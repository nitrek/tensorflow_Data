Incentive-based Compensation Arrangements
AGENCIES: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury (OCC); Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board); Federal Deposit Insurance

Corporation (FDIC); Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA); National Credit Union
Administration (NCUA); and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Request for Comment.
SUMMARY: The OCC, Board, FDIC, FHFA, NCUA, and SEC (the Agencies) are
seeking comment on a joint proposed rule (the proposed rule) to revise the proposed rule
the Agencies published in the Federal Register on April 14, 2011, and to implement
section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (DoddFrank Act). Section 956 generally requires that the Agencies jointly issue regulations or
guidelines: (1) prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements that the Agencies
determine encourage inappropriate risks by certain financial institutions by providing
excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss; and (2) requiring
those financial institutions to disclose information concerning incentive-based
compensation arrangements to the appropriate Federal regulator.
DATES: Comments must be received by July 22, 2016.
ADDRESSES: Although the Agencies will jointly review the comments submitted, it
would facilitate review of the comments if interested parties send comments to the
Agency that is the appropriate Federal regulator, as defined in section 956(e) of the
Dodd-Frank Act, for the type of covered institution addressed in the comments.
Commenters are encouraged to use the title “Incentive-based Compensation
Arrangements” to facilitate the organization and distribution of comments among the
Agencies. Interested parties are invited to submit written comments to:

INTRODUCTION
Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

(the “Dodd-Frank Act” or the “Act”) 1 requires the Agencies to jointly prescribe
regulations or guidelines with respect to incentive-based compensation practices at
certain financial institutions (referred to as “covered financial institutions”). 2
Specifically, section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act (“section 956”) requires that the
Agencies prohibit any types of incentive-based compensation 3 arrangements, or any
feature of any such arrangements, that the Agencies determine encourage inappropriate
risks by a covered financial institution: (1) by providing an executive officer, employee,
director, or principal shareholder of the covered financial institution with excessive
1

Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010).
12 U.S.C. 5641.
3
Section 956(b) uses the term “incentive-based payment arrangement.” It appears that Congress
used the terms “incentive-based payment arrangement” and “incentive-based compensation
arrangement” interchangeably. The Agencies have chosen to use the term “incentive-based
compensation arrangement throughout the proposed rule and this Supplementary Information
section for the sake of clarity.

compensation, fees, or benefits; or (2) that could lead to material financial loss to the
covered financial institution. Under the Act, a covered financial institution also must
disclose to its appropriate Federal regulator the structure of its incentive-based
compensation arrangements sufficient to determine whether the structure provides
excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or could lead to material financial loss to the
institution. The Dodd-Frank Act does not require a covered financial institution to report
the actual compensation of particular individuals.
The Act defines “covered financial institution” to include any of the following
types of institutions that have $1 billion or more in assets: (A) a depository institution or
depository institution holding company, as such terms are defined in section 3 of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) (12 U.S.C. 1813); (B) a broker-dealer registered
under section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o); (C) a credit
union, as described in section 19(b)(1)(A)(iv) of the Federal Reserve Act; (D) an
investment adviser, as such term is defined in section 202(a)(11) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(11)); (E) the Federal National Mortgage
Association (Fannie Mae); (F) the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie
Mac); and (G) any other financial institution that the appropriate Federal regulators,
jointly, by rule, determine should be treated as a covered financial institution for these
purposes.
The Act also requires that any compensation standards adopted under section 956
be comparable to the safety and soundness standards applicable to insured depository

17

institutions under section 39 of the FDIA 4 and that the Agencies take the compensation
standards described in section 39 of the FDIA into consideration in establishing
compensation standards under section 956. 5 As explained in greater detail below, the
standards established by the proposed rule are comparable to the standards established
under section 39 of the FDIA.
In April 2011, the Agencies published a joint notice of proposed rulemaking that
proposed to implement section 956 (2011 Proposed Rule). 6 Since the 2011 Proposed
Rule was published, incentive-based compensation practices have evolved in the
financial services industry. The Board, the OCC, and the FDIC have gained experience
in applying guidance on incentive-based compensation, 7 FHFA has gained supervisory
experience in applying compensation-related rules 8 adopted under the authority of the
Safety and Soundness Act, 9 and foreign jurisdictions have adopted incentive-based
compensation remuneration codes, regulations, and guidance. 10 In light of these

12 U.S.C. 1831p-1. The OCC, Board, and FDIC (collectively, the “Federal Banking Agencies”)
each have adopted guidelines implementing the compensation-related and other safety and
soundness standards in section 39 of the FDIA. See Interagency Guidelines Establishing
Standards for Safety and Soundness (the “Federal Banking Agency Safety and Soundness
Guidelines”), 12 CFR part 30, Appendix A (OCC); 12 CFR part 208, Appendix D-1 (Board); 12
CFR part 364, Appendix A (FDIC).

These include the Executive Compensation Rule (12 CFR Part 1230), the Golden Parachute
Payments Rule (12 CFR Part 1231), and the Federal Home Loan Bank Directors’ Compensation
and Expenses Rule (12 CFR Part 1261 Subpart C).

developments and the comments received on the 2011 Proposed Rule, the Agencies are
publishing a new proposed rule to implement section 956.
The first part of this Supplementary Information section provides background
information on the proposed rule, including a summary of the 2011 Proposed Rule and
areas in which the proposed rule differs from the 2011 Proposed Rule. The second part
contains a section-by-section description of the proposed rule. 11 To help explain how the
requirements of the proposed rule would work in practice, the Appendix to this
Supplementary Information section sets out an example of an incentive-based
compensation arrangement for a hypothetical senior executive officer at a hypothetical
large banking organization and an example of how a forfeiture and downward adjustment
review might be conducted for a senior manager at a hypothetical large banking
organization.
For ease of reference, the proposed rules of the Agencies are referenced in this
Supplementary Information section using a common designation of section ___.1 to
section ___.14 (excluding the title and part designations for each agency). Each agency

Regulations. 12
A. Background
Incentive-based compensation arrangements are critical tools in the management
of financial institutions. These arrangements serve several important objectives,
including attracting and retaining skilled staff and promoting better performance of the
institution and individual employees. Well-structured incentive-based compensation
arrangements can promote the health of a financial institution by aligning the interests of
executives and employees with those of the institution’s shareholders and other
stakeholders. At the same time, poorly structured incentive-based compensation
arrangements can provide executives and employees with incentives to take inappropriate
risks that are not consistent with the long-term health of the institution and, in turn, the
long-term health of the U.S. economy. Larger financial institutions in particular are
interconnected with one another and with many other companies and markets, which can
mean that any negative impact from inappropriate risk-taking can have broader
consequences. The risk of these negative externalities may not be fully taken into
account in incentive-based compensation arrangements, even arrangements that
otherwise align the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders with those of
executives and employees.

12

Specifically, the Agencies propose to codify the rules as follows: 12 CFR part 42 (OCC); 12
CFR part 236 (the Board); 12 CFR part 372 (FDIC); 17 CFR part 303 (SEC); 12 CFR Parts 741
and 751 (NCUA); and 12 CFR part 1232 (FHFA).

There is evidence that flawed incentive-based compensation practices in the
financial industry were one of many factors contributing to the financial crisis that began
in 2007. Some compensation arrangements rewarded employees – including nonexecutive personnel like traders with large position limits, underwriters, and loan officers
– for increasing an institution’s revenue or short-term profit without sufficient
recognition of the risks the employees’ activities posed to the institutions, and therefore
potentially to the broader financial system. 13 Traders with large position limits,
underwriters, and loan officers are three examples of non-executive personnel who had
the ability to expose an institution to material amounts of risk. Significant losses caused
by actions of individual traders or trading groups occurred at some of the largest financial
institutions during and after the financial crisis. 14

A large financial institution suffered losses in 2012 from trading by an investment office in its
synthetic credit portfolio. These losses amounted to approximately $5.8 billion, which was
approximately 3.6 percent of the holding company’s tier 1 capital.

total stockholder’s equity). http://www.morganstanley.com/about-usir/shareholder/10k113008/10k1108.pdf Form 10-K 2008, Pages 45 and 108. Between 2005 and

an estimated EUR4.9 billion in 2007, which was approximately 23 percent of the firm’s 2007 tier

Of particular note were incentive-based compensation arrangements for
employees in a position to expose the institution to substantial risk that failed to align the
employees’ interests with those of the institution. For example, some institutions gave
loan officers incentives to write a large amount of loans or gave traders incentives to
generate high levels of trading revenues, without sufficient regard for the risks associated
with those activities. The revenues that served as the basis for calculating bonuses were
generated immediately, while the risk outcomes might not have been realized for months
or years after the transactions were completed. When these, or similarly misaligned
incentive-based compensation arrangements, are common in an institution, the
foundation of sound risk management can be undermined by the actions of employees
seeking to maximize their own compensation.
The effect of flawed incentive-based compensation practices is demonstrated by
the arrangements implemented by Washington Mutual (WaMu). According to the Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations Staff’s report on the failure of WaMu “[l]oan
officers and processors were paid primarily on volume, not primarily on the quality of
their loans, and were paid more for issuing higher risk loans. Loan officers and mortgage
brokers were also paid more when they got borrowers to pay higher interest rates, even if

the borrower qualified for a lower rate – a practice that enriched WaMu in the short term,
but made defaults more likely down the road.” 15
Flawed incentive-based compensation arrangements were evident in not just U.S.
financial institutions, but also major financial institutions worldwide. 16 In a 2009 survey
of banking organizations engaged in wholesale banking activities, the Institute of
International Finance found that 98 percent of respondents recognized the contribution of
incentive-based compensation practices to the financial crisis. 17
Shareholders and other stakeholders in a covered institution18 have an interest in
aligning the interests of executives, managers, and other employees with the institution’s
long-term health. However, aligning the interests of shareholders (or members, in the
case of credit unions, mutual savings associations, mutual savings banks, some mutual
holding companies, and Federal Home Loan Banks) and other stakeholders with
employees may not always be sufficient to protect the safety and soundness of an
institution, deter excessive compensation, or deter behavior or inappropriate risk-taking

As discussed below, the proposed rule uses the term “covered institution” rather than the
statutory term “covered financial institution.”

that could lead to material financial loss at the institution. Executive officers and
employees of a covered institution may be willing to tolerate a degree of risk that is
inconsistent with the interests of stakeholders, as well as broader public policy goals.
Generally, the incentive-based compensation arrangements of a covered
institution should reflect the interests of the shareholders and other stakeholders, to the
extent that the incentive-based compensation makes those covered persons demand more
or less reward for their risk-taking at the covered institution, and to the extent that
incentive-based compensation changes those covered persons’ risk-taking. However,
risks undertaken by a covered institution – particularly a larger institution – can spill over
into the broader economy, affecting other institutions and stakeholders. Therefore, there
may be reasons why the preferences of all of the stakeholders are not fully reflected in
incentive-based compensation arrangements. Hence, there is a public interest in
curtailing the inappropriate risk-taking incentives provided by incentive-based
compensation arrangements. Without restrictions on incentive-based compensation
arrangements, covered institutions may engage in more risk-taking than is optimal from a
societal perspective, suggesting that regulatory measures may be required to cut back on
the risk-taking incentivized by such arrangements. Particularly at larger institutions,
shareholders and other stakeholders may have difficulty effectively monitoring and
controlling the impact of incentive-based compensation arrangements throughout the
institution that may affect the institution’s risk profile, the full range of stakeholders, and
the larger economy.
As a result, supervision and regulation of incentive-based compensation can play
an important role in helping safeguard covered institutions against incentive-based
24

compensation practices that threaten safety and soundness, are excessive, or could lead to
material financial loss. In particular, such supervision and regulation can help address
the negative externalities affecting the broader economy or other institutions that may
arise from inappropriate risk-taking by large financial institutions.
B. Supervisory Experience
To address such practices, the Federal Banking Agencies proposed, and then later
adopted, the 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance governing incentive-based
compensation programs, which applies to all banking organizations regardless of asset
size. This Guidance uses a principles-based approach to ensure that incentive-based
compensation arrangements appropriately tie rewards to longer-term performance and do
not undermine the safety and soundness of banking organizations or create undue risks to
the financial system. In addition, to foster implementation of improved incentive-based
compensation practices, the Board, in cooperation with the OCC and FDIC, initiated in
late 2009 a multidisciplinary, horizontal review (“Horizontal Review”) of incentive-based
compensation practices at 25 large, complex banking organizations, which is still
ongoing. 19 One goal of the Horizontal Review is to help improve the Federal Banking
Agencies’ understanding of the range and evolution of incentive-based compensation
practices across institutions and categories of employees within institutions. The second
19

The financial institutions in the Horizontal Review are Ally Financial Inc.; American Express
Company; Bank of America Corporation; The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation; Capital
One Financial Corporation; Citigroup Inc.; Discover Financial Services; The Goldman Sachs
Group, Inc.; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Morgan Stanley; Northern Trust Corporation; The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc.; State Street Corporation; SunTrust Banks, Inc.; U.S. Bancorp;
and Wells Fargo & Company; and the U.S. operations of Barclays plc, BNP Paribas, Credit
Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings plc, Royal Bank of Canada, The Royal
Bank of Scotland Group plc, Societe Generale, and UBS AG.

25

goal is to provide guidance to each institution in implementing the 2010 Federal Banking
Agency Guidance. The supervisory experience of the Federal Banking Agencies in this
area is also relevant to the incentive-based compensation practices at broker-dealers and
investment advisers.
As part of the Horizontal Review, the Board conducted reviews of line of business
operations in the areas of trading, mortgage, credit card, and commercial lending
operations as well as senior executive incentive-based compensation awards and payouts.
The institutions subject to the Horizontal Review have made progress in developing
practices that would incorporate the principles of the 2010 Federal Banking Agency
Guidance into their risk management systems, including through better recognition of
risk in incentive-based compensation decision-making and improved practices to better
balance risk and reward. Many of those changes became evident in the actual
compensation arrangements of the institutions as the review progressed. In 2011, the
Board made public its initial findings from the Horizontal Review, recognizing the steps
the institutions had made towards improving their incentive-based compensation
practices, but also noting that each institution needed to do more. 20 In early 2012, the
Board initiated a second, cross-firm review of 12 additional large banking organizations
(“2012 LBO Review”). The Board also monitors incentive-based compensation as part
of ongoing supervision. Supervisory oversight focuses most intensively on large banking
organizations because they are significant users of incentive-based compensation and

Large Banking Organizations” (October 2011) (“2011 FRB White Paper), available at
http://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/other-reports/files/incentive-compensation-practicesreport-201110.pdf.

26

because flawed approaches at these organizations are more likely to have adverse effects
on the broader financial system. As part of that supervision, the Board also conducts
targeted incentive-based compensation exams and considers incentive-based
compensation in the course of wider line of business and risk-related reviews.
For the past several years, the Board also has been actively engaged in
international compensation, governance, and conduct working groups that have produced
a variety of publications aimed at further improving incentive-based compensation
practices. 21
The FDIC reviews incentive-based compensation practices as part of its safety
and soundness examinations of state nonmember banks, most of which are smaller
community institutions that would not be covered by the proposed rule. FDIC incentivebased compensation reviews are conducted in the context of the 2010 Federal Banking
Agency Guidance and Section 39 of the FDIA. Of the 518 bank failures resolved by the
FDIC between 2007 and 2015, 65 involved banks with total assets of $1 billion or more
that would have been covered by the proposed rule. Of the 65 institutions that failed with
total assets of $1 billion or more, 18 institutions or approximately 28 percent, were
identified as having some level of issues or concerns related to compensation

arrangements, many of which involved incentive-based compensation. Overall, most of
the compensation issues related to either excessive compensation or tying financial
incentives to metrics such as corporate performance or loan production without adequate
consideration of related risks. Also, several cases involved poor governance practices,
most commonly, dominant management influencing improper incentives. 22
The OCC reviews and assesses compensation practices at individual banks as part
of its normal supervisory activities. For example, the OCC identifies matters requiring
attention (MRAs) relating to compensation practices, including matters relating to
governance and risk management and controls for compensation. The OCC’s Guidelines
Establishing Heightened Standards for Certain Large Insured National Banks, Insured
Federal Savings Associations, and Insured Federal Branches 23 (the “OCC’s Heightened
Standards”) require covered banks to establish and adhere to compensation programs that
prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by
providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss. The OCC
includes an assessment of the banks’ compensation practices when determining
compliance with the OCC’s Heightened Standards.
In addition to safety and soundness oversight, FHFA has express statutory
authorities and mandates related to compensation paid by its regulated entities. FHFA

The Inspector General of the appropriate federal banking agency must conduct a Material Loss
Review (“MLR”) when losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund from failure of an insured

compensation to any executive officer of a regulated entity that is not reasonable and
comparable with compensation for employment in other similar businesses (including
publicly held financial institutions or major financial services companies) involving
similar duties and responsibilities.24 FHFA also has additional authority over the
Enterprises during conservatorship, and has established compensation programs for
Enterprise executives. 25
In early 2014, FHFA issued two final rules related to compensation pursuant to its
authority over compensation under the Safety and Soundness Act. 26 The Executive
Compensation Rule sets forth requirements and processes with respect to compensation
provided to executive officers by the Enterprises, the Federal Home Loan Banks, and the
Federal Home Loan Bank System’s Office of Finance. 27 Under the rule, those entities
may not enter into an incentive plan with an executive officer or pay any incentive
compensation to an executive officer without providing advance notice to FHFA. 28

FHFA’s Golden Parachute Payments Rule governs golden parachute payments in the
case of a regulated entity’s insolvency, conservatorship, or troubled condition. 29
In part because of the work described above, incentive-based compensation
practices and the design of incentive-based compensation arrangements at banking
organizations supervised by the Federal Banking Agencies have improved significantly in
the years since the recent financial crisis. However, the Federal Banking Agencies have
continued to evaluate incentive-based compensation practices as a part of their ongoing
supervision responsibilities, with a particular focus on the design of incentive-based
compensation arrangements for senior executive officers; deferral practices (including
compensation at risk through forfeiture and clawback mechanisms); governance and the
use of discretion; ex ante risk adjustment; and control function participation in incentivebased compensation design and risk evaluation. The Federal Banking Agencies’
supervision has been focused on ensuring robust risk management and governance
practices rather than on prescribing levels of pay.
Generally, the supervisory work of the Federal Banking Agencies and FHFA has
promoted more risk-sensitive incentive-based compensation practices and effective risk
governance. Incentive-based compensation decision-making increasingly leverages
underlying risk management frameworks to help ensure better risk identification,
monitoring, and escalation of risk issues. Prior to the recent financial crisis, many
institutions had no effective risk adjustments to incentive-based compensation at all.
Today, the Board has observed that incentive-based compensation arrangements at the
largest banking institutions reflect risk adjustments, the largest banking institutions take
29

30

into consideration adverse outcomes, more pay is deferred, and more of the deferred
amount is subject to reduction based on failure to meet assigned performance targets or as
a result of adverse outcomes that trigger forfeiture and clawback reviews. 30
Similarly, prior to the recent financial crisis, institutions rarely involved risk
management and control personnel in incentive-based compensation decision-making.
Today, control functions frequently play an increased role in the design and operation of
incentive-based compensation, and institutions have begun to build out frameworks to
help validate the effectiveness of risk adjustment mechanisms. Risk-related performance
objectives and “risk reviews” are increasingly common. Prior to the recent financial
crisis, boards of directors had begun to consider the relationship between incentive-based
compensation and risk, but were focused on incentive-based compensation for senior
executives. Today, refined policies and procedures promote some consistency and
effectiveness across incentive-based compensation arrangements. The role of boards of
directors has expanded and the quality of risk information provided to those boards has
improved. Finance and audit committees work together with compensation committees
with the goal of having incentive-based compensation result in prudent risk-taking.
Notwithstanding the recent progress, incentive-based compensation practices are
still in need of improvement, including better targeting of performance measures and risk
metrics to specific activities, more consistent application of risk adjustments, and better
documentation of the decision-making process. Congress has required the Agencies to
jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines that cover not only depository institutions and

of how compensation practices at the institutions involved in the Board’s Horizontal Review of
Incentive Compensation have changed since the recent financial crisis.

31

depository institution holding companies, but also other financial institutions. While the
Federal Banking Agencies’ supervisory approach based on the 2010 Federal Banking
Agency Guidance and the work of FHFA have resulted in improved incentive-based
compensation practices, there are even greater benefits possible under rule-based
supervision. Using their collective supervisory experiences, the Agencies are proposing a
uniform set of enforceable standards applicable to a larger group of institutions
supervised by all of the Agencies. The proposed rule would promote better incentivebased compensation practices, while still allowing for some flexibility in the design and
operation of incentive-based compensation arrangements among the varied institutions
the Agencies supervise, including through the tiered application of the proposed rule’s
requirements.
C. Overview of the 2011 Proposed Rule and Public Comment
The Agencies proposed a rule in 2011, rather than guidelines, to establish
requirements applicable to the incentive-based compensation arrangements of all covered
institutions. The 2011 Proposed Rule would have supplemented existing rules, guidance,
and ongoing supervisory efforts of the Agencies.
The 2011 Proposed Rule would have prohibited incentive-based compensation
arrangements that could encourage inappropriate risks. It would have required
compensation practices at regulated financial institutions to be consistent with three key
principles—that incentive-based compensation arrangements should appropriately
balance risk and financial rewards, be compatible with effective risk management and
controls, and be supported by strong corporate governance. The Agencies proposed that
financial institutions with $1 billion or more in assets be required to have policies and
32

procedures to ensure compliance with the requirements of the rule, and submit an annual
report to their Federal regulator describing the structure of their incentive-based
compensation arrangements.
The 2011 Proposed Rule included two additional requirements for “larger
financial institutions.” 31 The first would have required these larger financial institutions
to defer 50 percent of the incentive-based compensation for executive officers for a
period of at least three years. The second would have required the board of directors (or
a committee thereof) to identify and approve the incentive-based compensation for those
covered persons who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible
losses that are substantial in relation to the institution’s size, capital, or overall risk
tolerance, such as traders with large position limits and other individuals who have the
authority to place at risk a substantial part of the capital of the covered institution.
The Agencies received more than 10,000 comments on the 2011 Proposed Rule,
including from private individuals, community groups, several members of Congress,
pension funds, labor federations, academic faculty, covered institutions, financial
industry associations, and industry consultants.
The vast majority of the comments were substantively identical form letters of
two types. The first type of form letter urged the Agencies to minimize the incentives for
short-term risk-taking by executives by requiring at least a five-year deferral period for
31

In the 2011 Proposed Rule, the term “larger covered financial institution” for the Federal
Banking Agencies and the SEC meant those covered institutions with total consolidated assets of
$50 billion or more. For the NCUA, all credit unions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion
or more would have been larger covered institutions. For FHFA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and
all Federal Home Loan Banks with total consolidated assets of $1 billion or more would have
been larger covered institutions.

33

executive bonuses at big banks, banning executives’ hedging of their pay packages, and
requiring specific details from banks on precisely how they ensure that executives will
share in the long-term risks created by their decisions. These commenters also asserted
that the final rule should apply to the full range of important financial institutions and
cover all the key executives at those institutions. The second type of form letter stated
that the commenter or the commenter’s family had been affected by the financial crisis
that began in 2007, a major cause of which the commenter believed to be faulty pay
practices at financial institutions. These commenters suggested various methods of
improving these practices, including basing incentive-based compensation on measures
of a financial institution’s safety and stability, such as the institution’s bond price or the
spread on credit default swaps.
Comments from community groups, members of Congress, labor federations, and
pension funds generally urged the Agencies to strengthen the proposed rule and many
cited evidence suggesting that flawed incentive-based compensation practices in the
financial industry were a major contributing factor to the recent financial crisis. Their
suggestions included: revising the 2011 Proposed Rule’s definition of “incentive-based
compensation”; defining “excessive compensation”; increasing the length of time for or
amount of compensation subject to the mandatory deferral provision; requiring financial
institutions to include quantitative data in their annual incentive-based compensation
reports; providing for the annual public reporting by the Agencies of information
quantifying the overall sensitivity of incentive-based compensation to long-term risks at
major financial institutions; prohibiting stock ownership by board members; and

34

prohibiting hedging strategies used by highly-paid executives on their own incentivebased compensation.
The academic faculty commenters submitted analyses of certain compensation
issues and recommendations. These recommendations included: adopting a corporate
governance measure tied to stock ownership by board members; regulating how deferred
compensation is reduced at future payment dates; requiring covered institutions’
executives to have “skin in the game” for the entire deferral period; and requiring
disclosure of personal hedging transactions rather than prohibiting them.
A number of covered institutions and financial industry associations favored the
issuance of guidelines instead of rules to implement section 956. Others expressed
varying degrees of support for the 2011 Proposed Rule but also requested numerous
clarifications and modifications. Many of these commenters raised questions concerning
the 2011 Proposed Rule’s scope, suggesting that certain types of institutions be excluded
from the coverage of the final rule. Some of these commenters questioned the need for
the excessive compensation prohibition or requested that the final rule provide specific
standards for determining when compensation is excessive. Many of these commenters
also opposed the 2011 Proposed Rule’s mandatory deferral provision, and some asserted
that the provision was unsupported by empirical evidence and potentially harmful to a
covered institution’s ability to attract and retain key employees. In addition, many of
these commenters asserted that the material risk-taker provision in the 2011 Proposed
Rule was unclear or imposed on the boards of directors of covered institutions duties
more appropriately undertaken by the institutions’ management. Finally, these
commenters expressed concerns about the burden and timing of the 2011 Proposed Rule.
35

D. International Developments
The Agencies considered international developments in developing the 2011
Proposed Rule, mindful that some covered institutions operate in both domestic and
international competitive environments. 32 Since the release of the 2011 Proposed Rule, a
number of foreign jurisdictions have introduced new compensation regulations that
require certain financial institutions to meet certain standards in relation to compensation
policies and practices. In June 2013, the European Union adopted the Capital
Requirements Directive (“CRD”) IV, which sets out requirements for compensation
structures, policies, and practices that apply to all banks and investment firms subject to
the CRD. 33 The rules require that up to 100 percent of the variable remuneration shall be
subject to malus 34 or clawback arrangements, among other requirements. 35 The PRA’s
and the FCA’s Remuneration Code requires covered companies to defer 40 to 60 percent
of a covered person’s variable remuneration – and recently updated their implementing
regulations to extend deferral periods to seven years for senior executives and to five

(effective January 1, 2014). The remuneration rules in CRD IV were carried over from CRD III
with a few additional requirements. CRD III directed the Committee of European Bank
Supervisors (“CEBS”), now the European Banking Authority (“EBA”), to develop guidance on
how it expected the compensation principles under CRD III to be implemented. See CEBS
Guidelines on Remuneration Policies and Practices (December 10, 2010) (“CEBS Guidelines”),

Malus is defined by the European Union as “an arrangement that permits the institution to
prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of a deferred remuneration award in relation to risk
outcomes or performance.” See, PRA expectations regarding the application of malus to variable
remuneration - SS2/13 UPDATE, available at:
http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Documents/publications/ss/2015/ss213update.pdf.
35
CRD IV provides that at least 50 percent of total variable remuneration should consist of
equity-linked interests and at least 40 percent of any variable remuneration must be deferred over
a period of three to five years. In the case of variable remuneration of a particularly high amount,
the minimum amount required to be deferred is increased to 60 percent.

years for certain other covered persons. 36 The PRA also implemented, in July 2014, a
policy requiring firms to set specific criteria for the application of malus and clawback.
The PRA’s clawback policy requires that variable remuneration be subject to clawback
for a period of at least seven years from the date on which it is awarded. 37
Also in 2013, the EBA finalized the process and criteria for the identification of
categories of staff who have a material impact on the institution’s risk profile (“Identified
Staff”). 38 These Identified Staff are subject to provisions related, in particular, to the
payment of variable compensation. The standards cover remuneration packages for
Identified Staff categories and aim to ensure that appropriate incentives for prudent, longterm oriented risk-taking are provided. The criteria used to determine who is identified
are both qualitative (i.e., related to the role and decision-making authority of staff
members) and quantitative (i.e., related to the level of total gross remuneration in
absolute or in relative terms).
More recently, in December 2015, the EBA released its final Guidelines on Sound
Remuneration Policies. 39 The final Guidelines on Sound Remuneration Policies set out

the governance process for implementing sound compensation policies across the
European Union under CRD IV, as well as the specific criteria for categorizing all
compensation components as either fixed or variable pay. The final Guidelines on Sound
Remuneration Policies also provide guidance on the application of deferral arrangements
and pay-out instruments to ensure that variable pay is aligned with an institution’s longterm risks and that any ex-post risk adjustments can be applied as appropriate. These
Guidelines will apply as of January 1, 2017, and will replace the Guidelines on
Remuneration Policies and Practices that were published by the CEBS in December
2010.
Other regulators, including those in Canada, Australia, and Switzerland, have
taken either a guidance-based approach to the supervision and regulation of incentivebased compensation or an approach that combines guidance and regulation that is
generally consistent with the FSB Principles and Implementation Standards. In
Australia, 40 all deposit-taking institutions and insurers are expected to comply in full with
all the requirements in the APRA’s Governance standard (which includes remuneration
provisions). APRA also supervises according to its Remuneration Prudential Practice
Guide (guidance). In Canada, 41 all federally regulated financial institutions (domestic
and foreign) are expected to comply with the FSB Principles and Implementation
Standards, and the six Domestic Systemically Important Banks and three largest life
insurance companies are expected to comply with the FSB’s Principles and

Implementation Standards. OSFI has also issued a Corporate Governance Guideline that
contain compensation provisions. 42 Switzerland’s Swiss Financial Markets Supervisory
Authority has also published a principles-based rule on remuneration consistent with the
FSB Principles and Implementation Standards that applies to major banks and insurance
companies. 43
As compensation practices continue to evolve, the Agencies recognize that
international coordination in this area is important to ensure that internationally active
financial organizations are subject to consistent requirements. For this reason, the
Agencies will continue to work with their domestic and international counterparts to
foster sound compensation practices across the financial services industry. Importantly,
the proposed rule is consistent with the FSB Principles and Implementation Standards.
E. Overview of the Proposed Rule
The Agencies are re-proposing a rule, rather than proposing guidelines, to
establish general requirements applicable to the incentive-based compensation
arrangements of all covered institutions. Like the 2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed rule
would prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements at covered institutions that
could encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could
lead to a material financial loss. However, the proposed rule reflects the Agencies’
collective supervisory experiences since they proposed the 2011 Proposed Rule. These
supervisory experiences, which are described above, have allowed the Agencies to
propose a rule that incorporates practices that financial institutions and foreign regulators
42
43

See OSFI Corporate Governance Guidelines.
See FINMA Remuneration Circular.

39

have adopted to address the deficiencies in incentive-based compensation practices that
helped contribute to the financial crisis that began in 2007. For that reason, the proposed
rule differs in some respects from the 2011 Proposed Rule. This section provides a
general overview of the proposed rule and highlights areas in which the proposed rule
differs from the 2011 Proposed Rule. A more detailed, section-by-section description of
the proposed rule and the reasons for the proposed rule’s requirements is provided later in
this Supplementary Information section.
Scope and Initial Applicability. Similar to the 2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed
rule would apply to any covered institution with average total consolidated assets greater
than or equal to $1 billion that offers incentive-based compensation to covered persons.
The compliance date of the proposed rule would be no later than the beginning of
the first calendar quarter that begins at least 540 days after a final rule is published in the
Federal Register. The proposed rule would not apply to any incentive-based
compensation plan with a performance period that begins before the compliance date.
Definitions. The proposed rule includes a number of new definitions that were not
included in the 2011 Proposed Rule. These definitions are described later in the sectionby-section analysis in this Supplementary Information section. Notably, the Agencies
have added a definition of significant risk-taker, which is intended to include individuals
who are not senior executive officers but who are in the position to put a Level 1 or
Level 2 covered institution at risk of material financial loss. This definition is explained
in more detail below.
Applicability. The proposed rule distinguishes covered institutions by asset size,
applying less prescriptive incentive-based compensation program requirements to the
40

smallest covered institutions within the statutory scope and progressively more rigorous
requirements to the larger covered institutions. Although the 2011 Proposed Rule
contained specific requirements for covered financial institutions with at least $50 billion
in total consolidated assets, the proposed rule creates an additional category of
institutions with at least $250 billion in average total consolidated assets. These larger
institutions are subject to the most rigorous requirements under the proposed rule.
The proposed rule identifies three categories of covered institutions based on
average total consolidated assets: 44
•

Level 1 (greater than or equal to $250 billion);

•

Level 2 (greater than or equal to $50 billion and less than $250 billion); and

•

Level 3 (greater than or equal to $1 billion and less than $50 billion). 45
Upon an increase in average total consolidated assets, a covered institution would

be required to comply with any newly applicable requirements under the proposed rule
no later than the first day of the first calendar quarter that begins at least 540 days after
the date on which the covered institution becomes a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered
institution. The proposed rule would grandfather any incentive-based compensation plan
44

For covered institutions that are subsidiaries of other covered institutions, levels would
generally be determined by reference to the average total consolidated assets of the top-tier parent
covered institution. A detailed explanation of consolidation under the proposed rule is included
under the heading “Definitions pertaining to covered institutions” below in this Supplementary
Information section.
45
As explained later in this Supplementary Information section, the proposed rule includes a
reservation of authority that would allow the appropriate Federal regulator of a Level 3 covered
institution with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $10 billion and less than
$50 billion to require the Level 3 covered institution to comply with some or all of the provisions
of sections __.5 and __.7 through __.11 of the proposed rule if the agency determines that the
complexity of operations or compensation practices of the Level 3 covered institution are
consistent with those of a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution.

41

with a performance period that begins before such date. Upon a decrease in total
consolidated assets, a covered institution would remain subject to the provisions of the
proposed rule that applied to it before the decrease until total consolidated assets fell
below $250 billion, $50 billion, or $1 billion, as applicable, for four consecutive
regulatory reports (e.g., Call Reports).
A covered institution under the Board’s, the OCC’s, or the FDIC’s proposed rule
that is a subsidiary of another covered institution under the Board’s, the OCC’s, or the
FDIC’s proposed rule, respectively, may meet any requirement of the Board’s, OCC’s, or
the FDIC’s proposed rule if the parent covered institution complies with that requirement
in such a way that causes the relevant portion of the incentive-based compensation
program of the subsidiary covered institution to comply with that requirement.
Requirements and Prohibitions Applicable to All Covered Institutions. Similar to the
2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed rule would prohibit all covered institutions from
establishing or maintaining incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage
inappropriate risk by providing covered persons with excessive compensation, fees, or
benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the covered institution.
Also consistent with the 2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed rule provides that
compensation, fees, and benefits will be considered excessive when amounts paid are
unreasonable or disproportionate to the value of the services performed by a covered
person, taking into consideration all relevant factors, including:
•

The combined value of all compensation, fees, or benefits provided to a
covered person;

42

•

The compensation history of the covered person and other individuals with
comparable expertise at the covered institution;

•

The financial condition of the covered institution;

•

Compensation practices at comparable institutions, based upon such
factors as asset size, geographic location, and the complexity of the
covered institution’s operations and assets;

•

For post-employment benefits, the projected total cost and benefit to the
covered institution; and

•

Any connection between the covered person and any fraudulent act or
omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, or insider abuse with regard to
the covered institution.

The proposed rule is also similar to the 2011 Proposed Rule in that it provides that
an incentive-based compensation arrangement will be considered to encourage
inappropriate risks that could lead to material financial loss to the covered institution,
unless the arrangement:
•

Appropriately balances risk and reward;

•

Is compatible with effective risk management and controls; and

•

Is supported by effective governance.

However, unlike the 2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed rule specifically provides
that an incentive-based compensation arrangement would not be considered to
appropriately balance risk and reward unless it:

43

•

Includes financial and non-financial measures of performance;

•

Is designed to allow non-financial measures of performance to override
financial measures of performance, when appropriate; and

•

Is subject to adjustment to reflect actual losses, inappropriate risks taken,
compliance deficiencies, or other measures or aspects of financial and
non-financial performance.

The proposed rule also contains requirements for the board of directors of a
covered institution that are similar to requirements included in the 2011 Proposed Rule.
Under the proposed rule, the board of directors of each covered institution (or a
committee thereof) would be required to:
•

Conduct oversight of the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation
program;

•

Approve incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive
officers, including amounts of awards and, at the time of vesting, payouts
under such arrangements; and

•

Approve material exceptions or adjustments to incentive-based compensation
policies or arrangements for senior executive officers.

The 2011 Proposed Rule contained an annual reporting requirement, which has
been replaced by a recordkeeping requirement in the proposed rule. Covered institutions
would be required to create annually and maintain for at least seven years records that
document the structure of incentive-based compensation arrangements and that

44

demonstrate compliance with the proposed rule. The records would be required to be
disclosed to the covered institution’s appropriate Federal regulator upon request.
Disclosure and Recordkeeping Requirements for Level 1 and Level 2 Covered
Institutions. The proposed rule includes more detailed disclosure and recordkeeping
requirements for larger covered institutions than the 2011 Proposed Rule. The proposed
rule would require all Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions to create annually and
maintain for at least seven years records that document: (1) the covered institution’s
senior executive officers and significant risk-takers, listed by legal entity, job function,
organizational hierarchy, and line of business; (2) the incentive-based compensation
arrangements for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers, including
information on the percentage of incentive-based compensation deferred and form of
award; (3) any forfeiture and downward adjustment or clawback reviews and decisions
for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers; and (4) any material changes to
the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation arrangements and policies.
Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions would be required to create and maintain records
in a manner that would allow for an independent audit of incentive-based compensation
arrangements, policies, and procedures, and to provide the records described above in
such form and frequency as the appropriate Federal regulator requests.
Deferral, Forfeiture and Downward Adjustment, and Clawback Requirements for
Level 1 and Level 2 Covered Institutions. The proposed rule would require incentivebased compensation arrangements that appropriately balance risk and reward. For
Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions, the proposed rule would require that incentivebased compensation arrangements for certain covered persons include deferral of
45

payments, risk of downward adjustment and forfeiture, and clawback to appropriately
balance risk and reward. The 2011 Proposed Rule required deferral for three years of 50
percent of annual incentive-based compensation for executive officers of covered
financial institutions with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The proposed
rule would apply deferral requirements to significant risk-takers as well as senior
executive officers, and, as described below, would require 40, 50, or 60 percent deferral
depending on the size of the covered institution and whether the covered person receiving
the incentive-based compensation is a senior executive officer or a significant risk-taker.
Unlike the 2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed rule would explicitly require a shorter
deferral period for incentive-based compensation awarded under a long-term incentive
plan. The proposed rule also provides more detailed requirements and prohibitions than
the 2011 Proposed Rule with respect to the measurement, composition, and acceleration
of deferred incentive-based compensation; the manner in which deferred incentive-based
compensation can vest; increases to the amount of deferred incentive-based
compensation; and the amount of deferred incentive-based compensation that can be in
the form of options.
Deferral. Under the proposed rule, the mandatory deferral requirements for Level 1
and Level 2 covered institutions for incentive-based compensation awarded each
performance period would be as follows:
•

A Level 1 covered institution would be required to defer at least 60 percent of a
senior executive officer’s “qualifying incentive-based compensation” (as defined
in the proposed rule) and 50 percent of a significant risk-taker’s qualifying
incentive-based compensation for at least four years. A Level 1 covered
46

institution also would be required to defer for at least two years after the end of
the related performance period at least 60 percent of a senior executive officer’s
incentive-based compensation awarded under a “long-term incentive plan” (as
defined in the proposed rule) and 50 percent of a significant risk-taker’s incentivebased compensation awarded under a long-term incentive plan. Deferred
compensation may vest no faster than on a pro rata annual basis, and, for covered
institutions that issue equity or are subsidiaries of covered institutions that issue
equity, the deferred amount would be required to consist of substantial amounts of
both deferred cash and equity-like instruments throughout the deferral period.
Additionally, if a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker receives
incentive-based compensation in the form of options for a performance period, the
amount of such options used to meet the minimum required deferred
compensation may not exceed 15 percent of the amount of total incentive-based
compensation awarded for that performance period.
•

A Level 2 covered institution would be required to defer at least 50 percent of a
senior executive officer’s qualifying incentive-based compensation and 40 percent
of a significant risk-taker’s qualifying incentive-based compensation for at least
three years. A Level 2 covered institution also would be required to defer for at
least one year after the end of the related performance period at least 50 percent of
a senior executive officer’s incentive-based compensation awarded under a longterm incentive plan and 40 percent of a significant risk-taker’s incentive-based
compensation awarded under a long-term incentive plan. Deferred compensation
may vest no faster than on a pro rata annual basis, and, for covered institutions

47

that issue equity or are subsidiaries of covered institutions that issue equity, the
deferred amount would be required to consist of substantial amounts of both
deferred cash and equity-like instruments throughout the deferral period.
Additionally, if a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker receives
incentive-based compensation in the form of options for a performance period, the
amount of such options used to meet the minimum required deferred
compensation may not exceed 15 percent of the amount of total incentive-based
compensation awarded for that performance period.
The proposed rule would also prohibit Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions
from accelerating the payment of a covered person’s deferred incentive-based
compensation, except in the case of death or disability of the covered person.
Forfeiture and Downward Adjustment. Compared to the 2011 Proposed Rule, the
proposed rule provides more detailed requirements for Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions to reduce (1) incentive-based compensation that has not yet been awarded to a
senior executive officer or significant risk-taker, and (2) deferred incentive-based
compensation of a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker. Under the proposed
rule, “forfeiture” means a reduction of the amount of deferred incentive-based
compensation awarded to a person that has not vested. “Downward adjustment” means a
reduction of the amount of a covered person’s incentive-based compensation not yet
awarded for any performance period that has already begun. The proposed rule would
require a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution to make subject to forfeiture all unvested
deferred incentive-based compensation of any senior executive officer or significant risktaker, including unvested deferred amounts awarded under long-term incentive plans.
48

This forfeiture requirement would apply to all unvested, deferred incentive-based
compensation for those individuals, regardless of whether the deferral was required by
the proposed rule. Similarly, a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution would also be
required to make subject to downward adjustment all incentive-based compensation
amounts not yet awarded to any senior executive officer or significant risk-taker for the
current performance period, including amounts payable under long-term incentive plans.
A Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution would be required to consider forfeiture or
downward adjustment of incentive-based compensation if any of the following adverse
outcomes occur:
•

Poor financial performance attributable to a significant deviation from the covered
institution’s risk parameters set forth in the covered institution’s policies and
procedures;

•

Inappropriate risk-taking, regardless of the impact on financial performance;

•

Material risk management or control failures;

•

Non-compliance with statutory, regulatory, or supervisory standards resulting in
enforcement or legal action brought by a federal or state regulator or agency, or a
requirement that the covered institution report a restatement of a financial
statement to correct a material error; and

•

Other aspects of conduct or poor performance as defined by the covered
institution.
Clawback. In addition to deferral, downward adjustment, and forfeiture, the

proposed rule would require a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution to include clawback
provisions in the incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive

49

officers and significant risk-takers. The term “clawback” refers to a mechanism by which
a covered institution can recover vested incentive-based compensation from a senior
executive officer or significant risk-taker if certain events occur. The proposed rule
would require clawback provisions that, at a minimum, allow the covered institution to
recover incentive-based compensation from a current or former senior executive officer
or significant risk-taker for seven years following the date on which such compensation
vests, if the covered institution determines that the senior executive officer or significant
risk-taker engaged in misconduct that resulted in significant financial or reputational
harm to the covered institution, fraud, or intentional misrepresentation of information
used to determine the senior executive officer or significant risk-taker’s incentive-based
compensation. The 2011 Proposed Rule did not include a clawback requirement.
Additional Prohibitions. The proposed rule contains a number of additional prohibitions
for Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions that were not included in the 2011 Proposed
Rule. These prohibitions would apply to:
•

Hedging;

•

Maximum incentive-based compensation opportunity (also referred to as
leverage);

•

Relative performance measures; and

•

Volume-driven incentive-based compensation.

Risk Management and Controls. The proposed rule’s risk management and controls
requirements for large covered institutions are generally more extensive than the
requirements contained in the 2011 Proposed Rule. The proposed rule would require all
Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions to have a risk management framework for their
50

incentive-based compensation programs that is independent of any lines of business;
includes an independent compliance program that provides for internal controls, testing,
monitoring, and training with written policies and procedures; and is commensurate with
the size and complexity of the covered institution’s operations. In addition, the proposed
rule would require Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions to:
•

Provide individuals in control functions with appropriate authority to influence
the risk-taking of the business areas they monitor and ensure covered persons
engaged in control functions are compensated independently of the performance
of the business areas they monitor; and

•

Provide for independent monitoring of: (1) incentive-based compensation plans to
identify whether the plans appropriately balance risk and reward; (2) events
related to forfeiture and downward adjustment and decisions of forfeiture and
downward adjustment reviews to determine consistency with the proposed rule;
and (3) compliance of the incentive-based compensation program with the
covered institution’s policies and procedures.

Governance. Unlike the 2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed rule would require each
Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution to establish a compensation committee composed
solely of directors who are not senior executive officers to assist the board of directors in
carrying out its responsibilities under the proposed rule. The compensation committee
would be required to obtain input from the covered institution’s risk and audit
committees, or groups performing similar functions, and risk management function on
the effectiveness of risk measures and adjustments used to balance incentive-based
compensation arrangements. Additionally, management would be required to submit to

51

the compensation committee on an annual or more frequent basis a written assessment of
the effectiveness of the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation program and
related compliance and control processes in providing risk-taking incentives that are
consistent with the risk profile of the covered institution. The compensation committee
would also be required to obtain an independent written assessment from the internal
audit or risk management function of the effectiveness of the covered institution’s
incentive-based compensation program and related compliance and control processes in
providing risk-taking incentives that are consistent with the risk profile of the covered
institution.
Policies and Procedures. The proposed rule would require all Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions to have policies and procedures that, among other requirements:
•

Are consistent with the requirements and prohibitions of the proposed rule;

•

Specify the substantive and procedural criteria for forfeiture and clawback;

•

Document final forfeiture, downward adjustment, and clawback decisions;

•

Specify the substantive and procedural criteria for the acceleration of
payments of deferred incentive-based compensation to a covered person;

•

Identify and describe the role of any employees, committees, or groups
authorized to make incentive-based compensation decisions, including when
discretion is authorized;

•

Describe how discretion is exercised to achieve balance;

•

Require that the covered institution maintain documentation of its processes
for the establishment, implementation, modification, and monitoring of
incentive-based compensation arrangements;
52

•

Describe how incentive-based compensation arrangements will be monitored;

•

Specify the substantive and procedural requirements of the independent
compliance program; and

•

Ensure appropriate roles for risk management, risk oversight, and other
control personnel in the covered institution’s processes for designing
incentive-based compensation arrangements and determining awards, deferral
amounts, deferral periods, forfeiture, downward adjustment, clawback, and
vesting and assessing the effectiveness of incentive-based compensation
arrangements in restraining inappropriate risk-taking.

These policies and procedures requirements for Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions are generally more detailed than the requirements in the 2011 Proposed Rule.
Indirect Actions. The proposed rule would prohibit covered institutions from doing
indirectly, or through or by any other person, anything that would be unlawful for the
covered institution to do directly under the proposed rule. This prohibition is similar to
the evasion provision contained in the 2011 Proposed Rule.
Enforcement. For five of the Agencies, the proposed rule would be enforced under
section 505 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as specified in section 956. For FHFA, the
proposed rule would be enforced under subtitle C of the Safety and Soundness Act.
Conservatorship or Receivership for Certain Covered Institutions. FHFA’s and
NCUA’s proposed rules contain provisions that would apply to covered institutions that
are managed by a government agency or a government-appointed agent, or that are in

53

conservatorship or receivership or are limited-life regulated entities under the Safety and
Soundness Act or the Federal Credit Union Act. 46
A detailed description of the proposed rule and requests for comments are set
forth below.

46

The FDIC’s proposed rule would not apply to institutions for which the FDIC is appointed
receiver under the FDIA or Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, as appropriate, as those statutes
govern such cases.

54

II.

SECTION-BY-SECTION DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED RULE

§ ___.1

Authority, Scope and Initial Applicability.
Section ___.1 provides that the proposed rule is issued pursuant to section 956.

The Agencies also have listed applicable additional rulemaking authority in their
respective authority citations.
The OCC is issuing the proposed rule under its general rulemaking authority, 12
U.S.C. 93a and the Home Owners’ Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1461 et seq., its safety and
soundness authority under 12 U.S.C. 1818, and its authority to regulate compensation
under 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1.
The Board is issuing the proposed rule under its safety and soundness authority
under section 5136 of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 24), the Federal Reserve Act (12
U.S.C. 321-338a), the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818), the Bank Holding Company Act (12
U.S.C. 1844(b)), the Home Owners’ Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1462a and 1467a), and the
International Banking Act (12 U.S.C. 3108).
The FDIC is issuing the proposed rule under its general rulemaking authority, 12
U.S.C. 1819 Tenth, as well as its general safety and soundness authority under 12 U.S.C.
1818 and authority to regulate compensation under 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1.
FHFA is issuing the proposed rule pursuant to its authority under the Safety and
Soundness Act (particularly 12 U.S.C. 4511(b), 4513, 4514, 4518, 4526, and ch. 46
subch. III.).
NCUA is issuing the proposed rule under its general rulemaking and safety and
soundness authorities in the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.
55

The SEC is issuing the proposed rule pursuant to its rulemaking authority under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C.
78q, 78w, 80b–4, and 80b–11).
The approach taken in the proposed rule is within the authority granted by section
956. The proposed rule would prohibit types and features of incentive-based
compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks. As explained more fully
below, incentive-based compensation arrangements that result in payments that are
unreasonable or disproportionate to the value of services performed could encourage
inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation, fees, and benefits. Further,
incentive-based compensation arrangements that do not appropriately balance risk and
reward, that are not compatible with effective risk management and controls, or that are
not supported by effective governance are the types of incentive-based compensation
arrangements that could encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to material
financial loss to covered institutions. Because these types of incentive-based
compensation arrangements encourage inappropriate risks, they would be prohibited
under the proposed rule.
The Federal Banking Agencies have found that any incentive-based compensation
arrangement at a covered institution will encourage inappropriate risks if it does not
sufficiently expose the risk-takers to the consequences of their risk decisions over time,
and that in order to do this, it is necessary that meaningful portions of incentive-based
compensation be deferred and placed at risk of reduction or recovery. The proposed rule
reflects the minimums that are required to be effective for that purpose, as well as
minimum standards of robust governance, and the disclosures that the statute requires.
56

The Agencies’ position in this respect is informed by the country’s experience in the
recent financial crisis, as well as by their experience supervising their respective
institutions and their observation of the experience and judgments of regulators in other
countries.
Consistent with section 956, section ___.1 provides that the proposed rule would
apply to a covered institution with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal
to $1 billion that offers incentive-based compensation arrangements to covered persons.
The Agencies propose the compliance date of the proposed rule to be the
beginning of the first calendar quarter that begins at least 540 days after the final rule is
published in the Federal Register. Any incentive-based compensation plan with a
performance period that begins before such date would not be required to comply with
the requirements of the proposed rule. Whether a covered institution is a Level 1,
Level 2, or Level 3 covered institution47 on the compliance date would be determined
based on average total consolidated assets as of the beginning of the first calendar quarter
that begins after a final rule is published in the Federal Register. For example, if the final
rule is published in the Federal Register on November 1, 2016, then the compliance date
would be July 1, 2018. In that case, any incentive-based compensation plan with a
performance period that began before July 1, 2018 would not be required to comply with
the rule. Whether a covered institution is a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered
institution on July 1, 2018 would be determined based on average total consolidated
assets as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2017.
47

As discussed below, the proposed rule includes baseline requirements for all covered
institutions and additional requirements for Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions, which are
larger covered institutions.

57

The Agencies recognize that most incentive-based compensation plans are
implemented at the beginning of the fiscal or calendar year. Depending on the date of
publication of a final rule, the proposed compliance date would provide at least 18
months, and in most cases more than two years, for covered institutions to develop and
approve new incentive-based compensation plans and 18 months for covered institutions
to develop and implement the supporting policies, procedures, risk management
framework, and governance that would be required under the proposed rule.
1.1. The Agencies invite comment on whether this timing would be sufficient to allow
covered institutions to implement any changes necessary for compliance with the
proposed rule, particularly the development and implementation of policies and
procedures. Is the length of time too long or too short and why? What specific
changes would be required to bring existing policies and procedures into compliance
with the rule? What constraints exist on the ability of covered institutions to meet the
proposed deadline?
1.2. The Agencies invite comment on whether the compliance date should instead be the
beginning of the first performance period that starts at least 365 days after the final
rule is published in the Federal Register in order to have the proposed rule’s policies,
procedures, risk management, and governance requirements begin when the
requirements applicable to incentive-compensation plans and arrangements begin.
Why or why not?
Section ___.1 also specifies that the proposed rule is not intended to limit the
authority of any Agency under other provisions of applicable law and regulations. For
example, the proposed rule would not affect the Federal Banking Agencies’ authority
58

under section 39 of the FDIA and the Federal Banking Agency Safety and Soundness
Guidelines. The Board’s Enhanced Prudential Standards under 12 CFR Part 252
(Regulation YY) would not be affected. The OCC’s Heightened Standards also would
continue to be in effect. The NCUA’s authority under 12 U.S.C. 1761a, 12 CFR 701.2,
part 701 App. A, Art. VII. section 8, 701.21(c)(8)(i), 701.23(g) (1), 701.33, 702.203,
702.204, 703.17, 704.19, 704.20, part 708a, 712.8, 721.7, and part 750, and the NCUA
Examiners Guide, Chapter 7, 48 would not be affected. Neither would the proposed rule
affect the applicability of FHFA’s executive compensation rule, under section 1318 of the
Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4518), 12 CFR part 1230.
The Agencies acknowledge that some individuals who would be considered
covered persons, senior executive officers, or significant risk-takers under the proposed
rule are subject to other Federal compensation-related requirements. Further, some
covered institutions may be subject to SEC rules regarding the disclosure of executive
compensation, 49 and mortgage loan originators are subject to the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau’s restrictions on compensation. This rule is not intended to affect the
application of these other Federal compensation-related requirements.

§ ___.2

Definitions.
Section ___.2 defines the various terms used in the proposed rule. Where the

proposed rule uses a term defined in section 956, the proposed rule generally adopts the
definition included in section 956. 50
Definitions pertaining to covered institutions.
Section 956(e)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act defines the term “covered financial
institution” to mean a depository institution; a depository institution holding company; a
registered broker-dealer; a credit union; an investment adviser; the Federal National
Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) (together, the “Enterprises”); and any other financial
institution that the Agencies determine, jointly, by rule, should be treated as a covered
financial institution for purposes of section 956. Section 956(f) provides that the
requirements of section 956 do not apply to covered financial institutions with assets of
less than $1 billion.
The Agencies propose to jointly, by rule, designate additional financial
institutions as covered institutions. The Agencies propose to include the Federal Home
Loan Banks as covered institutions because they pose risks similar to those of some
institutions covered under the proposed rule and should be subject to the same regulatory
regime. The Agencies also propose to include as covered institutions the state-licensed
uninsured branches and agencies of a foreign bank, organizations operating under section

50

The definitions in the proposed rule would be for purposes of administering section 956 and
would not affect the interpretation or construction of the same or similar terms for purposes of
any other statute or regulation administered by the Agencies.

60

25 or 25A of the Federal Reserve Act (i.e., Edge and Agreement Corporations), as well as
the other U.S. operations of foreign banking organizations that are treated as bank
holding companies pursuant to section 8(a) of the International Banking Act of 1978 (12
U.S.C. 3106). Applying the same requirements to these institutions would be consistent
with other regulatory requirements that are applicable to foreign banking organizations
operating in the United States and would not distort competition for human resources
between U.S. banking organizations and foreign banking organizations operating in the
United States. These offices and operations currently are referenced in the Federal
Banking Agency Guidance and are subject to section 8 of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818),
which prohibits institutions from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices to the same
extent as insured depository institutions and bank holding companies. 51
In addition, the Agencies propose to jointly, by rule, designate state-chartered
non-depository trust companies that are members of the Federal Reserve System as
covered institutions. The definition of “covered financial institution” under section 956
of the Dodd-Frank Act includes a depository institution as such term is defined in section
3 of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1813); that term includes all national banks and any state
banks, including trust companies, that are engaged in the business of receiving deposits
other than trust funds. As a consequence of these definitions, all national banks,
including national banks that are non-depository trust companies, are “depository
institutions” within the meaning of section 956, but non-FDIC insured state nondepository trust companies that are members of the Federal Reserve System are not. In
order to achieve equal treatment across similar entities with different charters, the
51

See 12 U.S.C. 1813(c)(3) and 1818(b)(4).

61

Agencies propose to include state-chartered non-depository member trust companies as
covered institutions. These institutions would be “regulated institutions” under the
definition of “state member bank” in the Board’s rule.
Each Agency’s proposed rule contains a definition of the term “covered
institution” that describes the covered financial institutions the Agency regulates.
The Agencies have tailored the requirements of the proposed rule to the size and
complexity of covered institutions, and are proposing to designate covered institutions as
Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered institutions to effectuate this tailoring. The
Agencies have observed through their supervisory experience that large financial
institutions typically have complex business activities in multiple lines of business,
distinct subsidiaries, and regulatory jurisdictions, and frequently operate and manage
their businesses in ways that cross those lines of business, subsidiaries, and jurisdictions.
Level 3 covered institutions would generally be subject to only the basic set of
prohibitions and disclosure requirements. The proposed rule would apply additional
prohibitions and requirements to incentive-based compensation arrangements at Level 1
and Level 2 covered institutions, as discussed below. Whether a covered institution that
is a subsidiary of a depository institution holding company is a Level 1, Level 2, or
Level 3 covered institution would be based on the average total consolidated assets of the
top-tier depository institution holding company. Whether that subsidiary has at least $1
billion will be based on the subsidiary’s average total consolidated assets.
The Agency definitions of covered institution, Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3
covered institution, and related terms are summarized below.

62

Covered Institution and Regulated Institution. Each Agency has set forth text for
its Agency-specific definition of the term “covered institution” that specifies the entities
to which that Agency’s rule applies. 52 Under the proposed rule, a “covered institution”
would include all of the following:
• In the case of the OCC:
o A national bank, Federal savings association, or Federal branch or agency
of a foreign bank 53 with average total consolidated assets greater than or
equal to $1 billion; and
o A subsidiary of a national bank, Federal savings association, or Federal
branch or agency of a foreign bank, if the subsidiary (A) is not a broker,
dealer, person providing insurance, investment company, or investment
adviser; and (B) has average total consolidated assets greater than or equal
to $1 billion.
• In the case of the Board, the proposed definition of the term “covered institution” is
a “regulated institution” with average total consolidated assets greater than or
equal to $1 billion, and the Board’s definition of the term “regulated institution”
includes:
o A state member bank, as defined in 12 CFR 208.2(g);
o A bank holding company, as defined in 12 CFR 225.2(c), that is not a
foreign banking organization, as defined in 12 CFR 211.21(o), and a

52

The Agency-specific definitions are intended to be applied only for purposes of administering a
final rule under section 956.
53
The term “Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank” refers to both insured and uninsured
Federal branches and agencies of foreign banks.

63

subsidiary of such a bank holding company that is not a depository
institution, broker-dealer or investment adviser;
o A savings and loan holding company, as defined in 12 CFR 238.2(m), and
a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company that is not a
depository institution, broker-dealer or investment adviser;
o An organization operating under section 25 or 25A of the Federal Reserve
Act (Edge and Agreement Corporation);
o A state-licensed uninsured branch or agency of a foreign bank, as defined
in section 3 of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1813); and
o The U.S. operations of a foreign banking organization, as defined in 12
CFR 211.21(o), and a U.S. subsidiary of such foreign banking
organization that is not a depository institution, broker-dealer, or
investment adviser.
• In the case of the FDIC, “covered institution” means a:
o State nonmember bank, state savings association, and a state insured
branch of a foreign bank, as such terms are defined in section 3 of the
FDIA, 12 U.S.C. 1813, with average total consolidated assets greater than
or equal to $1 billion; and
o A subsidiary of a state nonmember bank, state savings association, or a
state insured branch of a foreign bank, as such terms are defined in section
3 of the FDIA, 12 U.S.C. 1813, that: (i) Is not a broker, dealer, person
providing insurance, investment company, or investment adviser; and (ii)
Has average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $1 billion.

64

• In the case of the NCUA, a credit union, as described in section 19(b)(1)(A)(iv) of
the Federal Reserve Act, meaning an insured credit union as defined under 12
U.S.C. 1752(7) or credit union eligible to make application to become an insured
credit union under 12 U.S.C. 1781. Instead of the term “covered financial
institution,” the NCUA uses the term “credit union” throughout its proposed rule,
as credit unions are the only type of covered institution NCUA regulates. The
scope section of the rule defines the credit unions that will be subject to this rule–
that is, credit unions with $1 billion or more in total consolidated assets.
• In the case of the SEC, a broker or dealer registered under section 15 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78o; and an investment adviser, as
such term is defined in section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act of
1940, 15 U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(11). 54 The proposed rule would not apply to persons
excluded from the definition of investment adviser contained in section
202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act nor would it apply to such other
persons not within the intent of section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers
Act, as the SEC may designate by rules and regulations or order. Section 956
does not contain exceptions or exemptions for investment advisers based on
registration. 55

54

By its terms, the definition of “covered financial institution” in section 956 includes any
institution that meets the definition of “investment adviser” under the Investment Advisers Act of
1940 (“Investment Advisers Act”), regardless of whether the institution is registered as an
investment adviser under that Act. Banks and bank holding companies are generally excluded
from the definition of “investment adviser” under section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers
Act, although they would still be “covered institutions” under the relevant Agency’s proposed
rule.
55
Commenters to the 2011 Proposed Rule requested clarification with respect to those entities
that are excluded from the definition of “investment adviser” under the Investment Advisers Act

65

• In the case of FHFA, the proposed definition of the term “covered institution” is a
“regulated institution” with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal
to $1 billion, and FHFA’s definition of the term “regulated institution” means an
Enterprise, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 4502(10), and a Federal Home Loan Bank.
Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 covered institutions. The Agencies have tailored
the requirements of the proposed rule to the size and complexity of covered institutions.
All covered institutions would be subject to a basic set of prohibitions and disclosure
requirements, as described in section __.4 of the proposed rule.
The Agencies are proposing to group covered institutions into three levels. The
first level, Level 1 covered institutions, would generally be covered institutions with
average total consolidated assets of greater than $250 billion and subsidiaries of such
institutions that are covered institutions. The next level, Level 2 covered institutions,
would generally be covered institutions with average total consolidated assets between
$50 billion and $250 billion and subsidiaries of such institutions that are covered
institutions. The smallest covered institutions, those with average total consolidated
assets between $1 and $50 billion, would be Level 3 covered institutions and generally
would be subject to only the basic set of prohibitions and requirements. 56

and those that are exempt from registration as an investment adviser under the Investment
Advisers Act. Section 956 expressly includes any institution that meets the definition of
investment adviser regardless of whether the institution is registered under the Investment
Advisers Act. See supra note 54. Thus, the proposed rule would apply to institutions that meet
the definition of investment adviser under section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act and
would not exempt any such institutions that may be prohibited or exempted from registering with
the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act.
56
As discussed later in this Supplemental Information section, under section ___.6 of the
proposed rule, an Agency would be able to require a covered institution with average total
consolidated assets greater than or equal to $10 billion and less than $50 billion to comply with

66

The proposed rule would apply additional prohibitions and requirements to
incentive-based compensation arrangements at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions,
as described in section __.5 and sections __.7 through __.11 of the proposed rule and
further discussed below. The specific requirements of the proposed rule that would apply
to Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions are the same, with the exception of the
deferral amounts and deferral periods described in section ___.7(a)(1) and section
___.7(a)(2).
Consolidation.
Generally, the Agencies also propose that covered institutions that are subsidiaries
of other covered institutions would be subject to the same requirements, and defined to be
the same level, as the parent covered institution, 57 even if the subsidiary covered
institution is smaller than the parent covered institution. 58 This approach of assessing
risks at the level of the holding company for a consolidated organization recognizes that

some or all of the provisions of section ___.5 and sections ___.7 through___.11, if the Agency
determines that the activities, complexity of operations, risk profile, or compensation practices of
the covered institution are consistent with those of a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution.
57
Commenters on the 2011 Proposed Rule questioned how the requirements would apply in the
context of consolidated organizations where a parent holding company structure may include one
or more subsidiary banks, broker-dealers, or investment advisers each with total consolidated
assets either above or below, or somewhere in between, the relevant thresholds. They also
expressed concern that the 2011 Proposed Rule could lead to “regulatory overlap” where the
parent holding company and individual subsidiaries are regulated by different agencies.
58
For the U.S. operations of a foreign banking organization, level would be determined by the
total consolidated U.S. assets of the foreign banking organization, including the assets of any U.S.
branches or agencies of the foreign banking organization, any U.S. subsidiaries of the foreign
banking organization, and any U.S. operations held pursuant to section 2(h)(2) of the Bank
Holding Company Act. In contrast, the level of an OCC-regulated Federal branch or agency of a
foreign bank would be determined with reference to the assets of the Federal branch or agency.
This treatment is consistent with the determination of the level of a national bank or Federal
savings association that is not a subsidiary of a holding company and the OCC’s approach to
regulation of Federal branches and agencies.

67

financial stress or the improper management of risk in one part of an organization has the
potential to spread rapidly to other parts of the organization. Large depository institution
holding companies increasingly operate and manage their businesses in such a way that
risks affect different subsidiaries within the consolidated organization and are managed
on a consolidated basis. For example, decisions about business lines including
management and resource allocation may be made by executives and employees in
different subsidiaries. Integrating products and operations may offer significant
efficiencies but can also result in financial stress or the improper management of risk in
one part of a consolidated organization and has the potential to spread risk rapidly to
other parts of the consolidated organization. Even when risk is assessed at the level of
the holding company, risk will also be assessed at individual institutions within that
consolidated organization. For example, a bank subsidiary of a large, complex bank
holding company might have a different risk profile than the bank holding company. In
that situation, a risk assessment would have different results when conducted at the level
of the bank and at the level of the bank holding company.
Moreover, in the experience of the Federal Banking Agencies, incentive-based
compensation programs generally are designed at the holding company level and are
applied throughout the consolidated organization. Many holding companies establish
incentive-based compensation programs in this manner because it can help maintain
effective risk management and controls for the entire consolidated organization. More
broadly, the expectations and incentives established by the highest levels of corporate
leadership set the tone for the entire organization and are important factors of whether an
organization is capable of maintaining fully effective risk management and internal

68

control processes. The Board has observed that some large, complex depository
institution holding companies have evolved toward comprehensive, consolidated risk
management to measure and assess the range of their exposures and the way these
exposures interrelate, including in the context of incentive-based compensation programs.
In supervising the activities of depository institution holding companies, the Board has
adopted and continues to follow the principle that depository institution holding
companies should serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for their
subsidiary depository institutions. 59
The proposed rule is designed to reinforce the ability of institutions to establish
and maintain effective risk management and controls for the entire consolidated
organization with respect to the organization’s incentive-based compensation program.
Moreover, the structure of the proposed rule is also consistent with the reality that within
many large depository institution holding companies, covered persons may be employed
by one legal entity but may do work for one or more of that entity’s affiliates. For
example, an employee of a national bank might also perform certain responsibilities on
behalf of an affiliated broker-dealer. Applying the same requirements to all subsidiary
covered institutions may reduce the possibility of evasion of the more specific standards
applicable to certain individuals at Level 1 or Level 2 covered institutions. Finally, this
approach may enable holding company structures to more effectively manage human
resources, because applying the same requirements to all subsidiary covered institutions

59

See 12 U.S.C. 1831o-1; 12 CFR 225.4(a)(1).

69

would treat similarly the incentive-based compensation arrangements for similar
positions at different subsidiaries within a holding company structure. 60
The proposed rule would also be consistent with the requirements of overseas
regulators who have examined the role that incentive-based compensation plays in
institutions. After examining the risks posed by certain incentive-based compensation
programs, many foreign regulators are now requiring that the rules governing incentivebased compensation be applied at the group, parent, and subsidiary operating levels
(including those in offshore financial centers). 61
The Agencies are cognizant that the approach being proposed may have some
disadvantages for smaller subsidiaries within a larger depository institution holding
company structure by applying the more specific provisions of the proposed rule to these
smaller institutions that would not otherwise apply to them but for being a subsidiary of a
depository institution holding company. As further discussed below, in an effort to
reduce burden, the Board’s proposed rule would permit institutions that are subsidiaries
of depository institution holding companies and that are subject to the Board’s proposed
rule to meet the requirements of the proposed rule if the parent covered institution
complies with the requirements in such a way that causes the relevant portion of the
incentive-based compensation program of the subsidiary covered institution to comply
with the requirements. 62

60

For example, requirements that apply to certain job functions in one part of a consolidated
organization but not to the same job function in another operating unit of the same holding
company structure could create uneven treatment across the legal entities.
61
See, e.g., Article 92 of the CRD IV (2013/36/EU).
62
See section __.3(c) of the proposed rule.

70

Similarly, the OCC’s proposed rule would allow a covered institution subject to
the OCC’s proposed rule that is a subsidiary of another covered institution subject to the
OCC’s proposed rule to meet a requirement of the OCC’s proposed rule if the parent
covered institution complies with that requirement in a way that causes the relevant
portion of the incentive-based compensation program of the subsidiary covered
institution to comply with that requirement.
The FDIC’s proposed rule would similarly allow a covered institution subject to
the FDIC’s proposed rule that is a subsidiary of another covered institution subject to the
FDIC’s proposed rule to meet a requirement of the FDIC’s proposed rule if the parent
covered institution complies with that requirement in a way that causes the relevant
portion of the incentive-based compensation program of the subsidiary covered
institution to comply with that requirement.
The SEC is not proposing to require a covered institution under its proposed rule
that is a subsidiary of another covered institution under that proposed rule to be subject to
the same requirements, and defined to be the same levels, as the parent covered
institution. In general, the operations, services, and products of broker-dealers and
investments advisers are not typically effected through subsidiaries 63 and it is expected
that their incentive-based compensation arrangements are typically derived from the
activities of the broker-dealers and investment advisers themselves. Because of this, any
inappropriate risks for which the incentive-based compensation programs at these firms
63

In addition, the SEC’s regulatory regime with respect to broker-dealers and investment advisers
generally applies on an entity-by-entity basis. For example, subject to certain exclusions, any
person that for compensation is engaged in the business of providing advice, making
recommendations, issuing reports, or furnishing analyses on securities, either directly or through
publications is subject to the Investment Advisers Act. See 15 U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(11).

71

may encourage should be localized, and the management of these risks similarly should
reside at the broker-dealer or investment adviser. Where that is not the case, individuals
that are employed by subsidiaries of a broker-dealer or investment adviser may still be
considered to be a “significant risk-taker” for the covered institution and, therefore,
subject to the proposed rule. 64 In addition, broker-dealers and investment advisers that
are subsidiaries of depository institution holding companies would be consolidated on the
basis of such depository institution holding companies generally, where there is often a
greater integration of products and operations, public interest, and assessment and
management of risk (including those related to incentive-based compensation) across the
depository institution holding companies and their subsidiaries. 65

64

The proposed rule also prohibits a covered institution from doing indirectly, or through or by
any other person, anything that would be unlawful for such covered institution to do directly. See
section 303.12. For example, the SEC has stated that it will, based on facts and circumstances,
treat as a single investment adviser two or more affiliated investment advisers that are separate
legal entities but are operationally integrated. See Exemptions for Advisers to Venture Capital
Funds, Private Fund Advisers With Less Than $150 Million in Assets Under Management, and
Foreign Private Advisers, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 3222 (June 22, 2011) 76 FR
39,646 (July 6, 2011); In the Matter of TL Ventures, Inc., Investment Advisers Act Release No.
3859 (June 20, 2014) (settled action); section 15 U.S.C. 80b-8.
65
As discussed above in this Supplementary Information, the Agencies propose that covered
institutions that are subsidiaries of covered institutions that are depository institution holding
companies would be subject to the same requirements, and defined to be the same level, as the
parent covered institutions. Because the failure of a depository institution may cause losses to the
deposit insurance fund, there is a heightened interest in the safety and soundness of depository
institutions and their holding companies. Moreover, as noted above, depository institution
holding companies should serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for their
subsidiary depository institutions. Additionally, in the experience of the Federal Banking
Agencies, incentive-based compensation programs generally are designed at the holding company
level and are applied throughout the consolidated organization. The Board has observed that
complex depository institution holding companies have evolved toward comprehensive,
consolidated risk management to measure and assess the range of their exposures and the way
these exposures interrelate, including in the context of incentive-based compensation programs.

72

Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 covered institutions.
For purposes of the proposed rule, the Agencies have specified the three levels of
covered institutions as:
•

In the case of the OCC:
o A “Level 1 covered institution” means: (i) a covered institution
that is a subsidiary of a depository institution holding company
with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $250
billion; (ii) a covered institution with average total consolidated
assets greater than or equal to $250 billion that is not a subsidiary
of a covered institution or of a depository institution holding
company; and (iii) a covered institution that is a subsidiary of a
covered institution with average total consolidated assets greater
than or equal to $250 billion.
o A “Level 2 covered institution” means: (i) a covered institution
that is a subsidiary of a depository institution holding company
with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $50
billion but less than $250 billion; (ii) a covered institution with
average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $50
billion but less than $250 billion that is not a subsidiary of a
covered institution or of a depository institution holding company;
and (iii) a covered institution that is a subsidiary of a covered
institution with average total consolidated assets greater than or
equal to $50 billion but less than $250 billion.
73

o A “Level 3 covered institution” means: (i) a covered institution
with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $1
billion but less than $50 billion; and (ii) a covered institution that is
a subsidiary of a covered institution with average total
consolidated assets greater than or equal to $1 billion but less than
$50 billion.
•

In the case of the Board:
o A “Level 1 covered institution” means a covered institution with
average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $250
billion and any subsidiary of a Level 1 covered institution that is a
covered institution.
o A “Level 2 covered institution” means a covered institution with
average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $50
billion that is not a Level 1 covered institution and any subsidiary
of a Level 2 covered institution that is a covered institution.
o A “Level 3 covered institution” means a covered institution with
average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $1 billion
that is not a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution.

•

In the case of the FDIC:
o A “Level 1 covered institution” means: (i) a covered institution
that is a subsidiary of a depository institution holding company
with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $250
billion; (ii) a covered institution with average total consolidated

74

assets greater than or equal to $250 billion that is not a subsidiary
of a depository institution holding company; and (iii) a covered
institution that is a subsidiary of a covered institution with average
total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $250 billion.
o A “Level 2 covered institution” means: (i) a covered institution
that is a subsidiary of a depository institution holding company

depository institution holding company; and (iii) a covered
institution that is a subsidiary of a covered institution with average
total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $50 billion but
less than $250 billion.
o A “Level 3 covered institution” means: (i) a covered institution

institution holding company; and (iii) a covered institution that is a
subsidiary of a covered institution with average total consolidated
assets greater than or equal to $1 billion but less than $50 billion.

In the case of FHFA:

billion that is not a Federal Home Loan Bank.
o A “Level 2 covered institution” means a covered institution with

Home Loan Bank that is a covered institution.
o A “Level 3 covered institution” means a covered institution with
average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $1 billion
that is not a Level 1 covered institution or Level 2 covered
institution.

The Agencies considered the varying levels of complexity and risks across
covered institutions that would be subject to this proposed rule, as well as the general
correlation of asset size with those potential risks, in proposing to distinguish covered
institutions by their asset size. 66 In general, larger financial institutions have more
complex structures and operations. These more complex structures make controlling
risk-taking more difficult. Moreover, these larger, more complex institutions also tend to
be significant users of incentive-based compensation. Significant use of incentive-based
compensation combined with more complex business operations can make it more
66

But see earlier discussion regarding consolidation.

77

difficult to immediately recognize and assess risks for the institution as a whole.
Therefore, the requirements of the proposed rule are tailored to reflect the size and
complexity of each of the three levels of covered institutions identified in the proposed
rule. The proposed rule assigns covered institutions to one of three levels, based on each
institution’s average total consolidated assets.
Additionally, the Agencies considered the exemption in section 956 for
institutions with less than $1 billion in assets along with other asset-level thresholds in
the Dodd-Frank Act 67 as an indication that Congress views asset size as an appropriate
basis for the requirements and prohibitions established under this proposed rule.
Consistent with this approach, the Agencies also looked to asset size to determine the
types of prohibitions that would be necessary to discourage inappropriate risks at covered
institutions that could lead to material financial loss.
The Agencies are proposing that more rigorous requirements apply to institutions
with $50 billion or more in assets. These institutions with assets of $50 billion or more
tend to be significantly more complex and, the risk-taking of these institutions, and their
potential failure, implicates greater risks for the financial system and the overall
economy. Tailoring application of the requirements of the proposed rule is consistent
with other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which distinguish requirements for
67

See, e.g., section 116 of the Dodd-Frank Act (12 U.S.C. 5326) (allowing the Financial Stability
Oversight Council to require a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion
or more to submit reports); section 163 of the Dodd-Frank Act (12 U.S.C. 5363) (requiring prior
notice to the Board for certain acquisitions by bank holding companies with total consolidated
assets of $50 billion or more); section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act (12 U.S.C. 5365) (requiring
enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50
billion or more); section 318(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act (12 U.S.C. 16) (authorizing the Board to
collect assessments, fees, and other charges from bank holding companies and savings and loan
holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more).

78

institutions with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For example, the
enhanced supervision and prudential standards for nonbank financial companies and bank
holding companies under section 165 68 apply to bank holding companies with total
consolidated assets of $50 billion or greater. It is also consistent with the definitions of
advanced approaches institutions under the Federal Banking Agencies’ domestic capital
rules, 69 which are linked to the total consolidated assets of an institution. Other statutory
and regulatory provisions recognize this difference. 70
Most of the requirements of the proposed rule would apply to Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions in a similar manner. Deferral requirements, however, would be
different for Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions, as discussed further below:
incentive-based compensation for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at
covered institutions with average total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $250
billion would be subject to a higher percentage of deferral, and longer deferral periods.
In the experience of the Agencies, covered institutions with assets of $250 billion or more
tend to be significantly more complex and thus exposed to a higher level of risk than
68

12 U.S.C. 5365.
See 12 CFR 3.100(b)(1) (advanced approaches national banks and Federal savings
associations); 12 CFR 324.100(b)(1) (advanced approaches state nonmember banks, state savings
associations, and insured branches of foreign banks); 12 CFR 217.100(b)(1) (advanced
approaches bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, and state member
banks).

See, e.g., Board, “Regulatory Capital Rules: Implementation of Risk-Based Capital Surcharges
for Global Systemically Important Bank Holding Companies,” 80 FR 49081 (August 14, 2015);

79

those with assets of less than $250 billion. The risk-taking of these institutions, and their
potential failure, implicates the greatest risks for the broader economy and financial
system. Other statutory and regulatory provisions recognize this difference. For
example, the definitions of advanced approaches institutions under the Federal Banking
Agencies’ domestic capital rules establish a $250 billion threshold for coverage. This
approach is similar to that used in the international standards published by the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision, and rules implementing such capital standards,
under which banks with consolidated assets of $250 billion or more are subject to
enhanced capital and leverage standards.
As noted above, the Agencies propose to designate the Federal Home Loan Banks
as covered institutions. Under FHFA’s proposed rule, each Federal Home Loan Bank
would be a Level 2 covered institution by definition, as opposed to by total consolidated
assets. As long as a Federal Home Loan Bank is a covered institution under this part,
with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $1 billion, it is a Level 2
covered institution. FHFA proposes this approach because generally for the Federal
Home Loan Banks, asset size is not a meaningful indicator of risk. The Federal Home
Loan Banks all operate in a similar enough manner that treating them differently based on
asset size is not justifiable. Because of the scalability of the Federal Home Loan Bank
business model, it is possible for a Federal Home Loan Bank to pass back and forth over
the asset-size threshold without any meaningful change in risk profile. FHFA proposes to
designate the Federal Home Loan Banks as Level 2 covered institutions instead of
Level 3 covered institutions because at the time of the proposed rule, at least one Federal
Home Loan Bank would be a Level 2 covered institution if determined by asset size, and

80

the regulatory requirements under the proposed rule that seem most appropriate for the
Federal Home Loan Banks are those of Level 2 covered institutions.
Similar to the approach used by the Federal Banking Agencies in their general
supervision of banking organizations, if the proposed rule were adopted, the Agencies
would generally expect to coordinate oversight and, to the extent applicable, supervision
for consolidated organizations in order to assess compliance throughout the consolidated
organization with any final rule. The Agencies are cognizant that effective and consistent
supervision generally requires coordination among the Agencies that regulate the various
entities within a consolidated organization. The supervisory authority of each appropriate
Federal regulator to examine and review its covered institutions for compliance with the
proposed rule would not be affected under this approach.
Affiliate. For the OCC, the Board, the FDIC, and the SEC, the proposed rule
would define “affiliate” to mean any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with another company. FHFA’s proposed rule would not include a
definition of “affiliate.” The Federal Home Loan Banks have no affiliates, and affiliates
of the Enterprises are included as part of the definition of Enterprise in the Safety and
Soundness Act, which is referenced in the definition of regulated entity. The NCUA’s
proposed rule also would not include a definition of “affiliate.” While in some cases,
credit union service organizations (“CUSOs”) might be considered affiliates of a credit
union, NCUA has determined that this rule would not apply to CUSOs.
Average total consolidated assets. Consistent with section 956, the proposed rule
would not apply to institutions with less than $1 billion in assets. Additionally, as
discussed above, under the proposed rule, more specific requirements would apply to
81

institutions with higher levels of assets. The Agencies propose to use average total
consolidated assets to measure assets for the purposes of determining applicability of the
requirements of this rule. Whether a covered institution that is a subsidiary of a
depository institution holding company is a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered
institution would be based on the average total consolidated assets of the top-tier
depository institution holding company. Whether that subsidiary has at least $1 billion
will be based on the subsidiary’s average total consolidated assets.
For an institution that is not an investment adviser, average total consolidated
assets would be determined with reference to the average of the total consolidated assets
reported on regulatory reports for the four most recent consecutive quarters. This method
is consistent with those used to calculate total consolidated assets for purposes of other
rules that have $50 billion thresholds, 71 and it may reduce administrative burden on
institutions – particularly Level 3 covered institutions that become Level 2 covered
institutions – if average total consolidated assets are calculated in the same way for the
proposed rule. For an institution that does not have a regulatory report for each of the
four most recent consecutive quarters to reference, average total consolidated assets
would mean the average of total consolidated assets, as reported on the relevant
regulatory reports, for the most recent quarter or consecutive quarters available, as
applicable. Average total consolidated assets would be measured on the as-of date of the
most recent regulatory report used in the calculation of the average. For a covered
institution that is an investment adviser, average total consolidated assets would be

71

See, e.g., OCC’s Heightened Standards (12 CFR Part 30, Appendix D); 12 CFR 46.3; 12 CFR
225.8; 12 CFR 243.2; 12 CFR 252.30; 2 CFR 252.132; 12 CFR 325.202; 12 CFR 381.2.

82

determined by the investment adviser’s total assets (exclusive of non-proprietary assets)
shown on the balance sheet for the adviser’s most recent fiscal year end. 72
The Board’s proposed rule would require that savings and loan holding
companies that do not file a regulatory report within the meaning of section ___.2(ee)(3)
of the Board’s proposed rule report their average total consolidated assets to the Board on
a quarterly basis. In addition, foreign banking organizations with U.S. operations would
be required to report their total consolidated U.S. assets to the Board on a quarterly basis.
These regulated institutions would be required to report their average total consolidated
assets to the Board either because they do not file reports of their total consolidated assets
with the Board (in the case of savings and loan holding companies that do not file a
regulatory report with the Board within the meaning of section ___.2(ee)(3) of the
Board’s proposed rule), or because the reports filed do not encompass the full range of
assets (in the case of foreign banking organizations with U.S. operations). Asset
information concerning the U.S. operations of foreign banking organizations is filed on
form FRY-7Q, but the information does not include U.S. assets held pursuant to section
2(h)(2) of the Bank Holding Company Act. Foreign banking organizations with U.S.

72

This proposed method of calculation for investment advisers corresponds to the reporting
requirement in Item 1.O. of Part 1A of Form ADV, which currently requires an investment
adviser to check a box to indicate if it has assets of $1 billion or more. See Form ADV, Part IA,
Item 1.O.; SEC, “Rules Implementing Amendments to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
Investment Advisers Release No. IA-3221,” 76 FR 42950 (July 19, 2011). Many commenters to
the first notice of proposed rulemaking indicated that they understood that the SEC did not intend
“total consolidated assets” to include non-proprietary assets, such as client assets under
management; others requested clarification that this understanding is correct. The SEC is
clarifying in the proposed rule that investment advisers should include only proprietary assets in
the calculation—that is, non-proprietary assets, such as client assets under management would not
be included, regardless of whether they appear on an investment adviser’s balance sheet. The
SEC notes that this method is drawn directly from section 956. See section 956(f) (referencing
“assets” only).

83

operations would report their average total consolidated U.S. assets including assets held
pursuant to section 2(h)(2) of the Bank Holding Company Act for purposes of complying
with the requirements of section ___.2(ee)(3) of the Board’s proposed rule. The Board
would propose that reporting forms be created or modified as necessary for these
institutions to meet these reporting requirements.
The proposed rule does not specify a method for determining the total
consolidated assets of some types of subsidiaries that would be considered covered
institutions under the proposed rule, because those subsidiaries do not currently submit
regular reports of their asset size to the Agencies. For the subsidiary of a national bank,
Federal savings association, or Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank, the OCC
would rely on a report of the subsidiary’s total consolidated assets prepared by the
subsidiary, national bank, Federal savings association, or Federal branch or agency in a
form that is acceptable to the OCC. Similarly, for a regulated institution subsidiary of a
bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or foreign banking
organization the Board would rely on a report of the subsidiary’s total consolidated assets
prepared by the bank holding company or savings and loan holding company in a form
that is acceptable to the Board.
Control. The definition of control in the proposed rule is similar to the definition
of the same term in the Bank Holding Company Act. 73 Any company would have control
over a bank or any company if: (1) the company directly or indirectly or acting through
one or more other persons owns, controls, or has power to vote 25 percent or more of any
class of voting securities of the bank or company; (2) the company controls in any
73

12 U.S.C. 1841(a)(2).

84

manner the election of a majority of the directors or trustees of the bank or company; or
(3) the appropriate Federal regulator determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing,
that the company directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the
management or policies of the bank or company.
Depository institution holding company. The OCC’s, the FDIC’s, and the SEC’s
proposed rules define “depository institution holding company” to mean a top-tier
depository institution holding company, where “depository institution holding company”
would have the same meaning as in section 3 of the FDIA. 74 In a multi-tiered depository
institution holding company, references in the OCC’s, FDIC’s and SEC’s proposed rules
to the “depository institution holding company” would mean the top-tier depository
institution holding company of the multi-tiered holding company only.
For example, for the purpose of determining whether a state nonmember bank that
is a subsidiary of a depository institution holding company and is within a multi-tiered
depository institution holding company structure is a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered
institution under the FDIC’s proposed rule, the state nonmember would look to the toptier depository institution holding company’s average total consolidated assets. Thus, in
a situation in which a state nonmember bank with average total consolidated assets of $35
billion is a subsidiary of a depository institution holding company with average total
consolidated assets of $45 billion that is itself a subsidiary of a depository institution
holding company with $75 billion in average total consolidated assets, the state
nonmember bank would be treated as a Level 2 covered institution because the top-tier
depository institution holding company has average total consolidated assets of $75
74

See 12 U.S.C. 1813(w).

85

billion (which is greater than or equal to $50 billion but less than $250 billion).
Similarly, state member banks and national banks within multi-tiered depository
institution holding company structures would look to the top-tier depository institution
holding company’s average total consolidated assets when determining if they are a Level
1, Level 2 or Level 3 covered institution under the Board’s and the OCC’s proposed
rules.
Subsidiary. For the OCC, the Board, the FDIC, and the SEC, the proposed rule
would define “subsidiary” to mean any company which is owned or controlled directly or
indirectly by another company. The Board proposes to exclude from its definition of
“subsidiary” any merchant banking investment that is owned or controlled pursuant to 12
U.S.C. 1843(k)(4)(H) and Subpart J of the Board’s Regulation Y (12 CFR 225) and any
company with respect to which the covered institution acquired ownership or control in
the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted in good faith. Depository
institution holding companies may hold such investments only for limited periods of time
by law. Application of the proposed rule to these institutions directly would not further
the purpose of the proposed rule under section 956. The holding company and any
nonbanking subsidiary holding these investments would be subject to the proposed rule.
For these reasons, the Board is proposing to exclude from the definition of subsidiary
companies owned by a holding company as merchant banking investments or through
debt previously contracted in good faith. These companies would, therefore, not be
required to conform their incentive-based compensation programs to the requirements of
the proposed rule.

86

FHFA’s proposed rule would not include a definition of “subsidiary.” The
Federal Home Loan Banks have no subsidiaries, and any subsidiaries of the Enterprises
as defined by other Agencies under the proposed rule would be included as affiliates as
part of the definition of Enterprise in the Safety and Soundness Act, which is referenced
in the definition of regulated entity. The NCUA’s proposed rule also would not include a
definition of “subsidiary.” While in some cases, CUSOs might be considered
subsidiaries of a credit union, NCUA has determined that this rule would not apply to
CUSOs.
2.1.The Agencies invite comment on whether other financial institutions should be
included in the definition of “covered institution” and why.
2.2.The Agencies invite comment on whether any additional financial institutions should
be included in the proposed rule’s definition of subsidiary and why.
2.3.The Agencies invite comment on whether any additional financial institutions (such
as registered investment companies) should be excluded from the proposed rule’s
definition of subsidiary and why.
2.4.The Agencies invite comment on the definition of average total consolidated assets.
2.5.The Agencies invite comment on the proposed rule’s approach to consolidation. Are
there any additional advantages to the approach? For example, the Agencies invite
comment on the advantages of the proposed rule’s approach for reinforcing the ability
of an institution to establish and maintain effective risk management and controls for
the entire consolidated organization and enabling holding company structures to more
effectively manage human resources. Are there advantages to the approach of the

87

proposed rule in helping to reduce the possibility of evasion of the more specific
standards applicable to certain individuals at Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institutions? Are there any disadvantages to the proposed rule’s approach to
consolidation? For example, the Agencies invite comment on any disadvantages
smaller subsidiaries of a larger covered institution may have by applying the more
specific provisions of the proposed rule to these smaller institutions that would not
otherwise apply to them but for being a subsidiary of a larger institution. Is there
another approach that the proposed rule should take? The Agencies invite comment
on any advantages and disadvantages of the SEC’s proposal to not consolidate
subsidiaries of broker-dealers and investment advisers that are not themselves
subsidiaries of depository institution holding companies. Are the operations,
services, and products of broker-dealers and investment advisers not typically
effected through subsidiaries? Should the SEC adopt an express requirement to treat
two or more affiliated investment advisers or broker-dealers that are separate legal
entities (e.g., investment advisers that are operationally integrated) as a single
investment adviser or broker-dealer for purposes of the proposed rule’s thresholds?
2.6.The Agencies invite comment on whether the three-level structure would be a
workable approach for categorizing covered institutions by asset size and why.
2.7.The Agencies invite comment on whether the asset thresholds used in these
definitions would divide covered institutions into appropriate groups based on how
they view the competitive marketplace. If asset thresholds are not the appropriate
methodology for determining which requirements apply, which other alternative
methodologies would be appropriate and why?
88

2.8.Are there instances where it may be appropriate to modify the requirements of the
proposed rule where there are multiple covered institutions subsidiaries within a
single parent organization based upon the relative size, complexity, risk profile, or
business model, and use of incentive-based compensation of the covered institution
subsidiaries within the consolidated organization? In what situations would that be
appropriate and why?
2.9.Is the Agencies’ assumption that incentive-based compensation programs are
generally designed and administered at the holding company level for the
organization as a whole correct? Why or why not? To what extent do broker-dealers
or investment advisers within a holding company structure apply the same
compensation standards as other subsidiaries in the parent company?
2.10.

Bearing in mind that section 956 by its terms seeks to address incentive-based

compensation arrangements that could lead to material financial loss to a covered
institution, commenters are asked to provide comments on the proposed method of
determining asset size for investment advisers. Are there instances where it may be
appropriate to determine asset size differently, by for example, including client assets
under management for investment advisers? In what situations would that be
appropriate and why?
2.11.

Should the determination of average total consolidated assets for investment

advisers exclude non-proprietary assets that are included on a balance sheet under
accounting rules, such as certain types of client assets under management required to
be included on an investment adviser’s balance sheet? Why or why not?

89

2.12.

Should the determination of average total consolidated assets be further tailored

for certain types of investment advisers, such as charitable advisers, non-U.S.domiciled advisers, or insurance companies and, if so, why and in what manner?
2.13.

The Agencies invite comment on the methods for determining whether foreign

banking organizations and Federal branches and agencies are Level 1, Level 2, or
Level 3 covered institutions. Should the same method be used for both foreign
banking organizations and Federal branches and agencies? Why or why not?
Definitions pertaining to covered persons.
Covered person.

The proposed rule defines “covered person” as any executive

officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder who receives incentive-based
compensation at a covered institution.75 The term “executive officer” would include
individuals who are senior executive officers, as defined in the proposed rule, as well as
other individuals designated as executive officers by the covered institution. As
described further below, section __.4 of the proposed rule would apply requirements and
prohibitions on all incentive-based compensation arrangements for covered persons at
covered institutions.
Included in the class of covered persons are senior executive officers and
significant risk-takers, discussed further below. Senior executive officers and significant
risk-takers are covered persons that may have the ability to expose a covered institution
to significant risk through their positions or actions. Accordingly, the proposed rule
75

Section 956 requires the Agencies to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines that prohibit
certain incentive-based compensation arrangements or features of such arrangements that
encourage inappropriate risk by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal
shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial
loss to the covered financial institution.

90

would prohibit the incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive
officers and significant risk-takers from including certain features that encourage
inappropriate risk, consistent with the approach under sections __.5, __.9, __.10, and
__.11 of the proposed rule of requiring risk-mitigating features for the incentive-based
compensation programs at larger and more complex covered institutions.
For Federal credit unions, only one director, if any, would be considered a
covered person because, under section 112 of the Federal Credit Union Act 76 and
NCUA’s regulations at 12 CFR 701.33, only one director may be compensated as an
officer of the board of directors. The insurance and indemnification benefits that are
excluded from the definition of “compensation” for purposes of 12 CFR 701.33 would
not cause a non-compensated director of a credit union to be included under the definition
of “covered person” because these benefits would not be “incentive-based compensation”
under the proposed rule.
Director. The proposed rule defines “director” as a member of the board of
directors of a covered institution. Any member of a covered institution’s governing body
would be included within this definition.
Principal shareholder. Section 956 applies to principal shareholders as well as
executive officers, employees, and directors. The proposed rule defines “principal
shareholder” as a natural person who, directly or indirectly, or acting through or in
concert with one or more persons, owns, controls, or has the power to vote 10 percent or
more of any class of voting securities of a covered institution. The 10 percent threshold

76

12 U.S.C. 1761a.

91

for identifying principal shareholders is used in a number of bank regulatory contexts. 77
The NCUA’s proposed rule does not include this definition because credit unions are notfor-profit financial cooperatives with member owners. The Agencies recognize that some
other types of covered institutions, for example, mutual savings associations, mutual
savings banks, and some mutual holding companies, do not have principal shareholders.
2.14.

The Agencies invite comment on whether the definition of “principal

shareholder” reflects a common understanding of who would be a principal
shareholder of a covered institution.
Senior executive officer. The proposed rule defines “senior executive officer” as
a covered person who holds the title or, without regard to title, salary, or compensation,
performs the function of one or more of the following positions at a covered institution
for any period of time in the relevant performance period: president, chief executive
officer (CEO), executive chairman, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief
investment officer, chief legal officer, chief lending officer, chief risk officer, chief
compliance officer, chief audit executive, chief credit officer, chief accounting officer, or
head of a major business line or control function. As described below, a Level 1 or
Level 2 covered institution would be required to defer a portion of the incentive-based
compensation of a senior executive officer and subject the incentive-based compensation
to forfeiture, downward adjustment, and clawback. The proposed rule would also limit
the extent to which options could be used to meet the proposed rule’s minimum deferral
requirements for senior executive officers. The proposed rule would require a covered
institution’s board of directors, or a committee thereof, to approve incentive-based
77

See, e.g., 12 CFR 215.2(m), 12 CFR 225.2(n)(2), and 12 CFR 225.41(c)(2).

92

compensation arrangements for senior executive officers and any material exceptions or
adjustments to incentive-based compensation policies or arrangements for senior
executive officers. Additionally, Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions would be
required to create and maintain records listing senior executive officers and to document
forfeiture, downward adjustment, and clawback decisions for senior executive officers.
The proposed rule would limit the extent to which a Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institution may award incentive-based compensation to a senior executive officer in
excess of the target amount for the incentive-based compensation. Senior executive
officers also would not be eligible to serve on the compensation committee of a Level 1
or Level 2 covered institution under the proposed rule.
The 2011 Proposed Rule contained a definition of “executive officer” that
included the positions of president, CEO, executive chairman, chief operating officer,
chief financial officer, chief investment officer, chief legal officer, chief lending officer,
chief risk officer, and head of a major business line. It did not include the positions of
chief compliance officer, chief audit executive, chief credit officer, chief accounting
officer, or head of a control function. One commenter asserted that the term “executive
officer” should not be defined with reference to specific position, but, rather, should be
identified by the board of directors of a covered institution. Other commenters asked the
Agencies for additional specificity about the types of executive officers that would be
covered at large and small covered institutions, particularly with respect to the heads of
major business lines. Some commenters encouraged the Agencies to align the definition
of “executive officer” with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by focusing on
individuals with significant policymaking functions. In the alternative, some of these

93

commenters suggested that the definition be revised to conform to the 2010 Federal
Banking Agency Guidance.
The definition of “senior executive officer” in the proposed rule retains the list of
positions included in the 2011 Proposed Rule and is consistent with other rules and
agency guidance. The list includes the minimum positions that are considered “senior
executives” under the Federal Banking Agency Safety and Soundness Guidelines. 78 The
Agencies also took into account the positions that would be considered “officers” under
section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 79
In addition to the positions listed in the 2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed
definition of “senior executive officer” includes the positions of chief compliance officer,
chief audit executive, chief credit officer, chief accounting officer, and other heads of a
control function. Individuals in these positions do not generally initiate activities that
generate risk of material financial loss, but they play an important role in identifying,
addressing, and mitigating that risk. Individuals in these positions have the ability to
influence the risk measures and other information and judgments that a covered
institution uses for risk management, internal control, or financial purposes. 80
Improperly structured incentive-based compensation arrangements could create
incentives for individuals in these positions to use their authority in ways that increase,

78

These minimum positions include “executive officers,” within the meaning of Regulation O (12
CFR 215.2(e)(1)) and “named officers” within the meaning of the SEC’s rules on disclosure of
executive compensation (17 CFR 229.402). In addition to these minimum positions, the Federal
Banking Agency Safety and Soundness Guidelines also apply to individuals “who are responsible
for oversight of the organization’s firm-wide activities or material business lines.” 75 FR at
36407.

94

rather than mitigate, risk of material financial loss. Some larger institutions have
designated individuals in these positions as “covered persons” for purposes of the 2010
Federal Banking Agency Guidance.
The definition of “senior executive officer” also includes a covered person who
performs the function of a senior executive officer for a covered institution, even if the
covered person’s formal title does not reflect that role or the covered person is employed
by a different entity. For example, under the proposed rule, a covered person who is an
employee of a bank holding company and also performs the functions of a chief financial
officer for the subsidiary bank would, in addition to being a covered person of the bank
holding company, also be a senior executive officer of the bank holding company’s
subsidiary bank. This approach would address attempts to evade being included within
the definition of “senior executive officer” by changing an individual’s title but not that
individual’s responsibilities. In some instances, the determination of senior executive
officers and compliance with relevant requirements of the proposed rule may be
influenced by the covered institution’s organizational structure. 81 If a covered institution
does not have any covered person who holds the title or performs the function of one or
more of the positions listed in the definition of “senior executive officer,” the proposed
rule would not require the covered institution to designate a covered person to fill such
position for purposes of the proposed rule. Similarly, if a senior executive officer at one
covered institution also holds the title or performs the function of one of more of the
positions listed for a subsidiary that is also a covered institution, then that individual

81

See section ___.3(c) of the proposed rule.

95

would be a senior executive officer for both the parent and the subsidiary covered
institutions.
The list of positions in the proposed definition sets forth the types of positions
whose incumbents would be considered senior executive officers. The Agencies are
proposing this list to aid covered institutions in identifying their senior executive officers
while allowing the covered institutions some degree of flexibility in determining which
business lines are major business lines.
2.15.

The Agencies invite comment on whether the types of positions identified in the

proposed definition of senior executive officer are appropriate, whether additional
positions should be included, whether any positions should be removed, and why.
2.16.

The Agencies invite comment on whether the term “major business line” provides

enough information to allow a covered institution to identify individuals who are
heads of major business lines. Should the proposed rule refer instead to a “core
business line,” as defined in FDIC and FRB rules relating to resolution planning (12
CFR 381.2(d)), to a “principal business unit, division or function,” as described in
SEC definitions of the term “executive officer” (17 CFR 240.3b-7), or to business
lines that contribute greater than a specified amount to the covered institution’s total
annual revenues or profit? Why?
2.17.

Should the Agencies include the chief technology officer (“CTO”), chief

information security officer, or similar titles as positions explicitly listed in the
definition of “senior executive officer”? Why or why not? Individuals in these

96

positions play a significant role in information technology management. 82 The CTO
is generally responsible for the development and implementation of the information
technology strategy to support the institution’s business strategy in line with its
appetite for risk. In addition, these positions are generally responsible for
implementing information technology architecture, security, and business resilience.
Significant risk-taker. The proposed rule’s definition of “significant risk-taker” is
intended to include individuals who are not senior executive officers but are in the
position to put a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution at risk of material financial loss so
that the proposed rule’s requirements and prohibitions on incentive-based compensation
arrangements apply to such individuals. In order to ensure that incentive-based
compensation arrangements for significant risk-takers appropriately balance risk and
reward, most of the proposed rule’s requirements for Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions relating to senior executive officers would also apply to significant risk-takers
to some degree. These requirements include the disclosure and recordkeeping
requirements of section __.5; the deferral, forfeiture, downward adjustment, and
clawback requirements of section __.7 (including the related limitation on options); and
the maximum incentive-based compensation opportunity limit of section __.8.
The proposed definition of “significant risk-taker” incorporates two tests for
determining whether a covered person is a significant risk-taker. A covered person
would be a significant risk-taker if either test was met. The first test is based on the
amounts of annual base salary and incentive-based compensation of a covered person

82

See generally Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) Information
Technology Examination Handbook, available at http://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets.aspx.

97

relative to other covered persons working for the covered institution and its affiliate
covered institutions (the “relative compensation test”). This test is intended to determine
whether the individual is among the top 5 percent (for Level 1 covered institutions) or top
2 percent (for Level 2 covered institutions) of highest compensated covered persons in
the entire consolidated organization, including affiliated covered institutions. The second
test is based on whether the covered person has authority to commit or expose 0.5 percent
or more of the capital of the covered institution or an affiliate that is itself a covered
institution (the “exposure test”). 83
The definition of significant risk-taker applies to only Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions. The definition of significant risk-taker does not apply to senior
executive officers. Senior executive officers of Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions

83

In the proposed rule, the Agencies have tailored the measure of capital to the type of covered
institution. For most covered institutions, the exposure test would be based on common equity
tier 1 capital. For depository institution holding companies, foreign banking organizations, and
affiliates of those institutions that do not report common equity tier 1 capital, the Board would
work with covered institutions to determine the appropriate measure of capital. For registered
securities brokers or dealers, the exposure test would be based on tentative net capital. See 17
CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(15). For Federal Home Loan Banks, the exposure test would be based on
regulatory capital. For the Enterprises, the exposure test would be based on minimum capital.
For credit unions, the exposure test would be based on net worth or total capital. For simplicity in
describing the exposure test in this Supplementary Information section, common equity tier 1
capital, tentative net capital, regulatory capital, minimum capital, net worth, and total capital are
referred to generally as “capital.” The Agencies expect that a covered institution that is an
investment adviser will use common equity tier 1 capital or tentative net capital to the extent it
would be a covered institution in another capacity (e.g., if the investment adviser also is a
depository institution holding company, a bank, a broker-dealer, or a subsidiary of a depository
institution holding company). For an investment adviser that would not be a covered institution
in any other capacity, the proposed rule’s exposure test would not be measured against the
investment adviser’s capital. For a covered person of such an investment adviser that can commit
or expose capital of an affiliated covered institution, the exposure test would be based on
common equity tier 1 capital or tentative net capital of that affiliated covered institution. For
other covered persons of any investment adviser that would not be a covered institution in any
other capacity, no exposure test is proposed to apply. Comment is requested below regarding
what measure would be appropriate for an exposure test.

98

would be separately subject to the proposed rule, as discussed earlier in this Supplemental
Information section.
The significant risk-taker definition under either test would be applicable only to
covered persons who received annual base salary and incentive-based compensation of
which at least one-third is incentive-based compensation (one-third threshold), based on
the covered person’s annual base salary paid and incentive-based compensation awarded
during the last calendar year that ended at least 180 days before the beginning of the
performance period for which significant risk-takers are being identified. 84 For example,
an individual who received $180,000 in annual base salary during calendar year 2019 and
was awarded incentive-based compensation of $120,000 for performance periods that
ended during calendar year 2019 could be a significant risk-taker because one-third of the
individual’s compensation was incentive-based. Specifically, the individual would be a
significant risk-taker for a performance period beginning on or after June 28, 2020 if the
individual also met the relative compensation test or the exposure test. 85
Under the proposed rule, in order for covered persons to be designated as
significant risk-takers, the covered persons would have to be awarded a level of
incentive-based compensation that would be sufficient to influence their risk-taking
behavior. In order to ensure that significant risk-takers are only those covered persons
who have incentive-based compensation arrangements that could provide incentives to

84

Incentive-based compensation awarded in a particular calendar year would include any
incentive-based compensation awarded with respect to a performance period that ended during
that calendar year.
85
In this example, incentive-based compensation awarded ($120,000) would be 40 percent of the
total $300,000 received in annual base salary ($180,000) and incentive-based compensation
awarded ($120,000).

99

engage in inappropriate risk-taking, only covered persons who meet the one-third
threshold could be significant risk-takers.
The proposed one-third threshold is consistent with the more conservative end of
the range identified in industry practice. Institutions in the Board’s 2012 LBO Review
that would be Level 2 covered institutions under the proposed rule reported that they
generally rewarded their self-identified individual risk-takers with incentive-based
compensation in the range of 8 percent to 90 percent of total compensation, with an
average range of 32 percent to 71 percent. The proposed threshold of one-third or more
falls within the lower end of that average range.
The one-third threshold would also be consistent with other standards regarding
compensation. Under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (as amended
by section 7001 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009), recipients of
financial assistance under Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) were
prohibited from paying or accruing any bonus, retention award, or incentive
compensation except for the payment of long-term restricted stock if that stock had a
value that was not greater than one third of the total amount of annual compensation of
the employee receiving the stock. 86 In addition, some international regulators also use a
threshold of one-third incentive-based compensation for determining the scope of
application for certain compensation standards. 87

87

100

The Agencies included the 180-day period in the one-third threshold of annual
base salary and incentive-based compensation because, based upon the supervisory
experience of the Federal Banking Agencies and FHFA, this period would allow covered
institutions an adequate period of time to calculate the total compensation of their
covered persons and, for purposes of the relative compensation test, the individuals
receiving incentive-based compensation from their affiliate covered institutions over a
full calendar year. The Agencies expect, based on the experience of exceptional
assistance recipients under TARP, 88 that 180 days would be a reasonable period of time
for Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions to finalize compensation paid to and awarded
to covered persons and to perform the necessary calculations to determine which covered
persons are significant risk-takers. This time period would allow covered institutions to
make awards following the end of the performance period, calculate the annual base
salary and incentive-based compensation for all employees in the consolidated
organization, including affiliated covered institutions, and then implement new
compensation arrangements for the significant risk-takers identified, if necessary.
The Agencies recognize that the relative compensation test and the exposure test,
combined with the one-third threshold, may not identify all covered persons at Level 1
and Level 2 covered institutions who have the ability to expose a covered institution or its
affiliated covered institutions to material financial loss. Accordingly, paragraph (2) of
the proposed rule’s definition of significant risk-taker would allow covered institutions or
88

The institutions that accepted “exceptional assistance” under TARP were required to submit to
the Office of the Special Master for approval the compensation levels and structures for the five
named executive officers and the next 20 most highly compensated executive officers (“Top 25”)
and the compensation structures for the next 75 most highly compensated employees. The
requirement for submission of the Top 25 necessitated the collection of the compensation data for
executives worldwide and took considerable time and effort on the part of the institutions.

101

the Agencies the flexibility to designate additional persons as significant risk-takers. An
Agency would be able to designate a covered person as a significant risk-taker if the
covered person has the ability to expose the covered institution to risks that could lead to
material financial loss in relation to the covered institution’s size, capital, or overall risk
tolerance. Each Agency would use its own procedures for making such a designation.
Such procedures generally would include reasonable advance written notice of the
proposed action, including a description of the basis for the proposed action, and
opportunity for the covered person and covered institution to respond.
Relative compensation test.
The relative compensation test in paragraphs (1)(i) and (ii) of the proposed
definition of “significant risk-taker” would require a covered institution to determine
which covered persons received the most annual base salary and incentive-based
compensation among all individuals receiving incentive-based compensation from the
covered institution and any affiliates of the covered institution that are also subject to the
proposed rule. 89 The definition contains two percentage thresholds for measuring
whether an individual is a significant risk-taker. For a Level 1 covered institution, a
covered person would be a significant risk-taker if the person receives annual base salary
89

The OCC, Board, FDIC, and SEC’s proposed rules include a defined term, “section 956
affiliate,” that is intended to function as shorthand for the types of entities that are considered
“covered institutions” under the six Agencies’ proposed rules. The term “section 956 affiliate” is
used only in the definition of “significant risk-taker,” and it is not intended to affect the scope of
any Agency’s rule or the entities considered “covered institutions” under any Agency’s rule.
Given the proposed location of each Agency’s proposed rule in the Code of Federal Regulations,
the cross-references used in each of the OCC, Board, FDIC, and SEC’s proposed rule differ
slightly. NCUA’s proposed rule does not include a definition of “section 956 affiliate,” because
credit unions are not affiliated with the entities that are considered “covered institutions” under
the other Agencies’ rules. Similarly, FHFA’s proposed rule does not include a definition of
“section 956 affiliate” because its regulated institutions are not affiliated with other Agencies’
covered institutions.

102

and incentive-based compensation for the last calendar year that ended at least 180 days
before the performance period that places the person among the highest 5 percent of all
covered persons in salary and incentive-based compensation (excluding senior executive
officers) of the Level 1 covered institution and, in the cases of the OCC, the Board, the
FDIC, and the SEC, any section 956 affiliates of the Level 1 covered institution. For
Level 2 covered institutions, the threshold would be 2 percent rather than 5 percent.
For example, if a hypothetical bank holding company were a Level 1 covered
institution and had $255 billion in average total consolidated assets might have a
subsidiary national bank with $253 billion in average total consolidated assets, a
mortgage subsidiary with $1.9 billion in average total consolidated assets, and a wealth
management subsidiary with $100 million in average total consolidated assets. 90 The
relative compensation test would analyze the annual base salary and incentive-based
compensation of all covered persons (other than senior executive officers) who receive
incentive-based compensation at the bank holding company, the subsidiary national bank,
and the mortgage subsidiary, which are all covered institutions with assets greater than or
equal to $1 billion. Individuals at the wealth management subsidiary would not be
included because that subsidiary has less than $1 billion in average total consolidated
assets. Thus, if the bank holding company, state member bank, and mortgage subsidiary
collectively had 150,000 covered persons (excluding senior executive officers), then the
covered institution should identify the 7,500 or 5 percent of covered persons (other than
90

Under the proposed rule, all of these subsidiaries in this example other than the wealth
management subsidiary would be subject to the same requirements as the bank holding company,
including the specific requirements applying to identification of significant risk-takers. The
wealth management subsidiary would not be subject to the requirements of the proposed rule
because it has less than $1 billion in average total consolidated assets.

103

senior executive officers) who receive the most annual base salary and incentive-based
compensation out of those 150,000 covered persons, and identify as significant risktakers any of those 7,500 persons who received annual base salary and incentive-based
compensation for the last calendar year that ended at least 180 days before the beginning
of the performance period of which at least one-third is incentive-based compensation. 91
Some of those 7,500 covered persons might receive incentive-based compensation from
the bank holding company; others might receive incentive-based compensation from the
national bank or the mortgage subsidiary. Each covered person that satisfies all
requirements would be considered a significant risk-taker of the covered institution from
which they receive incentive-based compensation. This example is provided solely for
the purpose of illustrating the calculation of the number of significant risk-takers under
the relative compensation test as proposed. It does not reflect any specific institution, nor
does it reflect the experience or judgment of the Agencies of the number of covered
persons or significant risk-takers at any institution that would be a Level 1 covered
institution under the proposed rule.
Annual base salary and incentive-based compensation would be measured based
on the last calendar year that ended at least 180 days before the beginning of the
performance period for the reasons discussed above.
The Agencies propose that Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions generally
should consider a covered person’s annual base salary actually paid during the calendar
year. If, for example, a covered person was a manager during the first half of the year,
91

The Agencies anticipate that covered institutions that are within a depository institution holding
company structure would work together to ensure that significant risk-takers are correctly
identified under the relative compensation test.

104

with an annual salary of $100,000, and was then promoted to a senior manager with an
annual salary of $150,000 on July 1 of that year, the annual base salary would be the
$50,000 that person received as manager for the first half of the year plus the $75,000
received as a senior manager for the second half of the year, for a total of $125,000.
For the purposes of determining significant risk-takers, covered institutions
should consider the incentive-based compensation that was awarded for any performance
period that ended during a particular calendar year, regardless of when the performance
period began. For example, if a covered person is awarded incentive-based compensation
relating to (i) a plan with a three-year performance period that began on January 1, 2017,
(ii) a plan with a two-year performance period that began on January 1, 2018, and (iii) a
plan with a one-year performance period that began on January 1, 2019, then all three of
these awards would be included in the calculation of incentive-based compensation for
calendar year 2019 because all three performance periods would end on December 31,
2019. The amount of previously deferred incentive-based compensation that vests in a
particular year would not affect the measure of a covered person’s incentive-based
compensation for purposes of the relative compensation test. 92
To reduce the administrative burden of calculating annual base salary and
incentive-based compensation, the calculation would not include fringe benefits such as
the value of medical insurance or the use of a company car. For purposes of such

92

Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions would also use this method of calculating a covered
person’s incentive-based compensation for a particular calendar year for purposes of determining
(1) whether such person received annual base salary and incentive-based compensation of which
at least one third was incentive-based compensation and (2) the amount of a covered person’s
annual base salary and incentive-based compensation under the dollar threshold test.

105

calculation, any non-cash compensation, such as stock or options, should be valued as of
the date of the award.
In the Agencies’ supervisory experience, the amount of a covered person’s annual
base salary and incentive-based compensation can reasonably be expected to relate to the
amount of responsibility that the covered person has within an organization, and covered
persons with a higher level of responsibility generally either (1) have a greater ability to
expose a covered institution to financial loss or (2) supervise covered persons who have a
greater ability to expose a covered institution to financial loss. For this reason, the
Agencies are proposing to use the relative compensation test as one basis for identifying
significant risk-takers.
Although a large number of covered persons may be able to expose a covered
institution to a financial loss, the Agencies have limited the relative compensation test to
the most highly compensated individuals in order to focus on those covered persons
whose behavior can directly or indirectly expose a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution
to a financial loss that is material. Based on an analysis of public disclosures of large,
international banking organizations 93 and on the Agencies’ own supervision of incentive-

93

Agencies examined information available through various public reports, including the FSB’s
annual Compensation Progress Report. For instance, many international jurisdictions require
firms to identify a population of employees who can expose a firm to material amounts of risk
(sometimes called material risk takers or key risk takers), who are subject to specific
requirements including deferral. In 2014 the FSB published information indicating that the
average percentage of total global employees identified as risk-takers under these various
jurisdictions’ requirements at a sample of large firms ranged from 0.01 percent of employees of
the global consolidated organization to more than 5 percent. The number varied between, but
also within, individual jurisdictions and institutions as a result of factors such as specific
institutions surveyed, the size of institution, and the nature of business conducted. See FSB,
Implementing the FSB Principles for Sound Compensation Practices and their Implementation

106

based compensation, the top 5 percent most highly compensated covered persons among
the covered institutions in the consolidated structure of Level 1 covered institutions are
the most likely to have the potential to encourage inappropriate risk-taking by the
covered institution because their compensation is excessive (the first test in section 956)
or be the personnel who are able to expose the organization to risk of material financial
loss (the second test in section 956).
The Board and the OCC, as a part of their supervisory efforts, reviewed a limited
sample of banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to
better understand what types of positions within these organizations would be captured
by various thresholds for highly compensated employees. In the review, the Board and
the OCC also considered how far below the CEO within the organizational hierarchy the
selected thresholds would reach. Generally, at banking organizations that would be Level

Standards Third Progress Report (November 2014), at 19, available at
http://www.fsb.org/2014/11/fsb-publishes-third-progress-report-on-compensation-practices.
In addition, the Agencies relied to a certain extent on information disclosed on a legal
entity basis as a result of Basel Pillar 3 remuneration disclosure requirements, for instance those
required under implementing regulations such as Article 450 of the Capital Requirements
Regulation (EU No 575/2013) in the European Union. See, e.g., Morgan Stanley, Article 450 of
CRR Disclosure: Remuneration Policy (December 31, 2014), available at
http://www.morganstanley.com/about-us-ir/pillar3/2014_CRR_450_Disclosure.pdf.
Remuneration disclosure requirements apply to “significant” firms. CRD IV defines institutions
that are significant “in terms of size, internal organisation and nature, scope and complexity of
their activities.” Under the EBA Guidance on Sound Remuneration Policies, significant
institutions means institutions referred to in Article 131 of Directive 2013/36/EU (global
systemically important institutions or ‘G-SIIs,’ and other systemically important institutions or
‘O-SIIs’), and, as appropriate, other institutions determined by the competent authority or
national law, based on an assessment of the institutions’ size, internal organization and the nature,
the scope and the complexity of their activities. Some, but not all, national regulators have
provided further guidance on interpretation of that term, including the United Kingdom’s FCA
which provides a form of methodology to determine if a firm is “significant” – based on
quantitative tests of balance sheet assets, liabilities, annual fee commission income, client money
and client assets.

107

1 covered institutions under the proposed rule, a 5 percent threshold would include
positions such as managing directors, directors, senior vice presidents, relationship and
sales managers, mortgage brokers, financial advisors, and product managers. Such
positions generally have the ability to expose the organization to the risk of material
financial loss. Based on this review, the Agencies believe it is reasonable to propose a 5
percent threshold under the relative compensation test for Level 1 covered institutions.
At banking organizations that would be Level 2 covered institutions under the
proposed rule, a 5 percent threshold yielded results that went much deeper into the
organization and identified roles with individuals who might not individually take
significant risks for the organization. Additional review of a limited sample of these
banking organizations that would be Level 2 covered institutions under the proposed rule
showed that, on average, the institutions in the limited sample identified approximately 2
percent of their total global employees as individual employees whose activities may
expose the organization to material amounts of risk, as consistent with the 2010 Federal
Banking Agency Guidance. A lower percentage threshold for Level 2 covered
institutions relative to Level 1 covered institutions also is consistent with the observation
that larger covered institutions generally have more complex structures and use incentivebased compensation more significantly than relatively smaller covered institutions.
Based on this analysis, the Agencies chose to propose a 2 percent threshold for Level 2
covered institutions. A lower percentage threshold for Level 2 covered institutions
relative to Level 1 covered institutions would reduce the burden on relatively smaller
covered institutions.

108

Under the proposed rule, if an Agency determines, in accordance with procedures
established by the Agency, that a Level 1 covered institution’s activities, complexity of
operations, risk profile, and compensation practices are similar to those of a Level 2
covered institution, then the Agency may apply a 2 percent threshold under the relative
compensation test rather than the 5 percent threshold that would otherwise apply. This
provision is intended to allow an Agency the flexibility to adjust the number of covered
persons who are significant risk-takers with respect to a Level 1 covered institution if the
Agency determines that, notwithstanding the Level 1 covered institution’s average total
consolidated assets, its actual activities and risks are similar to those of a Level 2 covered
institution, and therefore it would be appropriate for the Level 1 covered institution to
have fewer significant risk-takers.
Exposure test.
Under the exposure test, a covered person would be a significant risk-taker with
regard to a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution if the individual may commit or
expose 94 0.5 percent or more of capital of the covered institution or, and, in the cases of
the OCC, the Board, the FDIC, and the SEC, any section 956 affiliates of the covered
institution, whether or not the individual is employed by that specific legal entity.
The exposure test relates to a covered person’s authority to commit or expose
significant amounts of an institution’s capital, regardless of whether or not such
exposures or commitments are realized. The exposure test would relate to a covered
person’s authority to cause the covered institution to be subject to credit risk or market
94

An individual may commit or expose capital of a covered institution or affiliate if the
individual has the ability to put the capital at risk of loss due to market risk or credit risk.

109

risk. The exposure test would not relate to the ability of a covered person to expose a
covered institution to other types of risk that may be more difficult to measure or
quantify, such as compliance risk.
The measure of capital would relate to a covered person’s authority over the
course of the most recent calendar year, in the aggregate, and would be based on the
maximum amount that the person has authority to commit or expose during the year. For
example, a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution might allocate $10 million to a
particular covered person as an authorized level of lending for a calendar year. For
purposes of the exposure test in the proposed rule, the covered person’s authority to
commit or expose would be $10 million. This would be true even if the individual only
made $8 million in loans during the year or if the covered institution reduced the
authorized amount to $7.5 million at some point during the year. It would also be true
even if the covered person did not have the authority through any single transaction to
lend $10 million, so long as over the course of the year the covered person could lend up
to $10 million in the aggregate. If, however, in the course of the year the covered person
received authorization for an additional $5 million in lending, $15 million would become
the authorization amount for purposes of the exposure test. If a covered person had no
specific maximum amount of lending for the year, but instead his or her lending was
subject to approval on a rolling basis, then the covered person would be assumed to have
an authorized annual lending amount in excess of the 0.5 percent threshold.
As an additional example, a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution could authorize
a particular covered person to trade up to $5 million per day in a calendar year. For
purposes of the exposure test, the covered person’s authorized annual lending amount
110

would be $5 million times the number of trading days in the year (for example, $5
million times 260 days or $1.3 billion). This would be true even if the covered person
only traded $1 million per day during the year or if the covered institution reduced the
authorized trading amount to $2.5 million per day at some point during the year. If,
however, in the course of the year the covered person received authorization for an
additional $2 million in trading per day, the covered person’s authority to commit or
expose capital for purposes of the exposure test would be $1.82 billion ($7 million times
260 days). The Agencies are aware that institutions may not calculate their exposures in
this manner and are requesting comment upon it, as set forth below.
The exposure test would also include individuals who are voting members of a
committee that has the decision-making authority to commit or expose 0.5 percent or
more of the capital of a covered institution or of a section 956 affiliate of a covered
institution. For example, if a committee that is comprised of five covered persons has the
authority to make investment decisions with respect to 0.5 percent or more of a state
member bank’s capital, then each voting member of such committee would have the
authority to commit or expose 0.5 percent or more of the state member bank’s capital for
purposes of the exposure test. However, individuals who participate in the meetings of
such a committee but who do not have the authority to exercise voting, veto, or similar
rights that lead to the committee’s decision would not be included.
The exposure test would also cause a covered person to be considered a
significant risk-taker if he or she can commit or expose 0.5 percent or more of the capital
of any section 956 affiliate of the covered institution by which the covered person is
employed. For example, if a covered person of a nonbank subsidiary of a bank holding
111

company has the authority to commit 0.5 percent or more of the bank holding company’s
capital or the capital of the bank holding company’s subsidiary national bank (and
received annual base salary and incentive-based compensation for the last calendar year
that ended at least 180 days before the beginning of the performance period of which at
least one-third is incentive-based compensation), then the covered person would be
considered a significant risk-taker of the bank holding company or national bank,
whichever is applicable. This would be true even if the covered person is not employed
by the bank holding company or the bank holding company’s subsidiary national bank,
and even if the covered person does not have the authority to commit or expose the
capital of the nonbank subsidiary that employs the covered person.
The exposure test would require a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution to
consider the authority of an individual to take an action that could result in significant
credit or market risk exposures to the covered institution. The Agencies are proposing
the exposure test because individuals who have the authority to expose covered
institutions to significant amounts of risk can cause material financial losses to covered
institutions. For example, in proposing the exposure test, the Agencies were cognizant of
the significant losses caused by actions of individuals, or a trading group, at some of the
largest financial institutions during and after the financial crisis that began in 2007. 95
The exposure test would identify significant risk-takers based on the extent of an
individual’s authority to expose an institution to market risk or credit risk, measured by
reference to 0.5 percent of the covered institution’s regulatory capital. Measuring this
authority by reference to an existing capital standard would provide a uniform and clearly
95

See supra note 14.

112

defined metric to apply among covered persons at Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions. The Agencies have selected credit and market risks as the most relevant
types of exposures because the majority of assets on a covered institution’s balance sheet
generally give rise to market or credit risk exposure.
In proposing a threshold of 0.5 percent of relevant capital, the Agencies
considered both the absolute and relative amount of losses that the threshold would
represent for covered institutions, and the fact that incentive-based compensation
programs generally apply to numerous employees at a covered institution. In the
Agencies’ view, the proposed threshold represents a material financial loss within the
meaning of section 956 for any institution and multiple losses at the same firm
incentivized by a single incentive-based compensation program could impair the firm.
The Agencies considered the cumulative effect of incentive-based compensation
arrangements across a covered institution. The Agencies recognize that many covered
persons who have the authority to expose a covered institution to risk are subject to
similar incentive-based compensation arrangements. The effect of an incentive-based
compensation arrangement on a covered institution would be the cumulative effect of the
behavior of all covered persons subject to the incentive-based compensation arrangement.
If multiple covered persons are incented to take inappropriate risks, their combined risktaking behavior could lead to a financial loss at the covered institution that is significantly
greater than the financial loss that could be caused by any one individual. 96 Although
many institutions already have governance and risk management systems to help ensure
the commitment of significant amounts of capital is subject to appropriate controls, as
96

See, e.g., the Subcommittee Report.

113

noted above, incentive-based compensation arrangements that provide inappropriate risktaking incentives can weaken those governance and risk management systems. These
considerations about the cumulative effect of incentive-based compensation arrangements
weigh in favor of a conservative threshold under the exposure test so that large groups of
covered persons with the authority to commit a covered institution’s capital are not
subject to flawed incentive-based compensation arrangements which would incentivize
them to subject the covered institution to inappropriate risks.
The Agencies also considered that in another regulatory context, a relatively small
decrease in a large institution’s capital requires additional safeguards for safety and
soundness. Under the capital plan rule in the Board’s Regulation Y, well-capitalized
bank holding companies with average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more are
subject to prior approval requirements on incremental capital distributions if those
distributions, as measured over a one-year period, would exceed pre-approved amounts
by more than 1 percent of the bank holding company’s tier 1 capital. 97 Relative to the
capital plan rule, a lower threshold of capital is appropriate in the context of incentivebased compensation in light of the potential cumulative effect of multiple covered
persons with incentives to take inappropriate risks and the possibility that correlated
inappropriate risk-taking incentives could, in the aggregate, significantly erode capital
buffers at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions.

97

See 12 CFR 225.8(g). Bank holding companies that are well-capitalized and that meet other
requirements under the rule must provide the Board with prior notice for incremental capital
distributions, as measured over a one-year period, that represent more than 1 percent of their tier
1 capital. Id.

114

Taking into consideration the cumulative impact of incentive-based compensation
arrangements described above, the Agencies have proposed a threshold level for the
exposure test of 0.5 percent of capital. The exposure test would be measured on an
annual basis to align with the common practice at many institutions of awarding
incentive-based compensation on an annual basis, taking into account a covered person’s
performance and risk-taking over 12 months.
The Agencies also considered international compensation regulations that also use
a 0.5 percent threshold, but on a per transaction basis. 98 The Agencies are proposing to
apply the threshold on an aggregate annual basis because a per transaction basis could
permit an individual to evade designation as a significant risk-taker and the related
incentive-based compensation restrictions by keeping his or her individual transactions
below the threshold, but completing multiple transactions during the course of the year
that, in the aggregate, far exceed the threshold.
Exposure test at certain affiliates.
Paragraph (3) of the definition of significant risk-taker is intended to address
potential evasion of the exposure test by a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution that
authorizes an employee of one of its affiliates that is not a covered institution because it
has less than $1 billion in average total consolidated assets or is not considered a covered
institution under one of the six Agencies’ proposed rules, to commit or expose 0.5
percent or more of capital of the Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution. The Agencies are
98

See, e.g., EBA, “Regulatory Technical Standards on Criteria to Identify Categories of Staff
Whose Professional Activities Have a Material Impact on an Institution’s Risk Profile under
Article 94(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU” (December 16, 2013), available at
https://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/526386/EBA-RTS-201311+%28On+identified+staff%29.pdf/c313a671-269b-45be-a748-29e1c772ee0e.

115

concerned that in such a situation, the employee would be functioning as a significant
risk-taker at the affiliated Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution but would not be subject
to the requirements of the proposed rule that would be applicable to a significant risktaker at the affiliated Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution. To address this
circumstance, the proposed rule would treat such employee as a significant risk-taker
with respect to the affiliated Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution for which the
employee may commit or expose capital. That Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution
would be required to ensure that the employee’s incentive-based compensation
arrangement complies with the proposed rule.
Dollar threshold test.
As an alternative to the relative compensation test, the Agencies also considered
using a specific absolute compensation threshold, measured in dollars, to determine
whether an individual is a significant risk-taker. Under this test, a covered person who
receives annual base salary and incentive-based compensation 99 in excess of a specific
dollar threshold would be a significant risk-taker, regardless of how that covered person’s
annual base salary and incentive-based compensation compared to others in the
consolidated organization (the “dollar threshold test”). A dollar threshold test would
include adjustments such as for inflation. If the dollar threshold test replaced the relative
compensation test, the definition of “significant risk-taker” would still include only
covered persons who received annual base salary and incentive-based compensation of
which at least one-third was incentive-based compensation, based on the covered
99

For purposes of the dollar threshold test, the measure of annual base salary and incentive-based
compensation would be calculated in the same way as the measure for the one-third threshold
discussed above.

116

person’s annual base salary paid and incentive-based compensation awarded during the
last calendar year that ended at least 180 days before the beginning of the performance
period.
One advantage of a dollar threshold test compared to the relative compensation
test is that it could be less burdensome to implement and monitor. With a dollar
threshold test covered institutions can determine whether an individual covered person
meets the dollar threshold test of the significant risk-taker definition by reviewing the
compensation of only that single individual. The dollar threshold test would also allow
an institution to implement incentive-based compensation structures, policies, and
procedures with some foreknowledge of which employees would be covered by them.
However, even with adjustment for inflation, a dollar threshold put in place by regulation
would assume that a certain dollar threshold is an appropriate level for all Level 1 and
Level 2 covered institutions and covered persons. On the other hand, a dollar threshold
could set expectations so that individual employees would know based on their own
compensation if they are significant risk-takers.
Based on FHFA’s supervisory experience analyzing compensation both at
FHFA’s regulated entities and at other financial institutions, a dollar threshold would be
an appropriate approach to identify individuals with the ability to put the covered
institution at risk of material loss. FHFA must prohibit its regulated entities from
providing compensation to any executive officer of the regulated entity that is not
reasonable and comparable with compensation for employment in other similar
businesses (including publicly held financial institutions or major financial services

117

companies) involving similar duties and responsibilities.100 In order to meet this
statutory mandate, FHFA analyzes, assesses, and compares the compensation paid to
employees of its regulated entities and compensation paid to employees of other financial
institutions of various asset sizes. In performing this analysis, FHFA has observed that
the amount of a covered person’s annual base salary and incentive-based compensation
reasonably relates to the level of responsibility that the covered person has within an
organization. A dollar threshold test, if set at the appropriate level, would identify
covered persons who either (1) have a greater ability to expose a covered institution to
financial loss or (2) supervise covered persons who have a greater ability to expose a
covered institution to financial loss.
One disadvantage of the dollar threshold test is that it may not appropriately
capture all individuals who subject the firm to significant risks. A dollar threshold put in
place by regulation that is static across all Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions also is
not sensitive to the compensation practices of an individual organization. The relative
compensation test, while not as easy to implement, could be more sensitive to the
compensation structure of an organization because it is based on the relative
compensation of individuals that the organization concludes should be the mostly highly
compensated.
2.18.

For purposes of a designation under paragraph (2) of the definition of significant

risk-taker, should the Agencies provide a specific standard for what would constitute
“material financial loss” and/or “overall risk tolerance”? If so, how should these
terms be defined and why?
100

12 U.S.C. 4518(a).

118

2.19.

The Agencies specifically invite comment on the one-third threshold in the

proposed rule. Is one-third of the total of annual base salary and incentive-based
compensation an appropriate threshold level of incentive-based compensation that
would be sufficient to influence risk-taking behavior? Is using compensation from
the last calendar year that ended at least 180 days before the beginning of the
performance period for calculating the one-third threshold appropriate?
2.20.

The Agencies specifically invite comment on the percentages of employees

proposed to be covered under the relative compensation test. Are 5 percent and 2
percent reasonable levels? Why or why not? Would 5 percent and 2 percent include
all of the significant risk-takers or include too many covered persons who are not
significant risk-takers?
2.21.

The Agencies specifically invite comment on the time frame needed to identify

significant risk-takers under the relative compensation test. Is using compensation
from the last calendar year that ended at least 180 days before the beginning of the
performance period appropriate? The Agencies invite comment on whether there is
another measure of total compensation that would be possible to measure closer in
time to the performance period for which a covered person would be identified as a
significant risk-taker.
2.22.

The Agencies invite comment on all aspects of the exposure test, including

potential costs and benefits, the appropriate exposure threshold and capital equivalent,
efficacy at identifying those non-senior executive officers who have the authority to
place the capital of a covered institution at risk, and whether an exposure test is a
useful complement to the relative compensation test. If so, what specific types of
119

activities or transactions, and at what level of exposure, should the exposure test
cover? The Agencies also invite comment on whether the exposure test is workable
and why. What, if any, additional details would need to be specified in order to make
the exposure test workable, such as further explanation of the meanings of “commit”
or “expose”? In addition to committees, should the exposure test apply to groups of
persons, such as traders on a desk? If so, how should it be applied?
2.23.

With respect to the exposure test, the Agencies specifically invite comment on the

proposed capital commitment levels. Is 0.5 percent of capital of a covered institution
a reasonable proxy for material financial loss, or are there alternative levels or dollar
thresholds that would better achieve the statutory objectives? If alternative methods
would better achieve the statutory objectives, what are the advantages and
disadvantages of those alternatives compared to the proposed level? For depository
institution holding company organizations with multiple covered institutions, should
the capital commitment level be consistent across all such institutions or should it
vary depending on specified factors and why? For example, should the levels for
covered institutions that are subsidiaries of a parent who is also a covered institution
vary depending on: (1) the size of those subsidiaries relative to the parent; and/or (2)
whether the entity would be subject to comparable restrictions if it were not affiliated
with the parent? What are the advantages and disadvantages of any such variation,
and what would be the appropriate levels? The Agencies recognize that certain
covered institutions under the Board’s, the OCC’s, the FDIC’s, and the SEC’s
proposed rules, such as Federal and state branches and agencies of foreign banks and
investment advisers that are not also depository institution holding companies, banks,

120

or broker-dealers or subsidiaries of those institutions, are not otherwise required to
calculate common equity tier 1 capital or tentative net capital, as applicable. How
should the capital commitment level be determined under the Board’s, the OCC’s, the
FDIC’s, and the SEC’s proposed rules for those covered institutions? Is there a
capital or other measure that the Agencies should consider for those covered
institutions that would achieve similar objectives to common equity tier 1 capital or
tentative net capital? If so, what are the advantages and disadvantages of such a
capital or other measure?
2.24.

The Agencies invite comment on whether it is appropriate to limit the exposure

test to market risk and credit risk and why. What other types of risk should be
included, if any and how would such exposures be measured? Should the Agencies
prescribe a method for measurement of market risk and credit risk? Should exposures
be measured as notional amounts or is there a more appropriate measure? If so, what
would it be? Should the exposure test take into account hedging? How should the
exposure test be applied to an individual in a situation where a firm calculates an
exposure limit for a trading desk comprised of a group of people? Should a de
minimis threshold be introduced for any transaction counted toward the 0.5 percent
annual exposure test?
2.25.

Should the exposure test consider the authority of a covered person to initiate or

structure proposed product offerings, even if the covered person does not have final
decision-making authority over such product offerings? Why or why not? If so, are
there specific types of products with respect to which this approach would be
appropriate and why?
121

2.26.

Should the exposure test measure a covered person’s authority to commit or

expose (a) through one transaction or (b) as currently proposed, through multiple
transactions in the aggregate over a period of time? What would be the benefits and
disadvantages of applying the test on a per-transaction versus aggregate basis over a
period of time? If measured on an aggregate basis, what period of time is appropriate
and why? For example, should paragraph (1)(iii) of the definition of significant risktaker read: “A covered person of a covered institution who had the authority to
commit or expose in any single transaction during the previous calendar year 0.5
percent or more of the capital 101 of the covered institution or of any section 956
affiliate of the covered institution, whether or not the individual is a covered person
of that specific legal entity”? Why or why not?
2.27.

If the exposure test were based on a single transaction, would 0.5 percent of

capital be the appropriate threshold for significant risk-taker status? Why or why
not? If not, what would be the appropriate percentage of capital to include in the
exposure test and why?
2.28.

Should the Agencies introduce an absolute exposure threshold in addition to a

percentage of capital test if a per-transaction test was introduced instead of the annual
exposure test? Why or why not? For example, would a threshold formulated as “the
lesser of 0.5 percent of capital or $100 million” help to level the playing field across
Level 1 covered institutions and the smallest Level 2 covered institutions and better
ensure that the right set of activities is being considered by all institutions? The

101

Under this alternative language, each Agency’s rule text would include the relevant capital
metrics for its covered institutions.

122

Agencies’ supervisory experience indicates that many large institutions, for example,
require additional scrutiny of significant transactions, which helps to ensure that the
potential risks posed by large transactions are adequately considered before such
transactions are approved. Would $100 million be the appropriate level at which
additional approval procedures are required before a transaction is approved, or
would a lower threshold be appropriate if an absolute dollar threshold were combined
with the capital equivalent threshold?
2.29.

Should the exposure test measure exposures or commitments actually made, or

should the authority to make an exposure or commitment be sufficient to meet the test
and why? For example, should paragraph (1)(iii) of the definition of significant risktaker read: “A covered person of a covered institution who committed or exposed in
the aggregate during the previous calendar year 0.5 percent or more of the common
equity tier 1 capital, or in the case of a registered securities broker or dealer, 0.5
percent or more of the tentative net capital, of the covered institution or of any section
956 affiliate of the covered institution, whether or not the individual is a covered
person of that specific legal entity”?
2.30.

Would a dollar threshold test, as described above, achieve the statutory objectives

better than the relative compensation test? Why or why not? If using a dollar
threshold test, and assuming a mechanism for inflation adjustment, would $1 million
be the right threshold or should it be higher or lower? For example, would a
threshold of $2 million dollars be more appropriate? Why or why not? How should
the threshold be adjusted for inflation? Are there other adjustments that should be
made to ensure the threshold remains appropriate? What are the advantages and
123

disadvantages of a dollar threshold test compared to the proposed relative
compensation test?
2.31.

The Agencies specifically invite comment on replacement of the relative

compensation test in paragraphs (1)(i) and (ii) of the definition of significant risktaker with a dollar threshold test, as follows: “a covered person of a Level 1 or Level
2 covered institution who receives annual base salary and incentive-based
compensation of $1 million or more in the last calendar year that ended at least 180
days before the beginning of the performance period.” Under this alternative, the
remaining language in the definition of “significant risk-taker” would be unchanged.
2.32.

The Agencies invite comment on all aspects of a dollar threshold test, including

potential costs and benefits, the appropriate amount, efficacy at identifying those nonsenior executive officers who have the ability to place the institution at risk, time
frame needed to identify significant risk-takers, and comparison to a relative
compensation test such as the one proposed. Is the last calendar year that ended at
least 180 days before the beginning of the performance period an appropriate time
frame or for the dollar threshold test or would using compensation from the
performance period that ended in the most recent calendar year be appropriate? The
Agencies specifically invite comment on whether to use an exposure test if a dollar
threshold test replaces the relative compensation test and why.
2.33.

The Agencies invite comment on all aspects of the definition of “significant risk-

taker.” The Agencies specifically invite comment on whether the definition should
rely solely on the relative compensation test, solely on the exposure test, or on both

124

tests, as proposed. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these
options?
2.34.

In addition to the tests outlined above, are there alternative tests of, or proxies for,

significant risk-taking that would better achieve the statutory objectives? What are
the advantages and disadvantages of alternative approaches? What are the
implementation burdens of any of the approaches, and how could they be addressed?
2.35.

How many covered persons would likely be identified as significant risk-takers

under the proposed rule? How many covered persons would likely be identified
under only the relative compensation test with the one-third threshold? How many
covered persons would likely be identified under only the exposure test as measured
on an annual basis with the one-third threshold? How many covered persons would
be identified under only an exposure test formulated on a per transaction basis with
the one-third threshold? How many covered persons would be identified under only
the dollar threshold test, assuming the dollar threshold is $1 million, with the onethird threshold? How many covered persons would be identified under each test
individually without a one-third threshold?
Other definitions.
To award. The proposed rule defines “to award” as to make a final determination,
conveyed to a covered person, of the amount of incentive-based compensation payable to
the covered person for performance over a performance period.
The Agencies acknowledge that some covered institutions use the term “award”
to refer to the decisions that covered institutions make about incentive-based

125

compensation structures and performance measure targets before or soon after the
relevant performance period begins. However, in the interest of clarity and consistency,
the proposed rule uses the phrase “to award” only with reference to final determinations
about incentive-based compensation amounts that an institution makes and communicates
to the covered person who could receive the award under an incentive-based
compensation arrangement for a given performance period.
In most cases, incentive-based compensation will be awarded near the end of the
performance period. Neither the length of the performance period nor the decision to
defer some or all incentive-based compensation would affect the determination of when
incentive-based compensation is awarded for purposes of the proposed rule. For
example, at the beginning of a one-year performance period, a covered institution might
inform a covered person of the amount of incentive-based compensation that the covered
person could earn at the end of the performance period if certain measures and other
criteria are met. The covered institution might also inform the covered person that a
portion of the covered person’s incentive-based compensation will be deferred for a fouryear period. The covered person’s incentive-based compensation for that performance
period – including both the portion that is deferred and the portion that vests immediately
– would be “awarded” when the covered institution determines what amount of incentivebased compensation the covered person has earned based on his or her performance
during the performance period.
For equity-like instruments, such as stock appreciation rights and options, the date
when incentive-based compensation is awarded may be different than from the date when
the instruments vest, are paid out, or can be exercised. For example, a covered institution
126

could determine at the end of a performance period that a covered person has earned
options on the basis of performance during that performance period, and the covered
institution could provide that the covered person cannot exercise the options for another
five years. The options would be considered to have been “awarded” at the end of the
performance period, even if they cannot be exercised for five years.
Under the proposed rule, covered institutions would have the flexibility to decide
how the determination of the amount of incentive-based compensation would be
conveyed to a covered person. For example, some covered institutions may choose to
inform covered persons of their award amounts in writing or by electronic message.
Others may choose to allow managers to orally inform covered persons of their award
amounts.
2.36.

The Agencies invite comment on whether the proposed rule’s definition of “to

award” should include language on when incentive-based compensation is awarded
for purposes of the proposed rule. Specifically, the Agencies invite comment on
whether the definition should read: “To award incentive-based compensation means
to make a final determination, conveyed to a covered person, at the end of the
performance period, of the amount of incentive-based compensation payable to the
covered person for performance over that performance period.” Why or why not?
Board of directors. The proposed rule defines “board of directors” as the
governing body of a covered institution that oversees the activities of the covered
institution, often referred to as the board of directors or board of managers. Under the
Board’s proposed rule, for a foreign banking organization, “board of directors” would
mean the relevant oversight body for the institution’s state insured or uninsured branch,
127

agency, or operations, consistent with the foreign banking organization’s overall
corporate and management structure. Under the FDIC’s proposed rule, for a state insured
branch of a foreign bank, “board of directors” would refer to the relevant oversight body
for the state insured branch consistent with the foreign bank’s overall corporate and
management structure. Under the OCC’s proposed rule, for a Federal branch or agency
of a foreign bank, “board of directors” would refer to the relevant oversight body for the
Federal branch or agency, consistent with its overall corporate and management structure.
The OCC would work closely with Federal branches and agencies to determine the
appropriate person or committee to undertake the responsibilities assigned to the
oversight body. NCUA’s proposed rule defines “board of directors” as the governing
body of a credit union.
Clawback. The term “clawback” under the proposed rule refers specifically to a
mechanism that allows a covered institution to recover from a senior executive officer or
significant risk-taker incentive-based compensation that has vested if the covered
institution determines that the senior executive officer or significant risk-taker has
engaged in fraud or the types of misconduct or intentional misrepresentation described in
section ___.7(c) of the proposed rule. Clawback would not apply to incentive-based
compensation that has been awarded but is not yet vested. As used in the proposed rule,
the term “clawback” is distinct from the terms “forfeiture” and “downward adjustment,”
in that clawback provisions allow covered institutions to recover incentive-based
compensation that has already vested. In contrast, forfeiture applies only after incentivebased compensation is awarded but before it vests. Downward adjustment occurs only
before incentive-based compensation is awarded.

128

Compensation, fees, or benefits. The proposed rule defines “compensation, fees,
or benefits” to mean all direct and indirect payments, both cash and non-cash, awarded
to, granted to, or earned by or for the benefit of, any covered person in exchange for
services rendered to the covered institution. The form of payment would not affect
whether such payment meets the definition of “compensation, fees, or benefits.” The
term would include, among other things, payments or benefits pursuant to an employment
contract, compensation, pension, or benefit agreements, fee arrangements, perquisites,
options, post-employment benefits, and other compensatory arrangements. The term is
defined broadly under the proposed rule in order to include all forms of incentive-based
compensation.
The term “compensation, fees, or benefits” would exclude reimbursement for
reasonable and proper costs incurred by covered persons in carrying out the covered
institution’s business.
Control function. The proposed rule defines “control function” as a compliance,
risk management, internal audit, legal, human resources, accounting, financial reporting,
or finance role responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring, or controlling risktaking. 102 The term would include loan review and Bank Secrecy Act roles. Section
___.9(b) of the proposed rule would require a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution to
provide individuals engaged in control functions with the authority to influence the risktaking of the business areas they monitor and ensure that covered persons engaged in
control functions are compensated in accordance with the achievement of performance

102

The term “control function” would serve a different purpose than, and is not intended to affect
the interpretation of, the term “front line unit,” as used in the OCC’s Heightened Standards.

129

objectives linked to their control functions and independent of the performance of the
business areas they monitor. As described below, section ___.11 of the proposed rule
would also require that a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution’s policies and procedures
provide an appropriate role for control function personnel in the covered institution’s
incentive-based compensation program. The heads of control functions would also be
considered senior executive officers for purposes of the proposed rule, because such
employees can individually affect the risk profile of a covered institution.
Although covered persons in control functions generally do not perform activities
designed to generate revenue or reduce expenses, they may nonetheless have the ability
to expose covered institutions to risk of material financial loss. For example, individuals
in human resources and risk management roles contribute to the design and review of
performance measures used in incentive-based compensation arrangements, which may
allow them to influence the activities of risk-takers in a covered institution. For that
reason, the proposed rule would treat covered persons who are the heads of control
functions as senior executive officers who would be subject to certain additional
requirements under the proposed rule as described further below.
2.37.

The Agencies invite comment on whether and in what circumstances, the

proposed definition of “control function” should include additional individuals and
organizational units that (a) do not engage in activities designed to generate revenue
or reduce expenses; (b) provide operational support or servicing to any organizational
unit or function; or (c) provide technology services.
Deferral. The proposed rule defines “deferral” as the delay of vesting of
incentive-based compensation beyond the date on which the incentive-based
130

compensation is awarded. As discussed below in this Supplementary Information
section, under the proposed rule, a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution would be
required to defer a portion of the incentive-based compensation of senior executive
officers and significant risk-takers. The Agencies would not consider compensation that
has vested, but that the covered person then chooses to defer, e.g., for tax reasons, to be
deferred incentive-based compensation for purposes of the proposed rule because it
would not be subject to forfeiture.
The Agencies note that the deferral period under the proposed rule would not
include any portion of the performance period, even for incentive-based compensation
plans that have longer performance periods. Deferral involves a “look-back” period that
is intended as a stand-alone interval that follows the performance period and allows time
for ramifications (such as losses or other adverse consequences) of, and other information
about, risk-taking decisions made during the performance period to become apparent.
If incentive-based compensation is paid in the form of options, the period of time
between when an option vests and when the option can be exercised would not be
considered deferral under the proposed rule. As with other types of incentive-based
compensation, an option would count toward the deferral requirement only if it has been
awarded but has not yet vested, regardless of when the option could be exercised. 103
2.38.

To the extent covered institutions are already deferring incentive-based

compensation, does the proposed definition of deferral reflect current practice? If
not, in what way does it differ?

103

Section ___.7(a)(4)(ii) of the proposed rule limits the portion of the proposed rule’s minimum
deferral requirements that can be met in the form of options.

131

Deferral period. The proposed rule defines “deferral period” as the period of time
between the date a performance period ends and the last date on which the incentivebased compensation that is awarded for such performance period vests. A deferral period
and a performance period that both relate to the same incentive-based compensation
award could not occur concurrently. Because sections___.7(a)(1)(iii) and (a)(2)(iii) of
the proposed rule would allow for pro rata vesting of deferred amounts during a deferral
period, some deferred incentive-based compensation awarded for a performance period
could vest before the end of the deferral period following that performance period. As a
result, the deferral period would be considered to end on the date that the last tranche of
incentive-based compensation awarded for a performance period vests.
Downward adjustment. The proposed rule defines “downward adjustment” as a
reduction of the amount of a covered person’s incentive-based compensation not yet
awarded for any performance period that has already begun, including amounts payable
under long-term incentive plans, in accordance with a forfeiture and downward
adjustment review under section __7(b) of the proposed rule. As explained above,
downward adjustment is distinct from clawback and forfeiture because downward
adjustment affects incentive-based compensation that has not yet been awarded. It is also
distinct from performance-based adjustments that covered institutions might make in
determining the amount of incentive-based compensation to award to a covered person,
absent or separate from a forfeiture or downward adjustment review. Depending on the
results of a forfeiture and downward adjustment review under section ___.7(b) of the
proposed rule, a covered institution could adjust downward incentive-based
compensation that has not yet been awarded to a senior executive officer or significant

132

risk-taker such that the senior executive officer or significant risk-taker is awarded none,
or only some, of the incentive-based compensation that could otherwise have been
awarded to such senior executive officer or significant risk-taker.
Equity-like instrument. The proposed rule defines “equity-like instrument” as
(1) equity in the covered institution or of any affiliate of the covered institution; or (2) a
form of compensation (i) payable at least in part based on the price of the shares or other
equity instruments of the covered institution or of any affiliate of the covered institution;
or (ii) that requires, or may require, settlement in the shares of the covered institution or
any affiliate of the covered institution. The value of an equity-like instrument would be
related to the value of the covered institution’s shares. 104 The definition includes three
categories. Shares are an example of the first category, “equity.” Examples of the
second category, “a form of compensation payable at least in part based on the price of
the shares or other equity instruments of the covered institution or any affiliate of the
covered institution,” include restricted stock units (RSUs), stock appreciation rights, and
other derivative instruments that settle in cash. Examples of the third category, “a form
of compensation that requires, or may require, settlement in the shares of the covered
institution or of any affiliate of the covered institution,” include options and derivative
securities that settle, either mandatorily or permissively, in shares. An RSU that offers a
choice of settlement in either cash or shares is also an example of this third category. The
definition of equity-like instrument would include shares in the holding company of a

104

The definition of “equity-like instrument” in the proposed rule is similar to “share-based
payment” in Topic 718 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting
Standards Codification (formerly FAS 123(R)). Paragraph 718-10-30-20, FASB Accounting
Standards Codification.

133

covered institution, or instruments the value of which is dependent on the value of shares
in the holding company of a covered institution. For example, the definition would
include incentive-based compensation paid in the form of shares in a bank holding
company, even if that incentive-based compensation were provided by a national bank
subsidiary of that bank holding company. Covered institutions would determine the
specific terms and conditions of the equity-like instruments they award to covered
persons.
NCUA’s proposed rule does not include the definition of “equity-like instrument”
because credit unions do not have these types of instruments.
2.39.

Are there any financial instruments that are used for incentive-based

compensation and have a value that is dependent on the performance of a covered
institution’s shares, but are not captured by the definition of “equity-like instrument”?
If so, what are they, and should such instruments be added to the definition? Why or
why not?
Forfeiture. The proposed rule defines “forfeiture” as a reduction of the amount of
deferred incentive-based compensation awarded to a covered person that has not
vested. 105 Depending on the results of a forfeiture and downward adjustment review

105

Forfeiture is similar to the concept of “malus” common at some covered institutions. Malus is
defined in the CEBS Guidelines as “an arrangement that permits the institution to prevent vesting
of all or part of the amount of a deferred remuneration award in relation to risk outcomes or
performance.” See CEBS Guidelines. The 2011 Proposed Rule did not define the term
“forfeiture,” but the concept was implicit in the discussion of adjustments during the deferral
period. See 76 FR at 21179, “Deferred payouts may be altered according to risk outcomes either
formulaically or based on managerial judgment, though extensive use of judgment might make it
more difficult to execute deferral arrangements in a sufficiently predictable fashion to influence
the risk-taking behavior of a covered person. To be most effective in ensuring balance, the
deferral period should be sufficiently long to allow for the realization of a substantial portion of

134

under section ___.7(b) of the proposed rule, a covered institution could reduce a
significant risk-taker or senior executive officer’s unvested incentive-based compensation
such that none, or only some, of the deferred incentive-based compensation vests. As
discussed below in this Supplementary Information section, a Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institution would be required to place at risk of forfeiture all unvested deferred incentivebased compensation, including amounts that have been awarded and deferred under longterm incentive plans.
Incentive-based compensation. The proposed rule defines “incentive-based
compensation” as any variable compensation, fees, or benefits that serve as an incentive
or reward for performance. The Agencies propose a broad definition to provide
flexibility as forms of compensation evolve. Compensation earned under an incentive
plan, annual bonuses, and discretionary awards are all examples of compensation that
could be incentive-based compensation. The form of payment, whether cash, an equitylike instrument, or any other thing of value, would not affect whether compensation, fees,
or benefits meet the definition of “incentive-based compensation.”
In response to a similar definition in the 2011 Proposed Rule, commenters asked
for clarification about the components of incentive-based compensation. The proposed
definition clarifies that compensation, fees, and benefits that are paid for reasons other
than to induce performance would not be included. For example, compensation, fees, or
benefits that are awarded solely for, and the payment of which is solely tied to, continued
employment (e.g., salary or a retention award that is conditioned solely on continued
the risks from the covered person’s activities, and the measures of loss should be clearly
explained to covered persons and closely tied to their activities during the relevant performance
period.”

135

employment) would not be considered incentive-based compensation. Likewise,
payments to new employees at the time of hiring (signing or hiring bonuses) that are not
conditioned on performance achievement would not be considered incentive-based
compensation because they generally are paid to induce a prospective employee to join
the institution, not to influence future performance of such employee.
Similarly, a compensation arrangement that provides payments solely for
achieving or maintaining a professional certification or higher level of educational
achievement would not be considered incentive-based compensation under the proposed
rule. In addition, the Agencies do not intend for this definition to include compensation
arrangements that are determined based solely on the covered person’s level of fixed
compensation and that do not vary based on one or more performance measures (e.g.,
employer contributions to a 401(k) retirement savings plan computed based on a fixed
percentage of an employee’s salary). Neither would the proposed definition include
dividends paid and appreciation realized on stock or other equity-like instruments that are
owned outright by a covered person. However, stock or other equity-like instruments
awarded to a covered person under a contract, arrangement, plan, or benefit would not be
considered owned outright while subject to any vesting or deferral arrangement
(regardless of whether such deferral is mandatory).
2.40.

The Agencies invite comment on the proposed definition of incentive-based

compensation. Should the definition be modified to include additional or fewer forms
of compensation and in what way? Is the definition sufficiently broad to capture all
forms of incentive-based compensation currently used by covered institutions? Why

136

or why not? If not, what forms of incentive-based compensation should be included
in the definition?
2.41.

The Agencies do not expect that most pensions would meet the proposed rule’s

definition of “incentive-based compensation” because pensions generally are not
conditioned on performance achievement. However, it may be possible to design a
pension that would meet the proposed rule’s definition of “incentive-based
compensation.” The Agencies invite comment on whether the proposed rule should
contain express provisions addressing the status of pensions in relation to the
definition of “incentive-based compensation.” Why or why not?
Incentive-based compensation arrangement, incentive-based compensation plan,
and incentive-based compensation program. The proposed rule defines three separate,
but related, terms describing how covered institutions provide incentive-based
compensation. 106 Under the proposed rule, “incentive-based compensation arrangement”
would mean an agreement between a covered institution and a covered person, under
which the covered institution provides incentive-based compensation to the covered
person, including incentive-based compensation delivered through one or more incentivebased compensation plans. An individual employment agreement would be an incentivebased compensation arrangement.
“Incentive-based compensation plan” is defined as a document setting forth terms
and conditions governing the opportunity for and the delivery of incentive-based
compensation payments to one or more covered persons. An incentive-based
106

The use of these terms under the proposed rule is consistent with how the same terms are used
in the 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance.

137

compensation plan may cover, among other things, specific roles or job functions,
categories of individuals, or forms of payment. A covered person may be compensated
under more than one incentive-based compensation plan.
“Incentive-based compensation program” means a covered institution’s
framework for incentive-based compensation that governs incentive-based compensation
practices and establishes related controls. A covered institution’s incentive-based
compensation program would include all of the covered institution’s incentive-based
compensation arrangements and incentive-based compensation plans.
Long-term incentive plan. The proposed rule defines “long-term incentive plan”
as a plan to provide incentive-based compensation that is based on a performance period
of at least three years. Any incentive-based compensation awarded to a covered person
for a performance period of less than three years would not be awarded under a long-term
incentive plan, but instead would be considered “qualifying incentive-based
compensation” as that term is defined under the proposed rule. 107
Long-term incentive plans are forward-looking plans designed to reward
employees for performance over a multi-year period. These plans generally provide an
award of cash or equity at the end of a performance period if the employee meets certain
individual or institution-wide performance measures. Because they have longer

107

In the 2011 Proposed Rule, the Agencies did not define the term “long-term incentive plan,”
but the 2011 Proposed Rule discussed “longer performance periods” as one of four methods used
to make compensation more sensitive to risk. 76 FR at 21179 (“Under this method of making
incentive-based compensation risk sensitive, the time period covered by the performance
measures used in determining a covered person’s award is extended (for example, from one year
to two years). Longer performance periods and deferral of payment are related in that both
methods allow awards or payments to be made after some or all risk outcomes associated with a
covered person’s activities are realized or better known.”).

138

performance periods, long-term incentive plans allow more time for information about a
covered person’s performance and risk-taking to become apparent, and covered
institutions can take that information into account to balance risk and reward. Under
current practice, the performance period for a long-term incentive plan is typically three
years. 108
2.42.

The Agencies invite comment on whether the proposed definition of “long-term

incentive plan” is appropriate for purposes of the proposed rule. Are there incentivebased compensation arrangements commonly used by financial institutions that
would not be included within the definition of “long-term incentive plan” under the
proposed rule but that, given the scope and purposes of section 956, should be
included in such definition? If so, what are the features of such incentive-based
compensation arrangements, why should the definition include such arrangements,
and how should the definition be modified to include such arrangements?

139

Option. The proposed rule defines an “option” as an instrument through which a
covered institution provides a covered person with the right, but not the obligation, to buy
a specified number of shares representing an ownership stake in a company at a
predetermined price within a set time period or on a date certain, or any similar
instrument, such as a stock appreciation right. Typically, covered persons must wait for a
specified time period to conclude before obtaining the right to exercise an option. 109 The
definition of option would also include option-like instruments that mirror some or all of
the features of an option. For example, the proposed rule would include stock
appreciation rights under the definition of option because the value of a stock
appreciation right is based on a stock’s price on a future date. As mentioned above, an
option would be considered an equity-like instrument, as that term is defined in the
proposed rule. NCUA’s proposed rule does not include a definition of “option” because
credit unions do not issue options.
Performance period. The proposed rule defines “performance period” as the
period during which the performance of a covered person is assessed for purposes of
determining incentive-based compensation. The Agencies intend for the proposed rule to
provide covered institutions with flexibility in determining the length and the start and
end dates of their employees’ performance periods. For example, under the proposed
rule, a covered institution could choose to have a performance period that coincided with
a calendar year or with the covered institution’s fiscal year (if the calendar year and fiscal
year were different). A covered institution could also choose to have a performance

109

As explained above in the definition of “deferral,” the time period after the option vests but
before it may be exercised is not considered part of the deferral period.

140

period of one year for some incentive-based compensation and a performance period of
three years for other incentive-based compensation.
2.43.

Does the proposed rule’s definition of “performance period” meet the goal of

providing covered institutions with flexibility in determining the length and start and
end dates of performance periods? Why or why not? Would a prescribed
performance period, for example, periods that correspond to calendar years, be
preferable? Why or why not?
Qualifying incentive-based compensation. The proposed rule defines “qualifying
incentive-based compensation” as the amount of incentive-based compensation awarded
to a covered person for a particular performance period, excluding amounts awarded to
such covered person for that particular performance period under a long-term incentive
plan. With the exception of long-term incentive plans, all forms of compensation, fees,
and benefits that qualify as “incentive-based compensation,” including annual bonuses,
would be included in the amount of qualifying incentive-based compensation. The
deferral requirements of section ___.7(a) of the proposed rule would require a Level 1 or
Level 2 covered institution to defer a specified percentage of any qualifying incentivebased compensation awarded to a significant risk-taker or senior executive officer for
each performance period.
Regulatory report. Each Agency has included a definition of “regulatory report”
in its version of the proposed rule that explains which regulatory reports would be
required to be used by each of that Agency’s covered institutions for the purposes of
measuring average total consolidated assets under the proposed rule.

141

For a national bank, state member bank, state nonmember bank, federal savings
association, and state savings association, “regulatory report” would mean the
consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (“Call Report”). 110 For a U.S. branch or
agency of a foreign bank, “regulatory report” would mean the Reports of Assets and
Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks—FFIEC 002. For a bank
holding company, “regulatory report” would mean Consolidated Financial Statements for
Bank Holding Companies (“FR Y–9C”). For a savings and loan holding company,
“regulatory report” would mean FR Y-9C; if a savings and loan holding company is not
required to file an FR Y-9C, Quarterly Savings and Loan Holding Company Report (“FR
2320”), if the savings and loan holding company reports consolidated assets on the FR
2320. For a savings and loan holding company that does not file a regulatory report
within the meaning of the preceding sentence, “regulatory report” would mean a report of
average total consolidated assets filed with the Board on a quarterly basis. For an Edge
or Agreement Corporation, “regulatory report” would mean the Consolidated Report of
Condition and Income for Edge and Agreement Corporations (“FR 2886b”). For the U.S.
operations of a foreign banking organization, “regulatory report” would mean a report of
average total consolidated U.S. assets filed with the Board on a quarterly basis. For
subsidiaries of national banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches or
agencies of foreign banking organizations that are not brokers, dealers, persons providing
insurance, investment companies, or investment advisers, “regulatory report” would
mean a report of the subsidiary’s total consolidated assets prepared by the subsidiary,
national bank, Federal savings association, or Federal branch or agency in a form that is
110

Specifically, the OCC will refer to item RCFD 2170 of Schedule RC.

142

acceptable to the OCC. For a regulated institution that is a subsidiary of a bank holding
company, savings and loan holding company, or a foreign banking organization,
“regulatory report” would mean a report of the subsidiary’s total consolidated assets
prepared by the bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or subsidiary
in a form that is acceptable to the Board.
For FHFA’s proposed rule, “regulatory report” would mean the Call Report
Statement of Condition.
For a natural person credit union, “regulatory report” would mean the 5300 Call
Report. For corporate credit unions, “regulatory report” would mean the 5310 Call
Report.
For a broker or dealer registered under section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o), “regulatory report” would mean the FOCUS Report. 111 For an
investment adviser, as such term is defined in section 202(a)(11) of the Investment
Advisers Act, and as discussed above, total consolidated assets would be determined by
the investment adviser’s total assets (exclusive of non-proprietary assets) shown on the
balance sheet for the adviser’s most recent fiscal year end. 112

111

17 CFR 240.17a-5(a); 17 CFR 249.617.
The proposed rule would not apply the concept of a regulatory report and the attendant
mechanics provided in section __.3 of the proposed rule to covered institutions that are
investment advisers because such institutions are not currently required to report the amount of
total consolidated assets to any Federal regulators in their capacities as investment advisers. See
proposed definition of “average total consolidated assets” for the proposed method by which an
investment adviser would determine its asset level for purposes of the proposed rule.
112

143

Vesting. Under the proposed rule, “vesting” of incentive-based compensation
means the transfer of ownership 113 of the incentive-based compensation to the covered
person to whom the incentive-based compensation was awarded, such that the covered
person’s right to the incentive-based compensation is no longer contingent on the
occurrence of any event. Amounts awarded under an incentive-based compensation
arrangement may vest immediately—for example, when the amounts are paid out to a
covered person immediately and are not subject to deferral and forfeiture. As explained
above, before amounts awarded to a covered person vest, the amounts could also be
deferred and at risk of forfeiture. After amounts awarded to a covered person vest, the
amounts could be subject to clawback, but they would not be at risk of forfeiture.
As described below in this Supplementary Information section, for incentivebased compensation to be counted toward the minimum deferral amount as discussed in
section ___.7(a) of the proposed rule, a sufficient amount of time must elapse between
the end of the performance period and the time when the deferred incentive-based
compensation vests (and is no longer subject to forfeiture). During that deferral period,
the award would be at risk of forfeiture.
If, after the award date, the covered institution had the right to require forfeiture
of the shares or units awarded, then the award would not be considered vested. If, after
the award date, the covered institution does not have the right to require forfeiture of the
shares or units awarded, then the award would be vested and therefore would not be able

113

Compensation awarded to a trust or other entity at the direction of, or for the benefit of, a
covered person would be treated as compensation awarded to that covered person. If incentivebased compensation awarded to the entity cannot be reduced by forfeiture, the amounts would be
treated as having vested at the time of the award.

144

to be counted toward the minimum deferral amount even if the shares or units have not
yet been transferred to the covered person. For example, a covered institution could
award an employee 100 shares of stock appreciation rights that pay out five years after
the award date. In other words, five years after the award date, the covered institution
will pay the employee the difference between the value of 100 shares of the covered
institution’s stock on the award date and the value of 100 shares of the covered
institution’s stock five years later. The amount the covered institution pays the employee
could vary based on the value of the institution’s shares. If the covered institution does
not have the right to adjust the number of shares of stock appreciation rights before the
payout, the stock appreciation rights would be considered vested as of the award date
(even if the amount paid out could vary based on the value of the institution’s shares). If,
however, the covered institution has the right to adjust the number of shares of stock
appreciation rights until payout to account for risk outcomes that occur after the award
date (for example, by reducing the number of shares of stock appreciation rights from
100 to 50 based on a failure to comply with the institution’s risk management policies),
the stock appreciation rights would not be considered vested until payout. Similarly,
amounts paid to a covered person pursuant to a dividend equivalent right would vest
when the number of dividend equivalent rights cannot be adjusted by the covered
institution on the basis of risk outcomes.
2.44.

The Agencies invite comment generally on the proposed rule’s definitions.

Relationship between defined terms.

145

The relationship between some of these defined terms can best be explained
chronologically. Under the proposed rule, a covered institution’s incentive-based
compensation timeline would be as follows:
•

Performance period. A covered person may have incentive-based compensation
targets based on performance measures that would apply during a performance
period. A covered person’s performance or the performance of the covered
institution during this period would influence the amount of incentive-based
compensation awarded to the covered person. Before incentive-based
compensation is awarded to a covered person, it should be subject to risk
adjustments to reflect actual losses, inappropriate risks taken, compliance
deficiencies, or other measures or aspects of financial and non-financial
performance, as described in section __.4(d) of the proposed rule. In addition, at
any time during the performance period, incentive-based compensation could be
subject to downward adjustment, as described in section __.7(b) of the proposed
rule.

•

Downward adjustment (if needed). Downward adjustment could occur at any
time during a performance period if a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution
conducts a forfeiture and downward adjustment review under section ___.7(b) of
the proposed rule and the Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution determines that
incentive-based compensation not yet awarded for the current performance period
should be reduced. In other words, downward adjustment applies to plans where
the performance period has not yet ended.

146

•

Award. At or near the end of a performance period, a covered institution would
evaluate the covered person’s or institution’s performance, taking into account
adjustments described in section __.4(d)(3) of the proposed rule, and determine
the amount of incentive-based compensation, if any, to be awarded to the covered
person for that performance period. At that time, the covered institution would
determine what portion of the incentive-based compensation that is awarded will
be deferred, as well as the vesting schedule for that deferred incentive-based
compensation. A Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution could reduce the amount
of incentive-based compensation payable to a senior executive officer or
significant risk-taker depending on the outcome of a forfeiture and downward
adjustment review, as described in section ___.7(b) of the proposed rule.

•

Deferral period. The deferral period for incentive-based compensation awarded
for a particular performance period would begin at the end of such performance
period, regardless of when a covered institution awards incentive-based
compensation to a covered person for that performance period. At any time
during a deferral period, a covered institution could require forfeiture of some or
all of the incentive-based compensation that has been awarded to the covered
person but has not yet vested.

•

Forfeiture (if needed). Forfeiture could occur at any time during the deferral
period (after incentive-based compensation has been awarded but before it vests).
A Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution could require forfeiture of unvested
deferred incentive-based compensation payable to a senior executive officer or
significant risk-taker based on the result of a forfeiture and downward adjustment
147

review, as described in section ___.7(b) of the proposed rule. Depending on the
outcome of a forfeiture and downward adjustment review under section ___.7(b)
of the proposed rule, a covered institution could reduce, or eliminate, the unvested
deferred incentive-based compensation of a senior executive officer or significant
risk-taker.
•

Vesting. Vesting could occur annually, on a pro rata basis, throughout a deferral
period. Vesting could also occur at a slower than pro rata schedule, such as
entirely at the end of a deferral period (vesting entirely at the end of a deferral
period is sometimes called “cliff vesting”). The deferral period for a particular
performance period would end when all incentive-based compensation awarded
for that performance period has vested. A covered institution may also evaluate
information that has arisen over the deferral period about financial losses,
inappropriate risks taken, compliance deficiencies, or other measures or aspects of
financial and non-financial performance of the covered person at the time of
vesting to determine if the amount that has been deferred should vest in full or
should be reduced through forfeiture.

•

Clawback (if needed). Clawback could be used to recover incentive-based
compensation that has already vested. Clawback could be used after a deferral
period has ended, and it also could be used to recover any portion of incentivebased compensation that vests before the end of a deferral period. A Level 1 or
Level 2 covered institution would be required to include clawback provisions in
incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive officers and
significant risk-takers, as described in section ___.7(c) of the proposed rule.
148

2.45.

Is the interplay of the award date, vesting date, performance period, and deferral

period clear? If not, why not?
2.46.

Have the Agencies made clear the distinction between the proposed definitions of

clawback, forfeiture, and downward adjustment? Do these definitions align with
current industry practice? If not, in what way do they differ and what are the
implications of such differences for both the operations of covered institutions and the
effective supervision of compensation practices?
§ ___.3

Applicability
Section ___.3 describes which provisions of the proposed rule would apply to an

institution that is subject to the proposed rule when an increase or decrease in average
total consolidated assets causes it to become a covered institution, transition to another
level, or no longer meet the definition of covered institution. This process may differ
somewhat depending on whether the institution is a subsidiary of, or affiliated with,
another covered institution.
As discussed above, for an institution that is not an investment adviser, average
total consolidated assets would be determined by reference to the average of the total
consolidated assets reported on regulatory reports for the four most recent consecutive
quarters. The Agencies are proposing this calculation method because it is also used to
calculate total consolidated assets for purposes of other rules that have $50 billion
thresholds, 114 and it is therefore expected to result in lower administrative burden on
some institutions – particularly when those institutions move from Level 3 to Level 2 – if
114

See, e.g., OCC’s Heightened Standards; 12 CFR 46.3; 12 CFR 225.8; 12 CFR 243.2; 12 CFR
252.30; 2 CFR 252.132; 12 CFR 325.202; 12 CFR 381.2.

149

the proposed rule requires total consolidated assets to be calculated in the same way as
existing rules.
As discussed above, average total consolidated assets for a covered institution that
is an investment adviser would be determined by the investment adviser’s total assets
(exclusive of non-proprietary assets) shown on the balance sheet for the adviser’s most
recent fiscal year end. The proposed rule would not apply the concept of a regulatory
report and the attendant mechanics provided in section __.3 of the proposed rule to
covered institutions that are investment advisers because such institutions are not
currently required to report the amount of total consolidated assets to any Federal
regulators in their capacities as investment advisers.
(a) When average total consolidated assets increase.
Section ___.3(a) of the proposed rule describes how the proposed rule would
apply to institutions that are subject to the proposed rule when average total consolidated
assets increase. It generally provides that an institution that is not a subsidiary of another
covered institution becomes a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered institution when its
average total consolidated assets increase to an amount that equals or exceeds $250
billion, $50 billion, or $1 billion, respectively. For subsidiaries of other covered
institutions, the Agencies would generally look to the average total consolidated assets of
the top-tier parent holding company to determine whether average total consolidated
assets have increased.
Given the unique characteristics of the different types of covered institutions
subject to each Agency’s proposed rule, each Agency’s proposed rule contains specific
language for subsidiaries that is consistent with the same general approach. For example,
150

under the Board’s proposed rule, a regulated institution would become a Level 1, Level 2,
or Level 3 covered institution when its average total consolidated assets or the average
total consolidated assets of any of its affiliates, equals or exceeds $250 billion, $50
billion, or $1 billion, respectively. Under the OCC’s proposed rule, a national bank that
is a subsidiary of a bank holding company would become a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3
covered institution when the top-tier bank holding company’s average total consolidated
assets equals or exceeds $250 billion, $50 billion, or $1 billion, respectively. Because the
Federal Home Loan Banks have no subsidiaries, and subsidiaries of the Enterprises are
included as affiliates as part of the definition of the Enterprises, FHFA’s proposed rule
does not include specific language to address subsidiaries. Because the NCUA’s rule
does not cover subsidiaries of credit unions and credit unions are not subsidiaries of other
types of institutions, NCUA’s proposed rule does not include specific language to address
subsidiaries. More detail on each Agency’s proposed approach to subsidiaries is
provided in the above discussion of definitions relating to covered institutions.
For covered institutions other than investment advisers and the Federal Home
Loan Banks, using a rolling average for asset size, rather than measuring asset size at a
single point in time, should minimize the frequency with which an institution may fall
into or out of a covered institution level. As explained above, if a covered institution has
fewer than four regulatory reports, the institution would be required to use the average of
its total consolidated assets from its existing regulatory reports for purposes of
determining average total consolidated assets. If a covered institution has a mix of two or
more different types of regulatory reports covering the relevant period, those would be
averaged for purposes of determining average total consolidated assets.

151

Section ___.3(a)(2) of the proposed rule provides a transition period for
institutions that were not previously considered covered institutions and for covered
institutions moving from a lower level to a higher level due to an increase in average total
consolidated assets. Such covered institutions would be required to comply with the
requirements for their new level not later than the first day of the first calendar quarter
that begins at least 540 days after the date on which they become Level 1, Level 2, or
Level 3 covered institutions. Prior to such date, the institutions would be required to
comply with the requirements of the proposed rule, if any, that were applicable to them
on the day before they became Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered institutions as a
result of the increase in assets. For example, if a Level 3 covered institution that is not a
subsidiary of a depository institution holding company has average total consolidated
assets that increase to more than $50 billion on December 31, 2015, then such institution
would become a Level 2 covered institution on December 31, 2015. However, the
institution would not be required to comply with the requirements of the proposed rule
that are applicable to a Level 2 covered institution until July 1, 2017. Prior to July 1,
2017, (the compliance date), the institution would remain subject to the requirements of
the proposed rule that are applicable to a Level 3 covered institution. The covered
institution’s controls, risk management, and corporate governance also would be required
to comply with the provisions of the proposed rule that are applicable to a Level 2
covered institution no later than July 1, 2017. The Agencies are proposing this delay
between the date when a covered institution’s average total consolidated assets increase
and the date when the covered institution becomes subject to the requirements related to

152

its new level to provide covered institutions with sufficient time to comply with the new
requirements.
The same general rule would apply to covered institutions that are subsidiaries
(or, in the case of the Board’s proposed rule, affiliates) of other covered institutions. For
example, a Level 3 state savings association that is a subsidiary of a Level 3 savings and
loan holding company, and a Level 3 subsidiary of that state savings association, would
become a Level 2 covered institution on December 31, 2015, if the average total
consolidated assets of the savings and loan holding company increased to more than $50
billion on December 31, 2015, and would not be required to comply with the
requirements of the proposed rule that are applicable to a Level 2 covered institution until
July 1, 2017.
Section ___.3(a)(3) of the proposed rule provides that incentive-based
compensation plans with performance periods that begin before the compliance date
described in section ___.3(a)(2) would not be required to comply with the requirements
of the proposed rule that become applicable to the covered institution on the compliance
date as a result of the change in its status as a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered
institution. Incentive-based compensation plans with a performance period that begins on
or after the compliance date described in section ___.3(a)(2) would be required to comply
with the rules for the covered institution’s new level. In the example described in the
previous paragraph, any incentive-based compensation plan with a performance period
that begins before July 1, 2017, would not be required to comply with the requirements of
the proposed rule that are applicable to a Level 2 covered institution (although any such

153

plan would be required to comply with the requirements of the proposed rule that are
applicable to a Level 3 covered institution).
The Agencies have included this grandfathering provision so that covered
institutions would not be required to modify incentive-based compensation plans that are
already in place when a covered institution’s average total consolidated assets increase
such that it moves to a higher level. However, incentive-based compensation plans with
performance periods that begin after the compliance date would be subject to the rules
that apply to the covered institution’s new level. In the previous example, any incentivebased compensation plan for a senior executive officer with a performance period that
begins on or after July 1, 2017, would be required to comply with the requirements of the
proposed rule that are applicable to a Level 2 covered institution, such as the deferral,
forfeiture, downward adjustment, and clawback requirements contained in section ___.7
of the proposed rule.
Because institutions that would be covered institutions under the proposed rule
commonly use long-term incentive plans with overlapping performance periods or
incentive-based compensation plans with performance periods of one year, the Agencies
do not anticipate that the grandfathering provision would unduly delay the application of
the proposed rule to individual incentive-based compensation arrangements.
3.1.The Agencies invite comment on whether a covered institution’s average total
consolidated assets (a rolling average) is appropriate for determining a covered
institution’s level when its total consolidated assets increase. Why or why not? Will
540 days provide covered institutions with adequate time to adjust incentive-based
compensation programs to comply with different requirements? If not, why not? In
154

the alternative, is 540 days too long to give covered institutions time to comply with
the requirements of the proposed rule? Why or why not?
3.2.The Agencies invite comment on whether the date described in section ___.3(a)(2)
should instead be the beginning of the first performance period that begins at least
365 days after the date on which the regulated institution becomes a Level 1, Level 2,
or Level 3 covered institution in order to have the date on which the proposed rule’s
corporate governance, policies, and procedures requirements begin coincide with the
date on which the requirements applicable to plans begin. Why or why not?
(b) When total consolidated assets decrease.
Section ___.3(b) of the proposed rule describes how the proposed rule would
apply to an institution when assets decrease. A covered institution (other than an
investment adviser) that is not a subsidiary of another covered institution would cease to
be a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered institution if its total consolidated assets, as
reported on its regulatory reports, fell below the relevant total consolidated assets
threshold for Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered institutions, respectively, for four
consecutive quarters. The calculation would be effective on the as-of date of the fourth
consecutive regulatory report. For example, a bank holding company that is a Level 2
covered institution with total consolidated assets of $55 billion on January 1, 2016, might
report total consolidated assets of $48 billion for the first quarter of 2016, $49 billion for
the second quarter of 2016, $49 billion for the third quarter of 2016, and $48 billion for
the fourth quarter of 2016. On the as-of date of the Y-9C submitted for the fourth quarter
of 2016, that bank holding company would become a Level 3 covered institution because
its total consolidated assets were less than $50 billion for four consecutive quarters. In
155

contrast, if that same bank holding company reported total consolidated assets of $48
billion for the first quarter of 2016, $49 billion for the second quarter of 2016, $49 billion
for the third quarter of 2016, and $51 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, it would still
be considered a Level 2 covered institution on the as-of date of the Y-9C submitted for
the fourth quarter of 2016 because it had total consolidated assets of less than $50 billion
for only 3 consecutive quarters. If the bank holding company had total consolidated
assets of $49 billion in the first quarter of 2017, it still would not become a Level 3
covered institution at that time because it would not have four consecutive quarters of
total consolidated assets of less than $50 billion. The bank holding company would only
become a Level 3 covered institution if it had four consecutive quarters with total
consolidated assets of less than $50 billion after the fourth quarter of 2016.
As with section ___.3(a), a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered institution that is
a subsidiary of another Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered institution would cease to be
a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered institution when the top-tier parent covered
institution ceases to be a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered institution. As with section
__.3(a), each Agency’s proposed rule takes a slightly different approach that is consistent
with the same general principle. For example, if a broker-dealer with less than $50
billion in average total consolidated assets is a Level 2 covered institution because its
parent bank holding company has more than $50 billion in average total consolidated
assets, the broker-dealer would become a Level 3 covered institution if its parent bank
holding company had less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets for four
consecutive quarters, thus causing the parent bank holding company itself to become a
Level 3 covered institution.

156

The proposed rule would not require any transition period when a decrease in a
covered institution’s total consolidated assets causes it to become a Level 2 or Level 3
covered institution or to no longer be a covered institution. The Agencies are not
proposing to include a transition period in this case because the new requirements would
be less stringent than the requirements that were applicable to the covered institution
before its total consolidated assets decreased, and therefore a transition period should be
unnecessary. Instead, the covered institution would immediately be subject to the
provisions of the proposed rule, if any, that are applicable to it as a result of the decrease
in its total consolidated assets. For example, if as a result of having four consecutive
regulatory reports with total consolidated assets less than $50 billion, a bank holding
company that was previously a Level 2 covered institution becomes a Level 3 covered
institution as of June 30, 2017, then as of June 30, 2017 that bank holding company
would no longer be subject to the requirements of the proposed rule that are applicable to
Level 2 covered institutions. It would instead be subject to the requirements of the
proposed rule that are applicable to Level 3 covered institutions.
A covered institution that is an investment adviser would cease to be a Level 1,
Level 2, or Level 3 covered institution effective as of the most recent fiscal year end in
which its total consolidated assets fell below the relevant asset threshold for Level 1,
Level 2, or Level 3 covered institutions, respectively. For example, an investment
adviser that is a Level 1 covered institution during 2015 would cease to be a Level 1
covered institution effective on December 31, 2015 if its total assets (exclusive of nonproprietary assets) shown on its balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2015
(assuming the investment adviser had a calendar fiscal year) were less than $250 billion.

157

3.3.The Agencies invite comment on whether four consecutive quarters is an appropriate
period for determining a covered institution’s level when its total consolidated assets
decrease. Why or why not?
3.4.Should the determination of total consolidated assets for covered institutions that are
investment advisers be by reference to a periodic report or similar concept? Why or
why not? Should there be a concept of a rolling average for asset size for covered
institutions that are investment advisers and, if so, how should this be structured?
3.5.Should the transition period for an institution that changes levels or becomes a
covered institution due to a merger or acquisition be different than an institution that
changes levels or becomes a covered institution without a change in corporate
structure? If so, why? If so, what transition period would be appropriate and why?
3.6.The Agencies invite comment on whether covered institutions transitioning from
Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 2 to Level 3 should be permitted to modify incentivebased compensation plans with performance periods that began prior to their
transition in level in such a way that would cause the plans not to meet the
requirements of the proposed rule that were applicable to the covered institution at the
time when the performance periods for the plans commenced. Why or why not?
(c) Compliance of covered institutions that are subsidiaries of covered
institutions.
Section __.3(c) of the Board’s, OCC’s, or FDIC’s proposed rules provide that a
covered institution that is subject to the Board’s, OCC’s, or FDIC’s proposed rule,
respectively, and that is a subsidiary of another covered institution may meet any

158

requirement of the proposed rule if the parent covered institution complies with such
requirement in a way that causes the relevant portion of the incentive-based
compensation program of the subsidiary covered institution to comply with the
requirement. The Board, the OCC, and the FDIC have included this provision in their
proposed rules in order to reduce the compliance burden on subsidiaries that would be
subject to the Board’s, OCC’s, and FDIC’s proposed rules and in recognition of the fact
that holding companies, national banks, Federal savings associations, state nonmember
banks, and state savings associations may perform certain functions on behalf of such
subsidiaries.
Subsidiary covered institutions subject to the Board’s, OCC’s, or FDIC’s
proposed rule could rely on this provision to comply with, for example, the corporate
governance or policies and procedures requirements of the proposed rule. For example,
if a parent bank holding company has a compensation committee that performs the
requirements of section __.4(e) of the proposed rule with respect to a subsidiary of the
parent bank holding company that is a covered institution under the Board’s rule by (1)
conducting oversight of the subsidiary’s incentive-based compensation program, (2)
approving incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive officers of
the subsidiary (including any individuals who are senior executive officers of the
subsidiary but not senior executive officers of the parent bank holding company), and (3)
approving any material exceptions or adjustments to incentive-based compensation
policies or arrangements for such senior executive officers of the subsidiary, then the
subsidiary would be deemed to have complied with the requirements of section __.4(e) of
the proposed rule. Similarly, under the OCC’s proposed rule, if an operating subsidiary

159

of a national bank that is a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution subject to the OCC’s
proposed rule uses the policies and procedures for its incentive-based compensation
program of its parent national bank that is also a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution
subject to the OCC’s proposed rule, and such policies and procedures satisfy the
requirements of section __.11 of the proposed rule, then the OCC would consider the
subsidiary to have satisfied section __.11 of the proposed rule. Under the FDIC’s
proposed rule, if a subsidiary of a state nonmember bank or state savings association that
is a covered institution subject to the FDIC’s proposed rule uses the policies and
procedures for its incentive-based compensation program of its parent state nonmember
bank or state savings association that is a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution subject to
the FDIC’s proposed rule, and such policies and procedures satisfy the requirements of
section __.11 of the proposed rule, then the FDIC would consider the subsidiary to have
satisfied section __.11 of the proposed rule.
Many parent holding companies, particularly larger banking organizations, design
and administer incentive-based compensation programs and associated policies and
procedures. Smaller covered institutions that operate within a larger holding company
structure may realize efficiencies by incorporating or relying upon their parent
company’s incentive-based compensation program or certain components of the program,
to the extent that the program or its components establish governance, risk management,
and recordkeeping frameworks that are appropriate to the smaller covered institutions and
support incentive-based compensation arrangements that appropriately balance risks to
the smaller covered institution and rewards for its covered persons. Therefore, it may be
less burdensome for covered institution subsidiaries with risk profiles that are similar to

160

those of their parent holding companies to use their parent holding companies’ program
rather than their own.
The Agencies recognize that the authority of each appropriate Federal regulator to
examine and review compliance with the proposed rule, along with requiring corrective
action when they deem appropriate, would not be affected by section __.3(c) of the
Board’s, OCC’s, or FDIC’s proposed rule. Each appropriate Federal regulator would be
responsible for examining, reviewing, and enforcing compliance with the proposed rule
by their covered institutions, including any that are owned or controlled by a depository
institution holding company. For example, in the situation where a parent holding
company controls a subsidiary national bank, state nonmember bank, or broker-dealer, it
would be expected that the board of directors of the subsidiary will ensure that the
subsidiary is in compliance with the proposed rule. Likewise, the board of directors of a
broker-dealer operating subsidiary of a national bank would be expected to ensure that
the broker-dealer operating subsidiary is in compliance with the proposed rule.
§ ___.4

Requirements and Prohibitions Applicable to All Covered Institutions
Section ___.4 sets forth the general requirements that would be applicable to all

covered institutions. Later sections establish more specific requirements that would be
applicable for Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions.
Under the proposed rule, all covered institutions would be prohibited from
establishing or maintaining incentive-based compensation arrangements, or any features
of any such arrangements, that encourage inappropriate risks by the covered institution
(1) by providing covered persons with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or (2)
that could lead to material financial loss to the covered institution. Section ___.4
161

includes considerations for determining whether an incentive-based compensation
arrangement provides excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, as required by section
956(a)(1). Section ___.4 also establishes requirements that would apply to all covered
institutions designed to prevent inappropriate risks that could lead to material financial
loss, as required by section 956(a)(2). 115 The general standards and requirements set
forth in sections ___.4(a), (b), and (c) of the proposed rule would be consistent with the
general standards and requirements set forth in sections ___.5(a) and (b) of the 2011
Proposed Rule.
The Agencies do not intend to establish a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach to the
design of incentive-based compensation arrangements. Thus, under the proposed rule,
the structure of incentive-based compensation arrangements at covered institutions would
be expected to reflect the proposed requirements set forth in section ___.4 of the
proposed rule in a manner tailored to the size, complexity, risk tolerance, and business
model of the covered institution. Subject to supervisory oversight, as applicable, each
covered institution would be responsible for ensuring that its incentive-based
compensation arrangements appropriately balance risk and reward. The methods by
which this is achieved at one covered institution may not be effective at another, in part
because of the importance of integrating incentive-based compensation arrangements and
practices into the covered institution’s own risk-management systems and business
model. The effectiveness of methods may differ across business lines and operating units
as well, so the proposed rule would provide for considerable flexibility in how individual
115

In addition to the requirements outlined in section __.4, Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions would have to meet additional requirements set forth in section __.5 and sections __.7
through __.11.

162

covered institutions approach the design and implementation of incentive-based
compensation arrangements that appropriately balance risk and reward.
(a) In general.
Section ___.4(a) of the proposed rule is derived from the text of section 956(b)
which requires the Agencies to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines that prohibit
any type of incentive-based payment arrangement, or any feature of any such
arrangement, that the Agencies determine encourages inappropriate risks by covered
institutions (1) by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal
shareholder of the covered institution with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or
(2) that could lead to material financial loss to the covered institution.
(b) Excessive compensation.
Section ___.4(b) of the proposed rule specifies that compensation, fees, and
benefits would be considered excessive for purposes of section __.4(a)(1) when amounts
paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the value of the services performed by a
covered person, taking into account all relevant factors. Section 956(c) directs the
Agencies to “ensure that any standards for compensation established under subsections
(a) or (b) are comparable to the standards established under section [39] of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 2 [sic] 1831p-1) for insured depository institutions.”
Under the proposed rule, the factors for determining whether an incentive-based
compensation arrangement provides excessive compensation would be comparable to the
Federal Banking Agency Safety and Soundness Guidelines that implement the

163

requirements of section 39 of the FDIA. 116 The proposed factors would include: (1) the
combined value of all compensation, fees, or benefits provided to the covered person;
(2) the compensation history of the covered person and other individuals with comparable
expertise at the covered institution; (3) the financial condition of the covered institution;
(4) compensation practices at comparable covered institutions, based upon such factors as
asset size, geographic location, and the complexity of the covered institution’s operations
and assets; (5) for post-employment benefits, the projected total cost and benefit to the
covered institution; and (6) any connection between the covered person and any
fraudulent act or omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, or insider abuse with regard
to the covered institution. The inclusion of these factors is consistent with the
requirement under section 956(c) that any standards for compensation under section
956(a) or (b) must be comparable to the standards established for insured depository
institutions under the FDIA and that the Agencies must take into consideration the
compensation standards described in section 39(c) of the FDIA.

116

The Federal Banking Agency Safety and Soundness Guidelines provide:
Compensation shall be considered excessive when amounts paid are unreasonable or
disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or
principal shareholder, considering the following:
1. The combined value of all cash and non-cash benefits provided to the individual;
2. The compensation history of the individual and other individuals with comparable
expertise at the institution;
3. The financial condition of the institution;
4. Comparable compensation practices at comparable institutions, based upon such
factors as asset size, geographic location, and the complexity of the loan portfolio or
other assets;
5. For postemployment benefits, the projected total cost and benefit to the institution;
6. Any connection between the individual and any fraudulent act or omission, breach of
trust or fiduciary duty, or insider abuse with regard to the institution; and
7. Any other factors the Agencies determines to be relevant.
See 12 CFR part 30, Appendix A, III.A; 12 CFR part 364, Appendix A, III.A; 12 CFR part 208,
Appendix D-1. These factors are drawn directly from section 39(c)(2) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C.
1831p-1(c)(2)).

164

In response to similar language in the 2011 Proposed Rule, some commenters
indicated that this list of factors should include additional factors or allow covered
institutions to consider other factors that they deem appropriate. The proposed rule
clarifies that all relevant factors would be taken into consideration, and that the list of
factors in section __.4(b) would not be exclusive.
Commenters on the 2011 Proposed Rule expressed concern that it would be
difficult for some types of institutions, such as grandfathered unitary savings and loan
holding companies with retail operations, mutual savings associations, mutual savings
banks, and mutual holding companies, to identify comparable covered institutions. Those
commenters also expressed concern that it would be difficult for these institutions to
identify the compensation practices of comparable institutions that are not public
companies or that do not otherwise make public information about their compensation
practices. The Agencies intend to work closely with these institutions to identify
comparable institutions to help ensure compliance with the proposed rule.
(c) Material financial loss.
Section 956(b)(2) of the Act requires the Agencies to adopt regulations or
guidelines that prohibit any type of incentive-based payment arrangement, or any feature
of any such arrangement, that the Agencies determine encourages inappropriate risks by a
covered financial institution that could lead to material financial loss to the covered
institution. In adopting such regulations or guidelines, the Agencies are required to
ensure that any standards established under this provision of section 956 are comparable
to the standards under Section 39 of the FDIA, including the compensation standards.
However, section 39 of the FDIA does not include standards for determining whether
165

compensation arrangements may encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to material
financial loss. 117 Accordingly, as in the 2011 Proposed Rule, the Agencies have
considered the language and purpose of section 956, existing supervisory guidance that
addresses incentive-based compensation arrangements that may encourage inappropriate
risk-taking, 118 the FSB Principles and Implementation Standards, and other relevant
material in considering how to implement this aspect of section 956.
A commenter argued that the provisions of the 2011 Proposed Rule relating to
incentive-based compensation arrangements that could encourage inappropriate risks that
could lead to material financial loss were not comparable to the standards established
under section 39 of the FDIA. More specifically, the commenter believed that the
requirements of the 2011 Proposed Rule, including the mandatory deferral requirement,
were more “detailed and prescriptive” than the standards established under section 39 of
the FDIA.
The Agencies intend that the requirements of the proposed rule implementing
section 956(b)(2) of the Act would be comparable to the standards established under
section 39 of the FDIA. Section 956(b)(2) of the Act requires that the Agencies prohibit
incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by
covered institutions that could lead to material financial loss, a requirement that is not
discussed in the standards established under section 39 of the FDIA, which, as discussed
above, provide guidelines to determine when compensation paid to a particular executive
117

Section 39 of the FDIA requires only that the Federal banking agencies prohibit as an unsafe
and unsound practice any employment contract, compensation or benefit agreement, fee
arrangement, perquisite, stock option plan, postemployment benefit, or other compensatory
arrangement that could lead to a material financial loss. See 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1(c)(1)(B). The
Federal Banking Agency Safety and Soundness Guidelines satisfy this requirement.

2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance.

166

officer, employee, director or principal shareholder would be excessive. In enacting
section 956, Congress referred specifically to the standards established under section 39
of the FDIA, and was presumably aware that in the statute there were no such standards
articulated that provide guidance for determining whether compensation arrangements
could lead to a material financial loss. The provisions of the proposed rule implementing
section 956(b)(2) reflect the Agencies’ intent to comply with the statutory mandate under
section 956, while ensuring that the proposed rule is comparable to section 39 of the
FDIA, which states that compensatory arrangements that could lead to a material
financial loss are an unsafe and unsound practice.
Section ___.4(c) of the proposed rule sets forth minimum requirements for
incentive-based compensation arrangements that would be permissible under the
proposed rule, because arrangements without these attributes could encourage
inappropriate risks that could lead to material financial loss to a covered institution.
These requirements reflect the three principles for sound incentive-based compensation
policies contained in the 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance: (1) balanced risktaking incentives; (2) compatibility with effective risk management and controls; and
(3) effective corporate governance. 119 Similarly, section __.4(c) of the proposed rule
provides that an incentive-based compensation arrangement at a covered institution could
encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to material financial loss to the covered
institution, unless the arrangement: (1) appropriately balances risk and reward; (2) is
compatible with effective risk management and controls; and (3) is supported by effective
governance.
119

See 75 FR 36407-36413.

167

An example of a feature that could encourage inappropriate risks that could lead
to material financial loss would be the use of performance measures that are closely tied
to short-term revenue or profit of business generated by a covered person, without any
adjustments for the longer-term risks associated with the business generated. Similarly, if
there is no mechanism for factoring risk outcomes over a longer period of time into
compensation decisions, traders who have incentive-based compensation plans with
performance periods that end at the end of the calendar year, could have an incentive to
take large risks towards the end of the calendar year to either make up for
underperformance earlier in the performance period or to maximize their year-end profits.
The same result could ensue if the performance measures themselves are poorly designed
or can be manipulated inappropriately by the covered persons receiving incentive-based
compensation.
Incentive-based compensation arrangements typically attempt to encourage
actions that result in greater revenue or profit for a covered institution. However, shortrun revenue or profit can often diverge sharply from actual long-run profit because risk
outcomes may become clear only over time. Activities that carry higher risk typically
have the potential to yield higher short-term revenue, and a covered person who is given
incentives to increase short-term revenue or profit, without regard to risk, would likely be
attracted to opportunities to expose the covered institution to more risk that could lead to
material financial loss.
Section ___.4(c)(1) of the proposed rule would require all covered institutions to
ensure that incentive-based compensation arrangements appropriately balance risk and
reward. Incentive-based compensation arrangements achieve balance between risk and
168

financial reward when the amount of incentive-based compensation ultimately received
by a covered person depends not only on the covered person’s performance, but also on
the risks taken in achieving this performance. Conversely, an incentive-based
compensation arrangement that provides financial reward to a covered person without
regard to the amount and type of risk produced by the covered person’s activities would
not be considered to appropriately balance risk and reward under the proposed rule. 120
Incentive-based compensation arrangements should balance risk and financial rewards in
a manner that does not encourage covered persons to expose a covered institution to
inappropriate risk that could lead to material financial loss.
The incentives provided by an arrangement depend on how all features of the
arrangement work together. For instance, how performance measures are combined,
whether they take into account both current and future risks, which criteria govern the use
of risk adjustment before the awarding and vesting of incentive-based compensation, and
what form incentive-based compensation takes (i.e., equity-based vehicles or cash-based
vehicles) can all affect risk-taking incentives and generally should be considered when
covered institutions create such arrangements.
The 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance outlined four methods that can be
used to make compensation more sensitive to risk—risk adjustments of awards, deferral
of payment, longer performance periods, and reduced sensitivity to short-term

120

For example, a covered person who makes a high-risk loan may generate more revenue in the
short run than one who makes a low-risk loan. Incentive-based compensation arrangements that
reward covered persons solely on the basis of short-term revenue might pay more to the covered
person taking more risk, thereby incentivizing employees to take more, and sometimes
inappropriate, risk. See 2011 FRB Report at 11.

performance. 121 Consistent with the 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance, under the
proposed rule, an incentive-based compensation arrangement generally would have to
take account of the full range of current and potential risks that a covered person’s
activities could pose for a covered institution. Relevant risks would vary based on the
type of covered institution, but could include credit, market (including interest rate and
price), liquidity, operational, legal, strategic, and compliance risks. Performance and risk
measures generally should align with the broader risk management objectives of the
covered institution and could be incorporated through use of a formula or through the
exercise of judgment. Performance and risk measures also may play a role in setting
amounts of incentive-based compensation pools (bonus pools), in allocating pools to
individuals’ incentive-based compensation, or both. The effectiveness of different types
of adjustments varies with the situation of the covered person and the covered institution,
as well as the thoroughness with which the measures are implemented.
The analysis and methods for ensuring that incentive-based compensation
arrangements appropriately balance risk and reward should also be tailored to the size,
complexity, business strategy, and risk tolerance of each institution. The manner in
which a covered institution seeks to balance risk and reward in incentive-based
compensation arrangements should account for the differences between covered
persons—including the differences between senior executive officers and significant risktakers and other covered persons. Activities and risks may vary significantly both among
covered institutions and among covered persons within a particular covered institution.
For example, activities, risks, and incentive-based compensation practices may differ
121

See 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance, 75 FR at 36396.

170

materially among covered institutions based on, among other things, the scope or
complexity of activities conducted and the business strategies pursued by the institutions.
These differences mean that methods for achieving incentive-based compensation
arrangements that appropriately balance risk and reward at one institution may not be
effective in restraining incentives to engage in imprudent risk-taking at another
institution.
The proposed rule would require that incentive-based compensation arrangements
contain certain features. Section ___.4(d) sets out specific requirements that would be
applicable to arrangements for all covered persons at all covered institutions and that are
intended to result in incentive-based compensation arrangements that appropriately
balance risk and reward. Sections ___.7 and ___.8 of the proposed rule provide more
specific requirements that would be applicable to arrangements at Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions.
While the proposed rule would require incentive-based compensation
arrangements for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and
Level 2 covered institutions to have certain features (such as a certain percentage of the
award deferred), those features alone would not be sufficient to balance risk-taking
incentives with reward. The extent to which additional balancing methods are required
would vary with the size and complexity of a covered institution and with the nature of a
covered person’s activities.
Section __.4(c)(2) of the proposed rule provides that an incentive-based
compensation arrangement at a covered institution would encourage inappropriate risks
that could lead to material financial loss to the covered institution unless the arrangement
171

is compatible with effective risk management and controls. A covered institution’s risk
management processes and internal controls would have to reinforce and support the
development and maintenance of incentive-based compensation arrangements that
appropriately balance risk and reward required under section __.4(c)(1) of the proposed
rule.
One of the reasons risk management is important is that covered persons may
seek to evade the processes established by a covered institution to achieve incentivebased compensation arrangements that appropriately balance risk and reward in an effort
to increase their own incentive-based compensation. For example, a covered person
might seek to influence the risk measures or other information or judgments that are used
to make the covered person’s incentive-based compensation sensitive to risk. Such
actions may significantly weaken the effectiveness of a covered institution’s incentivebased compensation arrangements in restricting inappropriate risk-taking and could have
a particularly damaging effect if they result in the manipulation of measures of risk,
information, or judgments that the covered institution uses for other risk-management,
internal control, or financial purposes. In such cases, the covered person’s actions may
weaken not only the balance of the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation
arrangements but also the risk-management, internal controls, and other functions that are
supposed to act as a separate check on risk-taking.
All covered institutions would have to have appropriate controls surrounding the
design, implementation, and monitoring of incentive-based compensation arrangements
to ensure that processes for achieving incentive-based compensation arrangements that
appropriately balance risk and reward are followed, and to maintain the integrity of their
172

risk-management and other control functions. The nature of controls likely would vary
by size and complexity of the covered institution as well as the activities of the covered
person. For example, under the proposed rule, controls surrounding incentive-based
compensation arrangements at smaller covered institutions likely would be less extensive
and less formalized than at larger covered institutions. Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions would be more likely to have a systematic approach to designing and
implementing their incentive-based compensation arrangements, and their incentivebased compensation programs would more likely be supported by formalized and welldeveloped policies, procedures, and systems. Level 3 covered institutions, on the other
hand, might maintain less extensive and detailed incentive-based compensation
programs. Section ___.9 of the proposed rule provides additional, specific requirements
that would be applicable to Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions designed to result in
incentive-based compensation arrangements at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions
that are compatible with effective risk management and controls.
Incentive-based compensation arrangements also would have to be supported by
an effective governance framework. Section ___.4(e) sets forth more detail on
requirements for boards of directors of all covered institutions that would be designed to
result in incentive-based compensation arrangements that are supported by effective
governance, while section ___.10 of the proposed rule provides more specific
requirements that would be applicable to Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions.
The proposed requirement for effective governance is an important foundation of
incentive-based compensation arrangements that appropriately balance risk and reward.
The involvement of the board of directors in oversight of the covered institution’s overall
173

incentive-based compensation program should be scaled appropriately to the scope of the
covered institution’s incentive-based compensation arrangements and the number of
covered persons who have incentive-based compensation arrangements.
(d) Performance measures.
The performance measures used in an incentive-based compensation arrangement
have an important effect on the incentives provided to covered persons and thus affect the
potential for the incentive-based compensation arrangement to encourage inappropriate
risk-taking that could lead to material financial loss. Under section __.4(d) of the
proposed rule, an incentive-based compensation arrangement would not be considered to
appropriately balance risk and reward unless: (1) it includes financial and non-financial
measures of performance that are relevant to a covered person’s role and to the type of
business in which the covered person is engaged and that are appropriately weighted to
reflect risk-taking; (2) it is designed to allow non-financial measures of performance to
override financial measures when appropriate; and (3) any amounts to be awarded under
the arrangement are subject to adjustment to reflect actual losses, inappropriate risks
taken, compliance deficiencies, or other measures or aspects of financial and nonfinancial performance. Each of these requirements is described more fully below.
First, the arrangements would be required to include both financial and nonfinancial measures of performance. Financial measures of performance generally are
measures tied to the attainment of strategic financial objectives of the covered institution,
or one of its operating units, or to the contributions by covered persons towards
attainment of such objectives, such as measures related to corporate sales, profit, or
revenue targets. Non-financial measures of performance, on the other hand, could be
174

assessments of a covered person’s risk-taking or compliance with limits on risk-taking.
These may include assessments of compliance with the covered institution’s policies and
procedures, adherence to the covered institution’s risk framework and conduct standards,
or compliance with applicable laws. These financial and non-financial measures of
performance should include considerations of risk-taking, and be relevant to a covered
person’s role within the covered institution and to the type of business in which the
covered person is engaged. They also should be appropriately weighted to reflect the
nature of such risk-taking. The requirement to include both financial and non-financial
measures of performance would apply to forms of incentive-based compensation that set
out performance measure goals and related amounts near the beginning of a performance
period (such as long-term incentive plans) and to forms that do not necessarily specify
performance measure goals and related amounts in advance of performance (such as
certain bonuses). For example, a senior executive officer may have his or her
performance evaluated based upon quantitative financial measures, such as return on
equity, and on qualitative, non-financial measures, such as the extent to which the senior
executive officer promoted sound risk management practices or provided strategic
leadership through a difficult merger. The senior executive officer’s performance also
may be evaluated on several qualitative non-financial measures that in some instances
span multiple calendar and performance years.
Incentive-based compensation should support prudent risk-taking, but should also
allow covered institutions to hold covered persons accountable for inappropriate
behavior. Reliable quantitative measures of risk and risk outcomes, where available, may
be particularly useful in both developing incentive-based compensation arrangements that

175

appropriately balance risk and reward and assessing the extent to which incentive-based
compensation arrangements properly balance risk and reward. However, reliable
quantitative measures may not be available for all types of risk or for all activities, and in
many cases may not be sufficient to fully assess the risks that the activities of covered
persons may pose to covered institutions. Poor performance, as assessed by non-financial
measures such as quality of risk management, could pose significant risks for the covered
institution and may itself be a source of potential material financial loss at a covered
institution. For this reason, non-financial performance measures play an important role in
reinforcing expectations on appropriate risk, control, and compliance standards and
should form a significant part of the performance assessment process.
Under certain circumstances, it may be appropriate for non-financial performance
measures, which are the primary measures that relate to risk-taking behavior, to override
considerations of financial performance measures. An override might be appropriate
when, for example, a covered person conducts trades or other transactions that increase
the covered institution’s profit but that create an inappropriate compliance risk for the
covered institution. In such a case, an incentive-based compensation arrangement should
allow for the possibility that the non-financial measure of compliance risk could override
the financial measure of profit when the amount of incentive-based compensation to be
awarded to the covered person is determined.
The effective balance of risks and rewards may involve the use of both formulaic
arrangements and discretion. At most covered institutions, management retains a
significant amount of discretion when awarding incentive-based compensation. Although
the use of discretion has the ability to reinforce risk balancing, when improperly utilized,
176

discretionary decisions can undermine the goal of incentive-based compensation
arrangements to appropriately balance risk and reward. For example, an incentive-based
compensation arrangement that has a longer performance period that could allow risk
events to manifest and for awards to be adjusted to reflect risk could be less effective if
management makes a discretionary award decision that does not account for, or mitigates,
the future impact of those risk events. 122
Section __.4(d)(3) of the proposed rule would also require that any amounts to be
awarded under an incentive-based compensation arrangement be subject to adjustment to
reflect actual losses, inappropriate risks taken, compliance deficiencies, or other measures
or aspects of financial and non-financial performance. It is important that incentivebased compensation arrangements be balanced in design and implemented so that awards
and actual amounts that vest actually vary based on risks or risk outcomes. If, for
example, covered persons are awarded or paid substantially all of their potential
incentive-based compensation even when they cause a covered institution to take a risk
that is inappropriate given the institution’s size, nature of operations, or risk profile, or
cause the covered institution to fail to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, then
covered persons will have less incentive to avoid activities with substantial risk of
financial loss or non-compliance with legal or regulatory obligations.
(e) Board of directors.
Under section __.4(e) of the proposed rule, the board of directors, or a committee
thereof, would be required to: (1) conduct oversight of the covered institution’s incentive122

For Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions, section ___.11 of the proposed rule would
require policies and procedures that address the institution’s use of discretion.

177

based compensation program; (2) approve incentive-based compensation arrangements
for senior executive officers, including the amounts of all awards and, at the time of
vesting, payouts under such arrangements; and (3) approve any material exceptions or
adjustments to incentive-based compensation policies or arrangements for senior
executive officers.
Section __.4(e)(1) of the proposed rule would require the board of directors, or a
committee thereof, of a covered institution to conduct oversight of the covered
institution’s incentive-based compensation program. Such oversight generally should
include overall goals and purposes. For example, boards of directors, or a committee
thereof, of covered institutions generally should oversee senior management in the
development of an incentive-based compensation program that incentivizes behaviors
consistent with the long-term health of the covered institution, and provide sufficient
detail to enable senior management to translate the incentive-based compensation
program into objectives, plans, and arrangements for each line of business and control
function. Such oversight also generally should include holding senior management
accountable for effectively executing the covered institution’s incentive-based
compensation program and for communicating expectations regarding acceptable
behaviors and business practices to covered persons. Boards of directors should actively
engage with senior management, including challenging senior management’s incentivebased compensation assessments and recommendations when warranted.
In addition to the general program oversight requirement set forth in section
__.4(e)(1) of the proposed rule, a board of directors, or a committee thereof, would also
be required by sections __.4(e)(2) and __.4(e)(3) to approve incentive-based
178

compensation arrangements for senior executive officers, including the amounts of all
awards and payouts, at the time of vesting, under such arrangements, and to approve any
material exceptions or adjustments to those arrangements.
Although risk-adjusting incentive-based compensation for senior executive
officers responsible for the covered institution’s overall risk posture and performance
may be challenging given that quantitative measures of institution-wide risk are difficult
to produce and allocating responsibility among the senior executive team for achieving
risk objectives can be a complex task, the role of senior executive officers in managing
the overall risk-taking activities of an institution is important. Accordingly the proposed
rule would require the board of directors, or a committee thereof, to approve
compensation arrangements involving senior executive officers. When a board of
directors, or a committee thereof, is considering an award or a payout, it should consider
risks to ensure that the award or payout is consistent with broader risk management and
strategic objectives.
(f) Disclosure and Recordkeeping Requirements and (g) Rule of Construction.
Section ___.4(f) of the proposed rule would establish disclosure and
recordkeeping requirements for all covered institutions, as required by section
956(a)(1). 123 Under the proposed rule, each covered institution would be required to
create and maintain records that document the structure of all of the institution’s
incentive-based compensation arrangements and demonstrate compliance with the
proposed rule, and to disclose these records to the appropriate Federal regulator upon

123

12 U.S.C. 5641(a)(1).

179

request. The proposed rule would require covered institutions to create such records on
an annual basis and to maintain such records for at least seven years after they are
created. The Agencies recognize that the exact timing for recordkeeping will vary from
institution to institution, but this requirement would ensure that covered institutions
create such records for their incentive-based compensation arrangements at least once
every 12 months. The requirement to maintain records for at least seven years generally
aligns with the clawback period described in section __.7(c) of the proposed rule.
The proposed rule would require that the records maintained by a covered
institution, at a minimum, include copies of all incentive-based compensation plans, a list
of who is subject to each plan, and a description of how the covered institution’s
incentive-based compensation program is compatible with effective risk management and
controls. These records would be the minimum required information to determine
whether the structure of the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation
arrangements provide covered persons with excessive compensation or could lead to
material financial loss to the covered institution. As specified in section 956(a)(2) and
section ___.4(g) of the proposed rule, a covered institution would not be required to
report the actual amount of compensation, fees, or benefits of individual covered persons
as part of this requirement. 124

124

The Agencies note that covered institutions may be required to report actual compensation
under other provisions of law. For example, corporate credit unions must disclose compensation
of certain executive officers to their natural person credit union members under NCUA’s
corporate credit union rule. 12 CFR 704.19. The proposed rule would not affect the
requirements in 12 CFR 704.19 or in any other reporting provision under any other law or
regulation.
The SEC requires an issuer that is subject to the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)) to disclose information regarding

180

The 2011 Proposed Rule would have implemented section 956(a)(1) by requiring
all covered financial institutions to submit an annual report to their appropriate Federal
regulator, in a format specified by their appropriate Federal regulator, that described in
narrative form the structure of the covered financial institution’s incentive-based
compensation arrangements for covered persons and the policies governing such
arrangements. 125 Some commenters on the 2011 Proposed Rule favored annual reporting
requirements, while other commenters opposed any requirement for institutions to make
periodic submissions of information about incentive-based compensation arrangements to
regulators, noting concerns about burden, particularly for smaller covered financial
institutions. A few commenters requested an annual certification requirement instead of
a reporting requirement. While there is value in receiving reports, the burden of
producing them would potentially be great on smaller covered institutions. Accordingly,
the Agencies determined not to include a requirement for covered institutions to submit
annual narrative reports.
Given the variety of covered institutions and asset sizes, the Agencies are not
proposing a specific format or template for the records that must be maintained by all
covered institutions. According to the Agencies’ supervisory experience, as discussed
further above, many covered institutions already maintain information about their

the compensation of its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and three other
most highly compensated executive officers, as well as its directors, in the issuer’s proxy
statement, its annual report on Form 10-K, and registration statements for offerings of securities.
The requirements are generally found in Item 402 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.402).
125
See 2011 Proposed Rule, at 21177. The 2011 Proposed Rule also would have set forth
additional more detailed requirements for covered financial institutions with total consolidated
assets of $50 billion or more.

181

incentive-based compensation programs comparable to the types of information
described above (e.g., in support of public company filings).
Several commenters on the 2011 Proposed Rule expressed concern regarding the
confidentiality of the reported compensation information. In light of the nature of the
information that would be provided to the Agencies under section ___.4(f) of the
proposed rule, and the purposes for which the Agencies are requiring the information, the
Agencies would view the information disclosed to the Agencies as nonpublic and expect
to maintain the confidentiality of that information, to the extent permitted by law. 126
When providing information to one of the Agencies pursuant to the proposed rule,
covered institutions should request confidential treatment by that Agency.
4.1. The Agencies invite comment on the requirements for performance measures contained
in section __.4(d) of the proposed rule. Are these measures sufficiently tailored to
allow for incentive-based compensation arrangements to appropriately balance risk and
reward? If not, why?
4.2. The Agencies invite comment on whether the terms “financial measures of
performance” and “non-financial measures of performance” should be defined. If so,
what should be included in the defined terms?

126

For example, Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) provides an
exemption for “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and
privileged or confidential.” 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). FOIA Exemption 6 provides an exemption for
information about individuals in “personnel and medical files and similar files” when the
disclosure of such information “would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy.” 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6). FOIA Exemption 8 provides an exemption for matters that are
“contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of,
or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.”
5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8).

182

4.3. Would preparation of annual records be appropriate or should another method be used?
Would covered institutions find a more specific list of topics and quantitative
information for the content of required records helpful? Should covered institutions be
required to maintain an inventory of all such records and to maintain such records in a
particular format? If so, why? How would such specific requirements increase or
decrease burden?
4.4. Should covered institutions only be required to create new records when incentivebased compensation arrangements or policies change? Should the records be updated
more frequently, such as promptly upon a material change? What should be considered
a “material change”?
4.5. Is seven years a sufficient time to maintain the records required under section ___.4(f)
of the proposed rule? Why or why not?
4.6. Do covered institutions generally maintain records on incentive-based compensation
arrangements and programs? If so, what types of records and related information are
maintained and in what format? What are the legal or institutional policy requirements
for maintaining such records?
4.7. For covered institutions that are investment advisers or broker-dealers, is there
particular information that would assist the SEC in administering the proposed rule?
For example, should the SEC require its reporting entities to report whether they utilize
incentive-based compensation or whether they are Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 covered
institutions?

183

§ ___.5

Additional Disclosure and Recordkeeping Requirements for Level 1

and Level 2 Covered Institutions.
Section ___.5 of the proposed rule would establish additional and more detailed
recordkeeping requirements for Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions.
Under section ___.5(a) of the proposed rule, a Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institution would be required to create annually, and maintain for at least seven years,
records that document: (1) its senior executive officers and significant risk-takers listed
by legal entity, job function, organizational hierarchy, and line of business; (2) the
incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive officers and significant
risk-takers, including information on percentage of incentive-based compensation
deferred and form of award; (3) any forfeiture and downward adjustment or clawback
reviews and decisions for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers; and (4) any
material changes to the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation arrangements
and policies.
The proposed recordkeeping and disclosure requirements at Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions would assist the appropriate Federal regulator in monitoring whether
incentive-based compensation structures, and any changes to such structures, could result
in Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions maintaining incentive-based compensation
structures that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation, fees,
or benefits or could lead to material financial loss. The more detailed reporting
requirement for Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions under section ___.5(a) of the
proposed rule reflects the information that would assist the appropriate Federal regulator
in most effectively evaluating the covered institution’s compliance with the proposed rule
184

and identifying areas of potential concern with respect to the structure of the covered
institution’s incentive-based compensation arrangements.
For example, the recordkeeping requirement in section ___.5(a)(2) of the
proposed rule regarding amounts of incentive-based compensation deferred and the form
of payment of incentive-based compensation for senior executive officers and significant
risk-takers would help Federal regulators determine compliance with the requirement in
section ___.7(a) of the proposed rule for certain amounts of incentive-based
compensation of senior executive officers and significant risk-takers to be deferred for
specific periods of time. Similarly, the recordkeeping requirement in section ___.5(a)(3)
of the proposed rule would require Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions to document
the rationale for decisions under forfeiture and downward adjustment reviews and to keep
timely and accurate records of the decision. This documentation would provide
information useful to Federal regulators for determining compliance with the
requirements in sections___.7(b) and (c) of the proposed rule regarding specific forfeiture
and clawback policies at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions that are further
discussed below.
The proposed recordkeeping requirements in section ___.5(a) of the proposed rule
relate to the proposed substantive requirements in section ___.7 of the proposed rule and
would help the appropriate Federal regulator to closely monitor incentive-based
compensation payments to senior executive officers and significant risk-takers and to
determine whether those payments have been adjusted to reflect risk outcomes. This
approach also would be responsive to comments received on the 2011 Proposed Rule

185

suggesting that specific qualitative and quantitative information, instead of a narrative
description, be the basis of a reporting requirement for larger covered institutions.
Section ___.5(b) of the proposed rule would require a Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institution to create and maintain records sufficient to allow for an independent audit of
incentive-based compensation arrangements, policies, and procedures, including those
required under section __.11 of the proposed rule. A standard which reflects the level of
detail required in order to perform an independent audit of incentive-based compensation
would be appropriate given the importance of regular monitoring of incentive-based
compensation programs by independent control functions. Such a standard also would be
consistent with the monitoring requirements set out in section ___.11 of the proposed
rule.
As with the requirements applicable to all covered institutions under section
___.4(f) of the proposed rule, the Agencies are not proposing to require that a Level 1 or
Level 2 covered institution annually file a report with the appropriate Federal regulator.
Instead, section ___.5(c) of the proposed rule would require a Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institution to disclose its records to the appropriate Federal regulator in such form and
with such frequency as requested by the appropriate Federal regulator. The required form
and frequency of recordkeeping may vary among the Agencies and across categories of
covered institutions, although the records described in section ___.5(a) of the proposed
rule, along with any other records a covered institution creates to satisfy the requirements
of section ___.5(f) of the proposed rule, would be required to be created at least annually.
Some Agencies may require Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions to provide their
records on an annual basis, alone or with a standardized form of report. Level 1 and
186

Level 2 covered institutions should seek guidance concerning the reporting requirement
from their appropriate Federal regulator.
Generally, the Agencies would expect the volume and detail of information
disclosed by a covered institution under section ___.5 of the proposed rule to be tailored
to the nature and complexity of business activities at the covered institution, and to the
scope and nature of its use of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The Agencies
recognize that smaller covered institutions with less complex and less extensive
incentive-based compensation arrangements likely would not create or retain records that
are as extensive as those that larger covered institutions with relatively complex programs
and business activities would likely create. The tailored recordkeeping and disclosure
provisions for Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions in the proposed rule are designed
to provide the Agencies with streamlined and well-focused records that would allow the
Agencies to promptly and effectively identify and address any areas of concern.
Similar to the provision of information under section ___.4(f) of the proposed
rule, the Agencies expect to treat the information provided to the Agencies under section
__.5 of the proposed rule as nonpublic and to maintain the confidentiality of that
information to the extent permitted by law. 127 When providing information to one of the
Agencies pursuant to the proposed rule, covered institutions should request confidential
treatment by that Agency.

127

See supra note 126.

187

5.1. Should the level of detail in records created and maintained by Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions vary among institutions regulated by different Agencies? If so,
how? Or would it be helpful to use a template with a standardized information list?
5.2. In addition to the proposed records, what types of information should Level 1 and
Level 2 covered institutions be required to create and maintain related to deferral and to
forfeiture, downward adjustment, and clawback reviews?
§ ___.6

Reservation of Authority for Level 3 Covered Institutions.

Section ___.6 of the proposed rule would allow the appropriate Federal regulator to
require certain Level 3 covered institutions to comply with some or all of the more
rigorous requirements applicable to Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions.
Specifically, an Agency would be able to require a covered institution with average total
consolidated assets greater than or equal to $10 billion and less than $50 billion to
comply with some or all of the more rigorous provisions of section ___.5 and
sections___.7 through___.11 of the proposed rule, if the appropriate Federal regulator
determined that the covered institution’s complexity of operations or compensation
practices are consistent with those of a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution, based on
the covered institution’s activities, complexity of operations, risk profile, or
compensation practices. In such cases, the Agency that is the Level 3 covered
institution’s appropriate Federal regulator, in accordance with procedures established by
the Agency, would notify the institution in writing that it must satisfy the requirements
and other standards contained in section ___.5 and sections___.7 through___.11 of the
proposed rule. As with the designation of significant risk-takers discussed above, each
Agency’s procedures generally would include reasonable advance written notice of the
188

proposed action, including a description of the basis for the proposed action, and
opportunity for the covered institution to respond.
As noted previously, the Agencies have determined that it may be appropriate to
apply only basic prohibitions and disclosure requirements to Level 3 covered institutions,
in part because these institutions generally have less complex operations, incentive-based
compensation practices, and risk profiles than Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions.128
However, the Agencies recognize that there is a wide spectrum of business models and
risk profiles within the $10 to $50 billion range and believe that some Level 3 covered
institutions with between $10 and $50 billion in total consolidated assets may have
incentive-based compensation practices and operational complexity comparable to those
of a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution. In such cases, it may be appropriate for the
Agencies to provide a process for determining that such institutions should be held to the
more rigorous standards.
The Agencies are proposing $10 billion as the appropriate threshold for the low end
of this range based upon the general complexity of covered institutions above this size.
The threshold is also used in other statutory and regulatory requirements. For example,
the stress testing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require banking organizations with
total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to conduct annual stress tests. 129 For
deposit insurance assessment purposes, the FDIC distinguishes between small and large

Level 2, and Level 3 covered institutions.

189

banks based on a $10 billion asset size. 130 For supervisory purposes, the Board defines
community banks by reference to the $10 billion asset size threshold. 131
The Agencies would consider the activities, complexity of operations, risk profile,
and compensation practices to determine whether a Level 3 covered institution’s
operations or compensation practices warrant application of additional standards pursuant
to the proposed rule. For example, a Level 3 covered institution could have significant
levels of off-balance sheet activities, such as derivatives that may entail complexities of
operations and greater risk than balance sheet measures would indicate, making the
institution’s risk profile more akin to that of a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution.
Additionally, a Level 3 covered institution might be involved in particular high-risk
business lines, such as lending to distressed borrowers or investing or trading in illiquid
assets, and make significant use of incentive-based compensation to reward risk-takers.
Still other Level 3 covered institutions might have or be part of a complex organizational
structure, such as operating with multiple legal entities in multiple foreign jurisdictions.
Section ___.6 of the proposed rule would permit the appropriate Federal regulator
of a Level 3 covered institution with total consolidated assets of between $10 and $50
billion to require the institution to comply with some or all of the provisions of section
___.5 and sections___.7 through___.11 of the proposed rule. This approach would allow
the Agencies to take a flexible approach in the proposed rule provisions applicable to all
Level 3 covered institutions while retaining authority to apply more rigorous standards
where the Agencies determine appropriate based on the Level 3 covered institution’s
130

See 12 CFR 327.8(e) and (f).

complexity of operations or compensation practices. The Agencies expect they only
would use this authority on an infrequent basis. This approach has been used in other
rules for purposes of tailoring the application of requirements and providing flexibility to
accommodate the variations in size, complexity, and overall risk profile of financial
institutions.132
6.1. The Agencies invite general comment on the reservation of authority in section
___.6 of the proposed rule.
6.2. The Agencies based the $10 billion dollar floor of the reservation of authority on
existing similar reservations of authority that have been drawn at that level. Did the
Agencies set the correct threshold or should the floor be set lower or higher than $10
billion? If so, at what level and why?
6.3. Are there certain provisions in section ___.5 and sections___.7 through___.11 of
the proposed rule that would not be appropriate to apply to a covered institution with
total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more and less than $50 billion regardless of
its complexity of operations or compensation practices? If so, which provisions and
why?

132

For example, the OCC, FDIC, and Board’s domestic capital rules include a reservation of
authority whereby the agency may require an institution to hold an amount of regulatory capital
greater than otherwise required under the capital rules. 12 CFR 3.1(d) (OCC); 12 CFR
324.1(d)(1) through (6) (FDIC); 12 CFR 217.1(d) (Board). The OCC, FDIC, and the Board’s
Liquidity Coverage Ratio rule includes a reservation of authority whereby each agency may
impose heightened standards on an institution. 12 CFR 50.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 329.2 (FDIC); 12
CFR 249.2 (Board). The FDIC’s stress testing rules include a reservation of authority to require a
$10 billion to $50 billion covered bank to use reporting templates for larger banks. 12 CFR
325.201.

191

6.4. The Agencies invite comment on the types of notice and response procedures the
Agencies should use in determining that the reservation of authority should be used.
The SEC invites comment on whether notice and response procedures based on the
procedures for a proceeding initiated upon the SEC’s own motion under Advisers Act
rule 0-5 would be appropriate for this purpose.
6.5. What specific features of incentive-based compensation programs or arrangements
at a Level 3 covered institution should the Agencies consider in determining such
institution should comply with some or all of the more rigorous requirements within the
rule and why? What process should be followed in removing such institution from the
more rigorous requirements?
§ ___.7

Deferral, Forfeiture and Downward Adjustment, and Clawback

Requirements for Level 1 and Level 2 Covered Institutions
As discussed above, allowing covered institutions time to measure results with the
benefit of hindsight allows for a more accurate assessment of the consequences of risks to
which the institution has been exposed. This approach may be particularly relevant, for
example, where performance is difficult to measure because performance results and
risks take time to observe (e.g., assessing the future repayment prospects of loans written
during the current year).
In order to achieve incentive-based compensation arrangements that appropriately
balance risk and reward, including closer alignment between the interests of senior
executive officers and significant risk-takers within the covered institution and the
longer-term interests of the covered institution itself, it is important for information on
performance, including information on misconduct and inappropriate risk-taking, to
192

affect the incentive-based compensation amounts received by covered persons. Covered
institutions may use deferral, forfeiture and downward adjustment, and clawback to
address information about performance that comes to light after the conclusion of the
performance period, so that incentive-based compensation arrangements are able to
appropriately balance risk and reward. Section ___.7 of the proposed rule would require
Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions to incorporate these tools into the incentivebased compensation arrangements of senior executive officers and significant risk-takers.
Under the proposed rule, an incentive-based compensation arrangement at a
Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution would not be considered to appropriately balance
risk and reward, as would be required by section ___.4(c)(1), unless the deferral,
forfeiture, downward adjustment, and clawback requirements of section ___.7 are met.
These requirements would apply to incentive-based compensation arrangements provided
to senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions. Institutions may, of course, take additional steps to address risks that may
mature after the performance period.
The requirements of section ___.7 of the proposed rule would apply to Level 1
and Level 2 covered institutions; that is, to covered institutions with $50 billion or more
in average total consolidated assets. The requirements of section ___.7 would not be
applicable to Level 3 covered institutions. 133 As discussed above, the Agencies recognize

133

As explained earlier in this Supplementary Information section, the appropriate Federal
regulator of a Level 3 covered institution with average total consolidated assets greater than or
equal to $10 billion and less than $50 billion may require the covered institution to comply with
some or all of the provisions of section __.5 and sections __.7 through __.11 of the proposed rule
if the Agency determines that the complexity of operations or compensation practices of the
Level 3 covered institution are consistent with those of a Level 1 or 2 covered institution.

193

that larger covered institutions have more complex business activities and generally rely
more on incentive-based compensation programs, and, therefore, it is appropriate to
impose specific deferral, forfeiture and downward adjustment reviews and clawback
requirements on these institutions. It has been recognized that larger financial institutions
can present greater potential systemic risks. The Board, for example, has expressed the
view that institutions with more than $250 billion in total consolidated assets are more
likely than other institutions to pose systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. 134 Because
of these risks that could be created by excessive risk-taking at the largest covered
institutions, additional safeguards are needed against inappropriate risk-taking at Level 1
covered institutions. For these reasons, the Agencies are proposing a required minimum
deferral percentage and a required minimum deferral period for Level 1 covered
institutions that are greater than those for Level 2 covered institutions.
The requirements of section ___.7 of the proposed rule would apply to incentivebased compensation arrangements for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers
of Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions. The decisions of senior executive officers
can have a significant impact on the entire consolidated organization and often involve
substantial strategic or other risks that can be difficult to measure and model—
particularly at larger covered institutions— during or at the end of the performance
period, and therefore can be difficult to address adequately by risk adjustments in the

awarding of incentive-based compensation. 135 Supervisory experience and a review of
the academic literature 136 suggest that incentive-based compensation arrangements for
the most senior decision-makers and risk-takers at the largest institutions appropriately
balance risk and reward when a significant portion of the incentive-based compensation
awarded under those arrangements is deferred for an adequate amount of time.
As discussed above, in addition to the institution’s senior executive officers, the
significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions may have the ability to
expose the institution to the risk of material financial loss. In order to help ensure that the
incentive-based compensation arrangements for these individuals appropriately balance
risk and reward and do not encourage them to engage in inappropriate risk-taking that
could lead to material financial loss, the proposed rule would extend the deferral
requirement to significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions.
Deferral for significant risk-takers as well as executive officers helps protect against
material financial loss at the largest covered institutions.
§__.7(a) Deferral.
As a tool to balance risk and reward, deferral generally consists of four
components: the proportion of incentive-based compensation required to be deferred, the
time horizon of the deferral, the speed at which deferred incentive-based compensation
135

This premise was identified in the 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance, 75 FR at 36409,
and was highlighted in the 2011 FRB White Paper. The report reiterated the recommendation
that “[a] substantial fraction of incentive compensation awards should be deferred for senior
executives of the firm because other methods of balancing risk taking incentives are less likely to
be effective by themselves for such individuals.” 2011 FRB White Paper, at 15.

vests, and adjustment during the deferral period to reflect risks or inappropriate conduct
that manifest over that period of time.
Section ___.7(a) of the proposed rule would require Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions, at a minimum, to defer the vesting of a certain portion of all incentive-based
compensation awarded (the deferral amount) to a senior executive officer or significant
risk-taker for at least a specified period of time (the deferral period). The minimum
required deferral amount and minimum required deferral period would be determined by
the size of the covered institution, by whether the covered person is a senior executive
officer or significant risk-taker, and by whether the incentive-based compensation was
awarded under a long-term incentive plan or is qualifying incentive-based compensation.
Minimum required deferral amounts range from 40 percent to 60 percent of the total
incentive-based compensation award, and minimum required deferral periods range from
one year to four years, as detailed below.
Deferred incentive-based compensation of senior executive officers and
significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions would also be required
to meet the following other requirements:
•

Vesting of deferred amounts may occur no faster than on a pro rata annual basis
beginning on the one-year anniversary of the end of the performance period;

•

Unvested deferred amounts may not be increased during the deferral period;

•

For most Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions, substantial portions of deferred
incentive-based compensation must be paid in the form of both equity-like
instruments and deferred cash;

196

•

Vesting of unvested deferred amounts may not be accelerated except in the case
of death or disability; 137 and

•

All unvested deferred amounts must be placed at risk of forfeiture and subject to a
forfeiture and downward adjustment review pursuant to section ___.7(b).
Except for the prohibition against accelerated vesting, the prohibitions and

requirements in section ___.7(a) of the proposed rule would apply to all unvested
deferred incentive-based compensation, regardless of whether the deferral of the
incentive-based compensation was necessary to meet the requirements of the proposed
rule. For example, if a covered institution chooses to defer incentive-based compensation
above the amount required to be deferred under the rule, the additional amount would be
required to be subject to forfeiture. In another example, if a covered institution would be
required to defer a portion of a particular covered person’s incentive-based compensation
for four years, but chooses to defer that compensation for ten years, the deferral would be
subject to forfeiture during the entire ten-year deferral period. Applying the requirements
and prohibitions of section ___.7(a) to all unvested deferred incentive-based
compensation is intended to maximize the balancing effect of deferred incentive-based
compensation, to make administration of the requirements and prohibitions easier for
covered institutions, and to facilitate the Agencies’ supervision for compliance.

137

For covered persons at credit unions, NCUA’s rule also permits acceleration of payment if the
covered person must pay income taxes on the entire amount of an award, including deferred
amounts, at the time of award.

197

Compensation that is not incentive-based compensation and is deferred only for
tax purposes would not be considered “deferred incentive-based compensation” for
purposes of the proposed rule.
§__.7(a)(1) and §__.7(a)(2) Minimum deferral amounts and deferral periods for
qualifying incentive-based compensation and incentive-based compensation
awarded under a long-term incentive plan.
The proposed rule would require a Level 1 covered institution to defer at least 60
percent of each senior executive officer’s qualifying incentive-based compensation 138 for
at least four years, and at least 60 percent of each senior executive officer’s incentivebased compensation awarded under a long-term incentive plan for at least two years
beyond the end of that plan’s performance period. A Level 1 covered institution would
be required to defer at least 50 percent of each significant risk-taker’s qualifying
incentive-based compensation for at least four years, and at least 50 percent of each
significant risk-taker’s incentive-based compensation awarded under a long-term
incentive plan for at least two years beyond the end of that plan’s performance period.
Similarly, the proposed rule would require a Level 2 covered institution to defer at
least 50 percent of each senior executive officer’s qualifying incentive-based
compensation for at least three years, and at least 50 percent of each senior executive
officer’s incentive-based compensation awarded under a long-term incentive plan for at
least one year beyond the end of that plan’s performance period. A Level 2 covered

138

As described above, incentive-based compensation that is not awarded under a long-term
incentive plan would be defined as qualifying incentive-based compensation under the proposed
rule.

198

institution would be required to defer at least 40 percent of each significant risk-taker’s
qualifying incentive-based compensation for at least three years, and at least 40 percent
of each significant risk-taker’s incentive-based compensation awarded under a long-term
incentive plan for at least one year beyond the end of that plan’s performance period.
In practice, a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution typically evaluates the
performance of a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker during and after the
performance period. As the performance period comes to a close, the covered institution
determines an amount of incentive-based compensation to award the covered person for
that performance period. Senior executive officers and significant risk-takers may be
awarded incentive-based compensation at a given time under multiple incentive-based
compensation plans that have performance periods that come to a close at that time.
Although they end at the same time, those performance periods may have differing
lengths, and therefore may not completely overlap. For example, long-term incentive
plans, which have a minimum performance period of three years, would consider
performance in at least two years prior to the year the performance period ends, while
annual incentive plans would only consider performance in the year of the performance
period.
For purposes of determining the amount of incentive-based compensation that
would be required to be deferred and the actual amount that would be deferred, a Level 1
or Level 2 covered institution generally should use the present value of the incentivebased compensation at the time of the award. In determining the value of awards for this

199

purpose, Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions generally should use reasonable
valuation methods consistent with methods used in other contexts. 139
Pro rata vesting.
The requirements of this section would permit the covered institution to
immediately pay, or allow to vest, all of the incentive-based compensation that is
awarded that is not required to be deferred. All incentive-based compensation that is
deferred would be subject to a deferral period that begins only once the performance
period comes to a close. During this deferral period, indications of inappropriate risktaking may arise, leading the covered institution to consider whether the covered person
should not be paid the entire amount originally awarded.
The incentive-based compensation that would be required by the rule to be
deferred would not be permitted to vest faster than on a pro rata annual basis beginning
no earlier than the first anniversary of the end of the performance period for which the
compensation was awarded. In other words, a covered institution would be allowed to
make deferred incentive-based compensation eligible for vesting during the deferral
period on a schedule that paid out equal amounts on each anniversary of the end of the
relevant performance period. A covered institution would also be permitted to make
different amounts eligible for vesting each year, so long as the cumulative total of the
deferred incentive-based compensation that has been made eligible for vesting on each
anniversary of the end of the performance period is not greater than the cumulative total

139

See, e.g., Topic 718 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (formerly FAS 123(R);
Black-Scholes method for valuing options.

200

that would have been eligible for vesting had the covered institution made equal amounts
eligible for vesting each year.
For example, if a Level 1 covered institution is required to defer $100,000 of a
senior executive officer’s incentive-based compensation for four years, the covered
institution could choose to make $25,000 available for vesting on each anniversary of the
end of the performance period for which the $100,000 was awarded. The Level 1
covered institution could also choose to make different amounts available for vesting at
different times during the deferral period, as long as: the total amount that is made
eligible for vesting on the first anniversary is not more than $25,000; the total amount
that has been made eligible for vesting by the second anniversary is not more than
$50,000; and the total amount that has been made eligible for vesting by the third
anniversary is not more than $75,000. In this example, the Level 1 covered institution
would be permitted to make eligible for vesting $10,000 on the first anniversary, $30,000
on the second anniversary (bringing the total for the first and second anniversaries to
$40,000), $30,000 on the third anniversary (bringing the total for the first, second, and
third anniversaries to $70,000), and $30,000 on the fourth anniversary.
A Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution should consider the vesting schedule at
the time of the award, and the present value at time of award of each form of incentivebased compensation, for the purposes of determining compliance with this requirement.
Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions generally should use reasonable valuation
methods consistent with methods used in other contexts in valuing awards for purposes of
this rule.

201

This approach would provide a covered institution with some flexibility in
administering its specific deferral program. For example, a covered institution would be
permitted to make the full deferred amount of incentive-based compensation awarded for
any given year eligible for vesting in a lump sum at the conclusion of the deferral period
(i.e., “cliff vesting”). Alternatively, a covered institution would be permitted to make
deferred amounts eligible for vesting in equal increments at the end of each year of the
deferral period. Except in the case of acceleration allowed in sections ___.7(a)(1)(iii)(B)
and ___.7(a)(2)(iii)(B), the proposed rule does not allow for vesting of amounts required
to be deferred (1) faster than on a pro rata annual basis; or (2) beginning earlier than the
first anniversary of the award date.
The Agencies recognize that some or all of the incentive-based compensation
awarded to a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker may be forfeited before it
vests. For an example of how these requirements would work in practice, please see
Appendix A of this Supplementary Information section.
This restriction is intended to prevent covered institutions from defeating the
purpose of the deferral requirement by allowing vesting of most of the required deferral
amounts immediately after the award date. In addition, the proposed approach aligns
with both what the Agencies understand is common practice in the industry and with the
requirements of many foreign supervisors.
Acceleration of payments.
The Agencies propose that the acceleration of vesting and subsequent payment of
incentive-based compensation that is required to be deferred under this proposed rule
generally be prohibited for covered persons at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions.
202

This restriction would apply to all deferred incentive-based compensation required to be
deferred under the proposed rule, whether it was awarded as qualifying incentive-based
compensation or under a long-term incentive plan. This prohibition on acceleration
would not apply to compensation that the employee or the employer elects to defer in
excess of the amounts required under the proposed rule or for time periods that exceed
the required deferral periods or in certain other limited circumstances, such as the death
or disability of the covered person.
NCUA’s proposed rule would permit acceleration of payment if covered persons
at credit unions were subject to income taxes on the entire amount of an incentive-based
compensation award even before deferred amounts vest. Incentive-based compensation
for executives of not-for-profit entities is subject to income taxation under a different
provision of the Internal Revenue Code 140 than that applicable to executives of other
covered institutions. The result is that credit union executives’ incentive-based
compensation awards may be subject to immediate taxation on the entire award, even
deferred amounts. 141 The ability to accelerate payment would be a limited exception only
applicable to income tax liability and would only apply to the extent credit union
executives must pay income tax on unvested amounts during the deferral period. Also,
any amounts advanced to pay income tax liabilities for deferrals must be taken in
proportion to the vesting schedule. For example, a credit union executive may have
deferrals of $200,000 for each of three years ($600,000 total) and a total tax liability of

140

26 U.S.C. 457(f).
The Agencies understand that the taxation of unvested deferred awards of covered persons at
other covered institutions is based on other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. See, e.g., 26
U.S.C. 409A.
141

203

$240,000 for the deferred amount of an award. The advanced tax payments would result
in an annual reduction of $80,000 per deferred payment, resulting in a new vesting
amount of $120,000 for each year of the deferral period.
Many institutions currently allow for accelerated vesting in the case of death or
disability. Some current incentive-based compensation arrangements, such as separation
agreements, between covered persons and covered institutions provide for accelerated
vesting and payment of deferred incentive-based compensation that has not yet vested
upon the occurrence of certain events. 142 Many institutions also currently provide for the
accelerated vesting of deferred incentive-based compensation awarded to their senior
executive officers, particularly compensation awarded in the form of equity, in
connection with a change in control of the company 143 (sometimes as part of a “golden
parachute”). Shareholder proxy firms and some institutional investors have raised
concerns about such golden parachutes, 144 and golden parachutes are restricted by law
under certain circumstances, including if an institution is in troubled condition. 145
142

Several commenters argued that the 2011 Proposed Rule’s deferral requirements should not
apply upon the death, disability, retirement, or acceptance of government employment of covered
persons, or a change in control of the covered institution, effectively arguing for the ability of
covered institutions to accelerate incentive-based compensation under these circumstances.
143
See, e.g., Equilar, “Change-in-Control Equity Acceleration Triggers” (March 19, 2014),
available at http://www.equilar.com/reports/8-change-in-control-equity-acceleration-triggers.html
(Noting that although neither Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) nor Glass Lewis state that a
single trigger plan will automatically result in an “against” recommendation, both make it clear
that they view the single versus double trigger issue as an important factor in making their
decisions. ISS, in particular, suggests in its policies that double trigger vesting of equity awards
is currently the best market practice).

204

Finally, in current incentive-based compensation arrangements, events triggering
acceleration commonly include leaving the employment of a covered institution for a new
position (either any new position or only certain new positions, such as employment at a
government agency), an acquisition or change in control of the covered institution, or
upon the death or disability of the employee. 146
The Federal Banking Agencies have found that the acceleration of deferred
incentive-based compensation to covered persons is generally inappropriate because it
weakens the balancing effect of deferral and eliminates the opportunity for forfeiture
during the deferral period as information concerning risks taken during the performance
period becomes known. The acceleration of vesting and payment of deferred incentivebased compensation in other circumstances, such as when the covered person voluntarily
leaves the institution, could also provide covered persons with an incentive to retire or
leave a covered institution if the covered person is aware of risks posed by the covered
person’s activities that are not yet apparent to or fully understood by the covered
institution. Acceleration of payment could skew the balance of risk-taking incentives
provided to the covered person if the circumstances under which acceleration is allowed
are within the covered person’s control. The proposed rule would prohibit acceleration of
deferred compensation that is required to be deferred under this proposed rule in most
circumstances given the potential to undermine risk balancing mechanisms.

146

See, e.g., 2012 James F. Reda & Associates, “Study of Executive Termination Provisions
Among Top 200 Public Companies (December 2012), available at www.jfreda.com; Equilar,
“Change-in-Control Equity Acceleration Triggers” (March 19, 2014), available at
http://www.equilar.com/reports/8-change-in-control-equity-acceleration-triggers.html.

205

In contrast, the circumstances under which the Agencies would allow acceleration
of payment, namely death or disability of the covered person, generally are not subject to
the covered person’s control, and, therefore, are less likely to alter the balance of risktaking incentives provided to the covered person. In other cases where acceleration is
permitted, effective governance and careful assessment of potential risks, as well as
specific facts and circumstances are necessary in order to protect against creating
precedents that could undermine more generally the risk balancing effects of deferral.
Therefore, the Agencies have proposed to permit only these limited exceptions.
Under the proposed rule, the prohibition on acceleration except in cases of death
or disability would apply only to deferred amounts that are required by the proposed rule
so as not to discourage additional deferral, or affect institutions that opt to defer
incentive-based compensation exceeding the requirements. For example, if an institution
defers compensation until retirement as a retention tool, but the institution then merges
into another company and ceases to exist, retention may not be a priority. Thus,
acceleration would be permitted for any deferred incentive-based compensation amounts
above the amount required to be deferred or that was deferred longer than the minimum
deferral period to allow those amounts to be paid out closer in time to the merger.
Similarly, the acceleration of payment NCUA’s rule permits if a covered person
of a credit union faces up-front income tax liability on the deferred amounts of an award
is not an event subject to the covered person’s control. This exception will not apply
unless the covered person is actually subject to income taxes on deferred amounts for
which the covered person has not yet received payment, and equalizes the effect of
deferral for covered persons at credit unions and covered persons at most other covered
206

institutions. This limited exception is not intended to alter the balance of risk-taking
incentives.
Qualifying incentive-based compensation and incentive-based compensation awarded
under a long-term incentive plan
The minimum required deferral amounts would be calculated separately for
qualifying incentive-based compensation and incentive-based compensation awarded
under a long-term incentive plan, and those amounts would be required to be deferred for
different periods of time. For the purposes of calculating qualifying incentive-based
compensation awarded for any performance period, a covered institution would aggregate
incentive-based compensation awarded under any incentive-based compensation plan that
is not a long-term incentive plan. The required deferral percentage (40, 50, or 60 percent)
would be multiplied by that total amount to determine the minimum deferral amount. In
a given year, if a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker is awarded qualifying
incentive-based compensation under multiple plans that have the same performance
period (which is less than three years), the award under each plan would not be required
to meet the minimum deferral requirement, so long as the total amount that is deferred
from all of the amounts awarded under those plans meets the minimum required
percentage of total qualifying incentive-based compensation relevant to that covered
person.
For example, under the proposal, a significant risk-taker at a Level 2 covered
institution might be awarded $60,000 under a plan with a one-year performance period
that applies to all employees in her line of business and $40,000 under a plan with a oneyear performance period that applies to all employees of the covered institution. For that
207

performance period, the significant risk-taker has been awarded a total of $100,000 in
qualifying incentive-based compensation, so she would be required to defer a total of
$40,000. The covered institution could defer amounts awarded under either plan or under
both plans, so long as the total amount deferred was at least $40,000. For example, the
covered institution could choose to defer $20,000 from the first plan and $20,000 from
the second plan. The covered institution could also choose to defer nothing awarded
under the first plan and the entire $40,000 awarded under the second plan.
For a full example of how these requirements would work in the context of a
more complete incentive-based compensation arrangement, please see Appendix A of
this preamble.
In contrast, the minimum required deferral percentage would apply to all
incentive-based compensation awarded under each long-term incentive plan separately.
In a given year, if a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker is awarded incentivebased compensation under multiple long-term incentive plans that have performance
periods of three years or more, each award under each plan would be required to meet the
minimum deferral requirement. 147 Based on supervisory experience, the Federal Banking
Agencies have found that it would be extremely rare for a covered person to be awarded
incentive-based compensation under multiple long-term incentive plans in one year.

147

For example, if a Level 1 covered institution awarded a senior executive officer $100,000
under one long-term incentive plan and $200,000 under another long-term incentive-plan, the
covered institution would be required to defer at least $60,000 of the amount awarded under the
first long-term incentive plan and at least $120,000 of the amount awarded under the second longterm incentive plan. The Level 1 covered institution would not be permitted to meet the deferral
requirements by deferring, for example, $10,000 awarded under the first long-term incentive plan
and $170,000 awarded under the second long-term incentive plan.

208

The proposed rule would require deferral for the same percentage of qualifying
incentive-based compensation as of incentive-based compensation awarded under a longterm incentive plan. However, the proposed rule would require that deferred qualifying
incentive-based compensation meet a longer minimum deferral period than deferred
incentive-based compensation awarded under a long-term incentive plan. As with the
shorter performance period for qualifying incentive-based compensation, the period over
which performance is measured under a long-term incentive plan is not considered part of
the deferral period.
Under the proposed rule, both deferred qualifying incentive-based compensation
and deferred incentive-based compensation awarded under a long-term incentive plan
would be required to meet the vesting requirements separately. In other words, deferred
qualifying incentive-based compensation would not be permitted to vest faster than on a
on a pro rata annual basis, even if deferred incentive-based compensation awarded under
a long-term incentive plan vested on a slower than pro rata basis. Each deferred portion
is bound by the pro rata requirement.
For an example of how these requirements would work in practice, please see
Appendix A of this Supplementary Information section.
Incentive-based compensation provides an inducement for a covered person at a
covered institution to advance the strategic goals and interests of the covered institution
while enabling the covered person to share in the success of the covered institution.
Incentive-based compensation may also encourage covered persons to take undesirable or
inappropriate risks, or to sell unsuitable products in the hope of generating more profit
and thereby increasing the amount of incentive-based compensation received. Covered
209

persons may also be tempted to manipulate performance results in an attempt to make
performance measurements look better or to understate the actual risks such activities
impose on the covered institution’s balance sheet. 148 Incentive-based compensation
should therefore also provide incentives for prudent risk-taking in the long term and for
sound risk management.
Deferral of incentive-based compensation awards involves a delay in the vesting
and payout of an award to a covered person beyond the end of the performance period.
The deferral period allows for amounts of incentive-based compensation to be adjusted
for actual losses to the covered institution or for other aspects of performance that
become clear during the deferral period before those amounts vest or are paid. These
aspects include inappropriate risk-taking and misconduct on the part of the covered
person. More generally, deferral periods that lengthen the time between the award of
incentive-based compensation and vesting, combined with forfeiture, are important tools
for aligning the interests of risk-takers with the longer-term interests of covered
institutions.149 Deferral periods that are sufficiently long to allow for a substantial

148

For example, towards the end of the performance period, covered persons who have not yet
met the target performance measures could be tempted to amplify risk taking or take other actions
to meet those targets and receive the maximum incentive-based compensation. Without deferral,
there would be no additional review applied to the risk-taking activities that were taken during the
defined performance period to achieve those target performance measures.
149
There have been a number of academic papers that argue that deferred compensation provides
incentives for executives to consider the long-term health of the firm. For example, Eaton and
Rosen (1983) note that delaying compensation is a way of bonding executives to the firm and
providing incentives for them to focus on long-term performance of the firm. See Eaton and
Rosen, “Agency, Delayed Compensation, and the Structure of Executive Remuneration,” 38
Journal of Finance 1489, at 1489-1505; see also Park and Sturman, “How and What You Pay
Matters: The Relative Effectiveness of Merit Pay, Bonus, and Long-Term Incentives on Future
Job Performance” (2012), available at

portion of the risks from the covered person’s activities to manifest are likely to be most
effective in ensuring that risks and rewards are adequately balanced. 150
Deferral periods allow covered institutions an opportunity to more accurately
judge the nature and scale of risks imposed on covered institutions’ balance sheets by a
covered person’s performance for which incentive-based compensation has been
awarded, and to better understand and identify risks that result from such activities as
they are realized. These include risks imposed by inappropriate risk-taking or
misconduct, and risks that may manifest as a result of lapses in risk management or risk
oversight. For example, the risks associated with some business lines, such as certain
types of lending, may require many years before they materialize.
Though it is difficult to set deferral periods that perfectly match the time it takes
risks undertaken by the covered persons of covered institutions to become known, longer
periods allow more time for incentive-based compensation to be adjusted between the
time of award and the time incentive-based compensation vests. 151 At the same time,

150

The length of the deferral period has been a topic of discussion in the literature. Edmans
(2012) argues that deferral periods of two to three years are too short. He also argues that
deferral should be longer for institutions where the decisions of the executives have long-term
consequences. Bebchuk et al (2010) argue that deferral provisions alone will not prevent
executives from putting emphasis on short-term prices because executives that have been in place
for many years will have the opportunity to regularly cash out. They argue that executives should
be required to hold a substantial number of shares and options until retirement. See also Edmans,

Some empirical literature has found a link between the deferral of compensation and firm
value, firm performance, risk, and the manipulation of earnings. Gopalan et al (2014) measure

211

deferral periods that are inordinately long may reduce the effectiveness of incentivebased compensation arrangements because employees more heavily discount the
potential impact of such arrangements. Thus, it is important to strike a reasonable
balance between providing effective incentives and allowing sufficient time to validate
performance measures over a reasonable period of deferral. The specific deferral periods
and amounts proposed in the proposed rule are also consistent with current practice at
many institutions that would be Level 1 or Level 2 covered institutions, and with
compensation requirements in other countries. 152 In drafting the requirements in sections
___.7(a)(1) and ___.7(a)(2), the Agencies took into account the comments received
regarding similar requirements in the 2011 Proposed Rule. 153

the duration of executive compensation by accounting for the vesting schedules in compensation.
They argue that the measure is a proxy for the executives’ horizon. They find that longer
duration of compensation is present at less risky institutions and institutions with better past stock
performance. They also find that longer duration is associated with less manipulation of earnings.
Chi and Johnson (2009) find that longer vesting periods for stocks and options are related to
higher firm value. See Gopalan, Radhakrishnan, Milbourn, Song and Thakor, “Duration of
Executive Compensation,” 59 The Journal of Finance 2777 (2014); Chi, Jianxin, and Johnson,

153
Commenters on the 2011 Proposed Rule expressed differing views on the proposed deferral
requirements and the deferral-related questions posed by the Agencies. For example, some
commenters expressed the view that the deferral requirements for incentive-based compensation
awards for executive officers were appropriate. Some commenters argued that deferral would
create a longer-term focus for executives and help to ensure they are not compensated on the
basis of short-term returns that fail to account for long-term risks. Many commenters also argued
that the deferral requirements should be strengthened by extending the required minimum deferral
period or minimum percentage of incentive compensation deferred. For example, these
commenters urged the Agencies to require a five-year deferral period, instead of the three-year
period that was proposed, or to disallow “pro rata” payments within the proposed three-year
deferral period. These commenters also expressed the view that the Agencies’ proposal to require
covered financial institutions to defer 50 percent of their annual compensation would result in an

212

The Agencies have proposed the three- and four-year minimum deferral periods
because these deferral periods, taken together with the typically one-year performance
period, would allow a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution four to five years, or the
majority of a traditional business cycle, to identify outcomes associated with a senior
executive officer’s or significant risk-taker’s performance and risk-taking activities. The
business cycle reflects periods of economic expansion or recession, which typically
underpin the performance of the financial sector. The Agencies recognize that credit
cycles, which revolve around access to and demand for credit and are influenced by
various economic and financial factors, can be longer. 154
However, the Agencies are also concerned with striking the right balance between
allowing covered persons to be fairly compensated and not encouraging inappropriate

insufficient amount of incentive-based compensation being at risk of potential adjustment,
because the risks posed by those executive officer can take longer to become apparent. Other
commenters argued that all covered institutions subject to this rulemaking should comply with the
deferral requirements regardless of their size.
On the other hand, many commenters recommended that deferral not be required or
argued that, if deferral were to be required, the three-year and 50 percent deferral minimums
provided in the 2011 Proposed Rule were sufficient. Some commenters recommended that the
deferral requirements not be applied to smaller covered institutions. Some commenters also
suggested that unique aspects of certain types of covered institutions, such as investment advisers
or smaller banks within a larger consolidated organization, should be considered when imposing
deferral and other requirements on incentive-based compensation arrangements. A number of
commenters suggested that applying a prescriptive deferral requirement, together with other
requirements under the 2011 Proposed Rule, would make it more difficult for covered institutions
to attract and retain key employees in comparison to the ability of organizations not subject to
such requirements to recruit and retain the same employees.
154
From 1945 to 2009, the average length of the business cycle in the U.S. was approximately 5.7
years. See The National Bureau of Economic Research, “U.S. Business Cycle Expansions and
Contractions, available at http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html. Many researchers have
found that credit cycles are longer than business cycles. For example, Drehmann et al (2012)
estimate an average duration of credit cycles from 10 to 20 years. See Drehmann, Mathias, Borio
and Tsatsaronis, “Characterising the Financial Cycle: Don’t Lose Sight of the Medium Term!”
Bank for International Settlements, Working Paper, No. 380 (June 2012), available at
http://www.bis.org/publ/work380.htm. Aikman et al (2015) found that the credit cycle ranges
from eight to 20 years. See Aikman, Haldane, and Nelson, “Curbing the Credit Cycle,” 125 The
Economic Journal 1072 (June 2015).

risk-taking. The Agencies are concerned that extending deferral periods for too long may
lead to a covered person placing little or no value on the incentive-based compensation
that only begins to vest far out in the future. This type of discounting of the value of
long-deferred awards may be less effective as an incentive, positive or negative, and
consequently for balancing the benefit of these types of awards. 155
As described above, since the Agencies proposed the 2011 Proposed Rule, the
Agencies have gained significant supervisory experience while encouraging covered
institutions to adopt improved incentive-based compensation practices. The Federal
Banking Agencies note in particular improvements in design of incentive-based
compensation arrangements that help to more appropriately balance risk and reward.
Regulatory requirements for sound incentive-based compensation arrangements at
financial institutions have continued to evolve, including those being implemented by
foreign regulators. Consideration of international practices and standards is particularly
relevant in developing incentive-based compensation standards for large financial
institutions because they often compete for talented personnel internationally.
Based on supervisory experience, although exact amounts deferred may vary
across employee populations at large covered institutions, the Federal Banking Agencies
have observed that, since the financial crisis that began in 2007, most deferral periods at
financial institutions range from three to five years, with three years being the most

common deferral period. 156 Consistent with this observation, the FSB standards suggest
deferral periods “not less than three years,” and the average deferral period at significant
institutions in FSB member countries is now between three and four years. 157 The PRA
requires deferral of seven years for senior managers as defined under the Senior
Managers Regime, five years for risk managers as defined under the EBA regulatory
technical standard on identification of material risk-takers, and three to five years as per
the CRD IV minimum for all other material risk-takers. 158 CRD IV sets a minimum
deferral period of “at least three to five years.” For senior management, significant
institutions 159 are expected to apply deferral of “at least five years.” 160 Swiss
regulations 161 require that for members of senior management, persons with relatively
high total remuneration, and persons whose activities have a significant influence on the
risk profile of the firm, the time period for deferral should last “at least three years.”

CRD IV defines institutions that are significant “in terms of size, internal organisation and
nature, scope and complexity of their activities.” Under the EBA Guidance on Sound
Remuneration Policies, significant institutions means institutions referred to in Article 131 of
Directive 2013/36/EU (global systemically important institutions or ‘G-SIIs,’ and other
systemically important institutions or ‘O- SIIs’), and, as appropriate, other institutions determined
by the competent authority or national law, based on an assessment of the institutions’ size,
internal organisation and the nature, the scope and the complexity of their activities. Some, but
not all, national regulators have provided further guidance on interpretation of that term,
including the FCA which provides a form of methodology to determine if a firm is “significant”
based on quantitative tests of balance sheet assets, liabilities, annual fee commission income,
client money and client assets.

The requirements in the proposed rule regarding amounts deferred are also
consistent with observed better practices and the standards established by foreign
regulators. The Board’s summary overview of findings during the early stages of the
2011 FRB White Paper 162 observed that “deferral fractions set out in the FSB Principles
and Implementation Standards 163 are sometimes used as a benchmark (60 percent or more
for senior executives, 40 percent or more for other individual “material risk takers,”
which are not the same as “covered employees”) and concluded that deferral fractions
were at or above these benchmarks at both the U.S. banking organizations and foreign
banking organizations that participated in the horizontal review.
The proportion of incentive-based compensation awards observed to be deferred
at financial institutions during the Board’s horizontal review was substantial. For
example, on average senior executives report more than 60 percent of their incentivebased compensation is deferred, 164 and some of the most senior executives had more than
80 percent of their incentive-based compensation deferred with additional stock retention
requirements after deferred stock vests. Most institutions assigned deferral rates to
employees using a fixed schedule or “cash/stock table” under which employees that
received higher incentive-based compensation awards generally were subject to higher
deferral rates, although deferral rates for the most senior executives were often set

162

See FRB 2011 Report, at 31.
Specifically, the FSB Implementation Standards encourage that “a substantial portion of
variable compensation, such as 40 to 60 percent, should be payable under deferral arrangements
over a period of years” and that “proportions should increase significantly along with the level of
seniority and/or responsibility…for the most senior management and the most highly paid
employees, the percentage of variable compensation that is deferred should be substantially
higher, for instance, above 60 percent.”
164
“Deferral” for these reports is defined by the institutions and may include long-term incentive
plans without additional deferral.

separately and were higher than those for other employees. 165 The proposed rule’s higher
deferral rates for senior executive officers would be consistent with this observed
industry practice of requiring higher deferral rates for the most senior executives.
Additionally, by their very nature, senior executive officer positions tend to have more
responsibility for strategic decisions and oversight of multiple areas of operations, and
these responsibilities warrant requiring higher percentages of deferral and longer deferral
periods to safeguard against inappropriate risk-taking.
This proposed rule is also consistent with standards being developed
internationally. The PRA expects that “where any employee’s variable remuneration
component is £500,000 or more, at least 60 percent should be deferred.” 166 European
Union regulations require that “institutions should set an appropriate portion of
remuneration that should be deferred for a category of identified staff or a single
identified staff member at or above the minimum proportion of 40 percent or respectively
60 percent for particularly high amounts.” 167 The EU also publishes a report on
Benchmarking of Remuneration Practices at Union Level and Data on High Earners 168
that provides insight into amounts deferred across various lines of business within
significant institutions across the European Union. While amounts varied by areas of
operations, average deferral levels for identified staff range from 54 percent in retail
banking to more than 73 percent in investment banking.

The proposed rule’s enhanced requirements for Level 1 institutions are consistent
with international standards. Many regulators apply compensation standards in a
proportional or tiered fashion. The PRA, for example, classifies three tiers of firms based
on asset size and applies differentiated standards across this population. Proportionality
Level 1 includes firms with greater than £50 billion in consolidated assets;
Proportionality Level 2 includes firms with between £15 billion and £50 billion in
consolidated assets; and Proportionality Level 3 includes firms with less than £15 billion
in consolidated assets. The PRA also recognizes “significant” firms. Proportionality
Level 3 firms are typically not subject to provisions on retained shares, deferral, or
performance adjustment.
Under the proposed rule, incentive-based compensation awarded under a longterm incentive plan would be treated separately and differently than amounts of
incentive-based compensation awarded under annual performance plans (and other
qualifying incentive-based compensation) for the purposes of the deferral requirements.
Deferral of incentive-based compensation and the use of longer performance periods
(which is the hallmark of a long-term incentive plan) both are useful tools for balancing
risk and reward in incentive-based compensation arrangements because both allow for
the passage of time that allows the covered institution to have more information about a
covered person’s risk-taking activity and its possible outcomes. Both methods allow
awards or payments to be made after some or all risk outcomes are realized or better

218

known. However, longer performance periods and deferral of vesting are distinct risk
balancing methods. 169
As noted above, the Agencies took into account the comments received regarding
similar deferral requirements in the 2011 Proposed Rule. In response to the proposed
deferral requirement in the 2011 Proposed Rule, which did not distinguish between
incentive-based compensation awarded under a long-term incentive plan and other
incentive-based compensation, several commenters argued that the Agencies should
allow incentive-based compensation arrangements that use longer performance periods,
such as a three-year performance period, to count toward the mandatory deferral
requirement. In particular, some commenters argued that institutions that use longer
performance periods should be allowed to start the deferral period at the beginning of the
performance period. In this way, they argued, a payment made at the end of a three-year
performance period has already been deferred for three years for the purposes of the
deferral requirement.
As discussed above, deferral allows for time to pass after the conclusion of the
performance period. It introduces a period of time in between the end of the performance
period and vesting of the incentive-based compensation during which risks may mature
without the employee taking additional risks to affect that earlier award.
Currently, institutions commonly use long-term incentive plans without
subsequent deferral and thus there is no period following the multi-year performance
169

The 2011 Proposed Rule expressly recognized this distinction (“The Proposed Rule identifies
four methods that currently are often used to make compensation more sensitive to risk. These
methods are Risk Adjustment of Awards…Deferral of Payment…Longer Performance
Periods…Reduced Sensitivity to Short-Term Performance.”). See 76 FR at 21179.

219

period that would permit the covered institution to apply forfeiture or other reductions
should it become clear that the covered person engaged in inappropriate risk-taking.
Without deferral, the incentive-based compensation is awarded and vests at the end of the
multi-year performance period. 170 In contrast, during the deferral period, the covered
person’s incentive-based compensation award is fixed and the vesting could be affected
by information about a covered person’s risk-taking activities during the performance
period that becomes known during the deferral period.
For a long-term incentive plan, the period of time between the beginning of the
performance period and when incentive-based compensation is awarded is longer than
that of an annual plan. However, the period of time between the end of the performance
period and when incentive-based compensation is awarded is the same for both the longterm incentive plan and for the annual plan. Consequently, while a covered institution
may have more information about the risk-taking activities of a covered person that
occurred near the beginning of the performance period for a long-term incentive plan
than for an annual plan, the covered institution would have no more information about
risk-taking activities that occur near the end of the performance period. The incentivebased compensation awarded under the long-term incentive plan would be awarded
without the benefit of additional information about risk-taking activities near the end of
the performance period.
170

An employee may be incentivized to take additional risks near the end of the performance
period to attempt to compensate for poor performance early in the period of the long-term
incentive compensation plan. For example, as noted above, towards the end of a multi-year
performance period, covered persons who have not yet met the target performance measures
could be tempted to amplify risk taking or take other actions to meet those targets and receive the
maximum long-term incentive plan award with no additional review applied to the risk-taking
activities that were taken during the defined performance period to achieve those target
performance measures.

220

Therefore, the proposed rule would treat incentive-based compensation awarded
under a long-term incentive plan similarly to, but not the same as, qualifying incentivebased compensation for purposes of the deferral requirement. Under the proposed rule,
the incentive-based compensation awarded under a long-term incentive plan would be
required to be deferred for a shorter amount of time than qualifying incentive-based
compensation, although the period of time elapsing between the beginning of the
performance period and the actual vesting would be longer. A shorter deferral period
would recognize the fact that the longer performance period of a long-term incentive plan
allows some time for information to surface about risk-taking activities undertaken at the
beginning of the performance period. The longer performance period allows covered
institutions to adjust the amount awarded under long-term incentive plans for poor
performance during the performance period. Yet, since no additional time would pass
between risk-taking activities at the end of the performance period and the award date,
the proposed rule would allow a shorter deferral period than would be necessary for
qualifying incentive-based compensation.
The percentage of incentive-based compensation awarded that would be required
to be deferred would be the same for incentive-based compensation awarded under a
long-term incentive plan and for qualifying incentive-based compensation. However,
because of the difference in the minimum required deferral period, the minimum deferral
amounts for qualifying incentive-based compensation and for incentive-based
compensation awarded under a long-term incentive plan would be required to be
calculated separately. In other words, any amount of qualifying incentive-based
compensation that a covered institution chooses to defer above the minimum required

221

would not decrease the minimum amount of incentive-based compensation awarded
under a long-term plan that would be required to be deferred, and vice versa.
For example, a Level 2 covered institution that awards a senior executive officer
$50,000 of qualifying incentive-based compensation and $20,000 under a long-term
incentive plan would be required to defer at least $25,000 of the qualifying incentivebased compensation and at least $10,000 of the amounts awarded under the long-term
incentive plan. The Level 2 covered institution would not be permitted to defer, for
example, $35,000 of qualifying incentive-based compensation and no amounts awarded
under the long-term incentive plan, even though that would result in the deferral of 50
percent of the senior executive officer’s total incentive-based compensation. For a full
example of how these requirements would work in the context of a more complete
incentive-based compensation arrangement, please see Appendix A of this preamble.
For incentive-based compensation awarded under a long-term incentive plan,
section ___.7(a)(2) of the proposed rule would require that minimum deferral periods for
senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at a Level 1 covered institution
extend to two years after the award date and minimum deferral periods at a Level 2
covered institution extend to one year after the award date. For long-term incentive plans
with performance periods of three years, 171 this requirement would delay the vesting of
the last portion of this incentive-based compensation until five years after the beginning
of the performance period at Level 1 covered institutions and four years after the
beginning of the performance period at Level 2 covered institutions. Thus, while the
171

Many studies of incentive-based compensation at large institutions have found that long-term
incentive plans commonly have performance periods of three years. See Cook Report; Moody’s
Report.

222

deferral period from the award date is shorter for incentive-based compensation awarded
under a long-term incentive plan, the delay in vesting from the beginning of the
performance period would generally be the same under the most common qualifying
incentive-based compensation and long-term incentive plans.
Under the proposed rule, the incentive-based compensation that would be
required by the rule to be deferred would not be permitted to vest faster than on a pro rata
annual basis beginning no earlier than the first anniversary of the end of the performance
period. This requirement would apply to both deferred qualifying incentive-based
compensation and deferred incentive-based compensation awarded under a long-term
incentive plan.
The Federal Banking Agencies have also observed that the minimum required
deferral amounts and deferral periods that would be required under the proposed rule are
generally consistent with industry practice at larger covered institutions that are currently
subject to the 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance, although the Agencies recognize
that some institutions would need to revise their individual incentive-based compensation
programs and others were not subject to the 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance. In
part because the 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance and compensation regulations
imposed by international regulators 172 currently encourage banking institutions to

172

Most members of the FSB, for instance, have issued regulations, or encourage through
guidance and supervisory practice, deferral standards that meet the minimums set forth in the
FSB’s Implementation Standards. See 2015 FSB Compensation Progress Report (concluding
“almost all FSB jurisdictions have now fully implemented the P&S for banks.”). The FSB
standards state that “a substantial portion of variable compensation, such as 40 to 60 percent,
should be payable under deferral arrangements over a period of years and these proportions
should increase significantly along with the level of seniority and/or responsibility. The deferral
period should not be less than three years. See FSB Principles and Implementation Standards.

223

increase the proportion of compensation that is deferred to reflect higher levels of
seniority or responsibility, current practice for the largest international banking
institutions reflects substantial levels of deferral for such individuals. Many of those
individuals would be senior executive officers and significant risk-takers under the
proposed rule. Under current practice, deferral typically ranges from 40 percent for less
senior significant risk-takers to more than 60 percent for senior executives. 173 The
Agencies note that current practice for the largest international banking institutions
reflects average deferral periods of at least three years. 174
The deferral requirements of the proposed rule for senior executive officers and
significant risk-takers at the largest covered institutions are also consistent with
international standards on compensation. The European Union’s 2013 law on
remuneration paid by financial institutions requires deferral for large firms, among other
requirements. 175 The PRA and the FCA initially adopted the European Union’s law and
requires covered companies to defer 40 to 60 percent of “senior manager,” “risk
manager,” and “material risk-taker” compensation. The PRA and FCA recently updated
their implementing regulations to extend deferral periods to seven years for senior

173

FSB member jurisdictions provided data for the purposes of the 2015 FSB Compensation
Progress Report indicating that while the percentage of variable remuneration deferred varies
significantly between institutions and across categories of staff, for the surveyed population of
senior executives, the percentage of deferred incentive-based compensation averaged
approximately 50 percent. See 2015 FSB Compensation Progress Report.
174
See Moody’s Report.
175
In June 2013, the European Union adopted CRD IV, which sets out requirements on
compensation structures, policies, and practices that applies to all banks and investment firms
subject to the CRD. CRD IV provides that at least 50 percent of total variable remuneration
should consist of equity-linked interests and at least 40 percent of the variable component must be
deferred over a period of three to five years. Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 26 June 2013 (effective January 1, 2014).

managers and up to five years for certain other persons. 176 The proposed deferral
requirements are also generally consistent with the FSB’s Principles for Sound
Compensation Practices and their related implementation standards issued in 2009. 177
Having standards that are generally consistent across jurisdictions would be important
both to enable institutions subject to multiple regimes to fulfill the requirements of all
applicable regimes, and to ensure that covered institutions in the United States would be
on a level playing field compared to their non-U.S. peers in the global competition for
talent.
7.1 The Agencies invite comment on the proposed requirements in sections ___.7(a)(1) and
(a)(2).
7.2 Are minimum required deferral periods and percentages appropriate? If not, why not?
Should Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions be subject to different deferral
requirements, as in the proposed rule, or should they be treated more similarly for this
purpose and why? Should the minimum required deferral period be extended to, for
example, five years or longer in certain cases and why?
7.3 Is a deferral requirement for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at
Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions appropriate to promote the alignment of
employees’ incentives with the risk undertaken by such covered persons? If not, why
not? For example, comment is invited on whether deferral is generally an appropriate
method for achieving incentive-based compensation arrangements that appropriately

See UK Remuneration Rules. In the case of a material risk-taker who performs a PRA senior
management function, the pro rata vesting requirement applies only from year three onwards (i.e.,
the required deferral period is seven years, with no vesting to take place until three years after
award).

balance risk and reward for each type of senior executive officer and significant risktaker at these institutions or whether there are alternative or more effective ways to
achieve such balance.
7.4 Commenters are also invited to address the possible impact that the required minimum
deferral provisions for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers may have on
larger covered institutions and whether any deferral requirements should apply to senior
executive officers at Level 3 institutions.
7.5 A number of commenters to the 2011 Proposed Rule suggested that applying a
prescriptive deferral requirement, together with other requirements under that proposal,
would make it more difficult for covered institutions to attract and retain key employees
in comparison to the ability of organizations not subject to such requirements to recruit
and retain the same employees. What implications does the proposed rule have on
“level playing fields” between covered institutions and non-covered institutions in
setting forth minimum deferral requirements under the rule?
7.6 The Agencies invite comment on whether longer performance periods can provide risk
balancing benefits similar to those provided by deferral, such that the shorter deferral
periods for incentive-based compensation awarded under long-term incentive plans in
the proposed rule would be appropriate.
7.7 Would the proposed distinction between the deferral requirements for qualifying
incentive-based compensation and incentive-based compensation awarded under a
long-term incentive plan pose practical difficulties for covered institutions or increase
compliance burdens? Why or why not?

226

7.8 Would the requirement in the proposed rule that amounts awarded under long-term
incentive plans be deferred result in covered institutions offering fewer long-term
incentive plans? If so, why and what other compensation plans will be used in place of
long-term incentive plans and what negative or positive consequences might result?
7.9 Are there additional considerations, such as tax or accounting considerations, that may
affect the ability of Level 1 or Level 2 covered institutions to comply with the proposed
deferral requirement or that the Agencies should consider in connection with this
provision in the final rule? Commenters on the 2011 Proposed Rule noted that
employees of an investment adviser to a private fund hold partnership interests and that
any incentive allocations paid to them are typically taxed at the time of allocation,
regardless of whether these allocations have been distributed, and consequently,
employees of an investment adviser to a private fund that would have been subject to
the deferral requirement in the 2011 Proposed Rule would have been required to pay
taxes relating to incentive allocations that they were required to defer. Should the
determination of required deferral amounts under the proposed rule be adjusted in the
context of investment advisers to private funds and, if so, how? Could the tax liabilities
immediately payable on deferred amounts be paid from the compensation that is not
deferred?
7.10 The Agencies invite comment on the circumstances under which acceleration of payment
should be permitted. Should accelerated vesting be allowed in cases where employees
are terminated without cause or cases where there is a change in control and the covered
institution ceases to exist and why? Are there other situations for which acceleration
should be allowed? If so, how can such situations be limited to those of necessity?

227

7.11 The Agencies received comment on the 2011 Proposed Rule that stated it was common
practice for some private fund adviser personnel to receive payments in order to enable
the recipients to make tax payments on unrealized income as they became due. Should
this type of practice to satisfy tax liabilities, including tax liabilities payable on unrealized
amounts of incentive-based compensation, be permissible under the proposed rule,
including, for example, as a permissible acceleration of vesting under the proposed rule?
Why or why not? Is this a common industry practice?
§__.7(a)(3) Adjustments of deferred qualifying incentive-based compensation and
deferred long-term incentive plan compensation amounts.
Under section ___.7(a)(3) of the proposed rule, during the deferral period, a
Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution would not be permitted to increase a senior
executive or significant risk-taker’s unvested deferred incentive-based compensation. 178
In other words, any deferred incentive-based compensation, whether it was awarded as
qualifying incentive-based compensation or under a long-term incentive plan, would be
permitted to vest in an amount equal to or less than the amount awarded, but would not
be permitted to increase during the deferral period. 179 Deferred incentive-based
compensation may be decreased, for example, under a forfeiture and downward
adjustment review as would be required under section ___.7(b) of the proposed rule,
discussed below. It may also be adjusted downward as a result of performance that falls
short of agreed upon performance measure targets

178

This requirement is distinct from the prohibition in section 8(b) of the proposed rule, discussed
below.
179
Accelerated vesting would be permitted in limited circumstances under sections
___.7(a)(1)(iii)(B) and ___.7(a)(2)(iii)(B), as described above.

228

As discussed in section 8(b), under some incentive-based compensation plans,
covered persons can be awarded amounts in excess of their target amounts if the covered
institution or covered person’s performance exceed performance targets. As explained in
the discussion on section 8(b), this type of upside leverage in incentive-based
compensation plans may encourage covered persons to take inappropriate risks.
Therefore, the proposed rule would limit maximum payouts to between 125 and 150
percent of the pre-set target. In a similar vein, the Agencies are concerned that allowing
Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions to provide for additional increases in amounts
that are awarded but deferred may encourage senior executive officers and significant
risk-takers to take more risk during the deferral period and thus may not balance risktaking incentives. This concern is especially acute when covered institutions require
covered persons to meet more aggressive goals than those established at the beginning of
the performance period in order to “re-earn” already awarded, but deferred incentivebased compensation.
Although increases in the amount awarded, as described above, would be
prohibited by the proposed rule, increases in the value of deferred incentive-based
compensation due solely to a change in share value, a change in interest rates, or the
payment of reasonable interest or a reasonable rate of return according to terms set out at
the award date would not be considered increases in the amount awarded for purposes of
this restriction. Thus, a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution would be permitted to
award incentive-based compensation to a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker
in the form of an equity or debt instrument, and, if that instrument increased in market
value or included a provision to pay a reasonable rate of interest or other return that was

229

set at the time of the award, the vesting of the full amount of that instrument would not be
in violation of the proposed rule.
For an example of how these requirements would work in practice, please see
Appendix A of this Supplementary Information section.
7.12 The Agencies invite comment on the requirement in section ___.7(a)(3).
§__.7(a)(4) Composition of deferred qualifying incentive-based compensation and
deferred long-term incentive plan compensation for Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions.
Section ___.7(a)(4) of the proposed rule would require that deferred qualifying
incentive-based compensation or deferred incentive-based compensation awarded under a
long-term incentive plan of a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker at a Level 1
or Level 2 covered institution meet certain composition requirements.
Cash and equity-like instruments.
Covered institutions award incentive-based compensation in a number of forms,
including cash-based awards, equity-like instruments, and in a smaller number of cases,
incentive-based compensation in the form of debt or debt-like instruments such as
deferred cash. First, the proposed rule would require that, at Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions 180 that issue equity or are the affiliates of covered institutions that issue

180

In the cases of the Board, FDIC and OCC, this requirement would not apply to a Level 1 and
Level 2 covered institution that does not issue equity itself and is not an affiliate of an institution
that issues equity. Credit unions and certain mutual savings associations, mutual savings banks,
and mutual holding companies do not issue equity and do not have a parent that issues equity.
For those institutions, imposing this requirement would have little benefit, as no equity-like
instruments would be based off of the equity of the covered institution or one of its parents. In

230

equity, deferred incentive-based compensation for senior executive officers and
significant risk-takers include substantial portions of both deferred cash and equity-like
instruments throughout the deferral period. The Agencies recognize that the form of
incentive-based compensation that a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker
receives can have an impact on the incentives provided and thus their behavior. In
particular, having incentive-based compensation in the form of equity-like instruments
can align the interests of the senior executive officers and significant risk-takers with the
interests of the covered institution’s shareholders. Thus, the proposed rule would require
that a senior executive officer’s or significant risk-taker’s deferred incentive-based
compensation include a substantial portion of equity-like instruments.
Similarly, having incentive-based compensation in the form of cash can align the
interests of the senior executive officers and significant risk-takers with the interests of
other stakeholders in the covered institution. 181 Thus, the proposed rule would require
that a senior executive officer’s or significant risk-taker’s deferred incentive-based
compensation include a substantial portion of cash.
The value of equity-like instruments received by a covered person increases or
decreases in value based on the value of the equity of the covered institution, which
provides an implicit method of adjusting the underlying value of compensation as the
share price of the covered institution changes as a result of better or worse operational
performance. Deferred cash may increase in value over time pursuant to an interest rate,
the case of FHFA, this requirement would not apply to a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution
that does not issue equity or is not permitted by FHFA to use equity-like instruments as
compensation for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers.
181
Generally, in the case of resolution or bankruptcy, deferred incentive-based compensation in
the form of cash would be treated similarly to other unsecured debt.

231

but its value generally does not vary based on the performance of the covered institution.
These two forms of incentive-based compensation present a covered person with
different incentives for performance, just as a covered institution itself faces different
incentives when issuing debt or equity-like instruments. 182
For purposes of this proposed rule, the Agencies consider incentive-based
compensation paid in equity-like instruments to include any form of payment in which
the final value of the award or payment is linked to the price of the covered institution’s
equity, even if such compensation settles in the form of cash. Deferred cash can be
structured to share many attributes of a debt instrument. For instance, while equity-like
instruments have almost unlimited upside (as the value of the covered institution’s shares
increase), deferred cash that is structured to resemble a debt instrument can be structured
so as to offer limited upside and can be designed with other features that align more
closely with the interests of the covered institution’s debtholders than its shareholders. 183

182

Jensen and Meckling (1976) were the first to point out that the structure of compensation
should reflect all of the stakeholders in the firm—both equity and debt holders, an idea further
explored by Edmans and Liu (2013). Faulkender et al (2012) argue that a compensation program
that relies too heavily on stock-based compensation can lead to excessive risk taking,
manipulation, and distract from long-term value creation. Empirical research has found that
equity-based pay increases risk at financial firms Balanchandarn et al 2010). See Jensen and
Metcking, “Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs, and Ownership Structure,”

There has been a recent surge in research on the use of compensation that has a payoff
structure similar to debt, or “inside debt.” See, e.g., Wei and Yermack, “Investor Reactions to
CEOs Inside Debt Incentives,” 24 Review of Financial Studies 3813 (2011) (finding that bond

232

Where possible, it is important for the incentive-based compensation of senior
executive officers and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions
to have some degree of balance between the amounts of deferred cash and equity-like
instruments received. With the exception of the limitation of use of options discussed
below, the Agencies propose to provide covered institutions with flexibility in meeting
the general balancing requirement under section ____.7(a)(4)(i) and thus have not

prices rise, equity prices fall, and the volatility of both bond and stock prices fall for firms where
the CEO has sizable inside debt and arguing the results indicate that firms with higher inside debt
have lower risk; Cassell, Huang, Sanchez, and Stuart, “Seeking Safety: The Relation between
CEO Inside Debt Holding and the Riskiness of Firm Investment and Financial Policies,” 103
Journal of Financial Economics 518 (2012) (finding higher inside debt is associated with lower
volatility of future firm stock returns, research and development expenditures, and financial
leverage, and more diversification and higher asset liquidity and empirical research finding that
debt holders recognize the benefits of firms including debt-like components in their compensation
structure); Anantharaman, Divya, Fang, and Gong, “Inside Debt and the Design of Corporate
Debt Contracts,” 60 Management Science 1260 (2013) (finding that higher inside debt is
associated with a lower cost of debt and fewer debt covenants); Bennett, Guntay and Unal,
“Inside Debt and Bank Default Risk and Performance During the Crisis,” FDIC Center for
Financial Research Working Paper No. 2012-3 (finding that banks that had higher inside debt
before the recent financial crisis had lower default risk and higher performance during the crisis
and that banks with higher inside debt had supervisory ratings that indicate that they had stronger
capital positions, better management, stronger earnings, and being in a better position to
withstand market shocks in the future); Srivastav, Abhishek, Armitage, and Hagendorff, “CEO
Inside Debt Holdings and Risk-shifting: Evidence from Bank Payout Policies,” 47 Journal of
Banking & Finance 41 (2014) (finding that banks with higher inside debt holdings have a more
conservative dividend payout policy); Chen, Dou, and Wang, “Executive Inside Debt Holdings
and Creditors’ Demand for Pricing and Non-Pricing Protections,” working paper (2010) (finding
that higher inside debt is associated with lower interest rates and less restrictive debt covenants
and that in empirical research, specifically on banks, similar patterns emerge). In addition, the
Squam Lake Group has done significant work on the use of debt based structures. See, e.g.,
Squam Lake Group, “Aligning Incentives at Systemically Important Financial Institutions”

Contribution of Deferred Cash Compensation,” forthcoming in the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York’s Economic Policy Review (available at
https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/epr/index.html), Hamid Mehran and Joseph Tracy
highlight three channels through which deferred cash compensation can help mitigate risk:
promoting conservatism, inducing internal monitoring, and creating a liquidity buffer.

233

proposed specific percentages of deferred incentive-based compensation that must be
paid in each form.
Similar to the rest of section ___.7, the requirement in section ___.7(a)(4)(i)
would apply to deferred incentive-based compensation of senior executive officers and
significant risk-takers of Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions. As discussed above,
these covered persons are the ones most likely to have a material impact on the financial
health and risk-taking of the covered institution. Importantly for this requirement, these
covered persons are also the most likely to be able to influence the value of the covered
institution’s equity and debt.
7.13 The Agencies invite comment on the composition requirement set out in section
___.7(a)(4)(i) of the proposed rule.
7.14 In order to allow Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions sufficient flexibility in
designing their incentive-based compensation arrangements, the Agencies are not
proposing a specific definition of “substantial” for the purposes of this section. Should
the Agencies more precisely define the term “substantial” (for example, one-third or 40
percent) and if so, should the definition vary among covered institutions and why?
Should the term “substantial” be interpreted differently for different types of senior
executive officers or significant risk-takers and why? What other considerations should
the Agencies factor into level of deferred cash and deferred equity required? Are there
particular tax or accounting implications attached to use of particular forms of incentivebased compensation, such as those related to debt or equity?
7.15 The Agencies invite comment on whether the use of certain forms of incentive-based
compensation in addition to, or as a replacement for, deferred cash or deferred equity-like
234

instruments would strengthen the alignment between incentive-based compensation and
prudent risk-taking.
7.16 The Agencies invite commenters’ views on whether the proposed rule should include a
requirement that a certain portion of incentive-based compensation be structured with
debt-like attributes. Do debt instruments (as opposed to equity-like instruments or
deferred cash) meaningfully influence the behavior of senior executive officers and
significant risk-takers? If so, how? How could the specific attributes of deferred cash be
structured, if at all, to limit the amount of interest that can be paid? How should such an
interest rate be determined, and how should such instruments be priced? Which attributes
would most closely align use of a debt-like instrument with the interest of debt holders
and promote risk-taking that is not likely to lead to material financial loss?
Options.
Under section ___.7(a)(4)(ii), for senior executive officers and significant risktakers at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions that receive incentive-based
compensation in the form of options, the total amount of such options that may be used to
meet the minimum deferral amount requirements is limited to, no more than 15 percent of
the amount of total incentive-based compensation awarded for a given performance
period. A Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution would be permitted to award incentivebased compensation to senior executive officers and significant risk-takers in the form of
options in excess of this limitation, and could defer such compensation, but the incentivebased compensation in the form of options in excess of the 15 percent limit would not be
counted towards meeting the minimum deferral requirements for senior executive officers
and significant risk-takers at these covered institutions.
235

For example, a Level 1 covered institution might award a significant risk-taker
$100,000 in incentive-based compensation at the end of a performance period: $80,000
in qualifying incentive-based compensation, of which $25,000 is in options, and $20,000
under a long-term incentive plan, all of which is delivered in cash. The Level 1 covered
institution would be required to defer at least $40,000 of the qualifying incentive-based
compensation and at least $10,000 of the amount awarded under the long-term incentive
plan. Under the draft proposed rule, the amount that could be composed of options and
count toward the overall deferral requirement would be limited to 15 percent of the total
amount of incentive-based compensation awarded. In this example, the Level 1 covered
institution could count $15,000 in options (15 percent of $100,000) toward the
requirement to defer $40,000 of qualifying incentive-based compensation. For an
example of how these requirements would work in the context of a more complete
incentive-based compensation arrangement, please see Appendix A of this preamble.
This requirement would thus limit the total amount of incentive-based
compensation in the form of options that could satisfy the minimum deferral amounts in
sections ___.7(a)(1)(i) and ___.7(a)(1)(ii). Any incentive-based compensation awarded
in the form of options would, however, be required to be included in calculating the total
amount of incentive-based compensation awarded in a given performance period for
purposes of calculating the minimum deferral amounts at Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions as laid out in sections ___.7(a)(1)(i) and ___.7(a)(2)(ii).
Options can be a significant and important part of incentive-based compensation
arrangements at many covered institutions. The Agencies are concerned, however, that
overreliance on options as a form of incentive-based compensation could have negative
236

effects on the financial health of a covered institution due to options’ emphasis on upside
gains and possible lack of responsiveness to downside risks. 184
The risk dynamic for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers
changes when options are awarded because options offer asymmetric payoffs for stock
price performance. Options may generate very high payments to covered persons when
the market price of a covered institution’s shares rises, representing a leveraged return
relative to shareholders. Payment of incentive-based compensation in the form of options
may therefore increase the incentives under some market conditions for covered persons
to take inappropriate risks in order to increase the covered institution’s short-term share
price, possibly without giving appropriate weight to long-term risks.
Moreover, unlike restricted stock, options are limited in how much they decrease
in value when the covered institution’s shares decrease in value. 185 Thus, options may
184

In theory, since the payoffs from holding stock options are positively related to volatility of
stock returns, options create incentives for executives to increase the volatility of share prices by
engaging in riskier activities. See, e.g., Guay, W.R., “The Sensitivity of CEO Weather to Equity
Risk: An Analysis of the Magnitude and Determinants,” 53 Journal of Financial Economics 43
(1999); Cohen, Hall, and Viceira, “Do Executive Stock Options Encourage Risk Taking?”

and Shvelin, “Empirical Evidence on the Relation between Stock Option Compensation and RiskTaking,” 33 Journal of Accounting and Economics 145 (2002); Coles, Daniel, and Naveen,

Steiner, and Whyte, “Does Stock Option-Based Executive Compensation Induce Risk-Taking?

Borrowing and Capital,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports No. 305 (2007)
available at https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr305.pdf.
Beyond the typical measures of risk, the academic literature has found a relation between
executive stock option holdings and risky behavior. See, e.g., Denis, Hanouna, and Sarin, “Is
There a Dark Side to Incentive Compensation?” 12 Journal of Corporate Finance 467 (2006)
(finding that there is a significant positive association between the likelihood of securities fraud
allegations and the executive stock option incentives); Bergstresser and Phillippon, “CEO
Incentives and Earnings Management,” 80 Journal of Financial Economics 511 (2006) (finding
that the use of discretionary accruals to manipulate reported earnings was more pronounced at
firms where CEO’s compensation was more closely tied to stock and option holdings).

237

not be an effective tool for causing a covered person to adjust his or her behavior to
manage downside risk. For senior executive officers and significant risk-takers, whose
activities can materially impact the firm's stock price, incentive-based compensation
based on options may therefore create greater incentive to take inappropriate risk or
provide inadequate disincentive to manage risk. For these reasons, the Agencies are
proposing to limit to 15 percent the amount permitted to be used in meeting the minimum
deferral requirements.
In proposing to limit, but not prohibit, the use of options to fulfill the proposed
rule’s deferral requirements, the Agencies have sought to conservatively apply better
practice while still allowing for some flexibility in the design and operation of incentivebased compensation arrangements. The Agencies note that supervisory experience at
large banking organizations and analysis of compensation disclosures, as well as the
views of some commenters to the 2011 Proposed Rule, indicate that many institutions
have recognized the risks of options as an incentive and have reduced their use of options
in recent years.
The proposed rule’s 15 percent limit on options is consistent with current industry
practice, which is moving away from its historical reliance on options as part of
incentive-based compensation. Since the financial crisis that began in 2007, institutions
on their own initiative and those working with the Board have decreased the use of
options in incentive-based compensation arrangements generally such that for most
organizations options constitute no more than 15 percent of an institution’s total

185

This would be the case if the current market price for a share is less than or equal to the
option’s strike price (i.e., the option is not “in the money”).

238

incentive-based compensation. Restricted stock unit awards have now emerged as the
most common form of equity compensation and are more prevalent than stock options at
all employee levels. 186 Further, a sample of publicly available disclosures from large
covered institutions shows minimal usage of stock options among CEOs and other named
executive officers; out of a sample of 14 covered institutions reviewed by the Agencies,
only two covered institutions awarded stock options as part of their incentive-based
compensation in 2015. Only one of those two covered institutions awarded options in
excess of 15 percent of total compensation, and the excess was small. Thus, the proposed
rule’s limit on options has been set at a level that would, in the Agencies’ views, help
mitigate concerns about the use of options in incentive-based compensation while still
allowing flexibility for covered institutions to use options in a manner that is consistent
with the better practices that have developed following the recent financial crisis. 187
7.17 The Agencies invite comment on the restrictions on the use of options in incentive-based
compensation in the proposed rule. Should the percent limit be higher or lower and if so,
why? Should options be permitted to be used to meet the deferral requirements of the
rule? Why or why not? Does the use of options by covered institutions create, reduce, or
have no effect on the institution’s risk of material financial loss?
7.18 Does the proposed 15 percent limit appropriately balance the benefits of using options
(such as aligning the recipient’s interests with that of shareholders) and drawbacks of
using options (such as their emphasis on upside gains)? Why or why not? Is the

proposed 15 percent limit the appropriate limit, or should it be higher or lower? If it
should be higher or lower, what should the limit be, and why?
7.19 Are there alternative means of addressing the concerns raised by options as a form of
incentive-based compensation other than those proposed?
§__.7(b) Forfeiture and Downward Adjustment.
Section ___.7(b) of the proposed rule would require Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions to place incentive-based compensation of senior executive officers and
significant risk-takers at risk of forfeiture and downward adjustment and to subject
incentive-based compensation to a forfeiture and downward adjustment review under a
defined set of circumstances. As described below, a forfeiture and downward adjustment
review would be required to identify senior executive officers or significant risk-takers
responsible for the events or circumstances triggering the review. It would also be
required to consider certain factors when determining the amount or portion of a senior
executive officer’s or significant risk-taker’s incentive-based compensation that should
be forfeited or adjusted downward.
In general, the forfeiture and downward adjustment review requirements in
section ___.7(b) would require a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution to consider
reducing some or all of a senior executive officer’s or significant risk-taker’s incentivebased compensation when the covered institution becomes aware of inappropriate risktaking or other aspects of behavior that could lead to material financial loss. The amount
of incentive-based compensation that would be reduced would depend upon the severity
of the event, the impact of the event on the covered institution, and the actions of the
senior executive officer or significant risk-taker in the event. The covered institution
240

could accomplish this reduction of incentive-based compensation by reducing the amount
of unvested deferred incentive-based compensation (forfeiture), by reducing the amount
of incentive-based compensation not yet awarded for a performance period that has
begun (downward adjustment), or through a combination of both forfeiture and
downward adjustment. The Agencies have found that the possibility of a reduction in
incentive-based compensation in the circumstances identified in section ___.7(b)(2) of
the rule is needed in order to properly align financial reward with risk-taking by senior
executive officers and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions.
The possibility of forfeiture and downward adjustment under the proposed rule
would play an important role not only in better aligning incentive-based compensation
payouts with long-run risk outcomes at the covered institution but also in reducing
incentives for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers to take inappropriate
risk that could lead to material financial loss at the covered institution. The proposed rule
would also require covered institutions, through policies and procedures, 188 to formalize
the governance and review processes surrounding such decision-making, and to
document the decisions made.
While forfeiture and downward adjustment reviews would be required
components of incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive officers
and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions under the proposed
rule, and are one way for covered institutions to take into account information about
performance that becomes known over time, such reviews would not alone be sufficient
to appropriately balance risk and reward, as would be required under section ___.4(c)(1).
188

See sections ___.11(b) and ___.11(c).

241

Incentive-based compensation arrangements for those covered persons would also be
required to comply with the specific requirements of sections ___.4(d), ___.7(a), ___.7(c)
and ___.8. As discussed above, to achieve balance between risk and reward, covered
institutions should examine incentive-based compensation arrangements as a whole, and
consider including provisions for risk adjustments before the award is made, and for
adjustments resulting from forfeiture and downward adjustment review during the
deferral period.
§__.7(b)(1) Compensation at risk.
Under the proposed rule, a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution would be
required to place at risk of forfeiture 100 percent of a senior executive officer’s or
significant risk-taker’s deferred and unvested incentive-based compensation, including
unvested deferred amounts awarded under long-term incentive plans. Additionally, a
Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution would be required to place at risk of downward
adjustment all of a senior executive officer’s or significant risk-taker’s incentive-based
compensation that has not yet been awarded, but that could be awarded for a performance
period that is underway and not yet completed.
Forfeiture and downward adjustment give covered institutions an appropriate set
of tools through which consequences may be imposed on individual risk-takers when
inappropriate risk-taking or misconduct, such as the events identified in section
___.7(b)(2), occur or are identified. They also help ensure that a sufficient amount of
compensation is at risk. Certain risk management failures and misconduct can take years
to manifest, and forfeiture and downward adjustment reviews provide covered
institutions an opportunity to adjust the ultimate amount of incentive-based compensation
242

that vests based on information about risk-taking or misconduct that comes to light after
the performance period. A senior executive officer or significant risk-taker should not be
rewarded for inappropriate risk-taking or misconduct, regardless of when the covered
institution learns of it.
Some evidence of inappropriate risk taking, risk management failures and
misconduct may not be immediately apparent to the covered institution. To provide a
strong disincentive for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers to engage in
such conduct, which may lead to material financial loss to the covered institution, the
Agencies are proposing to require that all unvested deferred incentive-based
compensation and all incentive-based compensation eligible to be awarded for the
performance period in which the covered institution becomes aware of the conduct be
available for forfeiture and downward adjustment under the forfeiture and downward
adjustment review. A covered institution would be required to consider all incentivebased compensation available, in the form of both unvested deferred incentive-based
compensation and yet-to-be awarded incentive-based compensation, when considering
forfeiture or downward adjustments, even if the incentive-based compensation does not
specifically relate to the performance in the period in which the relevant event occurred.
For example, a significant risk-taker of a Level 1 covered institution might engage
in misconduct in June 2025, but the Level 1 covered institution might not become aware
of the misconduct until September 2028. The Level 1 covered institution would be
required to consider downward adjustment of any amounts available under any of the
significant risk-taker’s incentive-based compensation plans with performance periods that
are still in progress as of September 2028 (for example, an annual plan with a
243

performance period that runs from January 1, 2028, to December 31, 2028, or a long-term
incentive plan with a performance period that runs from January 1, 2027, to December
31, 2030). The Level 1 covered institution would also be required to consider forfeiture
of any amounts that are deferred, but not yet vested, as of September 2028 (for example,
amounts that were awarded for a performance period that ran from January 1, 2026, to
December 31, 2026, and that have been deferred and do not vest until December 31,
2030). For an additional example of how these requirements would work in practice,
please see Appendix A of this Supplementary Information section.
§__.7(b)(2) Events triggering forfeiture and downward adjustment review.
Section ___.7(b) of the proposed rule would require a Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institution to conduct a forfeiture and downward adjustment review based on certain
identified adverse outcomes.
Under section __.7(b), events 189 that would be required to trigger a forfeiture and
downward adjustment review include: (1) poor financial performance attributable to a
significant deviation from the risk parameters set forth in the covered institution’s
policies and procedures; (2) inappropriate risk-taking, regardless of the impact on
financial performance; (3) material risk management or control failures; and (4) noncompliance with statutory, regulatory, or supervisory standards that results in:
enforcement or legal action against the covered institution brought by a Federal or state
189

The underlying, or contractual, forfeiture language used by institutions need not be identical to
the triggers enumerated in this section, provided the covered institution’s triggers capture the full
set of outcomes outlined in section 7(b)(2) of the rule. For example, a trigger at a covered
institution that read “if an employee improperly or with gross negligence fails to identify, raise, or
assess, in a timely manner and as reasonably expected, risks and/or concerns with respect to risks
material to the institution or its business activities,” would be considered consistent with the
minimum parameters set forth in the trigger identified in section 7(b)(2)(ii) of the rule.

244

regulator or agency; or a requirement that the covered institution report a restatement of a
financial statement to correct a material error. Covered institutions would be permitted to
define additional triggers based on conduct or poor performance. Generally, in the
Agencies’ supervisory experience as earlier described, the triggers are consistent with
current practice at the largest financial institutions, although many covered institutions
have triggers that are more granular in nature than those proposed and cover a wider set
of adverse outcomes. The proposed enumerated adverse outcomes are a set of minimum
standards.
As discussed later in this Supplementary Information section, covered institutions
would be required to provide for the independent monitoring of all events related to
forfeiture and downward adjustment. 190 When such monitoring, or other risk
surveillance activity, reveals the occurrence of events triggering forfeiture and downward
adjustment reviews, Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions would be required to
conduct those reviews in accordance with section ___.7(b). Covered institutions may
choose to coordinate the monitoring for triggering events under section ___.9(c)(2) and
the forfeiture and downward adjustment reviews with broader risk surveillance activities.
Such coordinated reviews could take place on a schedule identified by the covered
institution. Schedules may vary among covered institutions, but they should occur often
enough to appropriately monitor risks and events related to forfeiture and downward
adjustment. Larger covered institutions with more complex operations are likely to need
to conduct more frequent reviews to ensure effective risk management.

190

See section ___.9(c)(2).

245

Poor financial performance can indicate that inappropriate risk-taking has
occurred at a covered institution. The Agencies recognize that not all inappropriate risktaking does, in fact, lead to poor financial performance, but given the risks that are posed
to the covered institutions by poorly designed incentive-based compensation programs
and the statutory mandate of section 956, it is appropriate to prohibit incentive-based
compensation arrangements that reward such inappropriate risk-taking. Therefore, if
evidence of past inappropriate risk-taking becomes known, the proposed rule would
require a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution to perform a forfeiture and downward
adjustment review in order to assess whether the relevant senior executive officer’s or
significant risk-taker’s incentive-based compensation should be affected by the
inappropriate risk-taking.
Similarly, material risk management or control failures may allow for
inappropriate risk-taking that may lead to material financial loss at a covered institution.
Because the role of senior executive officers and significant risk-takers, including those
in risk management and other control functions whose role is to identify, measure,
monitor, and control risk, the material failure by covered persons to properly perform
their responsibilities can be especially likely to put an institution at risk. Thus, if
evidence of past material risk management or control failures becomes known, the
proposed rule would require a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution to perform a
forfeiture and downward adjustment review, to assess whether a senior executive officer
or significant risk-taker’s incentive-based compensation should be affected by the risk
management or control failure. Examples of risk management or control failures would
include failing to properly document or report a transaction or failing to properly identify

246

and control the risks that are associated with a transaction. In each case, the risk
management or control failure, if material, could allow for inappropriate risk-taking at a
covered institution that could lead to material financial loss.
Finally, a covered institution’s non-compliance with statutory, regulatory, or
supervisory standards may also reflect inappropriate risk-taking that may lead to material
financial loss at a covered institution. The proposed rule would require a forfeiture and
downward adjustment review whenever any such non-compliance (1) results in an
enforcement or legal action against the covered institution brought by a Federal or state
regulator or agency; or (2) requires the covered institution to restate a financial statement
to correct a material error. The Federal Banking Agencies have found that it is
appropriate for a covered institution to conduct a forfeiture and downward adjustment
review under these circumstances because in many cases a statutory, regulatory, or
supervisory standard may have been put in place in order to prevent a covered person
from taking an inappropriate risk. In addition, non-compliance with a statute, regulation,
or supervisory standard may also give rise to inappropriate compliance risk for a covered
institution. A forfeiture and downward adjustment review would allow the institution to
assess whether this type of non-compliance should affect a senior executive officer or
significant risk-taker’s incentive-based compensation.
§__.7(b)(3) Senior executive officers and significant risk-takers affected by
forfeiture and downward adjustment.
A forfeiture and downward adjustment review would be required to consider
forfeiture and downward adjustment of incentive-based compensation for a senior
executive officer and significant risk-taker with direct responsibility or responsibility due
247

to the senior executive officer or significant risk-taker’s role or position in the covered
institution’s organizational structure, for the events that would trigger a forfeiture and
downward adjustment review as described in section __.7(b)(2). Covered institutions
should consider not only senior executive officers or significant risk-takers who are
directly responsible for an event that triggers a forfeiture or downward adjustment
review, but also those senior executive officers or significant risk-takers whose roles and
responsibilities include areas where failures or poor performance contributed to, or failed
to prevent, a triggering event. This requirement would discourage senior executive
officers and significant risk-takers who can influence outcomes from failing to report or
prevent inappropriate risk. A covered institution conducting a forfeiture and downward
adjustment review may also consider forfeiture for other covered persons at its discretion.
§__.7(b)(4) Determining forfeiture and downward adjustment amounts.
The proposed rule sets out factors that Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions
must consider, at a minimum, when making a determination to reduce incentive-based
compensation as a result of a forfeiture or downward adjustment review. A Level 1 or
Level 2 covered institution would be responsible for determining how much of a
reduction in incentive-based compensation is warranted, consistent with the policies and
procedures it establishes under §_.11(b), and should be able to support its decisions that
such an adjustment was appropriate if requested by its appropriate Federal regulator. In
reducing the amount of incentive-based compensation, covered institutions may reduce
the dollar amount of deferred cash or cash to be awarded, may lower the amount of
equity-like instruments that have been deferred or were eligible to be awarded, or some

248

combination thereof. A reduction in the value of equity-like instruments due to market
fluctuations would not be considered a reduction for purposes of this review.
The proposed minimum factors that would be required to be considered when
determining the amount of incentive-based compensation to be reduced are: (1) the intent
of the senior executive officer or significant risk-taker to operate outside the risk
governance framework approved by the covered institution’s board of directors or to
depart from the covered institution’s policies and procedures; (2) the senior executive
officer’s or significant risk-taker’s level of participation in, awareness of, and
responsibility for, the events triggering the review; (3) any actions the senior executive
officer or significant risk-taker took or could have taken to prevent the events triggering
the review; (4) the financial and reputational impact of the events 191 triggering the review
as set forth in section __.7(b)(2) on the covered institution, the line or sub-line of
business, and individuals involved, as applicable, including the magnitude of any
financial loss and the cost of known or potential subsequent fines, settlements, and
litigation; (5) the causes of the events triggering the review, including any decisionmaking by other individuals; and (6) any other relevant information, including past
behavior and risk outcomes linked to past behavior attributable to the senior executive
officer or significant risk-taker.

191

Reputational impact or harm related to the actions of covered individuals refers to a potential
weakening of confidence in an institution as evidenced by negative reactions from customers,
shareholders, bondholders and other creditors, consumer and community groups, the press, or the
general public. Reputational impact is a factor currently considered by some institutions in their
existing forfeiture policies. See, e.g., Wells Fargo & Company 2016 Proxy Statement, page 47,
available at https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/annualreports/2016-proxy-statement.pdf; and Citigroup 2016 Proxy Statement, page 74, available at
http://www.citigroup.com/citi/investor/quarterly/2016/ar16cp.pdf?ieNocache=611.

249

The considerations identified constitute a minimum set of parameters that would
be utilized for exercising the discretion permissible under the proposed rule while still
holding senior executive officers and significant risk-takers accountable for inappropriate
risk-taking and other behavior that could encourage inappropriate risk-taking that could
lead to risk of material financial loss at covered institutions. For example, a covered
institution might identify a pattern of misconduct stemming from activities begun three
years before the review that ultimately leads to an enforcement action and reputational
damage to the covered institution. A review of facts and circumstances, including
consideration of the minimum review parameters set forth in the proposed rule, could
reveal that one individual knowingly removed transaction identifiers in order to facilitate
a trade or trades with a counterparty on whom regulators had applied Bank Secrecy Act
or Anti-Monetary Laundering sanctions. Several of the senior executive officer’s or
significant risk-taker’s peers might have been aware of this pattern of behavior but did
not report it to their managers. Under the proposed rule, the individual who knowingly
removed the identifiers would, in most cases, be subject to a greater reduction in
incentive-based compensation than those who were aware of but not participants in the
misconduct. However, those peers that were aware of the misconduct, managers
supervising the covered person directly involved in the misconduct, and control staff who
should have detected but failed to detect the behavior would be considered for a
reduction, depending on their role in the organization, and assuming the peers are now
senior executive officers or significant risk-takers.
The Agencies do not intend for these proposed factors to be exhaustive and
covered institutions should consider additional factors where appropriate. In addition,

250

covered institutions generally should impact incentive-based compensation as a result of
forfeiture and downward adjustment reviews to reflect the severity of the event that
triggered the review and the level of an individual’s involvement. Covered institutions
should be able to demonstrate to the appropriate Federal regulator that the impact on
incentive-based compensation was appropriate given the particular set of facts and
circumstances.
7.20 The Agencies invite comment on the forfeiture and downward adjustment requirements
of the proposed rule.
7.21 Should the rule limit the events that require a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution to
consider forfeiture and downward adjustment to adverse outcomes that occurred within a
certain time period? If so, why and what would be an appropriate time period? For
example, should the events triggering forfeiture and downward adjustment reviews be
limited to those events that occurred within the previous seven years?
7.22 Should the rule limit forfeiture and downward adjustment reviews to reducing only the
incentive-based compensation that is related to the performance period in which the
triggering event(s) occurred? Why or why not? Is it appropriate to subject unvested or
unawarded incentive-based compensation to the risk of forfeiture or downward
adjustment, respectively, if the incentive-based compensation does not specifically relate
to the performance in the period in which the relevant event occurred or manifested?
Why or why not?
7.23 Should the rule place all unvested deferred incentive-based compensation, including
amounts voluntarily deferred by Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions or senior
executive officers or significant risk-takers, at risk of forfeiture? Should only that

251

unvested deferred incentive-based compensation that is required to be deferred under
section ___.7(a) be at risk of forfeiture? Why or why not?
7.24 Are the events triggering a review that are identified in section ___.7(b)(2)
comprehensive and appropriate? If not, why not? Should the Agencies add “repeated
supervisory actions” as a forfeiture or downward adjustment review trigger and why?
Should the Agencies add “final enforcement or legal action” instead of the proposed
“enforcement or legal action” and why?
7.25 Is the list of factors that a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution must consider, at a
minimum, in determining the amount of incentive-based compensation to be forfeited or
downward adjusted by a covered institution appropriate? If not, why not? Are any of the
factors proposed unnecessary? Should additional factors be included?
7.26 Are the proposed parameters for forfeiture and downward adjustment review sufficient to
provide an appropriate governance framework for making forfeiture decisions while still
permitting adequate discretion for covered institutions to take into account specific facts
and circumstances when making determinations related to a wide variety of possible
outcomes? Why or why not?
7.27

Should the rule include a presumption of some amount of forfeiture for particularly
severe adverse outcomes and why? If so, what should be the amount and what would
those outcomes be?

7.28

What protections should covered institutions employ when making forfeiture and
downward adjustment determinations?

7.29 In order to determine when forfeiture and downward adjustment should occur, should
Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions be required to establish a formal process that

252

both looks for the occurrence of trigger events and fulfills the requirements of the
forfeiture and downward adjustment reviews under the proposed rule? If not, why not?
Should covered institutions be required as part of the forfeiture and downward adjustment
review process to establish formal review committees including representatives of control
functions and a specific timetable for such reviews? Should the answer to this question
depend on the size of the institution considered?
§__.7(c) Clawback.
As used in the proposed rule, the term “clawback” means a mechanism by which
a covered institution can recover vested incentive-based compensation from a covered
person. The proposed rule would require Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions to
include clawback provisions in incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior
executive officers and significant risk-takers that, at a minimum, would allow for the
recovery of up to 100 percent of vested incentive-based compensation from a current or
former senior executive officer or significant risk-taker for seven years following the date
on which such compensation vests. Under section ___.7(c) of the proposed rule, all
vested incentive-based compensation for senior executive officers and significant risktakers, whether it had been deferred before vesting or paid out immediately upon award,
would be required to be subject to clawback for a period of no less than seven years
following the date on which such incentive-based compensation vests. Clawback would
be exercised under an identified set of circumstances. These circumstances include
situations where a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker engaged in:

253

(1) misconduct that resulted in significant financial or reputational harm 192 to the covered
institution; (2) fraud; or (3) intentional misrepresentation of information used to
determine the senior executive officer’s or significant risk-taker’s incentive-based
compensation. 193 The clawback provisions would apply to all vested incentive-based
compensation, whether that incentive-based compensation had been deferred or paid out
immediately when awarded. If a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution discovers that a
senior executive officer or significant risk-taker was involved in one of the triggering
circumstances during a past performance period, the institution would potentially be able
to recover from that senior executive officer or significant risk-taker incentive-based
compensation that was awarded for that performance period and has already vested. A
covered institution could require clawback irrespective of whether the senior executive
officer or significant risk-taker was currently employed by the covered institution.
The proposed set of triggering circumstances would constitute a minimum set of
outcomes for which covered institutions would be required to consider recovery of vested
incentive-based compensation. Covered institutions would retain flexibility to include
other circumstances or outcomes that would trigger additional use of such provisions.
In addition, while the proposed rule would require the inclusion of clawback
provisions in incentive-based compensation arrangements, the proposed rule would not
require that Level 1 or Level 2 covered institutions exercise the clawback provision, and
192

As described in the above note 191, reputational impact or harm of an event related to the
actions of covered individuals refers to a potential weakening of confidence in an institution as
evidenced by negative reactions from customers, shareholders, bondholders and other creditors,
consumer and community groups, the press, or the general public.
193
As with other provisions in this proposed rule, the clawback requirement would not apply to
incentive-based compensation plans and arrangements in place at the time the proposed rule is
final because those plans and arrangements would be grandfathered.

254

the proposed rule does not prescribe the process that covered institutions should use to
recover vested incentive-based compensation. Facts, circumstances, and all relevant
information should determine whether and to what extent it is reasonable for a Level 1 or
Level 2 covered institution to seek recovery of any or all vested incentive-based
compensation.
The Agencies recognize that clawback provisions may provide another effective
tool for Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions to deter inappropriate risk-taking
because it lengthens the time horizons of incentive-based compensation. 194 The Agencies
are proposing that vested incentive-based compensation be subject to clawback for up to
seven years. The Agencies are proposing seven years as the length of the review period
because it is slightly longer than the length of the average business cycle in the United
States and is close to the lower end of the range of average credit cycles. 195 Also, the
Agencies observe that seven years is consistent with some international standards. 196
By proposing seven years as the length of the review period, the Agencies intend
to encourage institutions to fairly compensate covered persons and incentivize
appropriate risk-taking, while also recognizing that recovering amounts that have already

been paid is more difficult than reducing compensation that has not yet been paid. The
Agencies are concerned that a clawback period that is too short or one that is too long, or
even infinite, could result in the covered person ignoring or discounting the effect of the
clawback period and accordingly, could be less effective in balancing risk-taking.
Additionally, a very long or even infinite clawback period may be difficult to implement.
While the Agencies did not propose a clawback requirement in the 2011 Proposed
Rule, mandatory clawback provisions are not a new concept. Commenters to the 2011
Proposed Rule advocated that the Agencies adopt measures to allow shareholders (and
others) to recover incentive-based compensation already paid to covered persons. As
discussed above, clawback provisions are now increasingly common at the largest
financial institutions. The largest (and mostly publicly traded) covered institutions are
already subject to a number of overlapping clawback regimes as a result of statutory
requirements 197 Over the past several years, many financial institutions have further
refined such mechanisms. 198 Most often, clawbacks allow banking institutions to recoup
incentive-based compensation in cases of financial restatement, misconduct, or poor
financial outcomes. A number of covered institutions have gone beyond these minimum
parameters to include situations where poor risk management has led to financial or

reputational damage to the firm. 199 The Agencies were cognizant of these developments
in proposing the clawback provision in section ___.7(c).
The Agencies propose the three triggers referenced above for several reasons.
First, a number of the specified triggers reflect better practice at covered institutions
today. 200 The factors triggering clawback are based on existing clawback requirements
that appear in some covered institutions’ incentive-based compensation arrangements.
Second, while many of the clawback regulatory regimes currently in place focus only on
accounting restatements or material misstatements of financial results, the proposed
triggers focus more broadly on risk-related outcomes that are more likely to contribute
meaningfully to the balance of incentive-based compensation arrangements. Third, the
proposed rule would extend coverage of clawback mechanisms to include additional
senior executive officers or significant risk-takers whose inappropriate risk-taking may
not result in an accounting restatement, but would inflict harm on the covered institution
nonetheless.

clawback if, among other things, “the employee engaged in conduct detrimental to the Firm that
causes material financial or reputational harm to the Firm”).

This provision would go beyond, but not conflict with, clawback provisions in
other areas of law. 201 For example, covered institutions that issue securities also may be
subject to clawback requirements pursuant to statutes administered by the SEC:
o Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 202 provides that if an issuer is
required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of
the issuer, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirements under
the securities laws, the CEO and chief financial officer of the issuer shall reimburse
the issuer for (i) any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation
received by that person from the issuer during the 12-month period following the first
public issuance or filing with the SEC (whichever first occurs) of the financial
document embodying such financial reporting requirement and (ii) any profits
realized from the sale of securities of the issuer during that 12-month period.
o Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act added Section 10D to the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. 203 Specifically, Section 10D(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires
the SEC to adopt rules directing the national securities exchanges 204 and the national

in compliance with the requirements of Section 10D(b). Section 10D(b) requires the
SEC to adopt rules directing the exchanges to establish listing standards to require
each issuer to develop and implement a policy providing:
(1) for the disclosure of the issuer’s policy on incentive-based compensation that is
based on financial information required to be reported under the securities laws;
and
(2) that, in the event that the issuer is required to prepare an accounting restatement
due to the issuer’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting
requirement under the securities laws, the issuer will recover from any of the
issuer’s current or former executive officers who received incentive-based
compensation (including stock options awarded as compensation) during the
three-year period preceding the date the issuer is required to prepare the
accounting restatement, based on the erroneous data, in excess of what would
have been paid to the executive officer under the accounting restatement.
The SEC has proposed rules to implement the requirements of Exchange Act Section

A “national securities association” is an association of brokers and dealers registered as such

7.34 Do the triggers discussed above effectively achieve the goals of section 956? Should the
triggers be based on those contained in section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act?
7.35 Should the Agencies provide additional guidance on the types of behavior that would
constitute misconduct for purposes of section __.7(c)(1)?
7.36 Should the rule include a presumption of some amount of clawback for particularly
severe adverse outcomes? Why or why not? If so, what should be the amount and what
would those outcomes be?
§ ___.8

Additional Prohibitions for Level 1 and Level 2 Covered Institutions

Section ___.8 of the proposed rule would establish additional prohibitions for
Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions to address practices that, in the view of the
Agencies, could encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to material financial loss at
covered institutions. The Agencies’ views are based in part on supervisory experiences
in reviewing and supervising incentive-based compensation at some covered institutions,
as described earlier in this Supplemental Information section. Under the proposed rule,
an incentive-based compensation arrangement at a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution
would be considered to appropriately balance risk and reward, as required by section

260

___.4(c)(1) of the proposed rule, only if the covered institution complies with the
prohibitions of section ___.8.
§ __.8(a) Hedging
Section __.8(a) of the proposed rule would prohibit Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions from purchasing hedging instruments or similar instruments on behalf of
covered persons to hedge or offset any decrease in the value of the covered person’s
incentive-based compensation. This prohibition would apply to all covered persons at a
Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution, not just senior executive officers and significant
risk-takers. Personal hedging strategies may undermine the effect of risk-balancing
mechanisms such as deferral, downward adjustment and forfeiture, or may otherwise
negatively affect the goals of these risk-balancing mechanisms and their overall efficacy
in inhibiting inappropriate risk-taking. 207 For example, a financial instrument, such as a
derivative security that increases in value as the price of a covered institution’s equity
decreases would offset the intended balancing effect of awarding incentive-based
compensation in the form of equity, the value of which is linked to the performance of
the covered institution.
Similarly, a hedging arrangement with a third party, under which the third party
would make direct or indirect payments to a covered person that are linked to or
commensurate with the amounts by which a covered person’s incentive-based
compensation is reduced by forfeiture, would protect the covered person against declines
207

This prohibition would not limit a covered institutions ability to hedge its own exposure in
deferred compensation obligations, which the Board, the OCC, and the FDIC continue to view as
prudent practice. (see, e.g., Federal Reserve SR Letter 04‐19 (Dec. 7, 2004); OCC Bulletin 2004‐
56 (Dec. 7, 2004); FDIC FIL-127-2004 (Dec. 7, 2004); OCC Interpretive Letter No. 878 (Dec.
22, 1999).

261

in the value of incentive-based compensation. In order for incentive-based compensation
to provide the appropriate incentive effects, covered persons should not be shielded from
exposure to the negative financial impact of taking inappropriate risks or other aspects of
their performance at the covered institution.
In the 2011 Proposed Rule, the Agencies stated that they were aware that covered
persons who received incentive-based compensation in the form of equity might wish to
use personal hedging strategies as a way to assure the value of deferred equity
compensation. 208 The Agencies expressed concern that such hedging during deferral
periods could diminish the alignment between risk and financial rewards that deferral
arrangements might otherwise achieve. 209 After considering supervisory experiences in
reviewing incentive-based compensation at some covered institutions and the purposes of
section 956 and related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Agencies are proposing a
prohibition on covered institutions purchasing hedging and similar instruments on behalf
of a covered person as a practical approach to eliminate the possibility that hedging
during deferral periods could diminish the alignment between risk and financial rewards
that deferral arrangements might otherwise achieve.
8.1.

The Agencies invite comment on whether this restriction on Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions prohibiting the purchase of a hedging instrument or similar
instrument on behalf of covered persons is appropriate to implement section 956
of the Dodd-Frank Act.

208

See 76 FR at 21183.
The Agencies note that one commenter to the 2011 Proposed Rule supported limits on
hedging.

209

262

8.2.

Are there additional requirements that should be imposed on covered institutions
with respect to hedging of the exposure of covered persons under incentive-based
compensation arrangements?

8.3.

Should the proposed rule include a prohibition on the purchase of a hedging
instrument or similar instrument on behalf of covered persons at Level 3
institutions?

§ __.8(b) Maximum incentive-based compensation opportunity
Section ___.8(b) of the proposed rule would limit the amount by which the actual
incentive-based compensation awarded to a senior executive officer or significant risktaker could exceed the target amounts for performance measure goals established at the
beginning of the performance period. It is the understanding of the Agencies that, under
current practice, covered institutions generally establish performance measure goals for
their covered persons at the beginning of, or early in, a performance period. At that time,
under some incentive-based compensation plans, those covered institutions establish
target amounts of incentive-based compensation that the covered persons can expect to be
awarded if they meet the established performance measure goals. Some covered
institutions also set out the additional amounts of incentive-based compensation, in
excess of the target amounts, that covered persons can expect to be awarded if they or the
covered institution exceed the performance measure goals. Incentive-based

263

compensation plans commonly set out maximum awards of 150 to 200 percent of the preset target amounts. 210
The proposed rule would prohibit a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution from
awarding incentive-based compensation to a senior executive officer in excess of 125
percent of the target amount for that incentive-based compensation. For a significant
risk-taker the limit would be 150 percent of the target amount for that incentive-based
compensation. This limitation would apply on a plan-by-plan basis, and, therefore,
would apply to long-term incentive plans separately from other incentive-based
compensation plans.
For example, a Level 1 covered institution might provide an incentive-based
compensation plan for its senior executive officers that links the amount awarded to a
senior executive officer to the covered institution’s four-year average return on assets
(ROA). The plan could establish a target award amount of $100,000 and a target fouryear average ROA of 75 basis points. That is, if the covered institution’s four-year
average ROA was 75 basis points, a senior executive officer would receive $100,000.
The plan could also provide that senior executive officers would earn nothing (zero
percent of target) under the plan if ROA was less than 50 basis points; $60,000 (60
percent of target) if ROA was 65 basis points; and $125,000 (125 percent of target) if
ROA was 100 basis points. Under the proposed rule, the plan would not be permitted to

210

See, e.g., Arthur Gallagher & Co., “Study of 2013 Short- and Long-Term Incentive Design
Criterion Among Top 200 S&P 500 Companies” (December 5, 2014), available at
http://www.ajg.com/media/1420659/study-of-2013-short-and-long-term-incentive-designcriterion-among-top-200.pdf.

264

provide, for example, $130,000 (130 percent of target) if ROA was 100 basis points or
$150,000 (150 percent of target) if ROA was 110 basis points.
The Agencies are proposing these limits, in part, because they are consistent with
the current industry practice at large banking organizations. Moreover, high levels of
upside leverage (e.g., 200 percent to 300 percent above the target amount) could lead to
senior executive officers and significant risk-takers taking inappropriate risks to
maximize the opportunity to double or triple their incentive-based compensation.
Recognizing the potential for inappropriate risk-taking with such high levels of leverage,
the Federal Banking Agencies have worked with large banking organizations to reduce
leverage levels to a range of 125 percent to 150 percent. Such a range continues to
provide for flexibility in the design and operation of incentive-based compensation
arrangements in covered institutions while it addresses the potential for inappropriate
risk-taking where leverage opportunities are large or uncapped. For a full example of
how these requirements would work in practice, please see Appendix A of this
Supplementary Information section.
The proposed rule would set different maximums for senior executive officers and
for significant risk-takers because senior executive officers and significant risk-takers
have the potential to expose covered institutions to different types and levels of risk, and
may be motivated by different types and amounts of incentive-based compensation. The
Agencies intend the different limitations to reflect the differences between the risks posed
by senior executive officers and significant risk-takers.
The Agencies emphasize that the proposed limits on a covered employee’s
maximum incentive-based compensation opportunity would not equate to a ceiling on
265

overall incentive-based compensation. Such limits would represent only a constraint on
the percentage by which incentive-based compensation could exceed the target amount,
and is aimed at prohibiting the use of particular features of incentive-based compensation
arrangements which can contribute to inappropriate risk-taking.
8.4. The Agencies invite comment on whether the proposed rule should establish different
limitations for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers, or whether the
proposed rule should impose the same percentage limitation on senior executive
officers and significant risk-takers.
8.5. The Agencies also seek comment on whether setting a limit on the amount that
compensation can grow from the time the target is established until an award occurs
would achieve the goals of section 956.
8.6. The Agencies invite comment on the appropriateness of the limitation, i.e., 125 percent
and 150 percent for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers, respectively.
Should the limitations be set higher or lower and, if so, why?
8.7. Should the proposed rule apply this limitation on maximum incentive-based
compensation opportunity to Level 3 institutions?
§ __.8(c) Relative performance measures
Under section ___.8(c) of the proposed rule, a Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institution would be prohibited from using incentive-based compensation performance
measures based solely on industry peer performance comparisons. This prohibition
would apply to incentive-based compensation arrangements for all covered persons at a

266

Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution, not just senior executive officers and significant
risk-takers.
As discussed above, covered institutions generally establish performance
measures for covered persons at the beginning of, or early in, a performance period. For
these types of plans, the performance measures (sometimes known as performance
metrics) are the basis upon which a covered institution determines the related amounts of
incentive-based compensation to be awarded to covered persons. These performance
measures can be absolute, meaning they are based on the performance of the covered
person or the covered institution without reference to the performance of other covered
persons or covered institutions. In contrast, a relative performance measure is a
performance measure that compares a covered institution’s performance to that of so
called “peer institutions” or an industry average. The composition of peer groups is
generally decided by the individual covered institution. An example of an absolute
performance measure is total shareholder return (TSR). An example of a relative
performance measure is the rank of the covered institution’s TSR among the TSRs of
institutions in a pre-established peer group.
The Agencies have observed that incentive-based compensation arrangements
based solely on industry peer performance comparisons (a type of relative performance
measure) can cause covered persons to take inappropriate risks that could lead to material
financial loss. 211 For example, if a covered institution falls behind its industry peers, it
may use performance measures—and set goals for those measures—that lead to

211

Gong, Li, and Shin, “Relative Performance Evaluation and Related Peer Groups in Executive
Compensation Contracts,” 86 The Accounting Review 1007 (May 2011).

267

inappropriate risk-taking by covered persons in order to perform better than its industry
peers. Also, the performance of a covered institution can be strong relative to its peers,
but poor on an absolute basis (e.g., every institution in the peer group is performing
poorly, but the covered institution is the best of the group). Consequently, if incentivebased compensation arrangements were based only on relative performance measures,
they would, in that circumstance, reward covered employees for performance that is poor
on an absolute level but still better than that of the covered institution’s peer group.
Similarly, in cases where only relative performance measures are used and performance
is poor, performance-based vesting may still occur when peer performance is also poor.
Using a combination of relative and absolute performance measures as part of the
performance evaluation process can help maintain balance between financial rewards and
potential risks in such situations.
Additionally, covered persons do not know what level of performance is
necessary to meet or exceed target peer group rankings, as rankings will become known
only at the end of the performance period. As a result, covered employees may be
strongly incentivized to achieve exceptional levels of performance by taking
inappropriate risks to increase the likelihood that the covered institution will meet or
exceed the peer group ranking in order to maximize their incentive-based compensation.
Further, comparing an institution’s performance to a peer group can be misleading
because the members of the peer group are likely to have different business models,
product mixes, operations in different geographical locations, cost structures, or other
attributes that make comparisons between institutions inexact.

268

Relative performance measures, including industry peer performance measures,
may be useful when used in combination with absolute performance measures. Thus,
under the proposed rule, a covered institution would be permitted to use relative
performance measures in combination with absolute performance measures, but not in
isolation. For instance, a covered institution would not be in compliance with the
proposed rule if the performance of the CEO were assessed solely on the basis of total
shareholder return relative to a peer group. However, if the performance of the CEO
were assessed on the basis of institution-specific performance measures, such as earnings
per share and return on tangible common equity, along with the same relative TSR the
covered institution would comply with section ___.8(c) of the proposed rule (assuming
the CEO’s incentive-based compensation arrangement met the other requirements of the
rule, such as an appropriate balance of risk and reward).
8.8. The Agencies invite comment on whether the restricting on the use of relative
performance measures for covered persons at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions
in section ___.8(d) of the proposed rule is appropriate in deterring behavior that could
put the covered institution at risk of material financial loss. Should this restriction be
limited to a specific group of covered persons and why? What are the relative
performance measures being used in industry?
8.9. Should the proposed rule apply this restriction on the use of relative performance
measures to Level 3 institutions?
§ __.8(d) Volume-driven incentive-based compensation
Section ___.8(d) of the proposed rule would prohibit Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions from providing incentive-based compensation to a covered person that is
269

based solely on transaction or revenue volume without regard to transaction quality or the
compliance of the covered person with sound risk management. Under the proposed rule,
transaction or revenue volume could be used as a factor in incentive-based compensation
arrangements, but only in combination with other factors designed to cause covered
persons to account for the risks of their activities. This prohibition would apply to
incentive-based compensation arrangements for all covered persons at a Level 1 or
Level 2 covered institution, not just senior executive officers and significant risk-takers.
Incentive-based compensation arrangements that do not account for the risks
covered persons can take to achieve performance measures do not appropriately balance
risk and reward, as section ___.4(c)(1) of the proposed rule would require. An
arrangement that provides incentive-based compensation to a covered person based solely
on transaction or revenue volume, without regard to other factors, would not adequately
account for the risks to which the transaction in question could expose the covered
institution. For instance, an incentive-based compensation arrangement that rewarded
mortgage originators based solely on the volume of loans approved, without any
subsequent adjustment for the quality of the loans originated (such as adjustments for
early payment default or problems with representations and warranties) would not
adequately balance risk and financial rewards.
An incentive-based compensation arrangement with performance measures based
solely on transaction or revenue volume could incentivize covered persons to generate as
many transactions or as much revenue as possible without appropriate attention to
resulting risks. Such arrangements were noted in MLRs and similar reports where
compensation had been cited as a contributing factor to a financial institution’s failure
270

during the recent financial crisis. 212 In addition, many studies about the causes of the
recent financial crisis discuss how volume-driven incentive-based compensation lead to
inappropriate risk-taking and caused material financial loss to financial institutions.213
8.10. The Agencies invite comment on whether there are circumstances under which
consideration of transaction or revenue volume as a sole performance measure goal,
without consideration of risk, can be appropriate in incentive-based compensation
arrangements for Level 1 or Level 2 covered institutions.
8.11. Should the proposed rule apply this restriction on the use of volume-driven incentivebased compensation arrangements to Level 3 institutions?
§ ___.9

Risk Management and Controls Requirements for Level 1 and Level 2

Covered Institutions
Prior to the financial crisis that began in 2007, institutions rarely involved risk
management in either the design or monitoring of incentive-based compensation
arrangements. Federal Banking Agency reviews of compensation practices have shown
that one important development in the intervening years has been the increasing
integration of control functions in compensation design and decision-making. For

212

In accordance with section 38(k) of the FDIA, 12 U.S.C. 1831o(k), MLRs are conducted by
the Inspectors General of the appropriate Federal banking agency following the failure of insured
depository institutions.

instance, control functions are increasingly relied on to ensure that risk is properly
considered in incentive-based compensation programs. At the largest covered
institutions, the role of the board of directors in oversight of compensation programs
(including the oversight of supporting risk management processes) has also expanded.
Section ___.9 of the proposed rule would establish additional risk management
and controls requirements at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions. Without effective
risk management and controls, larger covered institutions could establish incentive-based
compensation arrangements that, in the view of the Agencies, 214 could encourage
inappropriate risks that could lead to material financial loss at covered institutions.
Under the proposed rule, an incentive-based compensation arrangement at a Level 1 or
Level 2 covered institution would be considered to be compatible with effective risk
management and controls, as required by section ___.4(c)(2) of the proposed rule, only if
the covered institution also complies with the requirements of section ___.9. In
proposing section __.9, the Agencies are also cognizant of comments received on the
2011 Proposed Rule. 215 In order to facilitate consistent adoption of the practices that

214

This view is based in part on supervisory experiences in reviewing and supervising incentivebased compensation at some covered institutions.
215

The 2011 Proposed Rule would have required incentive-based compensation arrangements to
be compatible with effective risk management and controls. A number of commenters offered
views on the proposed requirements, and some raised concerns. Some commenters emphasized
the importance of sound risk management practices in the area of incentive-based compensation.
However, a number of commenters also questioned whether the determination of an
“appropriate” role for risk management personnel should be left to the discretion of individual
institutions. In light of these comments, the proposed rule is designed to strike a reasonable
balance between requiring an appropriate role for risk management and allowing institutions the
ability to tailor their risk management practices to their business model. The proposed rule does
not include prescriptive standards. Instead, it would allow Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions to retain flexibility to determine the specific role that risk management and control
functions should play in incentive-based compensation processes, while still allowing for
appropriate oversight of incentive-based compensation arrangements.

272

contribute to incentive-based compensation arrangements that appropriately balance risk
and reward, the Agencies are proposing that the practices set forth in section ___.9 be
required for all Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions.
Section ___.9(a) of the proposed rule would establish minimum requirements for
a risk management framework at a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution by requiring
that such framework: (1) be independent of any lines of business; (2) include an
independent compliance program that provides for internal controls, testing, monitoring,
and training with written policies and procedures consistent with section ___.11 of the
proposed rule; and (3) be commensurate with the size and complexity of the covered
institution’s operations.
Generally, section ___.9(a) would require that Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions have a systematic approach to designing and implementing their incentivebased compensation arrangements and incentive-based compensation programs supported
by independent risk management frameworks with written policies and procedures, and
developed systems. These frameworks would include processes and systems for
identifying and reporting deficiencies; establishing managerial and employee
responsibility; and ensuring the independence of control functions. To be effective, an
independent risk management framework should have sufficient stature, authority,
resources and access to the board of directors.
Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions would be required to develop, as part of
their broader risk management framework, an independent compliance program for
incentive-based compensation. The Federal Banking Agencies have found that an
independent compliance program leads to more robust oversight of incentive-based
273

compensation programs, helps to avoid undue influence by lines of business, and
facilitates supervision. Agencies would expect such a compliance program to have
formal policies and procedures to support compliance with the proposed rule and to help
to ensure that risk is effectively taken into account in both design and decision-making
processes related to incentive-based compensation. The requirements for such policies
and procedures are set forth in section ___.11 of the proposed rule.
The requirements of the proposed rule would encourage Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions to develop well-targeted internal controls that work within the
covered institution’s broader risk management framework to support balanced risktaking. Independent control functions should regularly monitor and test the covered
institution’s incentive-based compensation program and its arrangements to validate their
effectiveness. Training would generally include communication to employees of the
covered institution’s compliance risk management standards and policies and procedures,
and communication to managers on expectations regarding risk adjustment and
documentation.
The Agencies note that independent compliance programs consistent with these
proposed requirements are already in place at a significant number of larger covered
institutions, in part due to supervisory efforts such as the Board’s ongoing horizontal
review of incentive-based compensation, 216 Enhanced Prudential Standards from section
165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, 217 and the OCC’s Heightened Standards. 218 For example,
control function employees monitor compliance with policies and procedures and help to
216

See 2011 FRB White Paper.
See 12 CFR Part 252.
218
See 12 CFR Part 30, Appendix D.
217

274

ensure robust documentation of compensation decisions, including those relating to
forfeiture and risk-adjustment processes. Institutions have also improved communication
to managers and employees about how risk adjustment should work and have developed
processes to review the application of related guidance in order to ensure better
consideration of risk in compensation decisions. The Agencies are proposing to require
similar compliance programs at covered institutions not subject to the supervisory efforts
described above, as well as to reinforce the practices of covered institutions that already
have such compliance programs in place.
Section ___.9(b) of the proposed rule would require Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions to provide individuals engaged in control functions with the authority to
influence the risk-taking of the business areas they monitor and to ensure covered persons
engaged in control functions are compensated in accordance with the achievement of
performance objectives linked to their control functions and independent of the
performance of the business areas they oversee. These protections are intended to
mitigate potential conflicts of interest that might undermine the role covered persons
engaged in control functions play in supporting incentive-based compensation
arrangements that appropriately balance risk and reward.
Under section___.9(c) of the proposed rule, Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions would be required to provide for independent monitoring of: (1) incentivebased compensation plans to identify whether those plans appropriately balance risk and
reward; (2) events relating to forfeiture and downward adjustment reviews and decisions
related thereto; and (3) compliance of the incentive-based compensation program with
the covered institution’s policies and procedures.
275

To be considered independent under the proposed rule, the group or person at the
covered institution responsible for monitoring the areas described above generally should
have a reporting line to senior management or the board that is separate from the covered
persons whom the group or person is responsible for monitoring. Some covered
institutions may use internal audit to perform the independent monitoring that would be
required under this section. 219 The type of independent monitoring conducted to fulfill
the requirements of section ___.9(c) generally should be appropriate to the size and
complexity of the covered institution and its use of incentive-based compensation. For
example, a Level 1 covered institution might be expected to use a different scope and
type of data and analysis to monitor its incentive-based compensation program than a
Level 2 covered institution. Likewise, a covered institution that offers incentive-based
compensation to only a few employees may require a less formal monitoring process than
a covered institution that offers many types of incentive-based compensation to many of
its employees.
Section ___.9(c)(1) of the proposed rule would require covered institutions to
periodically review all incentive-based compensation plans to assess whether those plans
provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward. Monitoring the incentives
embedded in plans, rather than the individual arrangements that rely on those plans,
provides an opportunity to identify incentives for imprudent risk-taking. It also reduces
burden on covered institutions in a reasonable way in light of the proposed rule’s
additional protections against excessive risk-taking which operate at the level of

219

At OCC-supervised institutions, the independent monitoring required under section ___.9(c)
would be carried out by internal audit.

276

incentive-based compensation arrangements. Supervisory experience indicates that many
covered institutions already periodically perform such a review, and the Agencies
consider it a better practice. Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions should have
procedures for collecting information about the effects of their incentive-based
compensation arrangements on employee risk-taking, and have systems and processes for
using this information to adjust incentive-based compensation arrangements in order to
eliminate or reduce unintended incentives for inappropriate risk-taking.
Under Section ___.9(c)(2), covered institutions would be required to provide for
the independent monitoring of all events related to forfeiture and downward adjustment.
With regard to forfeiture and downward adjustment decisions, covered institutions would
be expected to regularly monitor the events that could trigger a forfeiture and downward
adjustment review. Many covered institutions also regularly conduct independent
monitoring and testing activities, or broad-based risk reviews, that could reveal instances
of inappropriate risk-taking. The policies and procedures established under section
__.11(b) would be expected to specify that covered institutions would evaluate whether
inappropriate risk-taking identified in the course of any independent monitoring and
testing activities triggered a forfeiture and downward adjustment review. The frequency
of reviews may vary depending on the size and complexity of, and the level of risks at,
the covered institution, but they should occur often enough to reasonably monitor risks
and events related to the forfeiture and downward adjustment triggers. 220 When these
reviews uncover events that trigger forfeiture and downward adjustment reviews, Level 1
and Level 2 covered institutions would be required to complete such a review, consistent
220

See section ___.7(b)(2).

277

with the requirements of section ___.7(b). They would also be required to monitor
adherence to policies and procedures that support effective balancing of risk and rewards.
Many covered institutions currently perform forfeiture reviews in the context of broader
and more regular risk reviews to ensure that the forfeiture review process appropriately
captures all risk-taking activity. The Agencies view this approach as better practice, as
decisions about appropriate adjustment of compensation in such circumstances are only
one desired outcome. For instance, identification of risk events generally should lead not
only to consideration of compensation adjustments, but also to analysis of whether there
are weaknesses in broader controls or risk management oversight that need to be
addressed. In their supervisory experience, the Federal Banking Agencies have found
that tying forfeiture reviews to broader risk reviews is a better practice.
Section ___.9(c)(3) of the proposed rule would require covered institutions to
provide for independent compliance monitoring of the institution’s incentive-based
compensation program with policies and procedures. To be considered independent
under the proposed rule, the group or person at the covered institution monitoring
compliance should have a separate reporting line to senior management or to the board of
directors from the business line or group being monitored, but may be conducted by
groups within the covered institution. For example, internal audit could review whether
award disbursement and vesting policies were adhered to and whether documentation of
such decisions was sufficient to support independent review. Such independence will
help ensure that the monitoring is unbiased and identifies appropriate issues.
The Agencies have taken the position that Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions should regularly review whether the design and implementation of their
278

incentive-based compensation arrangements deliver appropriate risk-taking incentives.
Independent monitoring should enable covered institutions to correct deficiencies and
make necessary improvements in a timely fashion based on the results of those
reviews. 221
9.1

Some Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions are subject to separate risk

management and controls requirements under other statutory or regulatory regimes.
For example, OCC-supervised Level 1 and Level 2 covered institution are subject to the
OCC’s Heightened Standards. Is it clear to commenters how the risk management and
controls requirements under the proposed rule would interact, if at all, with
requirements under other statutory or regulatory regimes?
§ ___.10

Governance Requirements for Level 1 and Level 2 Covered

Institutions
Section ___.10 of the proposed rule contains specific governance requirements
that would apply to Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions. Under the proposed rule, an
incentive-based compensation arrangement at a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution
would be considered to be supported by effective governance, as required by section
___.4(c)(3) of the proposed rule, only if the covered institution also complies with the
requirements of section ___.10.

221

The 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance mentions several practices that can contribute to
the effectiveness of such activity, including internal reviews and audits of compliance with
policies and procedures, and monitoring of results relative to expectations. For instance, internal
audit should assess the effectiveness of the compliance risk management program by performing
regular independent reviews and evaluating whether internal controls, policies, and processes that
limit incentive-based compensation risk are effective and appropriate for the covered institution’s
activities and associated risks.

279

As discussed earlier in this Supplementary Information section, the supervisory
experience of the Federal Banking Agencies at large consolidated financial institutions is
that effective oversight by a covered institution’s board of directors, including review and
approval by the board of the overall goals and purposes of the covered institution’s
incentive-based compensation program, is essential to the attainment of incentive-based
compensation arrangements that do not encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to
material financial loss to the covered institution.
Accordingly, section ___.10(a) of the proposed rule would require that a Level 1
or Level 2 covered institution establish a compensation committee, composed solely of
directors who are not senior executive officers, to assist the board in carrying out its
responsibilities related to incentive-based compensation. 222 Having an independent
compensation committee is consistent with the emphasis the Agencies place on the need
for incentive-based compensation arrangements to be compatible with effective risk
management and controls and supported by effective governance. In response to the
2011 Proposed Rule, some commenters expressed a view that an independent
compensation committee composed solely of non-management directors would have
helped to avoid potential conflicts of interest and more appropriate consideration of

222

As described above, under the Board’s and FDIC’s proposed rules, for a foreign banking
organization, “board of directors” would mean the relevant oversight body for the institution’s
U.S. branch, agency, or operations, consistent with the foreign banking organization’s overall
corporate and management structure. The Board and FDIC will work with foreign banking
organizations to determine the appropriate persons to carry out the required functions of a
compensation committee under the proposed rule. Likewise, under the OCC’s proposed rule, for
a Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank, “board of directors” would mean the relevant
oversight body for the Federal branch or agency, consistent with its overall corporate and
management structure. The OCC would work closely with Federal branches and agencies to
determine the person or committee to undertake the responsibilities assigned to the oversight
body.

280

management proposals, particularly proposed awards and payouts for senior executive
officers.
Section ___.10(b) of the proposed rule would require that compensation
committees at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions obtain input and assessments from
various parties. For example, the compensation committees would be required to obtain
input on the effectiveness of risk measures and adjustments used to balance risk and
reward in incentive-based compensation arrangements from the risk and audit committees
of the covered institution’s board of directors, or groups performing similar functions,
and from the covered institution’s risk management function. The proposed requirements
would help protect covered institutions against inappropriate risk-taking that could lead
to material financial loss by leveraging the expertise and experience of these parties.
In their review of the incentive-based compensation practices of many of the
largest covered institutions, the Federal Banking Agencies have noted that the
compensation, risk, and audit committees of the boards of directors collaborate and seek
advice from risk management and other control functions before making decisions.
Many of these covered institutions have members of the compensation committee that are
also members of the risk and audit committees. Some covered institutions rely on regular
meetings between the compensation and risk committees, while others rely on more ad
hoc communications. Human resources, risk management, finance, and audit committees

281

work with compensation committees to ensure that compensation systems attain multiple
objectives, including appropriate risk-taking. 223
Section __.10(b)(2) of the proposed rule would require the compensation
committees to obtain from management, on an annual or more frequent basis, a written
assessment of the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation program and
related compliance and control processes. The report should assess the extent to which
the program and processes provide risk-taking incentives that are consistent with the
covered institution’s risk profile. Management would be required to develop the
assessment with input from the covered institutions’ risk and audit committees, or groups
performing similar functions, and from individuals in risk management and audit
functions. In addition to the written assessment submitted by management, section
__.10(b)(3) of the proposed rule would require the compensation committee to obtain
another written assessment on the same matter, submitted on an annual or more frequent
basis, by the internal audit or risk management function of the covered institution. This
written assessment would be developed independently of the covered institution’s
management.
The Agencies are proposing that the independent compensation committee of the
board of directors to be the recipient of such input and written assessments.
Developing incentive-based compensation arrangements that provide balanced
risk-taking incentives and monitoring arrangements to ensure they achieve balance

223

See generally 2011 FRB White Paper; FSB, “FSB 2015 Workshop on Compensation
Practices” (April 14, 2015), available at http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/Summary-of-theApril-2015-FSB-workshop-on-compensation-practices.pdf.

requires an understanding of the full spectrum of risks (including compliance risks) and
potential risk outcomes associated with the activities of covered persons. For this reason,
risk-management and other control functions generally should each have an appropriate
role in the covered institution’s processes, not only for designing incentive-based
compensation arrangements, but also for assessing their effectiveness in providing risktaking incentives that are consistent with the risk profile of the institution. The proposed
rule sets forth two separate effectiveness assessments: (1) an assessment under the
auspices of management, but reliant on risk management and audit functions, as well as
the audit and risk committees of the board, and (2) an assessment conducted by the
internal audit or risk management function of the covered institution, independent of
management.
In support of the first requirement, a covered institution’s management has a full
understanding of both the entirety of the covered institution’s activities and a detailed
understanding of its incentive-based compensation program, including both the
performance that the covered institution intends to reward and the risks to which covered
persons can expose the covered institution. An understanding of the full compensation
program (including the effectiveness of risk measures across various lines of business,
the measurement of actual risk outcomes, and the analysis of risk-taking and risk
outcomes relative to incentive-based compensation payments) requires a large degree of
technical expertise. It also requires an understanding of the wider strategic and risk
management frameworks in place at the covered institution (including the various
objectives that compensation programs seek to balance, such as recruiting and retention
goals and prudent risk management). While the board of directors at a covered institution

283

is ultimately responsible for the balance of incentive-based compensation arrangements,
and for an incentive-based compensation program that incentivizes behaviors consistent
with the long-term health of the organization, the board should generally hold senior
management accountable for effectively executing the covered institution’s incentivebased compensation program, and for modifying it when weaknesses are identified.
In addition, some Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions use automated systems
to monitor the effectiveness of incentive-based compensation arrangements in balancing
risk-taking incentives, especially systems that support capture of relevant data in
databases that support monitoring and analysis. Management plays a role in all of these
activities and is well-positioned to oversee an analysis that considers such a wide variety
of inputs. In order to ensure that considerations of risk-taking are included in such an
exercise, an active role for independent control functions is critical in such a review as
well as input from the risk and audit committees of the board of directors, or groups
performing similar functions. Periodic presentations by the chief risk officer or other risk
management staff to the board of directors can help complement the annual effectiveness
review.
In addition, the proposed rule includes a requirement that internal audit or risk
management submit a written assessment of the effectiveness of a Level 1 or Level 2
covered institution’s incentive-based compensation program and related control processes
in providing risk-taking incentives that are consistent with the risk profile of the covered
institution. Regular internal reviews and audits of compliance with policies and
procedures are important to helping implement the incentive-based compensation system
as intended by those employees involved in incentive-based compensation decision284

making. Internal audit and risk management are well-positioned to provide an
independent perspective on a covered institution’s incentive-based compensation
program and related control processes. The Federal Banking Agencies have observed
that compensation committees benefit from an independent analysis of the effectiveness
of their covered institutions’ incentive-based compensation programs. 224
The proposed requirement takes into consideration comments received on the
policies and procedures standards embodied in the 2011 Proposed Rule that would have
required the covered financial institution’s board of directors, or a committee thereof, to
receive data and analysis from management and other sources sufficient to allow the
board, or committee thereof, to assess whether the overall design and performance of the
institution’s incentive-based compensation arrangements were consistent with section
956. Many commenters on the 2011 Proposed Rule expressed concern that the proposed
requirements in the 2011 Proposed Rule would have inappropriately expanded the
traditional “oversight” role of the board and would have required the board to exercise
judgment in areas that traditionally have been—and, in the view of some commenters, are
best left to—the expertise and prerogative of management. Commenters suggested that
the proposed requirement instead place responsibility on management to conduct a
formal assessment of the effectiveness of the covered institution’s incentive-based
compensation program and related compliance and control processes. The Agencies
agree that management should be responsible for conducting such an assessment and
section ___.10(b)(2) of the proposed rule would thus place this responsibility on
224

For example, the 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance notes that a banking organization’s
risk-management processes and internal controls should reinforce and support the development
and maintenance of balanced incentive compensation arrangements.

285

management, while requiring input from risk and audit committees, or groups performing
similar functions, and from the covered institutions’ risk management and audit
functions. Under the proposed rule, the board’s primary focus would be oversight of
incentive-based compensation program and arrangements, while management would be
expected to implement a program consistent with the vision of the board.
10.1. The Agencies invite comment on this provision generally and whether the written
assessments required under sections___.10(b)(2) and___.10(b)(3) of the proposed rule
should be provided to the compensation committee on an annual basis or at more or less
frequent intervals?
10.2. Are both reports required under §__.10(b)(2) and (3) necessary to aid the compensation
committee in carrying out its responsibilities under the proposed rule? Would one or the
other be more helpful? Why or why not?
§ ___.11

Policies and Procedures Requirements for Level 1 and Level 2

Covered Institutions
Section ___.11 of the proposed rule would require Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions to develop and implement certain minimum policies and procedures relating
to their incentive-based compensation programs. Requiring covered institutions to
develop and follow policies and procedures related to incentive-based compensation
would help both covered institutions and regulators identify the incentive-based
compensation risks to which covered institutions are exposed, and how these risks are
managed so as not to incentivize inappropriate risk-taking by covered persons that could
lead to material financial loss to the covered institution. The Agencies are not proposing
to require specific policies and procedures of Level 3 covered institutions because these
286

institutions are generally less complex and the impact to the financial system by risks
taken at these covered institutions is not as significant as risks taken by covered persons
at the larger, more complex covered institutions. In addition, by not requiring additional
policies and procedures, Agencies intend to reduce burden on smaller covered
institutions. In contrast, the larger Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions generally will
have more complex organizations that tend to conduct a wide range of business activities
and therefore will need robust policies and procedures as part of their compliance
programs. 225 Therefore, under section ___.11 of the proposed rule, Level 3 covered
institutions would not be subject to any specific requirements in this area, while Level 1
and Level 2 covered institutions would be required to develop and implement specific
policies and procedures for their incentive-based compensation programs.
Section ___.11 of the proposed rule would identify certain areas that the policies
and procedures of Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions would, at a minimum, have to
address. The list is not exhaustive. Instead, it is meant to indicate the policies and
procedures that would, at a minimum, be necessary to carry out the requirements in other
sections of the proposed rule.
The development and implementation of the policies and procedures under
section ___.11 of the proposed rule would help to ensure and monitor compliance with
the requirements set forth in section 956 and the other requirements in the proposed rule
because the policies and procedures would set clear expectations for covered persons and
allow the Agencies to better understand how a covered institution’s incentive-based
225

See Federal Reserve SR Letter 08-08, “Compliance Risk Management Programs and
Oversight at Large Banking Organizations with Complex Compliance Profiles” (October 16,
2008).

287

compensation program operates. Section ___.11(a) of the proposed rule would contain
the general requirement that the policies and procedures be consistent with the
prohibitions and requirements under the proposed rule. Other parts of section ___.11 of
the proposed rule would help to ensure and monitor compliance with specific portions of
the proposed rule.
Under section ___.11(b) of the proposed rule, a Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institution would have to develop and implement policies and procedures that specify the
substantive and procedural criteria for the application of forfeiture and clawback,
including the process for determining the amount of incentive-based compensation to be
clawed back. These policies and procedures would provide covered persons with notice
of the circumstances that would lead to forfeiture and clawback at their covered
institutions, including any circumstances identified by the covered institution in addition
to those required under the proposed rule. They would also help ensure consistent
application of forfeiture and clawback by establishing a common set of expectations.
Policies and procedures should make clear the triggers that will result in
consideration of forfeiture, downward adjustment, and clawback; should indicate what
individuals or committees are responsible for identifying, escalating and resolving these
issues in such cases; should ensure that control functions contribute relevant information
and participate in any decisions; and should set out a clear process for determining
responsibility for the events triggering the forfeiture and downward adjustment review
including provisions requiring appropriate input from covered employees under
consideration for forfeiture or clawback.

288

The proposed rule also would require that Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions’ policies and procedures require the maintenance of documentation of final
forfeiture, downward adjustment, and clawback decisions under section __.11(c) of the
proposed rule. Documentation would allow control functions and the Agencies to
evaluate compliance with the requirements of section __.7 of the proposed rule. The
Agencies are proposing this requirement because they have found that it is critical that
forfeiture and downward adjustment reviews at covered institutions be supported by
effective governance to ensure consistency, fairness and robustness of all related
decision-making.
Section ___.11(d) of the proposed rule would include a requirement for policies
and procedures of Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions that would specify the
substantive and procedural criteria for acceleration of payments of deferred incentivebased compensation to a covered person consistent with sections __.7(a)(1)(iii)(B) and
__.7(a)(2)(iii)(B) of the proposed rule. Under section __.7 of the proposed rule,
acceleration of vesting of incentive-based compensation that is required to be deferred
under such section would only be permitted in the case of death or disability. A Level 1
or Level 2 covered institution would have to have policies and procedures that describe
how disability would be evaluated for purposes of determining whether to accelerate
payments of deferred incentive-based compensation.
Section __.11(e) would require Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions to have
policies and procedures that identify and describe the role of any employees, committees,
or groups authorized to make incentive-based compensation decisions, including when
discretion is authorized. A Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution’s policies and
289

procedures would also have to describe how discretion is expected to be exercised in
order to appropriately balance risk and reward and how the incentive-based compensation
arrangements will be monitored under sections __.11(f) and (h) of the proposed rule,
respectively.
Related to the requirements regarding disclosure under sections __.4(f) and __.5
of the proposed rule, under section __.11(g), a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution
would need to have policies and procedures that require the covered institution to
maintain documentation of the establishment, implementation, modification, and
monitoring of incentive-based compensation arrangements sufficient to support the
covered institution’s decisions. Section __.11(i) would require the policies and
procedures to specify the substantive and procedural requirements of the independent
compliance program, consistent with section __.9(a)(2). And section __.11(j) would
require policies and procedures that address the appropriate roles for risk management,
risk oversight, and other control function personnel in the covered institution’s processes
for (1) designing incentive-based compensation arrangements and determining awards,
deferral amounts, deferral periods, forfeiture, downward adjustment, clawback, and
vesting, and (2) assessing the effectiveness of incentive-based compensation
arrangements in restraining inappropriate risk-taking.
The Agencies anticipate that some Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions that
have international operations might choose to adopt enterprise-wide incentive-based
compensation policies and procedures. The Agencies recognize that such policies and
procedures, when utilized by various subsidiary institutions, may need to be further
modified to reflect local regulation and the requirements of home country regulators in
290

the case of international institutions and tailored to a certain extent by line of business,
legal entity, or business model.
11.1. The Agencies invite general comment on the proposed policies and procedures
requirements for Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions under section ___.11 of the
proposed rule.
§ ___.12

Indirect Actions

Section ___.12 of the proposed rule would prohibit a covered institution from
doing indirectly what it cannot do directly under the proposed rule. Section ___.12
would apply all of the proposed rule’s requirements and prohibitions to actions taken by
covered institutions indirectly or through or by any other person. Section ___.12 is
substantially the same as section ___.7 of the 2011 Proposed Rule. The Agencies did not
receive any comments on section ___.7 of the 2011 Proposed Rule.
By subjecting such indirect actions by covered institutions to all of the proposed
rule’s requirements and prohibitions, section ___.12 would implement the directive in
section 956(b) to adopt rules that prohibit any type of incentive-based payment
arrangement, or any feature of any such arrangement, that the Agencies determine
encourages inappropriate risks by covered institutions (1) by providing excessive
compensation, fees, or benefits or (2) that could lead to material financial loss. The
Agencies are concerned that a covered institution may take indirect actions in order to
avoid application of the proposed rule’s requirements and prohibitions. For example, a
covered institution could attempt to make substantial numbers of its covered persons
independent contractors for the purpose of avoiding application of the proposed rule’s
requirements and prohibitions. A covered institution could also attempt to make
291

substantial numbers of its covered persons employees of another entity for the purpose of
avoiding application of the proposed rule’s requirements and prohibitions. If left
unchecked, such indirect actions could encourage inappropriate risk-taking by providing
covered persons with excessive compensation or could lead to material financial loss at a
covered institution.
The Agencies, however, do not intend to disrupt indirect actions, including
independent contractor or employment relationships, not undertaken for the purpose of
avoiding application of the proposed rule’s requirements and prohibitions. Thus, the
Agencies would apply the proposed rule regardless of how covered institutions classify
their actions, while also recognizing that covered institutions may legitimately engage in
activities that are outside the scope of section 956 and the proposed rule. 226
NCUA’s proposed rule also would clarify that covered credit unions may not use
CUSOs to avoid the requirements of the proposed rule, such as by using CUSOs to
maintain non-compliant incentive-based compensation arrangements on behalf of senior
executive officers or significant risk-takers of Federally insured credit unions.
12.1. Commenters are invited to address all aspects of section ___.12, including any
examples of other indirect actions that the Agencies should consider.
§ ___.13

Enforcement.

By its terms, section 956 applies to any depository institution and any depository
institution holding company (as those terms are defined in section 3 of the FDIA), any
226

The Agencies note, however, that section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act does not, and the
proposed rule would not, limit the authority of the Agencies under other provisions of applicable
law and regulations.

292

broker-dealer registered under section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act, any credit
union, any investment adviser (as that term is defined in the Investment Advisers Act of
1940), the Federal National Mortgage Association, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation. Section 956 also applies to any other financial institution that the
appropriate Federal regulators jointly by rule determine should be treated as a covered
financial institution for purposes of section 956.
Section 956(d) also specifically sets forth the enforcement mechanism for rules
adopted under that section. The statute provides that section 956 and the implementing
rules shall be enforced under section 505 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and that a
violation of section 956 or the regulations under section 956 will be treated as a violation
of subtitle A of Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.
Section 505 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act provides for enforcement:
(1) under section 1818 of title 12, by the appropriate Federal banking agency, as
defined in section 1813(q) of title 12, 227 in the case of—
(A) national banks, Federal branches and Federal agencies of foreign
banks, and any subsidiaries of such entities (except brokers, dealers,
persons providing insurance, investment companies, and investment
advisers);
(B) member banks of the Federal Reserve System (other than national
banks), branches and agencies of foreign banks (other than Federal
227

For purposes of section 1813(q), the appropriate Federal banking agency for institutions listed
in paragraphs (A) and (D) is the OCC; for institutions listed in paragraphs (B), the Board; and for
institutions listed in paragraph (C), the FDIC. 12 U.S.C. 1813(q).

branches, Federal agencies, and insured State branches of foreign banks),
commercial lending companies owned or controlled by foreign banks,
organizations operating under section 25 or 25A of the Federal Reserve
Act [12 U.S.C. 601 et seq., 611 et seq.], and bank holding companies and
their nonbank subsidiaries or affiliates (except brokers, dealers, persons
providing insurance, investment companies, and investment advisers);
(C) banks insured by the FDIC (other than members of the Federal
Reserve System), insured State branches of foreign banks, and any
subsidiaries of such entities (except brokers, dealers, persons providing
insurance, investment companies, and investment advisers); and
(D) savings associations the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC,
and any subsidiaries of such savings associations (except brokers, dealers,
persons providing insurance, investment companies, and investment
advisers).
(2) under the Federal Credit Union Act [12 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.], by the Board of
the NCUA with respect to any federally insured credit union, and any subsidiaries
of such an entity;
(3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.], by the SEC
with respect to any broker or dealer;
(4) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a–1 et seq.], by the
SEC with respect to investment companies;

294

(5) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80b–1 et seq.], by the
SEC with respect to investment advisers registered with the Commission under
such Act;
(6) under State insurance law, in the case of any person engaged in providing
insurance, by the applicable State insurance authority of the State in which the
person is domiciled, subject to section 6701 of this title;
(7) under the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.], by the
Federal Trade Commission for any other financial institution or other person that
is not subject to the jurisdiction of any agency or authority under paragraphs (1)
through (6) of this subsection; and
(8) under subtitle E of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 [12 U.S.C.
5561 et seq.], by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, in the case of any
financial institution and other covered person or service provider that is subject to
the jurisdiction of the Bureau.
The proposed rule includes these enforcement provisions as provided in section
956.
FHFA’s enforcement authority for the proposed rule derives from its authorizing
statute, the Safety and Soundness Act. FHFA is not one of the “Federal functional
regulators” listed in section 505 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Additionally, the
applicability of Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
is limited by their conditional exclusion from that Title’s definition of “financial
institution.” But there is no evidence that Congress intended to exclude FHFA, or Fannie

295

Mae and Freddie Mac, from enforcement of the proposed rule. To the contrary, Congress
specifically included Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as covered financial institutions and
FHFA as an “appropriate federal regulator” in section 956, and FHFA requires no
additional enforcement authority. The Safety and Soundness Act provides FHFA with
enforcement authority for all laws and regulations that apply to its regulated entities.
13.1.

The Agencies invite comment on all aspects of section
___.13.

§ ___.14

NCUA and FHFA Covered Institutions in Conservatorship,

Receivership, or Liquidation.
The NCUA’s and FHFA’s proposed rules each include a section __.14 that would
address those instances when a covered institution is placed in conservatorship,
receivership, or liquidation, including limited-life regulated entities, under their
respective authorizing statutes, the Federal Credit Union Act or the Safety and Soundness
Act. 228 If a covered institution is placed in conservatorship, receivership, or liquidation,
the conservator, receiver, or liquidating agent, respectively, and not the covered
institution’s board or management, has ultimate authority over all compensation
arrangements, including any incentive-based compensation for covered persons. When
determining or approving any incentive-based compensation plans for covered persons at
such a covered institution, the conservator, receiver, or liquidating agent will implement
the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act by prohibiting excessive incentive-based

228

The FDIC’s proposed rule would not apply to institutions for which the FDIC is appointed
receiver under the FDIA or Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, as appropriate, as those statutes
govern such cases.

296

compensation and incentive-based compensation that encourages inappropriate risktaking.
Institutions placed in conservatorship, receivership, or liquidation may be subject
to different needs and circumstances with respect to attracting and retaining talent than
other types of covered institutions. In order to attract and retain qualified individuals at a
covered institution in conservatorship, for example, the conservator may determine that
while a significant portion of a covered person’s incentive-based compensation should be
deferred, due to the uncertain future of the covered institution in conservatorship, the
deferral period would be shorter than that set forth in the deferral provisions of the
proposed rule. In another example, where a conservator assumes the roles and
responsibilities of the covered institution’s board and its committees, the conservator may
determine that it is not necessary for the board of the covered institution, if any remains
in conservatorship, to approve a material adjustment to a senior executive officer’s
incentive-based compensation arrangement as described by the governance section of the
proposed rule.
Certain provisions of the proposed rule, such as the deferral and governance
provisions, may not be appropriate for institutions in conservatorship, receivership, or
liquidation, and the incentive-based compensation structure that best meets their needs
while implementing the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act is appropriately left to the
conservator, receiver, or liquidating agent, respectively. Under the applicable section
__.14 of the proposed rule, if a covered institution is placed in conservatorship,
receivership, or liquidation under the Safety and Soundness Act, for FHFA’s proposed
rule, or the Federal Credit Union Act, for the NCUA’s proposed rule, the respective
297

conservator, receiver, or liquidating agent would have the responsibility to fulfill the
requirements and purposes of 12 U.S.C. 5641. The conservator, receiver, or liquidating
agent also has the discretion to determine transition terms should the covered institution
cease to be in conservatorship, receivership, or liquidation.
14.1. Commenters are invited to address all aspects of section ___.14 of the proposed rule.
SEC Amendment to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4.
The SEC is proposing an amendment to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(e) (17 CFR
240.17a-4(e)) to require that broker-dealers maintain the records required by § ___.4(f),
and for Level 1 and Level 2 broker-dealers, §§ ___.5 and ___.11, in accordance with the
recordkeeping requirements of Exchange Act Rule 17a-4. Exchange Rule 17a-4
establishes the general formatting and storage requirements for records that brokerdealers are required to keep. For the sake of consistency with other broker-dealer
records, the SEC believes that broker-dealers should also keep the records required by §
___.4(f), and for Level 1 and Level 2 broker-dealers, §§ ___.5 and ___.11, in accordance
with these requirements.
New paragraph (e)(10) of Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 would require Level 1, Level
2, and Level 3 broker-dealers to maintain and preserve in an easily accessible place the
records required by § ___.4(f), and for Level 1 and Level 2 broker-dealers, the records
required by §§ ___.5 and ___.11. Paragraph (f) of Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 provides
that the records a broker-dealer is required to maintain and preserve under Exchange Act
Rule 17a-3 (17 CFR 240.17a-3) and Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 may be immediately
produced or reproduced on micrographic media or by means of electronic storage media.
Paragraph (j) of Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 requires a broker-dealer, which would include
298

a broker-dealer that is a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered institution pursuant to the
proposed rules, to furnish promptly to a representative of the SEC legible, true, complete,
and current copies of those records of the broker-dealer that are required to be preserved
under Exchange Act Rule 17a-4, or any other records of the broker-dealer subject to
examination under section 17(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are
requested by the representative. 229
SEC Amendment to Investment Advisers Act Rule 204-2.
The SEC is proposing an amendment to rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers
Act (17 CFR 275.204-2) to require that investment advisers registered or required to be
registered under section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act (15 U.S.C. 80b-3) maintain
the records required by § __.4(f) and, for those investment advisers that are Level 1 or
Level 2 covered institutions, §§ __.5 and __.11, in accordance with the recordkeeping
requirements of rule 204-2. New paragraph (a)(19) of rule 204-2 would require
investment advisers subject to rule 204-2 that are Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered
institutions to make and keep true, accurate, and current the records required by, and for
the period specified in, § __.4(f) and, for those investment advisers that are Level 1 or
Level 2 covered institutions, the records required by, and for the periods specified in, §§
__.5 and __.11.
Rule 204-2 establishes the general recordkeeping requirements for investment
advisers registered or required to be registered under section 203 of the Investment

Advisers Act. For the sake of consistency with other investment adviser records, the SEC
is proposing that this rule require such investment advisers that are covered institutions to
keep the records required by § __.4(f) and those that are Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institutions to keep the records required by §§ __.5 and __.11 in accordance with the
requirements of rule 204-2.
III. Appendix to the Supplementary Information: Example Incentive-Based
Compensation Arrangement and Forfeiture and Downward Adjustment
Review
For an incentive-based compensation arrangement to meet the requirements of the
proposed rule, particularly the requirement that such an arrangement appropriately
balance risk and reward, covered institutions would need to look holistically at the entire
incentive-based arrangement. Below, for purposes of illustration only, the Agencies
outline an example of a hypothetical incentive-based compensation arrangement that
would meet the requirements of the proposed rule and an example of how a forfeiture and
downward adjustment review might be conducted. These illustrations do not cover every
aspect of the proposed rule. They are provided as an aid to understanding the proposed
rule and would not carry the force and effect of law or regulation, if issued as a
companion to a final rule. Reviewing these illustrations does not substitute for a review
of the proposed rule.
This example assumes that the final rule was published as proposed and all
incentive-based compensation programs and arrangements were required to comply on or
before January 1, 2020.

Ms. Ledger: Senior Executive Officer at Level 2 Covered Institution
Ms. Ledger is the chief financial officer at a bank holding company, henceforth
“ABC,” which has $200 billion in average total consolidated assets. Under the
definitions of the proposed rule Ms. Ledger would be a senior executive officer and ABC
would be a Level 2 covered institution.230
Ms. Ledger is provided incentive-based compensation under three separate
incentive-based compensation plans. The first plan, the “Annual Executive Plan,” is
applicable to all senior executive officers at ABC, and requires assessment over the
course of one calendar year. The second plan, the “Annual Firm-Wide Plan,” is
applicable to all employees at ABC, and is also based on a one-year performance period
that coincides with the calendar year. The third plan, “Ms. Ledger’s LTIP,” is applicable
only to Ms. Ledger, and requires assessment of performance over a three-year
performance period that begins on January 1 of year 1 and ends on December 31 of year
3. These three plans together comprise Ms. Ledger’s incentive-based compensation
arrangement.
The proposed rule would impose certain requirements on Ms. Ledger’s incentivebased compensation arrangement. Section ___.4(a)(1) of the proposed rule would require
that Ms. Ledger’s entire incentive-based compensation arrangement, and each feature of
that arrangement, not provide excessive compensation. ABC would be required to
consider the six factors listed in section ___.4(b) of the proposed rule, as well as any
other factors that ABC finds relevant, in evaluating whether Ms. Ledger’s incentive-

230

See the definitions of “senior executive officer” and “Level 2 covered institution” in section
__.2 of the proposed rule.

301

based compensation arrangement provides excessive compensation before approving Ms.
Ledger’s incentive-based compensation arrangement.
Balance.
Under section ___.4(c)(1) of the proposed rule, the entire arrangement would be
required to appropriately balance risk and reward. ABC would be expected to consider
the risks that Ms. Ledger’s activities pose to the institution, and the performance that Ms.
Ledger’s incentive-based compensation arrangement rewards. ABC might consider both
the type and target level of any associated performance measures; how all performance
measures would work together under the three plans; the form of incentive-based
compensation; the recourse ABC has to reduce incentive-based compensation once
awarded (through forfeiture) 231 including under the conditions outlined in section __.7 of
the proposed rule; the ability ABC has to use clawback of incentive-based compensation
once vested, including under the conditions outlined in section __.7 of the proposed rule;
and any overlapping performance periods of the various incentive-based compensation
plans, which apply to Ms. Ledger.
Under section ___.4(d) of the proposed rule, Ms. Ledger’s incentive-based
compensation arrangement would be required to include both financial and non-financial
measures of performance. These measures would need to include considerations of risktaking that are relevant to Ms. Ledger’s role within ABC and to the type of business in
which Ms. Ledger is engaged. They also would need to be appropriately weighted to

231

This requirement for balance under section ___.4(c)(1) would not, however require forfeiture,
or any specific forfeiture measure, for any particular covered person. As discussed below,
sections ___.7 and ___.8 contain specific requirements applicable to senior executive officers at
Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions.

302

reflect risk-taking. The arrangement would be required to allow non-financial measures
of performance to override financial measures of performance when appropriate in
determining Ms. Ledger’s incentive-based compensation. Any amounts to be awarded
under Ms. Ledger’s arrangement would be subject to adjustment to reflect ABC’s actual
losses, inappropriate risks Ms. Ledger took or was accountable for others taking,
compliance deficiencies Ms. Ledger was accountable for, or other measures or aspects of
Ms. Ledger’s and ABC’s financial and non-financial performance. For example, the
Annual Firm-Wide Plan might use a forward-looking internal profit measure that takes
into account stressed conditions as a proxy for liquidity risk that Ms. Ledger’s activities
pose to ABC and thus mitigates against incentives to take imprudent liquidity risk. It
might also include limits on liquidity risk, the repeated breach of which would result in
non-compliance with a key non-financial performance objective.
In practice, each incentive-based compensation plan will include various
measures of performance, and under the proposed rule, each plan would be required to
include both financial and non-financial measures. The Annual Firm-Wide Plan may be
largely based on the change in value of ABC’s equity over the performance year, but that
cannot be the only basis for incentive-based compensation awarded under that plan.
Non-financial measures of Ms. Ledger’s risk-taking activity would have to be taken into
account in determining the incentive-based compensation awarded under that plan, and
those non-financial measures would need to be appropriately weighted so that they could
override financial measures. Even if ABC’s equity performed very well over the
performance year, if Ms. Ledger was found to have violated risk performance measures,

303

Ms. Ledger should not be awarded the full target of incentive-based compensation from
the plan.
Because Ms. Ledger is a senior executive officer at a Level 2 covered institution,
Ms. Ledger’s incentive-based compensation arrangement would not be considered to
appropriately balance risk and reward unless it was structured to be consistent with the
requirements set forth in sections ___.7 and ___.8 of the proposed rule. The incentivebased compensation awarded to Ms. Ledger would not be permitted to be based solely on
relative performance measures 232 or be based solely on transaction revenue or volume. 233
The Annual Executive Plan may include a measure of ABC’s TSR relative to its peer
group, but that plan would comply with the proposed rule only if other absolute measures
of ABC’s or Ms. Ledger’s performance were also included (e.g., achievement of a threeyear average return on risk adjusted capital). Similarly, a plan that applied to significant
risk-takers who were engaged in trading might include transaction volume as one of the
financial performance measures, but that plan would comply with the proposed rule only
if it also included other factors, such as measurement of transaction quality or the
significant risk-taker’s compliance with the institution’s risk-management policies.
Award of incentive-based compensation for performance periods ending December
31, 2024.
Ms. Ledger’s incentive-based compensation is awarded on January 31, 2025. The
Annual Executive Plan and the Annual Firm-Wide Plan are awarded on this date for the
performance period starting on January 1, 2024 and ending on December 31, 2024. Ms.

232
233

See section ___.8(c) of the proposed rule.
See section ___.8(d) of the proposed rule.

304

Ledger’s LTIP will be awarded on this date for the performance period starting on
January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2024. This example assumes ABC’s share
price on December 31, 2024 (the end of the performance period) is $50.
Ms. Ledger’s target incentive-based compensation award amount under the
Annual Executive plan is $60,000 and 1,000 shares of ABC. 234 Under the Annual FirmWide Plan, Ms. Ledger’s target incentive-based compensation award amount is $30,000.
Finally, under Ms. Ledger’s LTIP, her target incentive-based compensation award
amount is $40,000 and 2,000 shares of ABC.
To be consistent with the proposed rule, the maximum incentive-based
compensation amounts that ABC would be allowed to award to Ms. Ledger are 125
percent of the target amount, which would amount to: $75,000 and 1,250 shares under the
Annual Executive Plan; $37,500 under the Annual Firm-Wide Plan; and $50,000 and
2,500 shares under Ms. Ledger’s LTIP.
If Ms. Ledger were implicated in a forfeiture and downward adjustment review
during the performance period, ABC would be expected to consider whether and by what
amount to reduce the amounts awarded to Ms. Ledger. As part of that review, ABC
would be expected to consider all of the amounts that could be awarded to Ms. Ledger
under the Annual Executive Plan, Annual Firm-Wide Plan, and Ms. Ledger’s LTIP for
downward adjustment before any incentive-based compensation were awarded to Ms.
Ledger. 235

234

That is, if Ms. Ledger meets all of the performance measure targets set out under that plan, she
will be awarded both $60,000 in cash and 1,000 shares of ABC stock.
235
See section __.7(b) of the proposed rule.

305

Regardless of whether a downward forfeiture and downward adjustment review
occurred, ABC would be expected to evaluate Ms. Ledger’s performance, including Ms.
Ledger’s risk-taking activities, at or near the end of the performance period (December
31, 2024). ABC would be required to use non-financial measures of performance, and
particularly measures of risk-taking, to determine Ms. Ledger’s incentive-based
compensation award, possibly decreasing the amount Ms. Ledger would be awarded if
only financial measures were taken into account. 236
Based on performance and taking into account Ms. Ledger’s risk-taking behavior,
ABC decides to award Ms. Ledger: $30,000 and 1,000 shares under the Annual
Executive Plan; $35,000 under the Annual Firm-Wide Plan; and $40,000 and 2,000
shares under Ms. Ledger’s LTIP. Valuing the ABC equity at the time of award, the total
value of Ms. Ledger’s award under the Annual Executive Plan is $80,000, under the
Annual Firm-Wide Plan is $35,000, and under Ms. Ledger’s LTIP is $140,000.

To calculate the minimum required deferred amounts, ABC would have to
aggregate the amounts awarded under both the Annual Executive Plan ($80,000) and the
Annual Firm-Wide Plan ($35,000), because each has the same performance period, which
is less than three years, to determine the total amount of qualifying incentive-based
compensation awarded ($115,000). 237 At least 50 percent of that qualifying incentivebased compensation would be required to be deferred for at least three years. 238 Thus,
ABC would be required to defer cash and equity with an aggregate value of at least
$57,500 from qualifying incentive-based compensation. ABC would have the flexibility
to defer the amounts awarded in cash or in equity, as long as the total deferred incentivebased compensation was composed of both substantial amounts of deferred cash and
substantial amounts of deferred equity. 239 ABC would also have the flexibility to defer
amounts awarded from either the Annual Executive Plan or the Annual Firm-Wide Plan.
In this example, ABC chooses to defer $27,500 of cash and 650 shares from Ms.
Ledger’s award from the Annual Executive Plan, which has a total value of $60,000 at
the time of the award, for three years and none of the award under the Annual Firm-Wide
Plan. 240

Vesting schedule.
ABC would have the flexibility to determine the schedule by which this deferred
incentive-based compensation would be eligible for vesting, as long as the cumulative
total of the deferred incentive-based compensation that has been made eligible for vesting
by any given year is not greater than the cumulative total that would have been eligible
for vesting had the covered institution made equal amounts eligible for vesting each
year. 241 With deferred qualifying incentive-based compensation valued at $60,000 and
three-year vesting, no more than $20,000 would be allowed to be eligible to vest on
December 31, 2025, and no more than $40,000 would be eligible to vest on or before
December 31, 2026. At least $20,000 would need to be eligible to vest on December 31,
2027, to be consistent with the proposed rule. In this example, ABC decides to make
none of the deferred award from the Annual Executive Plan eligible for vesting on
December 31, 2025; to make $13,750 and 325 shares (total value of cash and equity
$30,000) eligible for vesting on December 31, 2026; and to make $13,750 and 325 shares
(total value of cash and equity $30,000) eligible for vesting on December 31, 2027.

241

See section __.7(a)(1)(iii) of the proposed rule.

308

Ms. Ledger’s LTIP has a performance period of three years, so Ms. Ledger’s
LTIP would meet the definition of a “long-term incentive-plan” under the proposed
rule. 242 At least 50 percent of Ms. Ledger’s LTIP amount ($140,000) would be required
to be deferred for at least one year. 243 Thus, ABC would be required to defer cash and
equity with an aggregate value of at least $70,000 from Ms. Ledger’s LTIP, which would
be eligible for vesting on December 31, 2025. ABC would have flexibility to defer the
amounts awarded in cash or in equity, as long as the total deferred incentive-based
compensation were composed of both substantial amounts of deferred cash and
substantial amounts of deferred equity. 244 If ABC chooses to defer amounts awarded
from Ms. Ledger’s LTIP for longer than one year, ABC would have flexibility to
determine the schedule on which it would be eligible for vesting, as long as the
cumulative total of the deferred incentive-based compensation that has been made
eligible for vesting by any given year is not greater than the cumulative total that would
have been eligible for vesting had the covered institution made equal amounts eligible for
vesting in one year. 245
In this example, ABC chooses to defer $35,000 of cash and 700 shares of the
award from Ms. Ledger’s LTIP, which has a total value of $70,000 at the time of the
award, for one year. 246 The non-deferred amount ($35,000 and 700 shares) could vest at
the time of the award on January 31, 2025.

242

See the definition of “long-term incentive plan” in section __.2 of the proposed rule.
See sections __.7(a)(2)(i)(C) and __.7(a)(2)(ii)(B) of the proposed rule.

See section __.7(a)(4)(i) of the proposed rule.
245
See section __.7(a)(2)(iii) of the proposed rule.
246
Ms. Ledger’s remaining award under Ms. Ledger’s LTIP would vest immediately.
243

309

In summary, Ms. Ledger would receive $42,500 and 1,650 shares (a total value of
$125,000) immediately after December 31, 2024. 247 A total of $35,000 and 700 shares
(total value $70,000) would be eligible to vest on December 31, 2025. A total of $13,750
and 325 shares (total value $30,000) would be eligible to vest on December 31, 2026.
Finally, a total of $13,750 and 325 shares (total value $30,000) would again be eligible to
vest on December 31, 2027.

Use of options in deferred incentive-based compensation.
If, under the total award amount outlined above, ABC chooses to award Ms.
Ledger incentive-based compensation partially in the form of options, and chooses to
defer the vesting of those options, no more than $38,250 worth of those options (the
equivalent of 15 percent of the aggregate incentive-based compensation awarded to Ms.
Ledger) would be eligible to be treated as deferred incentive-based compensation. 248 As
an example, ABC may award Ms. Ledger options that have a value at the end of the
performance period of $10 and deferred vesting. ABC may choose to award Ms. Ledger
incentive-based compensation with a total value of $255,000 in the following forms:
$30,000 in cash, 640 shares of equity (valued at $32,000), and 1,800 options (valued at
$18,000) under the Annual Executive Plan; $35,000 cash under the Annual Firm-Wide
Plan; and $40,000 cash, 1,600 shares of equity (valued at $80,000), and 2,000 options
(valued at $20,000) under Ms. Ledger’s LTIP. Of that award, ABC may defer: $27,500
in cash, 290 shares (valued at $14,500), and 1,800 options (valued at $18,000) under the
Annual Executive Plan (total value of deferred $60,000); none of the award from the
Annual Firm-Wide Plan; and $35,000 in cash, 300 shares (valued at $15,000) and 2,000
options (valued at $20,000) under Ms. Ledger’s LTIP (total value of deferred $70,000).
The total value of options being counted as deferred incentive-based compensation would
be $38,000, which would be 14.9 percent of the total incentive-based compensation
awarded ($255,000). Assuming the vesting schedule is consistent with the proposed rule,
Ms. Ledger’s incentive-based compensation arrangement would be consistent with the
proposed rule, because: (1) the value of Ms. Ledger’s deferred incentive-based
248

See section __.7(a)(4)(ii)

311

compensation under the Annual Executive Plan (which comprises all of Ms. Ledger’s
deferred qualifying incentive-based compensation) is more than 50 percent of the value
of Ms. Ledger’s total qualifying incentive-based compensation award ($115,000) and (2)
the value of Ms. Ledger’s deferred incentive-based compensation under Ms. Ledger’s
LTIP is 50 percent the value of Ms. Ledger’s incentive-based compensation awarded
under a long-term incentive plan ($140,000).

In contrast, if ABC chooses to award Ms. Ledger more options than in the
example above, Ms. Ledger’s incentive-based compensation arrangement may no longer
be consistent with the proposed rule. As a second alternative scenario, ABC may choose
to award Ms. Ledger incentive-based compensation with a total value of $255,000 in the
following forms: $30,000 in cash, 500 shares of equity (valued at $25,000), and 2,500
options (valued at $25,000) under the Annual Executive Plan; $35,000 cash under the
Annual Firm-Wide Plan; and $40,000 cash, 1,600 shares of equity (valued at $80,000),
and 2,000 options (valued at $20,000) under Ms. Ledger’s LTIP. Of that award, if ABC
defers the following amounts, the arrangement would not be consistent with the proposed
rule: $27,500 in cash, 150 shares (valued at $7,500), and 2,500 options (valued at
$25,000) under the Annual Executive Plan (total value of deferred $60,000); none of the
award from the Annual Firm-Wide Plan; and $35,000 in cash, 300 shares (valued at
$15,000) and 2,000 options (valued at $20,000) under Ms. Ledger’s LTIP (total value of
deferred $70,000). The total value of options would be $45,000, which would be 17.6
percent of the total incentive-based compensation awarded ($255,000). Thus, 675 of
those options, or $6,750 worth, would not qualify to meet the minimum deferral
313

requirements of the proposed rule. Combining qualifying incentive-based compensation
and incentive-based compensation awarded under a long-term incentive plan, Ms.
Ledger’s total minimum required deferral amount would be $127,500, and yet incentivebased compensation worth only $123,250 would be eligible to meet the minimum
deferral requirements. ABC could alter the proportions of incentive-based compensation
awarded and deferred in order to comply with the proposed rule.

Other requirements specific to Ms. Ledger’s incentive-based compensation
arrangement.
Under the proposed rule, ABC would not be allowed to accelerate the vesting of
Ms. Ledger’s deferred incentive-based compensation, except in the case of Ms. Ledger’s
death or disability, as determined by ABC pursuant to sections ___.7(a)(1)(iii)(B) and
___.7(a)(2)(iii)(B).
Before vesting, ABC may determine to reduce the amount of deferred incentivebased compensation that Ms. Ledger receives pursuant to a forfeiture and downward
adjustment review. 249 If Ms. Ledger, or an employee Ms. Ledger managed, had been
responsible for an event triggering the proposed rule’s requirements for forfeiture and
downward adjustment review, ABC would be expected to consider all of the unvested
deferred amounts from the Annual Executive Plan and Ms. Ledger’s LTIP for forfeiture
before any incentive-based compensation vested even if the event occurred outside of the
relevant performance period for the awards discussed in the example (i.e., January 1,
249

See “Mr. Ticker: Forfeiture and downward adjustment review” discussion below for more
details about the requirements for a forfeiture and downward adjustment review.

315

2022 to December 31, 2024). 250 ABC may also rely on other performance adjustments
during the deferral period to appropriately balance Ms. Ledger’s incentive-based
compensation arrangement. In this case ABC would take into account information about
Ms. Ledger’s and ABC’s performance that becomes better known during the deferral
period to potentially reduce the amount of deferred incentive-based compensation that
vests. ABC would not be allowed to increase the amount of deferred incentive-based
compensation that vests. In the case of the deferred equity awarded to Ms. Ledger, the
number of shares or options awarded to Ms. Ledger and eligible for vesting on each
anniversary of the end of the performance period is the maximum number of shares or
options that may vest on that date. An increase in the total value of those shares or
options would not be considered an increase in the amount of deferred incentive-based
compensation for the purposes of the proposed rule. 251
ABC would be required to include clawback provisions in Ms. Ledger’s
incentive-based compensation arrangement that, at a minimum, allowed for clawback for
seven years following the date on which Ms. Ledger’s incentive-based compensation
vested. 252 These provisions would permit ABC to recover up to 100 percent of any
vested incentive-based compensation if ABC determined that Ms. Ledger engaged in
certain misconduct, fraud or intentional misrepresentation of information, as described in
section ___.7(c) of the proposed rule. Thus, if in the year 2030, ABC determined that
Ms. Ledger engaged in fraud in the year 2024, the entirety of the $42,500 and 1,650
shares of equity that vested immediately after 2024, and as well as any part of her
250

See section __.7(b) of the proposed rule.
See section __.7(a)(3) of the proposed rule.
252
See section __.7(c) of the proposed rule.
251

316

deferred incentive-based compensation ($62,500 and 1,350 shares of equity) that actually
had vested by 2030, could be subject to clawback by ABC. Facts and circumstances
would determine whether the ABC would actually seek to claw back amounts, as well as
the specific amount ABC would seek to recover from Ms. Ledger’s already-vested
incentive-based compensation.
Finally, in order for Ms. Ledger’s incentive-based compensation arrangement to
appropriately balance risk and reward, ABC would not be permitted to purchase a
hedging instrument or similar instrument on Ms. Ledger’s behalf that would offset any
decrease in the value of Ms. Ledger’s deferred incentive-based compensation. 253
Risk management and controls and governance.
Sections ___.4(c)(2) and ___.4(c)(3) of the proposed rule would require that Ms.
Ledger’s incentive-based compensation arrangement be compatible with effective risk
management and controls and be supported by effective governance.
For Ms. Ledger’s arrangement to be compatible with effective risk management
and controls, ABC’s risk management framework and controls would be required to
comply with the specific provisions of section ___.9 of the proposed rule. ABC would
have to maintain a risk management framework for its incentive-based compensation
program that is independent of any lines of business, includes an independent compliance
program, and is commensurate with the size and complexity of ABC’s operations. 254
ABC would have to provide individuals engaged in control functions with the authority
to influence the risk-taking of the business areas they monitor and ensure that covered
253
254

See section __.8(a) of the proposed rule.
See section ___.9(a) of the proposed rule.

317

persons engaged in control functions are compensated in accordance with the
achievement of performance objectives linked to their job functions, independent of the
performance of those business areas. 255 In addition, ABC would have to provide for
independent monitoring of events related to forfeiture and downward adjustment reviews
and decisions of forfeiture and downward adjustment reviews. 256
For Ms. Ledger’s arrangement to be consistent with the effective governance
requirement in the proposed rule, the board of directors of ABC would be required to
establish a compensation committee composed solely of directors who are not senior
executive officers. The board of directors, or a committee thereof, would be required to
approve Ms. Ledger’s incentive-based compensation arrangements, including the
amounts of all awards and payouts under those arrangements. 257 In this example, the
board of directors or a committee thereof (such as the compensation committee) would be
required to approve the total award of $105,000 and 3,000 shares in 2024. Each time
deferred amounts are scheduled to vest (in this example, in December 31, 2025,
December 31, 2026, and December 31, 2027), the board of directors or a committee
thereof would also be required to approve the amounts that vest. 258 Additionally, the
compensation committee would be required to receive input from the risk and audit
committees of the ABC’s board of directors on the effectiveness of risk measures and
adjustments used to balance risk and reward in incentive-based compensation

See sections __.4(e)(2) and __.4(e)(3) of the proposed rule.

arrangements. 259 Finally, the compensation committee would be required to obtain at
least annually two written assessments, one prepared by ABC’s management with input
from the risk and audit committees of the board of directors and a separate assessment
written from ABC’s risk management or internal audit function developed independently
of ABC’s senior management. Both assessments would focus on the effectiveness of
ABC’s incentive-based compensation program and related compliance and control
processes in providing appropriate risk-taking incentives. 260
Recordkeeping.
In order to comply with the recordkeeping requirements in the proposed rule,
ABC would be required to document Ms. Ledger’s incentive-based compensation
arrangement. 261 ABC would be required to maintain copies of the Annual Executive
Plan, the Annual Firm-Wide Plan, and Ms. Ledger’s LTIP, along with all plans that are
part of ABC’s incentive-based compensation program. ABC also would be required to
include Ms. Ledger on the list of senior executive officers and significant risk-takers,
including the legal entity for which she works, her job function, her line of business, and
her position in the organizational hierarchy. 262 Finally, ABC would be required to
document Ms. Ledger’s entire incentive-based compensation arrangement, including
information on percentage deferred and form of payment and any forfeiture and
downward adjustment or clawback reviews and decisions that pertain to her. 263

319

Mr. Ticker: Forfeiture and Downward Adjustment Review.
Under section __.7(b) of the proposed rule, ABC would be required to put certain
portions of a senior executive officer’s or significant risk-taker’s incentive-based
compensation at risk of forfeiture and downward adjustment upon certain triggering
events. 264 In this example, Mr. Ticker is a significant risk-taker who is the senior
manager of a trader and a trading desk that engaged in inappropriate risk-taking in
calendar year 2021, which was discovered on March 1, 2024. 265 The activity of the
trader, and several other members of the same trading desk, resulted in an enforcement
proceeding against ABC and the imposition of a significant fine.
Mr. Ticker is provided incentive-based compensation under two separate
incentive-based compensation plans. The first plan, the “Annual Firm-Wide Plan,” is
applicable to all employees at ABC, and is based on a one-year performance period that
coincides with the calendar year. The second plan, “Mr. Ticker’s LTIP,” is applicable to
all traders at Mr. Ticker’s level, and requires assessment of performance over a three-year
performance period that begins on January 1, 2022 (year 1) and ends on December 31,
2024 (year 3). These two plans together comprise Mr. Ticker’s incentive-based
compensation arrangement.
The proposed rule would require ABC to conduct a forfeiture and downward
adjustment review both because the trades resulted from inappropriate risk-taking and
because they failed to comply with a statutory, regulatory, or supervisory standard in a

264

See section __.7(b) of the proposed rule.
If Mr. Ticker’s inappropriate risk-taking during 2021 were instead discovered in another year,
ABC could subject all deferred amounts not yet vested in that year to forfeiture.
265

320

manner that resulted in an enforcement or legal action against ABC. 266 In addition, the
possibility exists that a material risk management and control failure as described in
section __.7(b)(2)(iii) of the proposed rule has occurred, which would widen the group of
covered employees whose incentive-based compensation would be considered for
possible forfeiture and downward adjustment. Under the proposed rule, covered
institutions would be required to consider forfeiture and downward adjustment for a
covered person with direct responsibility for the adverse outcome (in this case, the trader,
if designated as a significant risk-taker), as well as responsibility due to the covered
person’s role or position in the covered institution’s organizational structure (in this case,
Mr. Ticker for his possible lack of oversight of the trader when such activities were
conducted). 267
In this example, ABC determines that as the senior manager of the trader, Mr.
Ticker is responsible for inappropriate oversight of the trader and that Mr. Ticker
facilitated the inappropriate risk-taking the trader engaged in. Under the proposed rule,
ABC would have to consider all of Mr. Ticker’s unvested deferred incentive-based
compensation, including unvested deferred amounts awarded under Mr. Ticker’s LTIP,
when determining the appropriate impact on Mr. Ticker’s incentive-based
compensation. 268 In addition, all of Mr. Ticker’s incentive-based compensation amounts
not yet awarded for the current performance period, including amounts to be awarded
under Mr. Ticker’s LTIP, would have to be considered for possible downward

266

See sections __.7(b)(2)(ii) and __.7(b)(2)(iv)(A) of the proposed rule.
See section __.7(b)(3) of the proposed rule.
268
See section __.7(b)(1)(i) of the proposed rule.
267

321

adjustment. 269 The amount by which Mr. Ticker’s incentive-based compensation would
be reduced could be part or all of the relevant tranches which have not yet vested or have
not yet been awarded. For example, if Mr. Ticker’s lack of oversight were determined to
be only a contributing factor that led to the adverse outcome (e.g., Mr. Ticker identified
and elevated the breach of related risk limits but made no effort to follow up in order to
ensure that such activity immediately ceased), ABC might be comfortable reducing only
a portion of the incentive-based compensation to be awarded under Mr. Ticker’s LTIP in
2024.
To determine the amount or portion of Mr. Ticker’s incentive-based
compensation that should be forfeited or adjusted downward under the proposed rule,
ABC would be required to consider, at a minimum, the six factors listed in section
__.7(b)(4) of the proposed rule. 270 The cumulative impact of these factors, when
appropriately weighed in the final decision-making process, might lead to lesser or
greater impact on Mr. Ticker’s incentive-based compensation. For instance, if it were
found that Mr. Ticker had repeatedly failed to manage traders or others who report to
him, ABC might decide that a reduction of 100 percent of Mr. Ticker’s incentive-based
compensation at risk would be appropriate. 271 On the other hand, if it were determined
that Mr. Ticker took immediate and meaningful actions to prevent the adverse outcome
from occurring and immediately escalated and addressed the inappropriate behavior, the
impact on Mr. Ticker’s incentive-based compensation could be less than 100 percent, or
nothing.
269

See section __.7(b)(1)(ii) of the proposed rule.
See section __.7(b)(4) of the proposed rule.
271
See sections __.7(b)(4)(ii) and (iii) of the proposed rule.
270

322

It is possible that some or all of Mr. Ticker’s incentive-based compensation may
be forfeited before it vests, which could result in amounts vesting faster than pro rata. In
this case, ABC decides to defer $30,000 of Mr. Ticker’s incentive-based compensation
for three years so that $10,000 is eligible for vesting in 2022, $10,000 is eligible for
vesting in 2023, and $10,000 is eligible for vesting in 2024. This schedule would meet
the proposed rule’s pro rata vesting requirement. No adverse information about Mr.
Ticker’s performance comes to light in 2022 or 2023 and so $10,000 vests in each of
those years. However, Mr. Ticker’s inappropriate risk-taking during 2021 is discovered
in 2024, causing ABC to forfeit the remaining $10,000. Therefore, the amounts that vest
in this case are $10,000 in 2022, $10,000 in 2023, and $0 in 2024. While the vesting is
faster than pro rata due to the forfeiture, the incentive-based compensation arrangement
would still be consistent with the proposed rule since the original vesting schedule would
have been in compliance.
ABC would be required to document the rationale for its decision and to keep
timely and accurate records that detail the individuals considered for compensation
adjustments, the factors weighed in reaching a final decision and how those factors were
considered during the decision-making process. 272
IV. REQUEST FOR COMMENTS
The Agencies are interested in receiving comments on all aspects of the proposed
rule.
V. REGULATORY ANALYSIS

272

See section __.5(a)(3) of the proposed rule.

323

A. Regulatory Flexibility Act
OCC: Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b)
(“RFA”), the initial regulatory flexibility analysis otherwise required under section 603 of
the RFA is not required if the agency certifies that the proposed rule will not, if
promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities (defined for purposes of the RFA to include banks and Federal branches and
agencies with assets less than or equal to $550 million) and publishes its certification and
a short, explanatory statement in the Federal Register along with its proposed rule.
As discussed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section above,
section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act does not apply to institutions with assets of less than
$1 billion. As a result, the proposed rule will not, if promulgated, apply to any OCCsupervised small entities. For this reason, the proposed rule will not, if promulgated,
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of OCC-supervised small
entities. Therefore, the OCC certifies that the proposed rule will not, if promulgated,
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Board: The Board has considered the potential impact of the proposed rule on
small banking organizations in accordance with the RFA (5 U.S.C. 603(b)). As discussed
in the “Supplementary Information” above, section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act (codified
at 12 U.S.C. 5641) requires that the Agencies prohibit any incentive-based payment
arrangement, or any feature of any such arrangement, at a covered financial institution
that the Agencies determine encourages inappropriate risks by a financial institution by
providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss. In
addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act a covered financial institution also must disclose to
324

its appropriate Federal regulator the structure of its incentive-based compensation
arrangements. The Board and the other Agencies have issued the proposed rule in
response to these requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
The proposed rule would apply to “covered institutions” as defined in the
proposed rule. Covered institutions as so defined include specifically listed types of
institutions, as well as other institutions added by the Agencies acting jointly by rule. In
every case, however, covered institutions must have at least $1 billion in total
consolidated assets pursuant to section 956(f). Thus the proposed rule is not expected to
apply to any small banking organizations (defined as banking organizations with $550
million or less in total assets). See 13 CFR 121.201.
The proposed rule would implement section 956(a) of the Dodd-Frank act by
requiring a covered institution to create annually and maintain for a period of at least
seven years records that document the structure of all its incentive-based compensation
arrangements and demonstrate compliance with the proposed rule. A covered institution
must disclose the records to the Board upon request. At a minimum, the records must
include copies of all incentive-based compensation plans, a record of who is subject to
each plan, and a description of how the incentive-based compensation program is
compatible with effective risk management and controls.
Covered institutions with at least $50 billion in consolidated assets, and their
subsidiaries with at least $1 billion in total consolidated assets, would be subject to
additional, more specific requirements, including that such covered institutions create
annually and maintain for a period of at least seven years records that document: (1) the
covered institution’s senior executive officers and significant risk-takers, listed by legal
325

entity, job function, organizational hierarchy, and line of business; (2) the incentive-based
compensation arrangements for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers,
including information on percentage of incentive-based compensation deferred and form
of award; (3) any forfeiture and downward adjustment or clawback reviews and decisions
for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers; and (4) any material changes to
the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation arrangements and policies. These
larger covered institutions must provide these records in such form and with such
frequency as requested by the Board, and they must be maintained in a manner that
allows for an independent audit of incentive-based compensation arrangements, policies,
and procedures.
As described above, the volume and detail of information required to be created
and maintained by a covered institution is tiered; covered institutions with less than $50
billion in total consolidated assets are subject to less rigorous and detailed informational
requirements than larger covered institutions. As such, the Board expects that the volume
and detail of information created and maintained by a covered institution with greater
than $50 billion in consolidated assets, that may use incentive-based arrangements to a
significant degree, would be substantially greater than that created and maintained by a
smaller institution.
The proposed rule would implement section 956(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act by
prohibiting a covered institution from having incentive-based compensation arrangements
that may encourage inappropriate risks (i) by providing excessive compensation or (ii)
that could lead to material financial loss. The proposed rule would establish standards for
determining whether an incentive-based compensation arrangement violates these
326

prohibitions. These standards would include deferral, forfeiture, downward adjustment,
clawback, and other requirements for certain covered persons at covered institutions with
total consolidated assets of more than $50 billion, and their subsidiaries with at least $1
billion in assets, as well as specific prohibitions on incentive-based compensation
arrangements at these institutions. Consistent with section 956(c), the standards adopted
under section 956 are comparable to the compensation-related safety and soundness
standards applicable to insured depository institutions under section 39 of the FDIA. The
proposed rule also would supplement existing guidance adopted by the Board and the
other Federal Banking Agencies regarding incentive-based compensation (i.e., the 2010
Federal Banking Agency Guidance, as defined in the “Supplementary Information”
above).
The proposed rule also would require all covered institutions to have incentivebased compensation arrangements that are compatible with effective risk management
and controls and supported by effective governance. In addition, the board of directors,
or a committee thereof, of a covered institution to conduct oversight of the covered
institution’s incentive-based compensation program and to approve incentive-based
compensation arrangements and material exceptions or adjustments to incentive-based
compensation policies or arrangements for senior executive officers. For covered
institutions with greater than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, and their
subsidiaries with at least $1 billion in total consolidated assets, the proposed rule includes
additional specific requirements for risk management and controls, governance and
policies and procedures. Thus, like the deferral, forfeiture, downward adjustment,
clawback and other requirements referred to above, risk management, governance, and

327

policies and procedures requirements are tiered based on the size of the covered
institution, with smaller institutions only subject to general risk management, controls,
and governance requirements and larger institutions subject to more detailed
requirements, including policies and procedures requirements. Therefore, the
requirements of the proposed rule in these areas would be expected to be less extensive
for covered institutions with less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets than for
larger covered institutions.
As noted above, because the proposed rule applies to institutions that have at least
$1 billion in total consolidated assets, if adopted in final form it is not expected to apply
to any small banking organizations for purposes of the RFA. In light of the foregoing,
the Board does not believe that the proposed rule, if adopted in final form, would have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities supervised by the
Board. The Board specifically seeks comment on whether the proposed rule would
impose undue burdens on, or have unintended consequences for, small institutions and
whether there are ways such potential burdens or consequences could be addressed in a
manner consistent with section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
FDIC: In accordance with the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 601-612 (“RFA”), an agency must
provide an initial regulatory flexibility analysis with a proposed rule or to certify that the
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
(defined for purposes of the RFA to include banking entities with total assets of $550
million or less).
As described in the Scope and Initial Applicability section of the
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION above, the proposed rule would establish general
328

requirements applicable to the incentive-based compensation arrangements of all
institutions defined as covered institutions under the proposed rule (i.e., covered
institutions with average total consolidated assets of $1 billion or more that offers
incentive-based compensation to covered persons). As of December 31, 2015, a total of
353 FDIC-supervised institutions had total assets of $1 billion or more and would be
subject to the proposed rule.
As of December 31, 2015, there were 3,947 FDIC-supervised depository
institutions. Of those depository institutions, 3,262 had total assets of $550 million or
less. All FDIC-supervised depository institutions that fall under the $550 million asset
threshold, by definition, would not be subject to the proposed rule, regardless of their
incentive-based compensation practices.
Therefore, the FDIC certifies that the notice of proposed rulemaking would not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small FDIC-supervised
institutions.
FHFA: FHFA believes that the proposed rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, since none of FHFA’s
regulated entities come within the meaning of small entities as defined in the RFA (see
5 U.S.C. 601(6)), and the proposed rule will not substantially affect any business that its
regulated entities might conduct with such small entities.
NCUA: The RFA requires NCUA to prepare an analysis to describe any
significant economic impact a regulation may have on a substantial number of small

329

entities. 273 For purposes of this analysis, NCUA considers small credit unions to be those
having under $100 million in assets. 274 Section 956 of the Dodd Frank Act and the
NCUA’s proposed rule apply only to credit unions with $1 billion or more in assets.
Accordingly, NCUA certifies that the proposed rule would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities since the credit unions subject
to NCUA’s proposed rule are not small entities for RFA purposes.
SEC: Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the SEC hereby certifies that the proposed
rules would not, if adopted, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. The SEC notes that the proposed rules would not apply to brokerdealers or investment advisers with less than $1 billion in total consolidated assets.
Therefore, the SEC believes that all broker-dealers and investment advisers that are likely
to be covered institutions under the proposed rules would not be small entities.
The SEC encourages written comments regarding this certification. The SEC
solicits comment as to whether the proposed rules could have an effect on small entities
that has not been considered. The SEC requests that commenters describe the nature of
any impact on small entities and provide empirical data to support the extent of such
impact.
B. Paperwork Reduction Act

requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995. 275 In

accordance with the requirements of the PRA, the Agencies may not conduct or sponsor,
and a respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays
a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The
information collection requirements contained in this joint notice of proposed rulemaking
have been submitted by the OCC, FDIC, NCUA, and SEC to OMB for review and
approval under section 3506 of the PRA and section 1320.11 of OMB’s implementing
regulations (5 CFR 1320). The Board reviewed the proposed rule under the authority
delegated to the Board by OMB. FHFA has found that, with respect to any regulated
entity as defined in section 1303(20) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C.
4502(20)), the proposed rule does not contain any collection of information that requires
the approval of the OMB under the PRA. The recordkeeping requirements are found in
sections __.4(f), __.5, and __.11.
Comments are invited on:
(a) Whether the collections of information are necessary for the proper
performance of the Agencies’ functions, including whether the information has practical
utility;
(b) The accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collections,
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used;
(c) Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be
collected;
(d) Ways to minimize the burden of the information collections on respondents,
including through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of
information technology;

331

and
(e) Estimates of capital or start up costs and costs of operation, maintenance, and
purchase of services to provide information.
All comments will become a matter of public record. Comments on aspects of
this notice that may affect reporting, recordkeeping, or disclosure requirements and
burden estimates should be sent to the addresses listed in the ADDRESSES section. A
copy of the comments may also be submitted to the OMB desk officer for the Agencies
by mail to U.S. Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street NW, #10235,
Washington, DC 20503, by facsimile to (202) 395-5806, or by e-mail to

Proposed Information Collection
Title of Information Collection: Recordkeeping Requirements Associated with IncentiveBased Compensation Arrangements.
Frequency of Response: Annual.
Affected Public: Businesses or other for-profit.
Respondents:
OCC: National banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches or agencies
of a foreign bank with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $1
billion and their subsidiaries.

Board: State member banks, bank holding companies, savings and loan holding
companies, Edge and Agreement corporations, state-licensed uninsured branches or

332

agencies of a foreign bank, and foreign banking organization with average total
consolidated assets greater than or equal to $1 billion and their subsidiaries.

FDIC: State nonmember banks, state savings associations, and state insured branches
of a foreign bank, and certain subsidiaries thereof, with average total consolidated
assets greater than or equal to $1 billion.

NCUA: Credit unions with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to
$1 billion.

SEC: Brokers or dealers registered under section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and investment advisers as such term is defined in section 202(a)(11) of the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, in each case, with average total consolidated assets
greater than or equal to $1 billion.

Abstract: Section 956(e) of the Dodd- Frank Act requires that the Agencies prohibit
incentive-based payment arrangements at a covered financial institution that encourage
inappropriate risks by a financial institution by providing excessive compensation or that
could lead to material financial loss. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a covered financial
institution also must disclose to its appropriate Federal regulator the structure of its
incentive-based compensation arrangements sufficient to determine whether the structure
provides “excessive compensation, fees, or benefits” or “could lead to material financial

333

loss” to the institution. The Dodd-Frank Act does not require a covered financial
institution to disclose compensation of individuals as part of this requirement.
Section __.4(f) would require all covered institutions to create annually and
maintain for a period of at least seven years records that document the structure of all its
incentive-based compensation arrangements and demonstrate compliance with this part.
A covered institution must disclose the records to the Agency upon request. At a
minimum, the records must include copies of all incentive-based compensation plans, a
record of who is subject to each plan, and a description of how the incentive-based
compensation program is compatible with effective risk management and controls.
Section __.5 would require a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution to create
annually and maintain for a period of at least seven years records that document: (1) the
covered institution’s senior executive officers and significant risk-takers, listed by legal
entity, job function, organizational hierarchy, and line of business; (2) the incentive-based
compensation arrangements for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers,
including information on percentage of incentive-based compensation deferred and form
of award; (3) any forfeiture and downward adjustment or clawback reviews and decisions
for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers; and (4) any material changes to
the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation arrangements and policies. A
Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution must create and maintain records in a manner that
allows for an independent audit of incentive-based compensation arrangements, policies,
and procedures, including, those required under §_.11. A Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institution must provide the records described above to the Agency in such form and with
such frequency as requested by Agency.

334

Section __.11 would require a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution to develop
and implement policies and procedures for its incentive-based compensation program
that, at a minimum (1) are consistent with the prohibitions and requirements of this part;
(2) specify the substantive and procedural criteria for the application of forfeiture and
clawback, including the process for determining the amount of incentive-based
compensation to be clawed back; (3) require that the covered institution maintain
documentation of final forfeiture, downward adjustment, and clawback decisions; (4)
specify the substantive and procedural criteria for the acceleration of payments of
deferred incentive-based compensation to a covered person, consistent with section
___.7(a)(1)(iii)(B) and section ___.7(a)(2)(iii)(B)); (5) identify and describe the role of
any employees, committees, or groups authorized to make incentive-based compensation
decisions, including when discretion is authorized; (6) describe how discretion is
expected to be exercised to appropriately balance risk and reward; (7) require that the
covered institution maintain documentation of the establishment, implementation,
modification, and monitoring of incentive-based compensation arrangements, sufficient
to support the covered institution’s decisions; (8) describe how incentive-based
compensation arrangements will be monitored; (9) specify the substantive and procedural
requirements of the independent compliance program consistent with section 9(a)(2); and
(10) ensure appropriate roles for risk management, risk oversight, and other control
function personnel in the covered institution’s processes for designing incentive-based
compensation arrangements and determining awards, deferral amounts, deferral periods,
forfeiture, downward adjustment, clawback, and vesting; and assessing the effectiveness
of incentive-based compensation arrangements in restraining inappropriate risk-taking.

335

Collection of Information is Mandatory
The collection of information will be mandatory for any covered institution
subject to the proposed rules.
Confidentiality
The information collected pursuant to the collection of information will be kept
confidential, subject to the provisions of applicable law.
Estimated Paperwork Burden
In determining the method for estimating the paperwork burden the Board, OCC
and FDIC made the assumption that covered institution subsidiaries of a covered
institution subject to the Board’s, OCC’s or FDIC’s proposed rule, respectively, would
act in concert with one another to take advantage of efficiencies that may exist. The
Board, OCC and FDIC invite comment on whether it is reasonable to assume that
covered institutions that are affiliated entities would act jointly or whether they would act
independently to implement programs tailored to each entity.

Estimated average hours per response:

Amendments to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 and Investment Advisers Act Rule 204-2: The
proposed amendments to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 and Investment Advisers Act Rule
204-2 contain “collection of information requirements” within the meaning of the PRA.
The SEC has submitted the collections of information to OMB for review in accordance
with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5 CFR 1320.11. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a

337

person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a
currently valid OMB control number. OMB has assigned control number 3235-0279 to
Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 and control number 3235-0278 to Investment Advisers Act
Rule 204-2. The titles of these collections of information are “Rule 17a-4; Records to be
Preserved by Certain Exchange Members, Brokers and Dealers” and “Rule 204-2 under
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.” The collections of information required by the
proposed amendments to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 and Investment Advisers Act Rule
204-2 will be necessary for any broker-dealer or investment adviser (registered or
required to be registered under section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act (15 U.S.C.
80b-3)) (“covered investment advisers”), as applicable, that is a covered institution
subject to the proposed rules.
A.

Summary of Collection of Information

The SEC is proposing amendments to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(e) (17 CFR
240.17a-4(e)) and Investment Advisers Act Rule 204-2 (17 CFR 275.204-2) to require
that broker-dealers and covered investment advisers that are covered institutions maintain
the records required by § ___.4(f), and for broker-dealers or covered investment advisers
that are Level 1 or Level 2 covered institutions, §§ ___.5 and ___.11, in accordance with
the recordkeeping requirements of Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 or Investment Advisers Act
Rule 204-2, as applicable.
B.

Proposed Use of Information

The collections of information are necessary for, and will be used by, the SEC to
determine compliance with the proposed rules and section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 requires a broker-dealer to preserve records if the broker-dealer
338

makes or receives the type of record and establishes the general formatting and storage
requirements for records that broker-dealers are required to keep. Investment Advisers
Act Rule 204-2 establishes general recordkeeping requirements for covered investment
advisers. For the sake of consistency with other broker-dealer or covered investment
adviser records, the SEC believes that broker-dealers and covered investment advisers
that are covered institutions should also keep the records required by § ___.4(f), and for
broker-dealers or covered investment advisers that are Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institutions, §§ ___.5 and ___.11, in accordance with these requirements.
C.

Respondents

The collections of information will apply to any broker-dealer or covered
investment adviser that is a covered institution under the proposed rules. The SEC
estimates that 131 broker-dealers and approximately 669 investment advisers will be
covered institutions under the proposed rules. The SEC further estimates that of those
131 broker-dealers, 49 will be Level 1 or Level 2 covered institutions, and 82 will be
Level 3 covered institutions and that of those 669 investment advisers, approximately 18
will be Level 1 covered institutions, approximately 21 will be Level 2 covered
institutions, and approximately 630 will be Level 3 covered institutions. 276
D.

Total Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burden

The collection of information would add three types of records to be maintained
and preserved by broker-dealers and covered investment advisers: the records required by
§ ___.4(f), and for broker-dealers or covered investment advisers that are Level 1 or
276

For a discussion of how the SEC arrived at these estimates, see the SEC Economic Analysis at
Section V.I.

339

Level 2 covered institutions, the records required by § ___.5 and the policies and
procedures required by § ___.11.
1. Exchange Act Rule 17a-4
In recent proposed amendments to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4, the SEC estimated
that proposed amendments adding three types of records to be preserved by brokerdealers pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(b) would impose an initial burden of 39
hours per broker-dealer and an ongoing annual burden of 18 hours and $360 per brokerdealer. 277 The SEC believes that those estimates provide a reasonable estimate for the
burden imposed by the collection of information because the collection of information
would add three types of records to be preserved by broker-dealers pursuant to Exchange
Act Rule 17a-4(e). The records required to be preserved under Exchange Act Rule 17a4(e) are subject to the similar formatting and storage requirements as the records required
to be preserved under Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(b). For example, paragraph (f) of
Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 provides that the records a broker-dealer is required to
maintain and preserve under Exchange Act Rule 17a-4, including those under paragraph
(b) and (e), may be immediately produced or reproduced on micrographic media or by
means of electronic storage media. Similarly, paragraph (j) of Exchange Act Rule 17a-4
requires a broker-dealer to furnish promptly to a representative of the SEC legible, true,

277

Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers, Major
Security-Based Swap Participants, and Broker-Dealers; Capital Rule for Certain Security-Based
Swap Dealers, Release No. 34-71958 (Apr. 17, 2014), 79 FR 25194, 25267 (May 2, 2014). The
burden hours estimated by the SEC for amending Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(b) include burdens
attributable to ensuring adequate physical space and computer hardware and software storage for
the records and promptly producing them when requested. These burdens may include, as
necessary, acquiring additional physical space, computer hardware, and software storage and
establishing and maintaining additional systems for computer software and hardware storage.

340

complete, and current copies of those records of the broker-dealer that are required to be
preserved under Exchange Act Rule 17a-4, including those under paragraph (b) and (e).
The SEC notes, however, that paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 includes
a three-year minimum retention period while paragraph (e) does not include any retention
period. Thus, to the extent that a portion of the SEC’s previously estimated burdens with
respect to the amendments to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(b) represent the burden of
complying with the minimum retention period, using those same burden estimates with
respect to the collection of information may represent a slight overestimate because the
collection of information does not include a minimum retention period. The SEC
believes, however, that the previously estimated burdens with respect to the amendments
to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(b) represent a reasonable estimate of the burdens of the
collection of information given the other similarities between Exchange Act Rule 17a4(b) and Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(e) discussed above. Moreover, the burden to create,
and the retention period for, the records required by § ___.4(f), and for Level 1 and Level
2 broker-dealers, the records required by § ___.5 and the policies and procedures required
by § ___.11, is accounted for in the PRA estimates for the proposed rules. Consequently,
the burdens imposed by the collection of information are to ensure adequate physical
space and computer hardware and software storage for the records and promptly produce
them when requested. 278

278

As discussed above, paragraph (j) of Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 requires a broker-dealer to
furnish promptly to a representative of the SEC legible, true, complete, and current copies of
those records of the broker-dealer that are required to be preserved under Exchange Act Rule 17a4. Thus, the SEC estimates that this promptness requirement will be part of the incremental
burden of the collection of information.

341

Therefore, the SEC estimates that each of the three types of records required to be
preserved pursuant to the collection of information will each impose an initial burden of
13 hours 279 per respondent and an ongoing annual burden of 6 hours 280 and $120 281 per
respondent. This is the result of dividing the SEC’s previously estimated burdens with
respect to the amendments to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(b) by three to produce a perrecord burden estimate.
The SEC estimates that requiring broker-dealers to maintain the records required
by § ___.4(f) in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 will impose an initial burden
of 13 hours per respondent and a total ongoing annual burden of 6 hours and $120 per
respondent. The total burden for all respondents will be 1,703 hours initially (13 hours x
131 Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 broker-dealers) and 786 hours annually (6 hours x 131
Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 broker-dealers) with an annual cost of $15,720 ($120 x 131
Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 broker-dealers).
The SEC estimates that requiring Level 1 and Level 2 broker-dealers to maintain
the records required by § ___.5 in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 will impose
an initial burden of 13 hours per respondent and a total ongoing annual burden of 6 hours
and $120 per respondent. The total burden for all Level 1 and Level 2 broker-dealers will
279

13 hours is the result of dividing the SEC’s previously estimated burdens with respect to the
amendments to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(b) (39 hours) by three to produce a per-record burden
estimate. 39 hours / 3 types of records = 13 hours per record. These internal hours likely will be
performed by a senior database administrator.
280
6 hours is the result of dividing the SEC’s previously estimated burdens with respect to the
amendments to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(b) (18 hours) by three to produce a per-record burden
estimate. 18 hours / 3 types of records = 6 hours per record. These internal hours likely will be
performed by a compliance clerk.
281
$120 is the result of dividing the SEC’s previously estimated cost with respect to the
amendments to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(b) ($360) by three to produce a per-record cost
estimate. $360 hours / 3 types of records = $120 per record.

342

be 637 hours initially (13 hours x 49 Level 1 and Level 2 broker-dealers) and 294 hours
annually (6 hours x 49 Level 1 and Level 2 broker-dealers) with an annual cost of $5,880
($120 x 49 Level 1 and Level 2 broker-dealers).
The SEC estimates that requiring Level 1 and Level 2 broker-dealers to maintain
the policies and procedures required by § ___.11 in accordance with Exchange Act Rule
17a-4 will impose an initial burden of 13 hours per respondent and a total ongoing annual
burden of 6 hours and $120 per respondent. The total burden for all Level 1 and Level 2
broker-dealers will be 637 hours initially (13 hours x 49 Level 1 and Level 2 brokerdealers) and 294 hours annually (6 hours x 49 Level 1 and Level 2 broker-dealers) with
an annual cost of $5,880 ($120 x 49 Level 1 and Level 2 broker-dealers).
In the Supporting Statement accompanying the most recent extension of
Exchange Act Rule 17a-4’s collection of information, the SEC estimated that each
registered broker-dealer spends 254 hours annually to ensure it is in compliance with
Rule 17a-4 and produce records promptly when required, and $5,000 each year on
physical space and computer hardware and software to store the requisite documents and
information. 282 Thus, for Level 3 broker-dealers, as a result of the collection of
information, the total annual burden to ensure compliance with Rule 17a-4 and produce
records promptly when required will be 260 hours 283 and $5,120 284 per Level 3 broker-

As discussed above, the SEC estimates an increase of $120 for Level 3 brokerdealers and $360 for Level 1 and Level 2 broker-dealers to the $5,000 spent each year by
a broker-dealer on physical space and computer hardware and software to store the
requisite documents and information as a result of the collection of information. The
SEC estimates that respondents will not otherwise seek outside assistance in completing the
collection of information or experience any other external costs in connection with the
collection of information.

2. Investment Advisers Act Rule 204-2
The currently-approved total annual burden estimate for rule 204-2 is 1,986,152
hours. This burden estimate was based on estimates that 10,946 advisers were subject to
the rule, and each of these advisers spends an average of 181.45 hours preparing and
preserving records in accordance with the rule. Based on updated data as of January 4,
2016, there are 11,956 registered investment advisers. 287 This increase in the number of
registered investment advisers increases the total burden hours of current rule 204-2 from
1,986,152 to 2,169,417, an increase of 183,265 hours. 288
The proposed amendment to rule 204-2 would require covered investment
advisers that are Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered institutions to make and keep true,
accurate, and current the records required by, and for the period specified in, § __.4(f)
and, for those covered investment advisers that are Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institutions, the records required by, and for the periods specified in, §§ __.5 and __.11.
Based on SEC staff experience, the SEC estimates that the proposed amendment
to rule 204-2 would increase each registered investment adviser’s average annual
collection burden under rule 204-2 by 2 hours 289 for each of the three types of records

287

Based on data from the Commission’s Investment Adviser Registration Depository (“IARD”)
as of January 4, 2016.
288
This estimate is based on the following calculations: (11,956 – 10,946) x 181.45 = 183,265;
183,265 + 1,986,152 = 2,169,417.
289
The burden hours estimated by the SEC for amending Investment Advisers Act Rule 204-2
assumes that the covered investment adviser already has systems in place to comply with the
general requirements of Investment Advisers Rule 204-2. Accordingly, the 2 burden hours
estimated by the SEC for each type of record required to be preserved pursuant to these proposed
rules is attributable solely to the burden associated with maintaining such record.

346

required to be preserved pursuant to the collection of information. 290 Therefore, for a
covered investment adviser that is a Level 1 covered institution, the increase in its
average annual collection burden would be from 181.45 hours to 187.45 hours, 291 and
would thus increase the annual aggregate burden for rule 204-2 by 108 hours, 292 from
2,169,417 hours to 2,169,525 hours. 293 As monetized, the estimated burden for each such
investment adviser’s average annual burden under rule 204-2 would increase by
approximately $450, 294 which would increase the estimated monetized aggregate annual
burden for rule 204-2 by $8,100, from $162,706,275 to $162,714,375. 295 For a covered
investment adviser that is a Level 2 covered institution, the increase in its average annual
collection burden would be from 181.45 hours to 185.45 hours, 296 and would thus
increase the annual aggregate burden for rule 204-2 by 84 hours, 297 from 2,169,525
hours 298 to 2,169,609 hours. 299 As monetized, the estimated burden for each such

NCUA and the FDIC have determined that this proposed rulemaking would not
affect family well-being within the meaning of Section 654 of the Treasury and General
Government Appropriations Act of 1999. 310
D. Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994
The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994
(“RCDRIA”) requires that each Federal Banking Agency, in determining the effective
date and administrative compliance requirements for new regulations that impose
additional reporting, disclosure, or other requirements on insured depository institutions,
consider, consistent with principles of safety and soundness and the public interest, any
administrative burdens that such regulations would place on depository institutions,
including small depository institutions, and customers of depository institutions, as well
as the benefits of such regulations. In addition, new regulations that impose additional
reporting, disclosures, or other new requirements on insured depository institutions
generally must take effect on the first day of a calendar quarter that begins on or after the
date on which the regulations are published in final form.
The Federal Banking Agencies note that comment on these matters has been
solicited in the discussions of section __.1 and __.3 in Part II of the Supplementary
Information, as well as other sections of the preamble, and that the requirements of
RCDRIA will be considered as part of the overall rulemaking process. In addition, the
Federal Banking Agencies also invite any other comments that further will inform the
Federal Banking Agencies’ consideration of RCDRIA.

E. Solicitation of Comments on Use of Plain Language
Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 311 requires the Federal Banking
Agencies to use plain language in all proposed and final rules published after January 1,
2000. The Federal Banking Agencies invite comments on how to make these proposed
rules easier to understand. For example:
• Have the agencies organized the material to suit your needs? If not, how could this
material be better organized?
• Are the requirements in the proposed rules clearly stated? If not, how could the
proposed rules be more clearly stated?
• Do the proposed rules contain language or jargon that is not clear? If so, which
language requires clarification?
• Would a different format (grouping and order of sections, use of headings,
paragraphing) make the proposed rules easier to understand? If so, what changes to the
format would make the proposed rules easier to understand?
• What else could the Agencies do to make the regulation easier to understand?
F. OCC Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 Determination
The OCC has analyzed the proposed rule under the factors set forth in section 202
of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (“UMRA”) (2 U.S.C. 1532). Under this
analysis, the OCC considered whether the proposed rule includes Federal mandates that
may result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or

311

Pub. L. 106-102, section 722, 113 Stat. 1338 1471 (1999).

352

by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year (adjusted annually for
inflation). For the following reasons, the OCC finds that the proposed rule does not
trigger the $100 million UMRA threshold. First, the mandates in the proposed rule do
not apply to State, local, and tribal governments. Second, the overall estimate of the
maximum one-year cost of the proposed rule to the private sector is approximately $50
million. For this reason, and for the other reasons cited above, the OCC has determined
that this proposed rule will not result in expenditures by State, local, and tribal
governments, or the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one
year. Accordingly, this proposed rule is not subject to section 202 of the UMRA.
G. Differences Between the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Enterprises
Section 1313(f) of the Safety and Soundness Act requires the Director of FHFA,
when promulgating regulations relating to the Federal Home Loan Banks, to consider the
differences between the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Enterprises (Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac) as they relate to: The Federal Home Loan Banks’ cooperative ownership
structure; the mission of providing liquidity to members; the affordable housing and
community development mission; their capital structure; and their joint and several
liability on consolidated obligations (12 U.S.C. 4513(f)). The Director also may consider
any other differences that are deemed appropriate. In preparing this proposed rule, the
Director considered the differences between the Federal Home Loan Banks and the
Enterprises as they relate to the above factors, and determined that the rule is
appropriate. FHFA requests comments regarding whether differences related to those
factors should result in any revisions to the proposed rule.
H. NCUA Executive Order 13132 Determination
353

Executive Order 13132 encourages independent regulatory agencies to consider
the impact of their actions on state and local interests. In adherence to fundamental
federalism principles, NCUA, an independent regulatory agency, 312 voluntarily complies
with the Executive Order. As required by statute, the proposed rule, if adopted, will
apply to federally insured, state-chartered credit unions. These institutions are already
subject to numerous provisions of NCUA’s rules, based on the agency’s role as the
insurer of member share accounts and the significant interest NCUA has in the safety and
soundness of their operations. Because the statute specifies that this rule must apply to
state-chartered credit unions, NCUA has determined that the proposed rule does not
constitute a policy that has federalism implications for purposes of the Executive Order.
I. SEC Economic Analysis
A. Introduction
As discussed above, section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC, jointly
with other appropriate Federal regulators, to prescribe regulations or guidelines to require
covered institutions to disclose information about their incentive-based compensation
arrangements sufficient for the Agencies to determine whether their compensation
structure provides an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with
excessive compensation, fees or benefits or could lead to material financial loss to the
firm. Section 956 also requires the Agencies to jointly prescribe regulations or
guidelines that prohibit any type of incentive-based compensation arrangements, or any
feature of these arrangements, that the Agencies determine encourages inappropriate risks
by covered institutions by providing excessive compensation to officers, employees,
312

44 U.S.C. 3502(5).

354

directors, or principal shareholders (“covered persons”) or that could lead to material
financial loss to the covered institution. While section 956 requires rulemaking to
address a number of types of financial institutions, the rule being proposed by the SEC
would apply to broker-dealers registered with the SEC under section 15 of the Securities
Exchange Act (“broker-dealers” or “BDs”) and investment advisers, as defined in section
202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“investment advisers” or “IAs”).
In connection with its rulemakings, the SEC considers the likely economic effects
of the rules. This section provides the SEC’s economic analysis of the main likely effects
of the proposed rule on broker-dealers and investment advisers that would be covered
under the proposed rule. For purposes of this analysis, the SEC addresses the potential
economic effects for covered BDs and IAs resulting from the statutory mandate and from
the SEC’s exercise of discretion together, recognizing that it is often difficult to separate
the economic effects arising from these two sources. The SEC also has considered the
potential costs and benefits of reasonable alternative means of implementing the mandate.
Where practicable, the SEC has attempted to quantify the effects of the proposed rule;
however, in certain cases noted below, the SEC is unable to provide a reasonable estimate
because the SEC lacks the necessary data.
In particular, because the SEC’s regulation of individuals’ compensation has
historically been centered on disclosures by reporting companies, the SEC lacks
information and data regarding the present incentive-based compensation practices of
broker-dealers and investment advisers if those entities are not themselves reporting
companies under the Exchange Act. In addition, in proposing these rules jointly for
public comment, the Agencies have relied in part on the supervisory experience of the

355

Federal Banking Agencies. 313 Accordingly, for the purposes of evaluating the economic
impact of the proposed rule, the SEC has considered outside analyses and other studies
regarding the effects of incentive-based compensation that are not directly related to
broker-dealers or investment advisers. In addition, the SEC is requesting that
commenters provide data that will permit the SEC to perform a more direct analysis of
the economic impact on broker-dealers and investment advisers that the proposed rules
would have if adopted.
The SEC requests comment on all aspects of the economic effects, including the
costs and benefits of the proposed rule and possible alternatives to the proposed rule. The
SEC appreciates comments that include data or qualitative information that would enable
it to quantify the costs and benefits associated with the proposed rule and alternatives to
the proposed rule.
B. Broad Economic Considerations
Economic theory suggests that even compensation practices that are optimal from
the perspective of one set of stakeholders may not be optimal from the perspective of
others. As discussed below, pay packages that are optimal from the point of view of
certain shareholders may not be optimal from the point of view of taxpayers and other
stakeholders.

313

See, e.g., OCC, Board, FDIC, and Office of Thrift Supervision, “Guidance on Sound Incentive
Compensation Policies” (“2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance”), 75 FR 36395 (June 25,
2010), available at: http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20100621a.htm. As
discussed above, the Federal Banking Agencies have found that any incentive-based
compensation arrangement at a covered institution will encourage inappropriate risks if it does
not sufficiently expose the risk-takers to the consequences of their risk decisions over time, and
that in order to do this, it is necessary that meaningful portions of incentive-based compensation
be deferred and placed at risk of reduction or recovery. This economic analysis relies in part on
these Agencies’ supervisory experience described above.

356

In particular, as discussed above, under certain facts and circumstances, even pay
packages that are optimal from the point of view of shareholders may induce an excessive
amount of risk-taking that could create potentially negative externalities for taxpayers.
For example, also as discussed above, some have argued that during financial crises the
losses of certain financial institutions have resulted in taxpayer assistance. 314 To the
extent that the proposed rule would curtail pay convexity315 by imposing restrictions of
certain amounts, components, and features of incentive-based compensation, the
proposed rule may have potential benefits by lowering the likelihood of an outcome that
may induce negative externalities. The extent of these potential benefits would depend
on specific facts and circumstances at the firm level and individual level, including
whether the size, centrality, and business complexity of the firm and the position of the
individual materially affect the level of risk, including risks that could lead to negative
externalities. While academic literature does not provide clear evidence that brokerdealers and investment advisers have produced negative externalities for taxpayers, 316 the
proposed rule may address scenarios where such externalities could nonetheless arise
because the incentive-based compensation arrangements at a broker-dealer or investment

314

See Gorton, G., 2012. Misunderstanding Financial Crises: Why We Don’t See Them Coming,
Oxford University Press; French et al., 2010. Excerpts from The Squam Lake Report: Fixing the
Financial System. Journal of Applied Corporate Finance 22, 8−21.
315

Pay convexity describes the shape of the payoff curve as a result of compensation
arrangements. More convex payoff curves provide higher rewards for taking on risk.
316

In the academic literature, some studies relate to a broad spectrum of firms in different
industries, while other studies related to firms, primarily banks, in the financial services sector.
The SEC is not aware of studies that focus on broker-dealers and investment advisers. While
certain findings in the financial services sector may apply also to broker-dealers and investment
advisers, any generalization is subject to a number of limitations. For example, BDs and IAs
differ from other financial services firms with respect to business models, nature of the risks
posed by the institutions, and the nature and identity of the persons affected by those risks.

357

adviser generate differences in risk preferences between managers 317 and taxpayers.
From an economic standpoint, when the risk preferences of managers (agents)
differ from the risk preferences of stakeholders (principals) of a firm, risk-taking may be
considered inappropriate from the point of view of a particular stakeholder. 318 While the
economic theory mainly focuses on the principal-agent relationship between managers
and shareholders, an agency problem may also exist between managers and taxpayers and
between managers and debtholders. For example, certain levels of risk-taking (e.g., those
associated with investments in R&D-intensive activities) may be optimal 319 for
shareholders but considered to be excessive for debtholders. In general, debtholders are
likely to require a rate of return on their investment that is proportionate to the riskiness
of the firm and to put in place covenants in the contracts governing the debt that restrict
those managerial actions that, in their view, may constitute inappropriate risk-taking but
that shareholders may find appropriate. 320

317

The SEC’s economic analysis uses the term “managers” in an economic (rather than
organizational) connotation as the persons or entities that are able to make decisions on behalf of,
or that impact, another person or entity. Thus, managers in this context would include covered
persons such as senior executive officers and significant risk-takers.
318

The literature in economics and finance typically refers to a principal-agent model to describe
the employment relationship between shareholders and managers of a firm. The principal
(shareholder) hires an agent (manager) to operate the firm. More generally, the principal-agent
model is also used to describe the relationship between managers and stakeholders. For example,
see Jensen, M., Meckling, W. 1976. Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and
Ownership Structure. Journal of Financial Economics 3, 305−360.
319

The economic literature uses the term of “optimal” (“suboptimal”) level of risk-taking in a
technical manner to describe the alignment (misalignment) in risk preferences between managers
and a particular stakeholder. Here “optimal” means from the point of view of a particular
stakeholder (e.g., shareholders). Hereafter, consistently with the economic literature, the SEC’s
economic analysis uses these terms without any normative connotation or implication.
320

Both managers and shareholders have an incentive to engage in activities that promise high
payoffs if successful even if they have a low probability of success. If such activities turn out
well, managers and shareholders capture most of the gains, whereas if they turn out badly

358

Tying managerial compensation to firm performance aims at aligning the
incentives of management with the interests of shareholders. 321 Managers are likely to be
motivated by drivers other than their explicit compensation, including for example career
advancements, personal pride, and job retention concerns. Beyond that, making their
compensation in part depend on firm performance could incentivize managers to exert
effort and make decisions that maximize shareholder value. In a principal-agent
relationship between shareholders and managers, there may be an incentive misalignment
that may give rise to agency problems between the parties: for example, managers may
take on projects that benefit their personal wealth but do not necessarily increase the
value of the firm. Absent a variable component in the compensation arrangements that
encourages risk-taking, risk averse and undiversified managers 322 may take less risk than
is optimal from the point of view of shareholders. 323
With an aim to incentivize managers to take on risk that is optimal for

debtholders bear most of the costs. In the principal-agent relationship between managers and
debtholders, inappropriate risk taking would amount to managers’ actions that transfer risks from
shareholders to debtholders and that benefit shareholders at the expense of debtholders. See
Jensen, M., Meckling, W. 1976. Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and
Ownership Structure. Journal of Financial Economics 3, 305−360.
321

See Ibid.

322

The differential degree of diversification between managers’ and shareholders’ portfolios may
lead to a misalignment of managerial incentives from optimal risk-taking from the point of view
of shareholders. In general, executives are relatively undiversified compared to the average
investor, because a significant fraction of executives’ wealth is invested into the companies they
operate, through the value of their firm-specific human capital and their portfolio holdings,
including their compensation-related claims. The concentration of managerial wealth in their
employer company may lead to managerial aversion towards value-enhancing but risky projects
since such projects can place undiversified managerial wealth at heightened levels of risk. See
Hall, B., and Murphy, K. 2002. Stock Options for Undiversified Executives. Journal of
Accounting and Economics 33, 3−42.
323

Most managers would operate in a multi-period framework. In this environment, managers
would still have incentives to exert effort and make decisions that maximize shareholder value
due to career concerns and expectations about future wages.

359

shareholders and to attract and retain managerial talent, managerial compensation
arrangements most often include incentive-based compensation, which is the variable
component of compensation that serves as an incentive or a reward for performance. 324
Incentive-based compensation arrangements typically include 325 performance-based
compensation whose award is conditional on achieving specified performance measures
that are evaluated over a certain time period (i.e., short-term and long-term incentive
plans), in absolute terms or in relation to a peer group. It encompasses a wide range of
forms of compensation instruments. Among these forms, equity-based compensation
(e.g., performance share units, restricted stock units, and stock option awards) ties
managerial wealth to stock performance to motivate managers to take actions—exert
effort and take risks—that are more directly aligned with the interests of shareholders.
Equity awards are typically subject to multi-year vesting schedules and vesting
conditions restricting managers from unwinding their equity positions during vesting
periods. Relatedly, some managers are often prohibited from hedging their equity
positions in their firm’s stock against any downside in the stock value.
Incentivizing managers through compensation to take on shareholders’ preferred
amount of risk requires a delicate balancing act, because different combinations of
amounts, components and features of incentive-based compensation may make
managerial pay more or less sensitive to firm risk than the level that is desired by

324

Incentive-based compensation addresses the fact that shareholders cannot observe how much
effort managers exert or should exert. Because shareholders do not know and cannot specify
every action managers should take in every scenario, shareholders delegate many of the decisions
to managers by compensating them based on the results from those decisions.

325

See, for example, Frydman, C., and R. Saks, 2010. Executive Compensation: A New View
from a Long-Term Perspective, 1936–2005. Review of Financial Studies 23, 2099−2138.

360

shareholders to maximize their return. In particular, different combinations may make
pay a nonlinear (in particular, convex) function of performance; in other words, a greater
increment in payoffs is realized in the case of high performance, compared to when
performance is moderate or poor. While there has been ample debate about how certain
characteristics of incentive-based compensation may affect pay convexity and induce
risk-taking, the economic literature has not conclusively identified a specific amount,
component, or feature of incentive-based compensation that uniformly leads to
inappropriate risk-taking, due to differential facts and circumstances at both the firm level
and individual level.
For example, stock options and risk grants are often seen as a form of incentivebased compensation that, under certain conditions, may lead to incentives for taking
inappropriate risk from shareholders’ point of view. 326 Compared to cash incentives or
restricted stock units, stock options have an asymmetric payoff structure since they
provide the option holder with unlimited upside potential and limited downside. In
particular, given that a positive outcome from risk-taking is a positive payoff, whereas a
negative outcome does not symmetrically penalize the option holder, the design of stock
options is likely to encourage managers to undertake risks. The empirical research on the
effect of stock options on risk-taking does in general support a positive relation between
option-based compensation and risk-taking; 327 however, as a whole, the academic

326

327

See Guay, W. 1999. The sensitivity of CEO wealth to equity risk: an analysis of the magnitude
and determinants. Journal of Financial Economics 53, 43−71. Stock options, as opposed to
common stockholdings, increase the sensitivity of CEOs’ wealth to equity risk. The study
documents a positive relation between the convexity in compensation arrangements and stock
return volatility suggesting that such compensation arrangements are related to riskier investing

361

evidence is mixed on whether stock options induce inappropriate risk-taking from the
point of view of shareholders.
Some studies show that the relation between option-based compensation and risktaking incentives is not uniform across different firms, and the incentives to undertake
risk may vary depending on certain conditions. 328 For example, options that are deep inthe-money may lead the option holder to moderate risk exposure to protect the value of
the option. On the other hand, options that are deep out-of-the-money may provide
incentives for excessive risk-taking. Additionally, there is significant variation across
companies with regard to the use of options in compensation arrangements. Stock
options are a relatively more significant component of compensation arrangements for
executives in companies where risk-taking is important for maximizing shareholder
value. 329
Another example of a characteristic in incentive-based compensation
arrangements that is commonly considered to potentially provide incentives for actions
that carry undesired risks is the disproportionate use of short-term (e.g., measured over a
period of one year) performance measures (i.e., accounting, stock price-based, or
nonfinancial measures) that may steer managers toward short-termism without adequate

and financing decisions. Stock options are mostly used in companies where underinvestment is
value-increasing but risky projects may lead to significant losses in the value of these companies.
328

See Ross, S. 2004. Compensation, Incentives, and the Duality of Risk Aversion and Riskiness.
Journal of Finance 59, 207−225; Carpenter, J. 2000. Does Option Compensation Increase
Managerial Risk Appetite? Journal of Finance 55, 2311−2332. Both studies question the
common belief that stock options unequivocally induce holders to undertake more risk. Although
the asymmetric payoff structure of options is likely to encourage risk-taking in some cases, there
are also circumstances where options may lead to decreased appetite for risk taking by option
holders.

regard of the long-term risks potentially posed to long-term firm value. 330 In doing so,
managers may reap the rewards of their actions in the short run but may not participate in
the potentially negative outcomes that may materialize in the long run. Short-termism
may lead to investment distortions in the long run, such as under- 331 or overinvestment, 332 that are potentially detrimental to shareholder value. Some academic
studies suggest that managers’ focus on short-term performance may arise simply out of
their reputation and career concerns, and compensation awards tied to short-term
performance measures may accentuate the tendency toward short-termism. 333

330

See Bizjak, J., Brickley, J., Coles, J. 1993. Stock-based incentive compensation and
investment behavior. Journal of Accounting and Economics 16, 349−372. The authors argue that
managerial concern about current stock prices could lead management to distort optimal
investment decisions in an effort to influence the current stock price. Such short-termism is likely
to be exacerbated when there is a significant information asymmetry between management and
investors. The study argues that compensation arrangements with longer horizons are a potential
solution to such behavior, and finds that firms with higher information asymmetries between
management and shareholders actually use compensation arrangements with relatively longer
horizons.

See Bebchuk, L., Stole, L. 1993. Do Short-term Objectives Lead to Under- or Overinvestment
in Long-Term Projects? Journal of Finance 48, 719−729. The paper develops a model showing
that, depending on the nature of the information asymmetry between management and
shareholders, either under- or over-investment in long-run projects is likely to occur. When
shareholders cannot observe the level of investment in long-term projects, the model predicts that
managers would underinvest. When shareholders can observe the level of investment but not the
productivity of such investment, then managers have incentives to over-invest.

See Narayanan, M.P. 1985. Managerial Incentives for Short-Term Results. Journal of Finance
40, 1469−1484; and Stein, J. 1989. Efficient Capital Markets, Inefficient Firms: A Model of
Myopic Corporate Behavior. Quarterly Journal of Economics 104, 655−669. These studies
examine managerial incentives to focus on shorter-term performance at the expense of longerterm value. When managers have information about firm decisions that investors do not have,
focusing on short-term performance may be an optimal strategy from managers to enhance their
perceived skill and reputation, as well as achieve higher compensation. The studies also argue
that even if the market anticipates such short-termism from managers, the optimal strategy for
managers would still be to focus on short-term results. Narayanan (1985) also shows that shorttermism can be partially curbed by offering longer-term contracts to managers.

363

Studies document that short-term incentive plans or annual bonuses typically
represent a small fraction of executive compensation. 334 Additionally, a recent study
provides evidence of a significant increase in the number of firms granting multi-year
accounting-based performance incentives to their chief executive officers (“CEOs”). 335
Firms with relatively less volatile accounting performance measures and a stronger
presence of long-term shareholders are more likely to utilize these compensation
arrangements. As a whole, the academic evidence is mixed on whether short-term
incentive plans induce inappropriate risk-taking from the point of view of certain
shareholders. However, there is evidence that certain equity-based compensation

A survey of Chief Financial Officers indicates that, among other motivations, career concerns and
reputation act as leading motivations for the significant focus of executives on delivering shortterm performance (e.g., quarterly earnings expectations). The survey also documents that
executives are willing to forgo long-term value enhancing activities and projects in order to
deliver on short-term performance targets. See Graham, J., Harvey, C., and Rajgopal, S. 2005.

See Frydman, C., and R. Saks, 2010. Executive Compensation: A New View from a LongTerm Perspective, 1936–2005. Review of Financial Studies 23, 2099−2138. The paper documents
the evolution of various characteristics of executive compensation arrangements for the 50 largest
U.S. companies since 1936. Long-term pay including deferred bonuses in the form of restricted
stock and stock options comprised the largest part of executive compensation in recent years. For
example, 35% of total executive pay for these companies was in the form of long-term bonuses in
the form of restricted stock in 2005.
335

See Li, Z., and L. Wang, 2013. Executive Compensation Incentives Contingent on Long-Term
Accounting Performance, Working Paper. The study documents a significant increase in the use
of long-term accounting performance plans for CEOs of S&P500 companies. More specifically,
the study documents that 43% of S&P500 companies used long-term accounting performance
plans in CEO compensation arrangements in 2008, compared to 16% of S&P500 companies in
1996. In general terms, these plans usually rely on a three-year performance measurement period
of various accounting measures of performance such as earnings, revenues, cash flows and other
metrics to determine payouts to CEOs in the form of mostly equity or cash. The paper does not
find evidence that such compensation arrangements are used by CEOs to extract excessive
compensation.

364

arrangements may provide incentives for earnings management 336 and misreporting 337
that could lead to lower long-term shareholder value. Finally, there is also evidence that
compensation contracts with relatively shorter horizons are positively related (in a
statistical sense) to proxies for earnings management. 338
The presence of a number of mitigating factors may explain why evidence is
inconclusive on the effects of incentive-based compensation on inappropriate risk-taking.
One such factor is corporate governance and, more specifically, board of directors
oversight over executive compensation. The board of directors, as an agent of
shareholders, may monitor managers and review their performance (e.g., through the
compensation committee of the board of directors) in the case of decreases in shareholder

336

See Bergstresser, D., Philippon, T. 2006. CEO incentives and earnings management. Journal
of Financial Economics 80, 511−529. The paper presents evidence that highly incentivized
CEOs, as measured by the significance of stock and options in CEOs’ compensation
arrangements, are more likely to engage in earnings management that misrepresents the true
economic performance of a company, with the intent to personally profit from such
misrepresentation of performance. Although tying CEOs’ wealth to company performance aims
at aligning the incentives of CEOs with those of shareholders, the strength of such incentives may
lead to unintended consequences such as incentives to misrepresent company performance in
efforts to increase the value of their compensation.
337

See Burns, N., Kedia, S. 2006. The impact of performance-based compensation on
misreporting. Journal of Financial Economics 79, 35−67. The study provides empirical evidence
that CEOs whose option portfolios are more sensitive to the stock price of the company are more
likely to misreport their performance. The paper does not find any evidence that the sensitivity of
other components of performance-based compensation to stock price, such as restricted stock and
bonuses, are related to the propensity to misreport performance. The asymmetric payoff structure
of stock options provides incentives to CEOs to misreport because of the limited downside risk
associated with the detection of misreporting.
338

See Gopalan, R., Milbourn, T., Song, F., and Thakor, A. 2014. Duration of Executive
Compensation. Journal of Finance 69, 2777−2817. The paper constructs a measure of executive
pay duration that reflects the vesting periods of different pay components to investigate its
association with short-termism. Pay duration is positively related to growth opportunities, longterm assets, R&D intensity, lower risk and better recent stock performance. Longer CEO pay
duration is negatively related with income increasing accruals.

value that, among other factors, may be a result of inappropriate risk-taking. 339 Also,
corporate boards may attempt to determine compensation arrangements for executives in
a way that aligns executives’ interests with those of shareholders. The empirical
evidence on the effectiveness of board of directors oversight over executive
compensation is mixed. One study finds evidence suggesting that certain boards are not
effective in setting executive compensation because executives are often rewarded for
performance due to luck. 340 Another study provides evidence that CEOs play an
important role in the nomination and selection of board of directors members, suggesting
that board of directors oversight may be impaired as a result. 341 Other studies find that

339

While the SEC is not aware of any literature that directly examines inappropriate risk-taking
and managerial retention decisions, there is evidence in the academic literature documenting a
higher likelihood of managerial turnover following poor performance measured with stock
returns or accounting measures of performance (See for example, Engel, E., Hayes, R., and
Wang, X. 2003. CEO Turnover and Properties of Accounting Information. Journal of Accounting
and Economics 36, 197−226; and Farell, K., and Whidbee, D. 2003. The Impact of Firm
Performance Expectations on CEO Turnover and Replacement Decisions. Journal of Accounting
and Economics 36, 165−196.).
340

See Bertrand, M., and S. Mullainathan, 2001. Are CEOs rewarded for luck? The ones without
principals are. Quarterly Journal of Economics 116, 901−932. The paper examines whether the
component of firm performance that is outside of managerial control is related to managerial
compensation. According to the efficient contracting view of compensation, i.e. compensation
arrangements are used to mitigate principal-agent problems, executives should not be rewarded
(nor penalized) for performance due to luck. The authors propose a ‘skimming view’ for
managerial compensation where CEOs capture the compensation setting process and find
evidence that CEOs of oil companies get rewarded when changes in oil prices induce favorable
changes in company performance. See also Bebchuk, L.A., Fried, J.M., Walker, D.I., 2002.

See Coles, J., Daniel, N., and Naveen, L. Co-opted Boards. 2014. Review of Financial Studies
27, 1751−1796. The study examines whether independent directors that are appointed after the
current CEO assumed office are effective monitors of the CEO. The findings show that there is a
difference in the monitoring efficiency between independent directors holding their position prior
to the current CEO’s appointment vs. independent directors that join the board of directors after
the current CEO has assumed office (Co-opted board members). The percentage of ‘co-opted’
board members in a company is negatively related with various measures of board monitoring.
For example, these companies tend to pay their CEOs more and have lower turnover-performance

366

firms with strong governance are better than firms with weak governance at monitoring
the CEO and have better control of size and structure of CEO pay. 342
Another example of a mitigating factor is the implementation of risk controls over
business activities that academic studies have generally found effective at curbing
inappropriate risk-taking. One study 343 examines the relation between risk controls at
bank holding companies (“BHCs”) and outcomes related to risk-taking, such as the
fraction of loans that are non-performing, during the financial crisis. In this study, the
strength and quality of risk controls are proxied by the existence, independence,
experience and centrality of the Chief Risk Officer and the corresponding Risk
Committee. The study finds that BHCs with strong risk controls during years preceding

sensitivity (i.e., CEOs are less likely to be fired following deteriorating firm performance). The
study questions whether independent directors appointed after CEO assumed office are really
independent to the CEO.
Relatedly, another study finds that on average directors receive a very high level of votes in
elections, in the post-SOX era. The evidence points to the fact that if a director is slated, she is
elected. However, the study also finds evidence that lower levels of director votes lead to
reductions in ‘abnormal’ compensation and an increase in the level of CEO turnover. This latter
result is particularly strong when these directors serve as chair or members of the compensation
committee. See Cai, J., Garner, J., and Walking R. 2009. Journal of Finance 64, 2389−2421.

See Core, J., R. W. Holthausen, and D. F. Larcker. 1999. Corporate Governance, Chief
Executive Officer Compensation, and Firm Performance. Journal of Financial Economics 51,
371–406. The paper finds that board and ownership structure explain differences in CEO
compensation across firms to a significant extent. Weaker governance structures are related to
greater agency problems resulting in higher CEO compensation.
See Chhaochharia, V., and Grinstein, Y. 2009. CEO Compensation and Board Structure. Journal
of Finance 64, 231−261, showing that companies that were least compliant with new regulations
issued in 2002 by NYSE and NASDAQ (regarding governance listing standards) decreased
compensation to their CEOs to a significant extent. The decrease in CEO compensation is mainly
attributable to decreases in bonus and stock-based compensation. The results suggest that
requirements for board of directors structure and procedures have a significant effect on the
structure and size of CEO compensation. See also Fahlenbrach, R. 2009. Shareholder Rights,
Boards, and CEO Compensation. Review of Finance 13, 81−113, finding evidence of a
substitution effect between compensation and other governance mechanisms.

the crisis had lower frequencies of underperforming loans and better operating and stock
performance during the crisis. In this study, this relation was not significant in the years
outside of the financial crisis indicating that strong risk controls, as measured by this
study, curtailed extreme risk exposures only during the financial crisis. Another study 344
shows that lenders with relatively powerful risk managers, as measured by the level of
the risk manager’s compensation relative to the level of named executive officers’
compensation, experience lower loan default rates, interpreting this finding as evidence
that strong risk management is effective in reducing the origination of low quality loans.
Another mechanism that could play a mitigating role at curtailing the potential
effects of incentive-based compensation on inappropriate risk-taking is reputation and
career concerns of executives. On one hand, some studies show that managers’ concerns
about the effects of current performance on their future compensation are important in
affecting managerial incentives, even in the absence of formal compensation contracts. 345
For example, executives with greater career concerns typically have an incentive to take
less risk than optimal for the company346 and an executive’s pay-for-performance

See Gibbons, Robert, and Kevin J. Murphy. 1992. Optimal incentive contracts in the presence
of career concerns: Theory and evidence, Journal of Political Economy 100, 468–505. The paper
shows that career concerns can have important effects on incentives even in the absence of formal
contracts. The importance of career concerns as a motivating mechanism is particularly relevant
for younger managers whose ability is not yet established in the labor market. Moreover, the
evidence shows that CEOs’ pay-for-performance sensitivity is stronger for CEOs closer to
retirement, consistent with the idea that career concerns are not strong for older CEOs and are
thus re-enforced through formal contracts.
346

See Holmstrom, B. 1999. Managerial Incentive Problems: A Dynamic Perspective. Review of
Economic Studies 66, 169−182. The study models incentives for effort and risk taking by agents
in the presence of career concerns. With regards to risk taking, the model shows that younger

368

sensitivity is higher as the executive becomes older. 347 This suggests that inappropriate
risk-taking could be less severe for younger executives, for whom there are more periods
over which to spread the reward for their efforts. 348 On the other hand, as mentioned
above, some studies also argue that career concerns can lead executives to focus on
delivering short-term performance to enhance their present reputation, at the expense of
long-term value. 349
Some studies argue that compensation structures did not encourage inappropriate
risk-taking and that managers were severely penalized since their portfolio values
suffered considerably during the financial crisis. 350 According to these studies,
executives held significant amounts of their financial institutions’ equity in the form of
stock options and restricted stock when the crisis occurred and the value of these holdings
declined dramatically and quickly, wiping out most of their value. The fact that
executives were still significantly exposed to firm performance by holding on to stock
options and restricted stock units when the crisis occurred can be viewed as an indicator
managers whose talent or ability is not yet known to the market may be reluctant to choose risky
projects that are optimal from a shareholders’ perspective.

of career concerns: Theory and evidence, Journal of Political Economy 100, 468–505.

Young CEOs are likely to differ in other dimensions such as character, knowledge, and
experience and hence establishing a causal effect of career concerns on risk taking could be
difficult. See Cziraki, P., and M. Xu, 2013. CEO career concerns and risk-taking, working paper.

See Murphy, K. 2009. Compensation Structure and Systemic Risk. USC Marshall School of
Business Working Paper. Compensation for CEOs and other named executive officers (NEOs)
significantly suffered during the crisis. For TARP recipient institutions: bonuses declined by
approximately 80% from 2007 to 2008, and the value of stock options and restricted stock held
by NEOs declined by more than 80% during the same time period. Executive compensation also
significantly declined for non-TARP recipients but the decline was lower than for TARP
recipients.

that these executives had no knowledge of the significant risks associated with their
actions. 351 According to this view, executives were held accountable and penalized upon
the realization of the risks undertaken.
However, some other studies argue that, whereas bank executives lost significant
amounts of wealth tied to their stock and stock option holdings during the crisis, they also
received significant amounts of compensation during the years leading up to the financial
crisis. 352 Significant amounts of short-term bonuses were paid in the years preceding the
crisis, even to executives of financial institutions that failed soon thereafter. While bank
executives walked away with significant gains during the years leading up to the crisis,

351

See Fahlenbrach, R., Stulz, R. 2011. Bank CEO Incentives and the Credit Crisis. Journal of
Financial Economics 99, 11−26. The study examines the link between bank performance during
the crisis and CEO incentives from compensation arrangements preceding the crisis. The
evidence shows that banks whose CEOs’ incentives were better aligned with the interests of
shareholders performed worse during the crisis. The authors argue that a potential explanation for
their findings is that CEOs with better aligned incentives undertook higher risks before the crisis;
such risks were not suboptimal for shareholders at the point in time when they were undertaken.
This explanation is also corroborated by the fact that CEOs did not unload their equity holdings
prior to the crisis and, as a result, their wealth significantly declined.

Compensation at Bear Stearns and Lehman 2000−2008. Yale Journal on Regulation 27, 257−282.
The study presents details regarding payouts made to CEOs and executives of Bear Sterns and
Lehman Brothers during the 2000−2008 period. During the 2000−2008 period, executive teams at
Bear Sterns cashed out a total of $1.4 billion in cash bonuses and equity sales whereas the
executives at Lehman cashed out a total of $1 billion. The authors argue that the divergence
between how top executives and their shareholders fared may suggest that pay arrangements
provided incentives for excessive risk taking.
See Bhagat, S., Bolton, B. 2013. Bank Executive Compensation and Capital Requirements
Reform. Working Paper. The study examines, among other things, 2000−2008 net payoffs to
CEOs of 14 financial institutions that received TARP assistance during the crisis. Consistent with
the findings of Bebchuk et al. (2010), this study shows that CEOs of TARP assisted institutions
cashed out significant amounts of compensation prior to the crisis, but also suffered significant
losses when the crisis hit. The authors find that TARP CEOs cashed out significantly higher
amounts of compensation during the 2000−2008 period compared to other institutions that did not
receive TARP assistance; the finding is interpreted as evidence that TARP CEOs were aware of
the increased risks associated with their actions and significantly limited their exposure to firm
performance before the crisis hit.

370

investors suffered significant losses in their investments in these institutions and, in some
cases, taxpayers provided capital support to save these institutions from default. Thus,
the underlying actions that generated significant positive performance and resulted in
significant payouts to executives in the short run were also responsible for the realization
of the associated risks in the long run. Another study 353 finds that risk-taking incentives
for CEOs at large commercial banks substantially increased around 2000 and suggests
that this increase in risk-taking incentives was, at least partly, a response to growth
opportunities resulting from deregulation. The study also finds that CEOs responded to
the increased risk-taking incentives by increasing both systematic and idiosyncratic risks.
CEOs with strong risk-taking incentives were also more likely to invest in mortgage
backed securities; this finding is interpreted as knowledge on behalf of these CEOs
regarding the risks associated with such investments. Finally, the study finds that,
whereas boards of directors responded by moderating risk-taking incentives in situations
where these incentives were particularly strong, such an effect was absent at the very
largest banks with strong growth opportunities.
Finally, there are also studies that argue that compensation structures were not
responsible for the differential risk-taking and performance of financial institutions
during crises. In particular, a study argues that the differential risk culture across banks

353

See DeYoung, R., Peng, E., Yan, Meng. 2013. Executive Compensation and Business Policy
Choices at U.S. Commercial Banks. Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis 48, 165−196.
The study examines CEOs’ risk-taking incentives at large commercial banks over the 1995−2006
period. The authors link the increase in risk-taking incentives at these banks to growth
opportunities due to deregulation. They find that board of directors moderated CEO risk-taking
incentives but this effect is absent at the largest banks with strong growth opportunities and a
history of highly aggressive risk-taking incentives.

371

determines the differential performance of these institutions. 354 For example, banks that
performed poorly during the 1998 crisis were also found to perform poorly, and had
higher failure rates, during the recent financial crisis. Another recent study argues that,
prior to 2008, risk-taking was inherently different across financial institutions and the fact
that high-risk financial institutions paid high amounts of compensation to their executives
was not an indicator of excessive compensation practices but represented compensation
for the additional risk to which executives’ wealth was exposed. 355 The study suggests
that at financial institutions, compensation was the result of efficient contracting between
managers and shareholders. The study did not find support for the view that
compensation determined risk-taking and ultimately led to the failure of many
institutions.
Taken all together, while there is debate about certain amounts, components, and
features of incentive-based compensation that potentially encourage risk-taking, the

354

Performance in 1998 to Explain Bank Performance during the Recent Financial Crisis. Journal of
Finance 67, 2139−2185. The paper examines whether inherent business models or/and culture
drive certain banks to perform worse during crises. The study documents that banks that
performed poorly, performance measured in terms of stock returns , after Russia’s default in 1998
were also likely to perform poorly during the recent financial crisis. These banks had greater
degrees of leverage, relied more on short-term market funding and grew faster during the years
leading up to both crisis periods. The authors interpret their findings as being attributable to
differential risk-taking cultures across banks that persist over time.
355

See Cheng, I., Hong, H., Scheinkman, J. 2015. Yesterday’s Heroes: Compensation and Risk at
Financial Firms. Journal of Finance 70, 839−879. The paper examines the link between
managerial pay and risk taking in the financial industry. Specifically, the paper builds upon
efficient contracting theory to predict that managers in companies facing greater amounts of
uncontrollable risk would require higher levels of compensation. Given that higher levels of
uncontrollable risk expose managerial compensation to increased risk, risk averse managers
require additional compensation for the increased risk exposure. Using various measures of
arguably uncontrollable company risk, such as lagged risk measures and risk measures when the
company had an IPO, the authors find a positive relation between current compensation and
historical measures of risk. They interpret their results as inherent differences in risk among
financial companies driving differences in compensation levels among these companies.

372

existing academic literature does not provide conclusive evidence about a specific type of
incentive-based compensation arrangement that leads to inappropriate risk-taking without
taking into account other considerations, such as firm characteristics or other governance
mechanisms. In particular, there may be mitigating factors—some more effective than
others—that allow efficient contracting to develop compensation arrangements for
managers to align managerial interests with shareholders’ interests and provide incentives
for maximization of shareholder value.
If it is the case that some institutions are able to contract efficiently for
compensation arrangements, for any such institution that is a covered BD or IA with
large balance sheet assets, and if such institution does not pose potentially negative
externalities on taxpayers, the proposed rule may curtail the pay convexity resulting from
such efficient contracting between managers and shareholders with potential unintended
consequences. In particular, unintended consequences may include curbing risk-taking
incentives to a level that is lower than what shareholders deem optimal, with consequent
negative effects on efficiency and shareholder value. These potential negative effects on
efficiency and shareholder value could manifest themselves in a number of ways. For
example, the lower-than-optimal level of risk-taking could affect covered BDs’ and IAs’
transactions for their own accounts as well as operations that involve customers and
clients. The SEC expects that whether such consequences occur would depend on the
specific facts and circumstances of each covered BD or IA.
In addition, the proposed rule may result in losses of managerial talent that may
migrate from covered institutions to firms in different industries or abroad, especially if
CEOs have developed, in recent decades, general managerial skills that are transferable
373

across firms and industries, as some studies assert. 356 It should be noted, however, as the
discussion in the Preamble suggests, that some foreign regulators (e.g., in UK) have
adopted stricter limits on incentive-based compensation. Thus, some foreign regulators’
restrictions on incentive-based compensation may limit the likelihood of human capital
migrating to foreign institutions subject to those restrictions. Moreover, given that
incentive-based compensation is also designed to attract and retain managerial talent, the
proposed rule may result in an increased level of total compensation to make up for the
limits imposed to award opportunities, for the decrease in present value of the awards that
are deferred, or for the increase in the uncertainty associated with the fact that managers
may not be able to retain the compensation awards due to the potential for forfeiture
during the deferral period and/or clawback during the period following vesting of such
awards. If these unintended consequences occur, they may contribute to reduce the
competitiveness of certain U.S. financial institutions in their role of intermediation,
potentially affecting other industries.
On the other hand, for those covered institutions, including BDs and IAs with
large balance sheets, that do have the potential to generate negative externalities, the
proposed rule may result in better alignment of incentives between managers at these
institutions and taxpayers and hence may have potential benefits by lowering the
likelihood of an outcome that may induce negative externalities. Lowering the likelihood
of negative externalities would be beneficial for the long-term health of these institutions,
other institutions that are interconnected with those covered institutions and, in turn, the

Specialists: Lifetime Work Experience and Chief Executive Officer Pay. Journal of Financial
Economics 108, 471−492.

374

long-term health of the U.S. economy. The extent of these potential benefits, as
mentioned above, would depend on specific facts and circumstances at the firm level and
individual level.
C. Baseline
The baseline for the SEC’s economic analysis of the proposed rule includes the
current incentive-based compensation practices of those covered institutions that are
regulated by the SEC—registered broker-dealers and investment advisers—and the
relevant regulatory requirements that may currently affect such compensation
practices. 357
1. Covered Institutions
Section 956(f) limits the scope of the requirements to covered institutions with
total assets of at least $1 billion. The proposed rule defines covered institution as a
regulated institution that has average total consolidated assets of $1 billion or more.
Regulated institutions include covered BDs and IAs. Based on their average total
consolidated assets, the proposed rule further classifies covered institutions into three
levels: Level 1 covered institutions with average total consolidated assets greater than or
equal to $250 billion; Level 2 covered institutions with average total consolidated assets
greater than or equal to $50 billion, but less than $250 billion; and Level 3 covered
institutions with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $1 billion, but
less than $50 billion.

357

When referencing investment advisers, the SEC’s economic analysis references those
institutions that meet the definition of investment adviser under section 202(a)(11) of the
Investment Advisers Act, including any such institutions that may be prohibited or exempted
from registering with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act and any that are exempt from
registration but are reporting.

375

In the case of BDs and IAs, a Level 1 BD or IA is a covered institution with
average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $250 billion, or a covered
institution that is a subsidiary of a depository institution holding company that is a Level
1 covered institution. A Level 2 BD or IA is a covered institution with average total
consolidated assets greater than or equal to $50 billion that is not a Level 1 covered
institution; or a covered institution that is a subsidiary of a depository institution holding
company that is a Level 2 covered institution. A Level 3 BD or IA is a covered
institution with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $1 billion that is
not a Level 1 covered institution or Level 2 covered institution
Table 1 shows the number of covered BDs and IAs as of December 31, 2014,
sorted by the size of a BD or IA as a covered institution by itself, without considering the
size of that covered institution’s parent depository holding company, if any (hereafter,
“unconsolidated Level 1,” “unconsolidated Level 2,” and “unconsolidated Level 3” BDs
and IAs). 358 We use 2014 data in our analysis because this is the most recent year for
which compensation data is available. From FOCUS reports, there were 131 BDs with
total assets above $1 billion at the end of calendar year 2014. 359 From Item 1(O) of Form
ADV the SEC estimated that, out of 11,702 IAs registered with the SEC, or reporting to
the SEC as an exempt reporting adviser, 669 IAs had total assets of at least $1 billion as
of December 31, 2014, although the SEC lacks information that allows it to further
358

The terms “unconsolidated Level 1 covered institution,” “unconsolidated Level 2 covered
institution,” and “unconsolidated Level 3 covered institution” used in the SEC’s economic
analysis differ from the terms “Level 1 covered institution,” “Level 2 covered institution,” and
“Level 3 covered institution” as defined in the proposed rule.
359

Total assets are taken from FOCUS report, Part II Statement of Financial Condition. The
assets reported in the FOCUS report are required to be consolidated total assets if a BD has
subsidiaries.

376

classify these IAs as Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered institutions. 360

i. Broker-Dealers
In 2014, 4,416 unique BDs filed FOCUS reports. Of these 4,416 BDs, seven had
total assets greater than $250 billion (Level 1 BDs), 13 had total assets between $50
billion and $250 billion (unconsolidated Level 2 BDs), and 111 had total assets between
$1 billion and $50 billion (unconsolidated Level 3 BDs) in 2014. 361 As shown in Table
2, these unconsolidated Level 3 BDs had total assets equal to $9.6 billion on average and
$3.7 billion in median; and about 70 percent (78 out of 111) of them had total assets
below $10 billion.
Table 2. Size distribution of BDs

360

Form ADV requires IAs to report consolidated balance sheet assets. The 669 number includes
59 IAs that are not registered with the SEC but are reporting.
361

For purposes of this analysis, the SEC determined the unconsolidated level of each BD. For
example, if a BD alone had total assets between $1 billion and $50 billion at the end of at least
one calendar quarter in 2014, it was classified in this economic analysis as an unconsolidated
Level 3 BD. Similarly, if a BD alone had total assets between $50 and $250 billion (greater than
$250 billion) in at least one quarter in 2014, it was classified in this economic analysis as an
unconsolidated Level 2 (Level 1) BD. This classification method differs from the proposed rule.
Thus, some of the unconsolidated Level 2 and unconsolidated Level 3 BDs discussed in this
economic analysis may be Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions after consolidation and for
purposes of the proposed rule. Given that an unconsolidated Level 1 BD alone has greater than or
equal to $250 billion in total assets, an unconsolidated Level 1 BD would be a Level 1 covered
institution for purposes of the proposed rule, regardless of consolidation.

The SEC’s analysis indicates that, in 2014, all of the unconsolidated Level 1 and
unconsolidated Level 2 BDs were subsidiaries of a holding company or parent institution.
Of these parent institutions, only one was not a depository institution holding company.
The majority of the unconsolidated Level 3 BDs were also part of a larger corporate
structure. It should be noted that some parent institutions owned more than one BD. Out
378

of the 111 unconsolidated Level 3 BDs, 21 BDs were non-reporting, stand-alone
institutions (i.e., entities that are not part of a larger corporate structure).
In Table 3, the parent institutions of the affected BDs are classified into Level 1,
Level 2, or Level 3, based on the ultimate parent’s total consolidated assets. 362 As of the
end of 2014, there were 23 unique Level 1 parents and 9 unique Level 2 parents that
owned covered Level 1, unconsolidated Level 2, and unconsolidated Level 3 BDs. An
additional 18 unique parents were Level 3 covered institutions, and those owned only
unconsolidated Level 3 BDs. The SEC was not able to classify 29 parent institutions due
to the lack of data on their total consolidated assets.

The majority of BDs that were subsidiaries were held by a parent registered with
the SEC as a reporting institution (i.e., public company). All parents of Level 1 BDs and
almost all of the parents of unconsolidated Level 2 BDs were public companies, while 39
out of the 71 unique parents of unconsolidated Level 3 BDs were public companies.
Twenty three BDs were not subsidiaries but stand-alone companies that were private
Level 3 BDs.
ii. Investment Advisers
The SEC does not have a precise way of distinguishing among the largest IAs

380

because Form ADV requires an adviser to indicate only whether it has $1 billion or more
in assets on the last day of its most recent fiscal year. 363 In addition, the information
contained on Form ADV relates only to registered investment advisers and exempt
reporting advisers, while the proposed rule would apply to all investment advisers. 364 As
of December 2014, there were 669 IAs with assets of at least $1 billion, of which 129 IAs
were affiliated with banking or thrift institutions. 365 For the remaining 540 IAs the SEC
does not have information on how many of them are stand-alone companies and how
many are affiliated with non-bank parent companies. Of the 669 IAs, 51 are dually
registered as BDs with the SEC. 366 Of the 129 IAs affiliated with banking or thrift
institutions, 39 IAs are affiliated with banks and thrifts with $50 billion or more in assets.
Of the 39 IAs, 10 IAs were affiliated with banks and thrift institutions with assets

363

See Item 1.O of Part 1A of Form ADV. As noted above, the SEC has not historically examined
its regulated entities’ use of incentive-based employee compensation. In this regard, Form ADV
does not contain information with respect to such practices.
364

By its terms, the definition of “covered financial institution” in section 956 includes any
institution that meets the definition of “investment adviser” under the Investment Advisers Act,
regardless of whether the institution is registered as an investment adviser under that Act. Most
investment advisers (including registered investment advisers, exempt reporting advisers, or
otherwise) currently do not report to the SEC their average total consolidated assets, so the SEC
is unable to determine with particularity how many have average total consolidated assets greater
than or equal to $1 billion and less than $50 billion, greater than or equal to $50 billion and less
than $250 billion, or greater than or equal to $250 billion. The estimates used in this section with
respect to investment advisers, however, are based on data reported by registered investment
advisers and exempt reporting advisers with the SEC on Form ADV, because the SEC estimates
that it is unlikely that investment advisers that are prohibited from registering with the SEC
would be subject to the proposed rule.
365

Form ADV requires an adviser to indicate whether it has a “related person” that is a “banking
or thrift institution,” but does not require an adviser to identify a related person by type (e.g., a
depository institution holding company). See Item 7 of Part 1A and Item 7.A of Schedule D to
Form ADV. These estimates are therefore limited by the information reported by registered
investment advisers and exempt reporting advisers in their Forms ADV and has necessitated
manual referencing of the institutions specified.
366

Because the data presented below for the effects on BDs and IAs are presented separately, in
aggregate, they may overstate the costs and other economic effects for dual registrants.

381

between $50 billion and $250 billion; and 23 IAs were affiliated with banks and thrift
institutions with assets of more than $250 billion. As Table 4 shows, the 39 IAs have 25
unique parent institutions and most of these parent institutions (17) are public companies.

2. Current Incentive-Based Compensation Practices
The SEC does not have information on the incentive-based compensation
practices of the BDs and IAs themselves. The main reason why the SEC lacks such
information is that BDs and IAs are generally not public reporting companies and as a
result they do not provide the type of compensation information that a public reporting
company would file with the SEC as part of its communications with shareholders.
Notwithstanding these limitations on the data regarding the incentive-based
compensation arrangements at BDs or IAs, when the BDs or IAs are subsidiaries of
public reporting companies, the SEC has information for the public reporting company
that is the parent of these BDs and IAs. In particular, the information on incentive-based
compensation practices for named executive officers (“NEOs”) is annually disclosed in

382

proxy statements and annual reports filed with the SEC. NEOs typically include the
principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, and three most highly
compensated executives. 367
Given that it lacks data on the BDs and IAs themselves, for the purposes of this
economic analysis, the SEC uses data on incentive-based compensation of the NEOs at
the parent institutions, which for unconsolidated Level 1 and unconsolidated Level 2 BDs
are mostly bank holding companies, 368 as an indirect measure of incentive-based
compensation practices at the subsidiary level. 369 The SEC also analyzes the incentivebased compensation of public reporting institutions with assets between $1 billion and
$50 billion, many of which are not bank holding companies, because it is possible that
size may be a determinant of incentive-based compensation arrangements and thus the
incentive-based compensation of an unconsolidated Level 3 BD or IA may be more
similar to that of a public reporting institution with assets between $1 billion and $50

367

For a company that is not a smaller reporting company, Item 402(a)(3) of Regulation S-K
defines named executive officers as: 1) All individuals serving as the company’s principal
executive officer or acting in a similar capacity during the last completed fiscal year (PEO),
regardless of compensation level; 2) All individuals serving as the company’s principal financial
officer or acting in a similar capacity during the last completed fiscal year (PFO), regardless of
compensation level; 3) The company’s three most highly compensated executive officers other
than the PEO and PFO who were serving as executive officers at the end of the last completed
fiscal year; and 4) Up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would have been
provided under the immediately preceding bullet point, except that the individual was not serving
as an executive officer of the company at the end of the last completed fiscal year.
368

For Level 1 and unconsolidated Level 2 BDs, the SEC’s analysis indicates that, as of
December 2014, two of their 20 unique parent institutions are non-bank holding companies (one
investment management firm and one investment bank/brokerage). For the 39 IAs described in
Table 4, six of their 25 unique parent institutions are not bank holding companies, For
unconsolidated Level 3 BDs, 20 of the 42 unique parent institutions for which data on their size is
available are not bank holding companies.

369

It is also possible that the compensation practices between Level 1 parent and unconsolidated
Level 2 subsidiary (or between Level 2 parent and unconsolidated Level 3 subsidiary) may be
closer to each other than those of Level 1 parent and unconsolidated Level 3 subsidiary.

383

billion.
While the SEC utilizes the above-referenced public reporting company data, it
should be noted that there are a number of caveats that may impact the SEC’s analysis.
First, the incentive-based compensation arrangement at the subsidiary level may differ
from that of the parent level due to either the difference between the size of the subsidiary
relative to the size of the parent, or because the business model of the subsidiary is
different from that of the parent. More specifically, the incentive-based compensation
arrangement of bank holding companies may be different than that of BDs or IAs given
the fundamentally differing natures of the underlying business models and the
composition of their respective balance sheets. Further, the incentive-based
compensation practices at a public reporting company could be different than those at a
non-public reporting company. The SEC also does not have information about incentivebased compensation of non-NEOs and of those employees included in the definition of
significant risk-takers under the proposed rule. These caveats mean that the SEC’s
analysis, which is mainly based on data from public bank holding companies, may not
accurately reflect incentive-based compensation practices at BDs and IAs. To address
this lack of data, the SEC has supplemented its analysis with anonymized supervisory
data from the Board and the OCC, with limitations to the generalizability of the analysis
on non-NEOs and significant risk-takers similar to the ones discussed above.
i. Named Executive Officers
Table 5A presents data on the compensation structure of NEOs at Level 1, Level
2, and Level 3 parent public reporting institutions of unconsolidated Level 1,
unconsolidated Level 2, and unconsolidated Level 3 BDs as of the end of fiscal year

384

2014. 370 In addition to the CEO and the CFO, NEOs typically include the chief operating
officer (“COO”), the general counsel (“GC”), and the heads of business units such as
wealth management and investment banking. As shown in Table 5A, incentive-based
compensation is a significant component of NEO compensation at parent institutions. It
is approximately 90 percent of total compensation for Level 1 parent institutions and 85
percent for Level 2 parent institutions (median values are also reported in parentheses). 371
Additionally, a sizable fraction of incentive-based compensation is in the form of longterm incentive compensation, which is mainly awarded in the form of stock, stock
options, or debt instruments. 372 The SEC observes that the use of stock options varies by
size of the parent institution: stock options represent on average 6 percent of long-term
incentive compensation for Level 1 parents, while they represent approximately 20
percent of long-term incentive compensation for Level 2 parents. 373

Data comes from Compustat’s ExecuComp database. Out of 30 unique Level 1 and Level 2
parent institutions of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 BDs, compensation data is not available for 16
parent institutions.
371

Incentive-based compensation is determined as Total compensation as reported in SEC filings
– Salary.

372

Long-term incentive compensation is determined using the following items from Compustat’s
ExecuComp database: Total compensation as reported in SEC filings – Salary – Bonus – Other
annual compensation. Short-term incentive compensation is determined as Bonus + Other annual
compensation.
373

This is consistent with evidence of decreased use of stock options in compensation
arrangements over the last decade, with companies replacing the use of stock options with
restricted stock units. See Frydman and Jenter, CEO Compensation, Annual Review of Financial
Economics (2010).

Number of parent institutions with available

Table 5B presents similar statistics for the compensation structures of Level 1 and
Level 2 parent institutions of IAs that were affiliated with banks and thrift institutions
with assets of more than $50 billion.374 The summary statistics for the parent companies
of IAs mirrors the statistics for the BDs’ parent companies: a significant portion of NEO
compensation is in the form of incentive-based compensation, most of which is long-term
incentive compensation that comes in the form of stock awards. 375 Both Level 1 and

374

There is an overlap between the parent institutions of BDs and IAs: about half of the IAs’
parents are also parents of BDs and included in Table 5A.
375

This is not surprising given that approximately half of the IAs’ parent institutions are also
parent institutions of BDs and included in Table 5A.

Table 6A provides summary statistics for types of incentive-based compensation
currently awarded by parent institutions of BDs, their vesting periods, and the specific

387

measures on which these awards are based. 376 All types of parent institutions use cash in
their short-term incentive compensation. Only 12 percent of Level 1 parent institutions,
and none of the Level 2 parent institutions, defer short-term incentive compensation that
is awarded in cash only. A significant fraction of Level 1 parent institutions awards
short-term incentive compensation in the form of cash and stock.

A significant percentage of long-term incentive compensation of BD parent
institutions comes in the form of restricted or performance stock. 377 Restricted stock
accounts for about 36 percent of long-term incentive compensation at Level 1 parent
institutions and approximately 26 percent at Level 2 parent institutions. It has a vesting
period of approximately 3.5 years. Performance stock awards are more popular: over 80
percent of Level 1 and Level 2 parent institutions employ performance stock, which on
average accounts for approximately 53 percent of the long-term incentive compensation
of Level 1 parents and 42 percent of that of Level 2 parents. Performance stock awards
are frequently evaluated using total shareholder return (“TSR”), return on equity
(“ROE”), return on assets (“ROA”), earnings per share (“EPS”), or a combination of TSR
and one or more accounting measures of performance over an average of 3.7 years for
Level 1 parent institutions and 3 years for Level 2 parent institutions. About 14 percent
of Level 1 parent institutions impose deferral after the performance period for
performance stock. The average deferral period for these awards is approximately 4
years.
377

Restricted stock includes actual shares or share units that are earned by continued
employment, often referred to as time-based awards. Performance stock consists of stockdenominated actual shares or share units (performance shares) and grants of cash or dollardenominated units (performance units) earned based on performance against predetermined
objectives over a defined period.

390

Consistent with the results in Table 5A above, stock options do not appear to be a
popular component of incentive-based compensation arrangements among Level 1 parent
institutions. They are more frequently used by Level 2 parent institutions, for which
options account for approximately 20 percent of long-term incentive compensation. One
of the Level 1 parents also uses debt instruments as a part of NEOs’ long-term incentive
compensation, which fully vest after five years (i.e. cliff vest). Similar results are
obtained when examining the compensation practices of Level 1 and Level 2 parent
institutions of IAs, as the summary statistics in Table 6B suggest.

From the disclosures provided by reporting companies on clawback, forfeiture and certain
prohibitions, the SEC is able to establish whether a reporting company currently uses policies that
are in line with the proposed rule, but was not able to establish compliance with certainty.

In general, the SEC’s analysis of the compensation information disclosed in proxy
statements and annual reports by parent institutions of covered BDs suggests that NEO
compensation practices at most of the parent institutions are in line with the main

394

requirements and prohibitions in the proposed rule. This may not be surprising given that
the baseline already reflects a regulatory response to the financial crisis. 379 For example,
all Level 1 parents and 80 percent of Level 2 parents of BDs require some form of
deferral of incentive-based executive compensation. The average Level 1 parent
institution defers 75 percent of incentive-based compensation awarded to CEOs and 73
percent awarded to other NEOs, which is above the minimum deferral amount that would
be required by the proposed rule. In a similar vein, an average of 52 percent of incentivebased compensation awarded to CEOs and 49 percent awarded to other NEOs is deferred
at Level 2 parent institutions, similar to what would be required by the proposed rule.
The length of the deferral period at Level 1 and Level 2 parent institutions is also
currently in line with what would be required by the proposed rule: on average, 3.5 years
for NEOs at Level 1 parent institutions and approximately 3 years for those at Level 2
parent institutions.
Regarding the type of incentive-based compensation that is being deferred, both
Level 1 and Level 2 parent institutions defer equity-based compensation. One of the
Level 1 parent institutions uses debt instruments as incentive-based compensation and
defers it as well. Only a fraction of them (20 percent of Level 1 and 25 percent of Level
2 parent institutions), however, currently defer incentive-based compensation in cash; the
proposed rule would require deferral of substantial portions of both cash and equity-like
instruments for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level
2 covered institutions. Thus, for both Level 1 and Level 2 parent institutions the current

379

http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20100621a.htm

395

composition of their deferred compensation appears to conform to the proposed rule
requirements with respect to equity-like instruments, but only a few Level 1 and Level 2
parent institutions appear to conform to the proposed rule requirements with respect to
deferral of cash.
Some of the other requirements and prohibitions for Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions in the proposed rule are also currently in place at the parent institutions of
covered BDs. For example, all of the Level 1 parent institutions and a large majority of
Level 2 parent institutions require that the incentive-based compensation awards of NEOs
be subject to clawback and forfeiture provisions. The frequency of the use of clawback
and forfeiture by Level 1 and Level 2 parent institutions is higher than that reported by a
commenter 380 based on the results of a study. 381 The commenter did not specify,
however, when the study was done, nor the number and type of companies covered by
the study.
A majority of parent institutions also have prohibitions on hedging. 382 Consistent
with the proposed prohibition of relying solely on relative performance measures when
awarding incentive-based compensation, all of the Level 1 and Level 2 parent institutions
currently use a mix of absolute and relative performance measures in their incentivebased compensation arrangements. Additionally, most Level 1 parent institutions

strategies and the procedures for determining compensation since 2008.

The proposed rule would prohibit covered institutions from purchasing hedging instruments on
behalf of covered persons. The statistics regarding hedging prohibitions presented in Table 7a and
Table 7b, and Table 9a and Table 9b refer to complete prohibition regarding the use of hedging
instruments by senior executives and directors respectively.

396

prohibit acceleration of compensation payments except in the cases of death or disability,
whereas very few Level 2 parent institutions do that. The average maximum incentivebased compensation opportunity is 155 percent of the target amount for Level 1 parent
institutions and 190 percent for Level 2 parent institutions, which is above what would be
permitted by the proposed rules. In the SEC’s analysis of the compensation disclosure,
the SEC did not find any mention about prohibition of volume-driven incentive-based
compensation as would be proposed by the rule.
Similar results are obtained when analyzing the current practices of the Level 1
and Level 2 parent institutions of IAs (Table 7B). All IA parent institutions defer NEO
compensation, on average, for three years. Almost all parent companies subject
incentive-based compensation of NEOs to clawback and forfeiture and prohibit hedging
transactions.

To examine how the use of the proposed rule’s requirements and prohibitions has
changed since the financial crisis, in Tables 8A and 8B the SEC reports the use of
incentive-based compensation deferral, clawback, forfeiture, and some of the rule
prohibitions by the Level 1 and Level 2 parent institutions of BDs and IAs in year 2007,
just prior to the financial crisis. A comparison with the results in Tables 7A and 7B
shows that just prior to the financial crisis Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions
deferred less of NEOs’ incentive-based compensation compared to what they defer
nowadays. More importantly, the use of clawback and forfeiture in 2007 was far less
common than it is now: for example, none of these institutions reported using clawback
arrangements as of year 2007. Additionally, fewer covered institutions had risk
committees in year 2007.

Thus, the analysis suggests that following the financial crisis, most Level 1 and

provisions and prohibitions that would be required by the proposed rule.

Table 9A lists the most frequent triggers for clawback and forfeiture, which
include some type of misconduct and adverse performance/outcome. About 19 percent
of Level 1 parent institutions use improper or excessive risk-taking as a trigger for
forfeiture and clawback. About 88 percent of Level 1 parent institutions use misconduct,
and 75 percent of Level 1 parent institutions also use adverse performance as triggers for
clawback, similar to the proposed rules.

Some of the provisions of the proposed rule (e.g., prohibition of hedging) would
apply to covered persons that are non-employee directors who receive incentive-based
compensation at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions. Table 10A presents summary
statistics on the current compensation practices of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 parent
public institutions of BDs with respect to their non-employee directors. The data shows
that most of the Level 1 parent institutions and all of the Level 2 parent institutions
provide incentive-based compensation to their non-employee directors, and this
compensation comes mainly in the form of deferred equity. Additionally, a large
percentage of both Level 1 and Level 2 parents prohibit hedging by non-employee
directors.

The analysis of non-employee director compensation at the Level 1 and Level 2
parent institutions of IAs in Table 10B shows similar results: In all of the parent
institutions non-employee directors receive incentive-based compensation and a
significant fraction of parent institutions prohibit hedging transactions related to
incentive-based compensation.

ii. Executives other than Named Executive Officers
While the above statistics are based on publicly disclosed information on
compensation for the five most highly compensated executive officers at parent
institutions, the proposed rule would apply to any executive officer, employee, director or
principal shareholder (covered persons) who receives incentive-based compensation.
Thus, the data presented above may not be representative for non-NEOs. To provide
some evidence on the current incentive-based compensation arrangements of non-NEOs,

405

the SEC uses anonymized supervisory data from the Board. It should be noted that the
composition of the supervisory data sample could be different than that of the Level 1
and Level 2 parent institutions analyzed above. To alleviate this potential selection
problem, Table 10 compares NEO and non-NEO compensation arrangements only for the
supervisory data sample. Also, the supervisory data comes from banks, while the data
above is from bank holding companies. Because there may be differences in incentivebased compensation arrangements and policies at the bank level and the bank holding
company level, the supervisory data analysis could yield different results compared to the
results presented in the tables above.
Since the supervisory data does not identify NEOs and non-NEOs but identifies
the managerial position of each executive, the SEC uses an indirect approach to separate
the two groups of executives. From the proxy statements of Level 1 and Level 2 parent
institutions, the SEC identifies the executives that are most often included in the
definition of NEOs, in addition to the CEO and the CFO. These executives are the COO,
the GC, and often the heads of wealth management or investment banking. The SEC
then classifies these executives as NEOs and any other executive as non-NEO. Table 11
presents summary statistics for NEOs and non-NEOs based on the supervisory data.
Similar to NEOs, non-NEOs tend to have a significant fraction of long-term
incentive compensation in the form of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance
stock units (“PSUs”) that is deferred on average for about three years. Only 36 percent of
institutions in the sample used cash as incentive-based compensation for non-NEOs and a
significant fraction (on average about 50 percent across institutions that use cash as
incentive-based compensation) of the cash incentive-based compensation is deferred.

406

Similarly, 45 percent of the deferred incentive-based compensation for non-NEOs was in
the form of restricted stock and 54 percent was in the form of performance share units.
Fifty percent of the institutions in the sample used options as incentive-based
compensation for non-NEOs, with average vesting period of approximately 3.7 years.

iii. Significant Risk-Takers
The proposed rule requirements also would apply to significant risk-takers who
receive incentive-based compensation. Because data on the compensation of significant
risk-takers is not publicly available, the SEC relies on bank supervisory data from the
OCC to provide some evidence on the current practices regarding significant risk-taker
compensation at covered institutions. In the OCC anonymized data, banks identify
material risk-takers and specific compensation arrangements for them. The definition of
408

a material risk-taker is similar, but not identical, to that of a significant risk-taker in the
proposed rule. Based on supervisory data from three Level 2 covered institutions, it
seems that the incentive-based compensation of material risk-takers is subject to deferral,
clawback and forfeiture. The fraction of incentive-based compensation that is subject to
deferral depends on the size of the compensation a material risk-taker receives. As Table
12 suggests, the percentage deferred varies, with some exceptions, from 40 percent to 60
percent. The average length of the deferral period is three years.

Due to the lack of data, the SEC is unable to shed light on current significant risktaker compensation practices with respect to some of the other proposed rule
requirements such as the use of hedging or the type of compensation that is being
deferred (cash vs. stock vs. options). In addition, the data is based on information from
only three Level 2 covered institutions. It is also worth noting that the OCC data is at the
bank subsidiary level, not the depository institution holding company level. Thus, it is
possible that the features of the compensation of significant risk-takers at the bank
subsidiary level may not be representative of the compensation of significant risk-takers
at BDs and IAs.
iv. Covered Persons at Subsidiaries

409

Economic theory suggests that, in large, complex, and interconnected financial
institutions that are perceived to receive implicit government guarantee, managers of
these institutions could have the incentive to take on more risk than they would have
taken had there been no implicit government backstops, thus creating negative
externalities for taxpayers. As discussed above, the proposed rule could decrease the
likelihood of such negative externalities. To the extent that certain BDs and IAs pose
high risk that may lead to externalities, covered persons likely would therefore include
those individuals who, by virtue of receiving incentive-based compensation, are in a
position of placing significant risks.
Under the proposed rule, senior executive officers and significant risk-takers of
BDs and IAs that are covered institutions would be considered covered persons. The
proposed rule would require consolidation of subsidiaries of BHCs that are themselves
covered institutions for the purpose of applying certain rule requirements and
prohibitions to covered persons. As a result of this proposed consolidation, covered
persons employed at BDs and IAs would be subject to the same requirements as the
covered persons of their parent institutions, even though the BDs and IAs may be of a
smaller size, and hence otherwise treated at a lower level, than their parent institutions.
This proposed consolidation would significantly affect unconsolidated Level 3 BDs
because most of them are held by Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions, as well as
Level 3 IAs that are held by Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions. The proposed
consolidation would also affect unconsolidated Level 2 BDs and IAs that are held by
Level 1 covered institutions because those BDs and IAs will also become Level 1
covered institutions for the purposes of the rule.

410

As of December 2014, there were 29 unconsolidated Level 3 BDs whose parent
institutions are Level 1 and Level 2 institutions (Table 3); only one of those parent
institutions was not a covered institution as defined by the rule. Additionally, there were
38 unconsolidated Level 3 BDs whose parents were private institutions; while it is
possible that some of these may be Level 1 or Level 2 institutions, the SEC lacks data to
determine their size. With respect to the proposed rule requirements, the current
compensation arrangements of NEOs of Level 3 parent institutions exhibit some
important differences compared to Level 1 and Level 2 parent institutions. For example,
Level 3 parent institutions typically defer a smaller fraction of NEOs’ incentive-based
compensation (Table 7A), defer cash less frequently (Table 7A), and tend to use more
options as part of their incentive-based compensation arrangements (Table 6A),
compared to Level 1 and Level 2 parent institutions. On the other hand, Level 3 covered
institutions, like Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions, tend to apply forfeiture and
clawback and prohibit hedging (Table 7A).
The proposed rule also would require consolidation with respect to certain
significant risk-takers. Under the proposed definition of significant risk-taker, employees
of a subsidiary that could put substantial capital of the parent institution at risk would be
deemed significant risk-takers of the parent institution, and the proposed rule
requirements would apply to them in the same manner as the significant risk-taker at their
parent institutions. Because data on the compensation of significant risk-takers is not
publicly available, the SEC relies on bank supervisory data from the OCC regarding the
current compensation practices for significant risk-takers at Level 3 financial institutions;
the SEC does not have data on the compensation arrangements at Level 1 and Level 2

411

institutions. Table 13 shows summary statistics for the compensation arrangements of
significant risk-takers at Level 3 covered institutions. The compensation arrangements of
significant risk-takers of Level 3 covered institutions seem similar to those of NEOs of
Level 3 covered institutions. It is also worth noting that the OCC data is at the bank
subsidiary level, not the depository institution holding company level. Thus, it is possible
that the features of the compensation of significant risk-takers at the bank subsidiary level
may not be representative of the compensation of significant risk-takers at BDs and IAs.

The existing regulatory environment, especially after the financial crisis of
2007−2008, is also relevant to the current compensation practices of covered institutions
and the effects of the proposed rulemaking. Several guidance and codes that specifically
target incentive-based compensation have been adopted by various financial regulators

413

that may also apply to some BDs and IAs. Some of those prescribe compensation
practices and suggest prohibitions that are similar to the requirements and prohibitions in
the proposed rules.
i. Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies
In June 2010, the U.S. Federal Banking Agencies 383 adopted the Guidance on
Sound Incentive Compensation Policies. 384 The guidance applies to banking institutions
and, because most of the parents of Level 1 and Level 2 BDs are bank holding companies
subject to the guidance, its principles may apply to these BDs as well if the compensation
structures at subsidiaries are similar to those at the parent institutions and the parent
institution determines to implement relatively uniform incentive-based compensation
policies for the consolidated institution. The guidance may also apply to the 39 IAs that
are affiliated with banks and thrift institutions with assets of more than $50 billion.
The guidance is designed to prevent incentive-based compensation policies at
banking institutions from encouraging imprudent risk-taking and to aid in the
development of incentive-based compensation policies that are consistent with the safety
and soundness of the institution. It has three key principles providing that compensation
arrangements at a banking institution should: a) provide employees with incentives that
appropriately balance risk and reward; b) be compatible with effective risk management
and controls; and c) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and
effective oversight by the institution’s board of directors. Similar to the proposed rules,
383

The Federal Banking Agencies, as of 2010, were the Board, OCC, FDIC, and Office of Thrift
Supervision.

384

http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20100621a.htm

414

this guidance applies to senior executives and other employees who, either individually
or as a part of a group, have the ability to expose the relevant banking institution to a
material level of risk. The guidance suggests several methods of balancing risk and
rewards: risk adjustment of awards; deferral of payment; longer performance periods; and
reduced sensitivity to short-term performance.
ii. UK Prudential Regulatory Authority Remuneration Code
The SEC notes that for BDs and IAs whose parents are regulated by foreign
authorities, the foreign regulatory framework with respect to incentive-based
compensation may also be relevant for compliance with the proposed rules. 385 For
example, in 2010, the UK PRA adopted four remuneration codes that apply to banks and
investment firms and share important similarities with the proposed rules. 386 For
instance, the SYSC 19A remuneration code imposes a deferral of at least 40 percent for
not less than 3-5 years. For higher earners, at least 60 percent has to be deferred. The
code applies to senior management, risk takers, staff engaged in control functions, and
any employee receiving compensation that takes them into the same income bracket as
senior management and risk takers, whose professional activities have a material impact
on the firm’s risk profile. The code also requires that at least 50 percent of any bonus
must be made in shares, share-linked instruments or other equivalent non-cash
instruments of the firm. These shares should be subject to an appropriate retention

385

For example, 3 Level 1 and Level 2 BDs have parent institutions that are subject to the UK
PRA rules.
386

There are four codes: SYSC 19A (covering Deposit Taker and Investment firms), SYSC 19B
(covering Alternative Investment Fund Managers), SYSC 19C – BIPRU (covering Investment
firms), and SYSC 19D (covering Dual-regulated firms Remuneration Code). See
https://www.the-fca.org.uk/remuneration.

415

period. Firms also need to disclose details of their remuneration policies at least
annually.
In July 2014, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA) published two joint consultation papers “aimed at improving individual
responsibility and accountability in the banking sector.” 387 The papers seek feedback on
proposed changes to the rules for remuneration for UK banks and PRA-designated
investment firms. 388 The PRA and FCA’s new proposed rules follow recommendations
made by the UK Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, “Changing Banking
for Good,” published in June 2013, and are a response to the major role played by banks
in the financial crisis in 2007−2008 and allegations of the attempted manipulation of
LIBOR. Their new proposed rules were deemed necessary because the current rule on
individual accountability is “often unclear or confused” 389 and thus undermines public
trust in the banking sector and the financial regulators. The PRA and FCA proposed that
banks defer bonuses for a minimum of 7 years for senior managers and 5 years for other
material risk-takers. Financial institutions would be able to recover variable pay even if
it was paid out or vested for up to 7 years after the award date.

D. Scope of the Proposed Rule
1. Levels of Covered Institutions
The proposed rule would create a tiered system of covered institutions based on
an institution’s average total consolidated assets during the most recent consecutive four
quarters. 390 There are three levels of covered institutions: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3
covered institutions. Some of the proposed rule requirements (e.g., deferral of
compensation, forfeiture and clawback) would apply differentially to covered institutions
based on their size tier, with more stringent restrictions on the incentive-based
compensation arrangements at larger institutions (i.e., Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions). In general, the importance of financial institutions in the economy tends to
be positively correlated with their size. This is apparent from the use of implicit “toobig-to-fail” policies by governments and central banks, providing support to large
financial institutions at times of financial crises because of their importance to the greater
financial system. 391 In a similar vein, the 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance
prescribes stricter compensation rules and related risk-management and corporate
governance practices for large and more complex banking institutions. 392

390

For IAs, the tiered system would be based on year end balance sheet assets (excluding nonproprietary assets).

391

See, for example, Frederic Mishkin, Financial Institutions.

392

Large banking institutions include, in the case of banking institutions supervised by (i) the
Board, large, complex banking institutions as identified by the Board for supervisory purposes;
(ii) the OCC, the largest and most complex national banks as defined in the Large Bank
Supervision booklet of the Comptroller's Handbook; (iii) the FDIC, large, complex insured
depository institutions (IDIs). See, 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance, available at:
http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20100621a.htm

417

There are various measures developed to estimate the amount of risk 393 posed by
an institution to the greater financial system. One study finds that the degree of leverage,
maturity mismatch and the size of the institution are all related to a measure of systemic
importance and risk. 394 Another study finds that institution size, degree of leverage and
covariance of the institution’s stock with the market during distress are related to the
systemic risk contribution of an institution. 395 Moreover, an academic study of the
financial crisis states that the size of an institution is likely to magnify the impact of
failure to the entire financial system. 396 In terms of defining systemic importance, bank
holding companies with assets over $50 billion are required to disclose to the Board on
an annual basis, three indicators related to their systemic risk: institution size,
interconnectedness and complexity. 397
By setting stricter restrictions on the incentive-based compensation arrangements
at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions, the tiered approach could benefit taxpayers.

393

See Bisias et al. 2012. A Survey of Systemic Risk Analytics. Office of Financial Research,
Working Paper.
394

See Adrian, T., Brunnermier, M. 2011. COVAR. American Economic Review, forthcoming.
The paper proposes a measure for systemic risk contribution by financial institutions. The
forward-looking measure of systemic risk contribution is significantly related to lagged
characteristics of financial institutions such as size, leverage, and maturity mismatch.
395

See Brownlees, C., Engle, R. 2015. SRISK: A Conditional Capital Shortfall Index for
Systemic Risk Measurement. Working Paper. The paper develops a measure of systemic risk
contribution of a financial firm. This measure associates systemic risk with the capital shortfall a
financial institution is expected to experience conditional on a severe market decline. The
measure is a function of the firm’s size, degree of leverage and the expected equity loss
conditional on a market downturn.
396

Press.
397

Size is correlated with the two other measures of systemic importance, complexity and
interconnectedness. See FSOC 2015 Annual Report, available at:
https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/studiesreports/Documents/2015%20FSOC%20Annual%20Report.pdf.

418

To the extent that stricter incentive-based compensation rules are effective at curbing
inappropriate risk-taking, this could lessen the default likelihood for Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions, thus increasing the likelihood that taxpayers would not have to incur
costs to rescue important institutions. Moreover, if the stricter incentive-based
compensation rules lower the likelihood of default for Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions, the likelihood of default for smaller institutions could decrease as well, to the
extent that smaller institutions are exposed to counterparty risks due to their connection
with larger Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions.
Consolidation requirements aside, the tiered approach also would not impose as
great a compliance burden on smaller Level 3 covered institutions for which the proposed
rule requirements on deferral, forfeiture and clawback, and some other prohibitions and
requirements do not apply. To the extent that compliance costs have a fixed component
that may have a disproportionate impact on smaller institutions, excluding Level 3
covered institutions from more burdensome requirements would not place them at a
competitive disadvantage compared to Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions.
Moreover, to the extent that executives’ incentives become distorted due to the implicit
government guarantee, this is less likely to be the case for Level 3 covered institutions
due to their relatively smaller size. Thus, the potential benefits of the proposed rule may
be less substantial for smaller covered institutions since such institutions are less likely to
be in a position to take risks that may lead to externalities.
However, to the extent that the stricter proposed requirements for incentive-based
compensation arrangements at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions induce less than
optimal risk-taking incentives for covered persons from shareholders’ point of view, this

419

could result in a decrease in firm value and hence lower returns for the shareholders of
these institutions. Additionally, the stricter requirements for Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions could make it more difficult to attract and retain human capital, thus creating
competitive disadvantages in the labor market for these institutions. If these institutions
become disadvantaged due to their stricter compensation requirements, they might be
forced to increase overall compensation to be able to compete for managerial talent with
firms that are not affected by the proposed rules.
As discussed above, besides an institution’s average total consolidated assets,
other indicators (for example, the size of that institution’s open counterparty positions in
a market) not perfectly correlated with size could be a proxy for the importance of
financial institutions to the financial sector and the broader economy. If size is not a
good proxy for the importance of a financial institution, then the proposed rule would
likely pose a disproportionate compliance burden on larger institutions while not
covering institutions that may be more significant to the overall financial system under
different proxies for importance.
The proposed thresholds for identifying Level 1 covered institutions (over $250
billion) and Level 2 covered institutions (between $50 billion and $250 billion) are
similar to those used by banking regulators in other contexts. For example, the $250
billion is used by Basel III as a threshold to identify core banks that must adopt the Basel
standards; and the $50 billion threshold is used in a number of sections of the DoddFrank Act. 398 The use of these two thresholds might place a higher compliance burden

398

For example, sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act require the Board to establish
enhanced prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board and

420

on institutions that are close to, but just above the threshold compared to institutions that
are close, but just below the threshold. For example, a BD that has a size of $49 billion is
likely to be similar in many aspects to a BD that has a size of $51 billion. Yet, with the
current cutoff points, the former would not be subject to deferral, forfeiture and
clawback, and other prohibitions in the proposed rule, while the latter would be.
By covering various types of financial institutions (e.g., banks, BDs, IAs, thrifts,
etc.) with at least $1 billion in assets, section 956 and the proposed rule implicitly assume
that larger institutions pose higher risks, including risks that may impact the financial
system at large. This assumption may not hold true for certain institutions. For example,
in the case of BDs and IAs, which may have a much narrower scope of activities than a
comparably sized commercial bank, the narrower range of activities could limit their
impact on the overall financial system. On the other hand, larger BDs and IAs may pose
higher risks than smaller BDs and IAs. Also, at least one study has suggested that the
interconnectedness of financial institutions generally could affect multiple financial
institutions in a crisis and impact otherwise unrelated parts of the larger financial
system. 399 Another study asserts that financial institutions, including broker-dealers,

bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. In prescribing more
stringent prudential standards, the Board may, on its own or pursuant to a recommendation by the
Council in accordance with section 115, differentiate among companies on an individual basis or
by category, taking into consideration their capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial
activities (including the financial activities of their subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related
factors that the Board deems appropriate.
399
See, for example, Bisias D, M. Flood, A.W. Lo, and S. Valavanis, 2012. A Survey of Systemic
Risk Analytics. Office of Financial Research, Working paper, available at:
https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/wsr/ofr/Documents/OFRwp0001_BisiasFloodLoValavanis_
ASurveyOfSystemicRiskAnalytics.pdf. On page 9, the authors argue that “In a world of
interconnected and leveraged institutions, shocks can propagate rapidly throughout the financial
network, creating a self-reinforcing dynamic of forced liquidations and downward pressure on

421

have become highly interrelated and less liquid in the past decade, thus increasing the
level of risk in the financial sector. 400
2. Senior Executive Officers and Significant Risk-Takers
The requirements under the proposed rule would place differential restrictions on
compensation arrangements of covered persons. Within each covered institution, the
proposed rule would create different categories of covered persons, which include any
executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder that receives incentivebased compensation. While the proposed rule would apply to directors or principal
shareholders who receive incentive-based compensation, the SEC’s baseline analysis
suggests that most of the parent institutions provide incentive-based compensation to
non-employee directors but none of them provide such compensation arrangements to
principal shareholders that are neither executives nor non-employee directors. Below, the
SEC focuses the discussion of the economic effects of the proposed rule on two types of
covered persons: senior executive officers and significant risk-takers.
As discussed above, a senior executive officer is defined as a covered person who
holds the title or, without regard to title, salary, or compensation, performs the function of
one or more of the following positions at a covered institution for any period of time in

prices.” The study discusses the interconnectedness between financial institutions in general and
does not focus on the potential role of BDs and IAs.
400

See Billio M., M. Getmansky, A.W. Lo, and L. Pelizzon. 2012. Econometric Measures of
Connectedness and Systemic Risk in the Finance and Insurance Sectors, Journal of Financial
Economics, 104, 535−559. The study examines and finds evidence that banks, brokers, hedge
funds and insurance companies have become highly interrelated during the last decade, thus
increasing the level of systemic risk in the financial sector. For example, insurance companies
have had little to do with hedge funds until recently when these companies expanded into markets
such as providing insurance for financial products and credit default swaps. Such activities have
potential implications for systemic risk when conducted on a large scale.

422

the relevant performance period: president, executive chairman, CEO, CFO, COO, chief
investment officer, chief legal officer, chief lending officer, chief risk officer, chief
compliance officer, chief audit executive, chief credit officer, chief accounting officer, or
head of a major business line or control function (as defined in the proposed rule). A
significant risk-taker is defined as a covered person, other than a senior executive officer,
who receives compensation of which at least one-third is incentive-based compensation
and is: either 1) placed among the highest 5 percent in annual base salary and incentivebased compensation among all covered persons (excluding senior executive officers) of a
Level 1 covered institution or of any covered institution affiliate, or 2) placed among the
highest 2 percent in annual base salary and incentive-based compensation among all
covered persons (excluding senior executive officers) of a covered Level 2 covered
institution or of any covered institution affiliate, or 3) may commit or expose 0.5 percent
or more of the common equity tier 1 capital, or in the case of a registered securities
broker or dealer, 0.5 percent or more of the tentative net capital, of the covered institution
or of any affiliate of the covered institution that is itself a covered institution, or 4) is
designated as a significant risk-taker by the SEC or the covered institution.
The proposed rule would impose differential requirements on compensation
arrangements of senior executive officers and significant risk-takers conditional on the
size of the covered institution. Regarding senior executive officers, at least 60 percent of
a senior executive officer’s incentive-based compensation would be required to be
deferred at a Level 1 covered institution, whereas 50 percent would be the minimum
deferral amount for a senior executive officer at a Level 2 covered institution. Regarding
significant risk-takers, 50 percent of a significant-risk-taker’s incentive-based

423

compensation at a Level 1 covered institution would be required to be deferred as
compared to 40 percent for a significant risk-taker’s incentive-based compensation at a
Level 2 covered institution. Moreover, the minimum deferral period for all covered
persons at Level 1 covered institutions would be four years for qualifying incentive-based
compensation and two years for incentive-based compensation received under long-term
incentive plans whereas the deferral period for covered persons at a Level 2 covered
institution would be three years for qualifying incentive-based compensation and one
year for compensation received under long-term incentive plans.
In general, the proposed rule would impose relatively stricter requirements for
compensation arrangements of individuals who are more likely to be in a position to
execute or authorize actions with accompanying risks that may have a significant impact
on the financial health of the covered institution or of any covered institution affiliate.
Specifically, the proposed rule would require a higher percentage of incentive-based
compensation to be deferred for senior executive officers compared to significant risktakers at covered institutions. If senior executive officers are in a position to make
decisions that have a more significant impact on the degree of risk a covered institution
takes than significant risk-takers, then the higher percentages of deferral amounts for
senior executive officers appear to be commensurate with the degree of inappropriate
risk-taking in which they could engage. This would likely provide proportionately
stronger disincentives for inappropriate risk-taking by individuals that are more likely to
be able to expose the covered institution to greater amounts of risk, thus potentially
benefiting taxpayers and other stakeholders. In general, if certain significant risk-takers
(e.g., traders with the ability to place significant bets that could endanger the financial

424

health of the covered institution or of any affiliate of the covered institution) could
engage in more or similarly significant risk-taking than senior executive officers, the
proposed rules would place less stringent requirements on the compensation
arrangements of such significant risk-takers compared to senior executive officers,
lowering risk-taking disincentives for significant risk-takers and/or imposing a potential
higher cost to senior executive officers. However, the proposed rules may also create an
incentive for senior executive officers to monitor significant risk-takers in those
situations when they do not directly supervise such significant risk-takers.
While the definition of senior executive officer would be primarily based on job
function, the definition of significant risk-taker would be based on multiple criteria. To
identify significant risk-takers, one direct approach would require knowledge of their
authority to expose their institution to material amounts of risk. This risk-based approach
has intuitive appeal because it relates the application of the rules to the potential for risk
taking. Such an approach could, however, be designed in many different ways, including
differences relating to determining the appropriate risk-based measure, whether it should
be applied to individuals or a group (e.g., a trader or a trading desk), and whether it would
be appropriate to subject all trading activity to the same risk-based measure (e.g., U.S.
treasury securities versus collateralized mortgage obligations). One of the criteria in the
definition of significant risk-takers in the proposed rules is based on individuals’ relative
size of annual base salary and incentive-based compensation within a covered institution
and its affiliates. If the highest paid individuals at BDs and IAs are the ones that could
place BDs and IAs, or their parent institutions, at risk of insolvency, then the use of this
criterion is likely to reasonably identify individuals that are significant risk-takers and as

425

a result lower the likelihood of inappropriate risks being undertaken and potentially
safeguard the health of these institutions and the broader economy. If, however, the
highest paid individuals at BDs and IAs are not likely to be able to expose their parent
institution to significant risks, this criterion may be overly inclusive, resulting in
individuals being designated as significant risk-takers without possessing the ability to
inflict substantial losses on BDs or IAs, or their parent institutions. This may impose
restrictions on the compensation of those individuals and as a consequence may put BDs
and IAs at a disadvantage in hiring or retaining human capital. BDs and IAs may have to
increase the compensation of affected individuals to offset the restrictions imposed by the
proposed rule.
For IAs that are covered institutions in another capacity and BDs, the proposed
rules would also identify significant risk-takers using a measure of their ability to expose
the covered institution to risks. More specifically, a person that receives compensation of
which at least one-third is incentive-based compensation and may commit or expose 0.5
percent or more of the common equity tier 1 capital, or in the case of a registered
securities broker or dealer, 0.5 percent or more of the tentative net capital, of the covered
institution or of any affiliate of the covered institution would be a significant risk-taker.
As discussed above, the Agencies are proposing the exposure test because individuals
who have the authority to expose covered institutions to significant amounts of risk can
cause material financial losses to covered institutions. For example, in proposing the
exposure test, the Agencies were cognizant of the significant losses caused by actions of
individuals, or a trading group, at some of the largest financial institutions during and
after the financial crisis that began in 2007. In the case of a covered institution that is a

426

subsidiary of another covered institution and is smaller than its parent, this particular
criterion of the significant risk-taker definition could result in individuals being classified
as significant risk-takers who do not have the ability to expose significant amounts of the
parent’s capital to risk.
Additionally, under the proposed definition of significant risk-taker, a covered
person of a BD or IA subsidiary of a parent institution that is a Level 1 or Level 2
covered institution may be designated as a significant risk-taker relative to: (i) in the case
of a BD subsidiary, the size of the BD’s tentative net capital or; (ii) in the case of both
BD and IA subsidiaries, the tentative net capital or common equity tier 1 capital of any
section 956 affiliate of the BD or IA, if the covered person has the ability to commit
capital of the affiliate, even if the BD or IA subsidiary has significantly fewer assets than
its parent. Because the BD subsidiary would be treated as a Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institution due to its parent, a covered person of a BD that is a relatively smaller
subsidiary would be subject to more stringent compensation restrictions than would an
employee of a comparably sized BD that is not a subsidiary of a Level 1 or Level 2
covered institution. As a consequence, if such a designated significant risk-taker of a
smaller BD subsidiary of a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution is not in a position to
undertake actions that place the entire institution at risk, then the proposed approach may
impose disproportionately stricter compensation restrictions on such covered person.
An alternative would be to use an individual’s level of compensation as a proxy
for his or her ability or authority to undertake risks within a corporate structure. The
main assumption under this approach would be that there is a positive link between an
individual’s total compensation and that individual’s authority to commit significant

427

amounts of capital at risk at the covered institution or any affiliate of the covered
institution. A benefit of the total compensation-based approach would be the
implementation simplicity in the identification of significant risk-takers. However, the
main challenge would be the determination of the total compensation threshold that
would appropriately qualify individuals as significant risk-takers. On one hand, setting
the total compensation threshold too low could impose incentive-based compensation
restrictions on individuals that do not have authority to undertake significant risks. As a
result, it is possible that incentive-based compensation requirements imposed on
individuals that do not have significant risk-taking authority could lead to a disadvantage
in the efforts of the institutions to attract and retain talent. On the other hand, setting the
total compensation threshold too high could impose incentive-based compensation
restrictions on an incomplete set of significant risk-takers, limiting the potential benefits
of the proposed rule.
3. Consolidation of Subsidiaries
The proposed rule would subject covered institution subsidiaries of a depository
institution holding company that is a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution to the same
requirements as the depository institution holding company. In this manner, the
proposed rule would capture the effect that risk-taking within the subsidiaries of a
depository institution holding company could have on the parent, and the negative
externalities that could result for taxpayers.
For example, covered persons at a $10 billion BD subsidiary of a depository
institution holding company that is a Level 1 covered institution would be treated as
covered persons of a Level 1 covered institution and subject to the proposed requirements

428

and prohibitions applicable to covered persons at a Level 1 covered institution. One
benefit of the proposed approach is the implementation simplicity of the proposed rule
since the parent institution’s size would determine the requirements for all covered
persons in the covered institution’s corporate structure. Such an approach also has the
advantage that it may cover situations where the subsidiary could potentially expose the
consolidated institution to substantial risks. This could be the case if for example the
parent institution has provided capital to the subsidiary and the subsidiary is large enough
that its failure would represent a significant loss for the parent institution. Moreover,
such an approach curbs the possibility that a covered institution might place significant
risk-takers in a smaller unregulated subsidiary, in order to evade the compensation
restrictions of the proposed rule for individuals with authority to expose the institution to
significant amounts of risk.
There may also be costs associated with the proposed consolidation approach.
The main disadvantage of such approach is that it may impose requirements and
prohibitions on individuals employed in smaller subsidiaries that are less likely to be in a
position to expose the institution to significant risks. Thus, the assumptions underlying
the rule’s consolidation may not be accurate in all cases. The proposed rules’ treatment
of subsidiaries would depend on their size and the size of their parent, and also on the
effect that risk-taking within those subsidiaries could have on the potential failure of the
parent institution and the potential risk that such a failure could impose on the overall
financial system and the subsequent negative externality that this could create for
taxpayers. For example, if the parent institution does not explicitly provide capital or
implicitly guarantee the subsidiary’s positions, the proposed rules would impose similar

429

requirements on the incentive-based compensation of individuals with different abilities
to expose the institution to risk. Such compensation requirements may impose costs on
individuals in these subsidiaries, and it might affect the ability of these subsidiaries to
compete for managerial talent with stand-alone companies of the same size as the
subsidiary. If that were the case, the subsidiaries of larger parent institutions may have to
provide additional pay to individuals to compensate for the relatively stricter
compensation requirements and prohibitions. If these additional compensation
requirements are significantly costly, there may be incentives for smaller subsidiaries to
spin-off from their parents and operate as stand-alone firms to avoid the stricter
compensation requirements that would be applicable based on the size of the parent
institution.
Additionally, the costs of the proposed consolidation approach would depend on
how different the current incentive-based compensation arrangements of a subsidiary are
from those of its parent institution. If the compensation arrangements of BDs’ and IAs’
covered persons are similar to those of their parent institutions (e.g., they use similar
deferral percentages and terms, prohibit hedging, etc.), then the proposed consolidation
approach is not likely to lead to significant compliance costs for BDs and IAs. The 2010
Federal Banking Agency Guidance has significantly limited differences in compensation
arrangements between financial institutions and their subsidiaries. If, however, the
compensation arrangements at BDs and IAs more closely resemble the compensation
structures of financial institutions of similar size, than the proposed rule’s consolidation
requirement may lead to significant compliance costs. Unconsolidated Level 3 BDs and
IAs are most likely to be affected by this proposition. The parent institutions of Level 3

430

BDs, to the extent that they are owned by one, are mainly Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions. Although the SEC does not have data about the parent institutions of Level 3
IAs, the SEC expects that they would also be mainly Level 1 and Level 2 covered
institutions. As shown above, compensation practices at Level 3 parent institutions differ
significantly from Level 1 and Level 2 parent institutions on a number of dimensions:
they defer a smaller fraction of NEOs incentive-based compensation (Table 7A), defer
cash less frequently (Table 7A), and tend to use more options as part of their incentivebased compensation (Table 6A) compared to Level 1 and Level 2 parent institutions.
They also rather infrequently prohibit hedging with respect to non-employee directors
that receive incentive-based compensation (Table 10A). If the compensation
arrangements of unconsolidated Level 3 BDs and IAs are similar to those of Level 3
parent institutions, under the proposed rule they would need to make significant changes
to certain features of their compensation arrangements to be compliant with the proposed
rule. On the other hand, to the extent that their current compensation practices are not
optimal from the perspective of taxpayers and other stakeholders of such BDs and IAs,
there may be potential benefits. This point holds for the remainder of the economic
analysis where the SEC discusses the potential costs and benefits to unconsolidated Level
3 BDs and IAs of a larger covered institution from applying the proposed rule
requirements and prohibitions.
An alternative to the proposed consolidation approach would be to use the
subsidiary’s size to determine its status as a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered
institution. For example, a $10 billion BD subsidiary of a Level 1 depository institution
holding company would be treated as a Level 3 covered institution and covered persons

431

within the subsidiary would be subject to all requirements and prohibitions applicable to
a Level 3 covered institution. This alternative approach would not entail the potential
costs identified in the proposed approach described above. However, differential
application of the rule depending on subsidiary size could provide covered institutions
with an incentive to re-organize their operations by placing significant risk-takers into
relatively smaller subsidiaries to bypass the proposed requirements. This type of
behavior, however, might be mitigated in some circumstances by the proposed rule’s
prohibition on such indirect actions: a covered institution must not indirectly, or through
or by any other person, do anything that would be unlawful for such covered institution to
do directly under this part. Moreover, this type of behavior would be constrained by the
fact that the SEC’s capital requirements for broker-dealers require that the broker-dealer
itself carry the necessary capital for all broker-dealer positions. 401 Additionally, the
rule’s definition of a significant risk-taker would treat any employee of the subsidiary
with the ability to commit certain amount of capital or to create risks for the parent
institution as a significant risk-taker of the parent, further limiting the ability of
institutions to bypass the proposed requirements by placing such individuals into
relatively smaller subsidiaries.
E. Potential Costs and Benefits of the Proposed Rule’s Requirements and
Prohibitions
In the following sections, the SEC provides an analysis of the potential costs and
benefits associated with the proposed rule’s requirements and prohibitions and possible

401

See 17 CFR 15c3-1(a).

432

alternatives. 402 For purposes of this analysis, the SEC addresses the potential economic
effects for covered BDs and IAs resulting from the statutory mandate and from the SEC’s
exercise of discretion together, recognizing that it is often difficult to separate the costs
and benefits arising from these two sources. The SEC also requests comment on any
economic effect the proposed requirements may have on covered BDs and IAs. The SEC
appreciates comments that include both qualitative information and data quantifying the
costs and the benefits identified in the analysis or alternative implementations of the
proposed rule.
1. Limitations on Excessive Compensation
The proposed rule would prohibit covered institutions from establishing or
maintaining any type of incentive-based compensation arrangement, or any feature of any
such arrangement, that encourages inappropriate risk-taking by providing a covered
person with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material loss
for the institution.
The proposed rule would not define excessive compensation; instead, it would use
a principles-based approach that would provide covered institutions with the flexibility to
structure incentive-based compensation arrangements that do not constitute excessive
compensation based on several factors that are outlined below. These factors would
include: the total size of a covered person’s compensation; the compensation history of

402

Commenters on the 2011 Proposed Rule suggested more expansive discussion and analysis of
economic effects of the proposed rulemaking on items such as the ability of covered institutions
to compete for talent acquisition and retention (See, for example, letters by the U.S. Chamber and
FSR), and also on the effects of the rule on risk taking incentives and its consequences for
covered institutions’ ability to compete (See, for example, FSR). Below, the SEC’s economic
analysis outlines and discusses potential economic effects of the various rule provisions,
including items identified in comment letters discussing economic considerations.

433

the covered person and other individuals with comparable expertise at the institution; the
financial condition of the covered institution; compensation practices at comparable
institutions based upon such factors as asset size, geographic location, and the complexity
of the covered institution’s operations and assets; for post-employment benefits, the
projected total cost and benefit to the covered institution; and any connection between the
covered person and any fraudulent act or omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, or
insider abuse with regard to the covered institution.
The flexibility that the proposed rule provides would likely benefit covered
institutions by allowing them to tailor the incentive-based compensation arrangements to
the skills and job requirements of each covered person and to the nature of a particular
institution’s business and the risks thereof instead of applying a “one size fits all”
approach. The differences in the size, complexity, interconnectedness, and degree of
competition in the market for managerial talent among the institutions covered by the
proposed rule make excessive compensation difficult to define universally.
As mentioned above, a principles-based approach is likely to provide greater
discretion to covered institutions in tailoring compensation arrangements that do not
provide incentives for inappropriate risk-taking. Such discretion may potentially allow
for differential interpretation among covered institutions on what constitutes excessive
compensation and as a consequence, differential compensation arrangements even for
similar institutions could be designed. Given the flexibility inherent under a principlesbased approach, it is also possible that in fact some compensation contracts to covered
persons constitute excessive compensation that could lead to inappropriate risk-taking,

434

particularly if the compensation setting process is not efficient or unbiased. 403 It is also
possible that boards of directors may find it difficult to evaluate whether a compensation
arrangement creates excessive compensation that could lead to inappropriate risk-taking.
As such, it is likely that governance mechanisms in place would be crucial for institutions
to benefit from the flexibility of the principles-based approach and avoid the potential
costs described above.
An alternative would be a more prescriptive approach in defining compensation
arrangements that constitute excessive compensation. For example, an explicit definition
of excessive compensation could be provided for covered institutions. As mentioned
above, such an approach has the disadvantage of restricting compensation arrangement
options for covered institutions and thus an increased likelihood that inefficient
compensation arrangements would be applied to at least some covered institutions, given
the significant differences among covered institutions and covered persons.
2. Performance Measures
The proposed rule would require covered institutions to use a variety of
performance measures when determining the incentive-based compensation of covered
persons. Incentive-based compensation arrangements would be required to include a mix
of financial (i.e., accounting and stock-based) measures and non-financial measures, with
the ability for non-financial measures to override financial measures when appropriate.
Additionally, any amounts to be awarded under the arrangement would be subject to
adjustment to reflect actual losses, inappropriate risks taken, compliance deficiencies, or

403

For example, see Coles, J., Daniel, N., and Naveen, L. Co-opted Boards. 2014. Review of
Financial Studies 27, 1751−1796.

435

other measures or aspects of financial and non-financial performance.
There is evidence in the economic literature suggesting that non-financial
measures of performance are incremental predictors of long-term financial performance
relative to financial measures of performance, and provide important information about
executives’ performance. 404 Moreover, non-financial measures of performance in
compensation arrangements may better capture progress or milestones of strategic goals
that may be unique to specific institutions. 405 Thus, the proposed requirement to use a
mix of the two types of measures would likely provide more relevant information to
enable covered institutions to set up incentive compensation arrangements for covered
persons. In addition, the flexibility that the proposed rule would provide to covered
institutions to adjust the compensation awards based on various factors would allow
covered institutions to tailor their compensation arrangements to their specific
circumstances.
The baseline analysis suggests that many of the public parent institutions of some
BDs and IAs already use a mix of financial and non-financial measures in determining

404

See, e.g., Banker, R., G. Potter, and D. Srinivasan, 1999. An Empirical Investigation of an
Incentive Plan that Includes Nonfinancial Performance Measures. The Accounting Review 75,
65−92. The study examines whether non-financial measures of performance, specifically
customer satisfaction, are incremental predictors of future performance and whether inclusion of
such measures of performance in compensation contracts is efficient. The study finds that
customer satisfaction is incremental in predicting future financial performance and inclusion of
such performance measure in compensation contracts leads to improved future performance.
405

See, e.g., Ittner, C., D. Larcker, and T. Randall, 2003. Performance Implications of Strategic
Performance Measurement in Financial Services Firms. Accounting, Organizations and Society
28, 715-741. The study uses a sample of 140 U.S. financial services firms to examine the relation
between measurement system satisfaction, economic performance, and two general approaches to
strategic performance measurement: greater measurement diversity and improved alignment with
firm strategy and value drivers. The study finds evidence that firms making more extensive use of
a broad set of financial and non-financial measures than firms with similar strategies or value
drivers have higher measurement system satisfaction and stock market returns.

436

the incentive-based compensation awards of senior executive officers. To the extent that
BDs and IAs use a similar mix of measures to determine the incentive-based
compensation awards of their senior executive officers, the SEC expects the costs of
compliance with this provision of the proposed rule to be relatively low. If BDs and IAs
do not use the same mixture of financial and non-financial measures as their parents, or
do not rely on non-financial measures when determining the compensation of their senior
executive officers and significant risk-takers, the compliance costs associated with this
particular rule requirement may be significant. Such costs may be in the form of
additional expenditures related to hiring compensation consultants and/or lawyers to
design compensation schemes and assure the compliance of newly designed
compensation schemes with the proposed rule.
The SEC has attempted to quantify such costs using data reported by Level 1,
Level 2, and Level 3 covered institutions that are parents of BDs and IAs. Table 14
provides some summary statistics on the use of compensation consultants and the fees
paid to those over the period 2007−2014. 406 Based on the results in the table, Level 1 and
Level 2 covered institutions use on average two compensation consultants, while Level 3
covered institutions use one compensation consultant on average. If a Level 1 BD or IA
has to hire compensation consultant(s) to help them meet this rule requirement, it may
incur costs of approximately $185,515 per year. If an unconsolidated Level 2 BD or IA
has to hire compensation consultant(s) to help them meet this rule requirement, it may

406

Data used in the table comes from the ISS database.

437

incur costs of approximately $77,000 per year. 407 If an unconsolidated Level 3 BD or IA,
because of the consolidation requirement, has to hire compensation consultant(s) to help
meet this rule requirement, it may incur costs of approximately $18,788 per year. These
costs could be higher if the compensation consultant is asked to provide additional
services other than compensation consulting services. These costs could be lower,
however, if the parent institutions of BDs and IAs already employ compensation
consultants and could extend their services to meet the proposed rule requirements for
BDs and IAs.

3. Board of Directors
Additionally, the proposed rule would require that the board of directors of
covered institutions oversee a covered institution’s incentive-based compensation

407

We note that while we report the median consulting fee for covered institutions in Table 14,
the average compensation consultant fees are higher. For example, for Level 1 covered
institutions the average consulting fee is $198,673, for Level 2 covered institutions the average
consulting fee is $293,501, and for Level 3 covered institutions the average consulting fee is
$59,828. The presence of outliers in the compensation consulting fee data and the small sample
size are the reason for the large difference between average and median consulting fee.

438

program, and approve incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive
officers or any material exceptions or adjustments to incentive-based compensation
policies or arrangements.
Since overseeing and approving executive compensation arrangements is one of
the primary functions of the compensation committee of the corporate board, the SEC
believes that this rule requirement would not impose significant compliance costs on
covered institutions that already have compensation committees. Moreover, because the
baseline analysis suggests that the majority of the parents of some covered institutions
already employ most of the requirements and limitations of the proposed rule, it may not
be particularly costly for boards of directors or compensation committees to comply with
the proposed rule. However, there might be additional compliance costs for covered
institutions if the board of directors or the compensation committee have to exert
incremental effort (i.e., meet more frequently) in designing and approving compensation
arrangements. Additionally, if because of the rule’s definition of significant risk-takers
the compensation committee of a covered institution has to cover a much larger number
of employees and consider additional factors than it does at present, this may increase
compliance costs.
For covered BDs and IAs that do not have compensation committees, the board of
directors as a whole may be able to oversee and approve executive compensation
arrangements. Thus, for such BDs and IAs the compliance costs of this rule requirement
could result in more time being spent for the board of directors on these issues, which
might entail higher directors’ fees and possibly additional compensation consulting costs.
4. Disclosure and Recordkeeping
439

The proposed rule would require all covered institutions to create annually and
maintain for a period of at least 7 years records that document the structure of all its
incentive-based compensation arrangements and demonstrate compliance with the
proposed rule. At a minimum, these must include copies of all incentive-based
compensation plans, a record of who is subject to each plan, and a description of how the
incentive-based compensation program is compatible with effective risk management and
controls.
The SEC is proposing an amendment to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(e) 408 and
Investment Advisers Act Rule 204-2 409 to require that registered broker-dealers maintain
and investment advisers, respectively, the records required by the proposed rule, in
accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 and
Investment Advisers Act Rule 204-2, respectively. Exchange Rule 17a-4 and Investment
Advisers Act Rule 204-2 establish the general formatting and storage requirements for
records that registered broker-dealers and investment advisers, respectively, are required
to keep. For the sake of consistency with other broker-dealer and investment adviser
records, the SEC believes that registered broker-dealers and investment advisers,
respectively, should also keep the records required by the proposed rule, in accordance
with these requirements.
The proposed recordkeeping requirement would assist covered BDs and IAs in
monitoring incentive-based compensation awards and payments and comparing them
with actual risk outcomes to determine whether incentive-based compensation payments

408

17 CFR 275.204-2.

440

to senior executive officers and significant risk-takers lead to inappropriate risk-taking.
The proposed recordkeeping requirement would also help BDs and IAs to modify the
incentive-based compensation arrangements of senior executive officers and significant
risk-takers, if, over time, incentive-based compensation paid does not appropriately
reflect risk outcomes. These records would be available to SEC staff for examination,
which may enhance compliance and facilitate oversight.
This proposed requirement would likely impose compliance costs on covered
institutions. The SEC expects the magnitude of the compliance costs to depend on
whether broker-dealers and investment advisers already have a system in place to
generate information regarding their compensation practices for internal use (e.g., for
reports to the board of directors or the compensation committee) or for required
disclosures under the Exchange Act (for reporting companies). To the extent that such
existing platforms can be expanded to produce the records required under the proposed
rule, the SEC expects this requirement to impose lower compliance costs on these
institutions. The compliance costs associated with this particular proposed rule
requirement would likely be higher for covered institutions that may not be generating
such information, if for example they are not subject to related reporting obligations, or
may not keep the type and detail of records that would be required under the proposed
rule. Given that all Level 1 and unconsolidated Level 2 BDs, and most unconsolidated
Level 3 BDs and IAs, are non-reporting companies, the SEC expects that the
recordkeeping costs associated with the rule may be substantial for these BDs and IAs.
The SEC notes, however, that because it does not have information on the compensation
reporting and recordkeeping at the subsidiary level, the SEC may be overestimating

441

compliance costs for BDs and IAs with reporting parent institutions. For example, if the
parent institution reports and keeps records of the incentive-based compensation
arrangements at the subsidiary level, and on the same scale and detail as required by the
proposed rule, it is possible that the compliance costs for such BDs could be lower than
the compliance costs for BDs with non-reporting parent institutions. Since the SEC does
not have data on how many covered IAs have parent institutions, it is also possible that a
significant number of these IAs may be stand-alone companies and therefore could have
higher costs to comply with the proposed rule compared to covered IAs and BDs that are
part of reporting parent institutions.
According to the 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance, a banking organization
should provide an appropriate amount of information concerning its incentive
compensation arrangements for executive and non-executive employees and related riskmanagement, control, and governance processes to shareholders to allow them to monitor
and, where appropriate, take actions to restrain the potential for such arrangements and
processes to encourage employees to take imprudent risks. Such disclosures should
include information relevant to employees other than senior executive officers. The
scope and level of the information disclosed by the institution should be tailored to the
nature and complexity of the institution and its incentive compensation arrangements.
Thus, private covered institutions that are banking institutions and apply the policies of
the 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance may already be collecting the information
that would be required by the proposed rule. The SEC expects the compliance costs to be
lower for such covered institutions, to the extent that there is an overlap between the
information collected under the 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance and the

442

information that would be required for disclosure and recordkeeping under the proposed
rule. The BDs and IAs that are stand-alone non-reporting firms or have non-reporting
parent institutions that are not banking institutions would most likely be the ones to incur
higher compliance costs of disclosure and recordkeeping.
By requiring covered institutions to create and maintain records of incentivebased compensation arrangements for covered persons at all covered BDs and IAs, the
proposed recordkeeping requirement is expected to facilitate the SEC’s ability to monitor
incentive-based compensation arrangements and could potentially strengthen incentives
for covered institutions to comply with the proposed rule. As a consequence, an increase
in investor confidence that covered institutions are less likely to be incentivizing
inappropriate actions through compensation arrangements may occur and potentially
result in greater market participation and allocative efficiency, thereby potentially
facilitating capital formation. As discussed above, it is difficult for the SEC to estimate
compliance costs related to the specific provision. However, for covered institutions that
do not currently have a similar reporting system in place, there could be significant fixed
costs that may disproportionately burden smaller covered BDs and IAs and hinder
competition. Overall, the SEC does not expect the effects of the proposed recordkeeping
requirements on efficiency, competition and capital formation to be significant.
5. Reservation of Authority
Under the proposed rule, an Agency may require a Level 3 covered institution
with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $10 billion and less than
$50 billion to comply with some or all of the provisions of §§ 5 and 7 through 11of the
proposed rule applicable to Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions if the agency

443

determines that such Level 3 covered institution’s complexity of operations or
compensation practices are consistent with those of a Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institution.
This proposed rule requirement would allow the SEC to treat senior executive
officers and significant risk-takers at BDs and IAs that have total consolidated assets
below $50 billion as covered persons of a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution, because,
for example, the complexity of the BDs’ and IAs’ operations or risk profile could have a
significant impact on the overall financial system and could generate negative spillover
effects for taxpayers. As a result, the number of BDs and IAs that would be subject to the
portions of the proposed rule applicable to Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions may
increase relative to the estimates presented in the baseline. 410
The proposed requirement may increase compliance costs for these BDs and IAs.
As shown above, Level 3 parent institutions differ significantly from Level 1 and Level 2
parent institutions on a number of dimensions: they tend to defer a smaller fraction of
NEOs incentive-based compensation (Table 7A), tend to defer cash less frequently (Table
7A), and tend to use more options as part of their incentive-based compensation (Table
6A) compared to Level 1 and Level 2 parent institutions. They also use rather
infrequently the prohibition of hedging with respect to non-employee directors that
receive incentive-based compensation (Table 9A). If the compensation arrangements of
Level 3 BDs and IAs are similar to those of Level 3 parent institutions, then for Level 3
BDs and IAs that are designated as Level 1 or Level 2 covered BDs and IAs by an

410

As discussed above in the Baseline section, as of the end of 2014, there were 33 BDs with total
consolidated assets between $10 and $50 billion. Due to the lack of data, the SEC cannot
determine the number of IAs with total consolidated assets between $10 and $50 billion.

444

Agency, the proposed rule is likely to require significant changes to certain features of
their compensation arrangements to be in compliance.
F. Potential Costs and Benefits of Additional Requirements and Prohibitions
for Level 1 and 2 Covered Institutions
1. Mandatory Deferral
The proposed rule would require a minimum amount of annual incentive-based
compensation to be deferred for a minimum number of years for senior executive officers
and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions. For senior
executive officers and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2 BDs and IAs, such
requirement is expected to establish a minimum accountability horizon with respect to the
outcomes of actions of these individuals, including the realization of longer-term risks
that may be associated with such actions.
As discussed above, from an economic standpoint, managerial actions carry
associated risks, and the horizon over which such risks unfold is uncertain. If the risk
realization horizon is longer than the performance period used to measure and
compensate the performance of senior executive officers and significant risk-takers, they
may have an incentive to undertake projects that deliver strong short-term performance at
the potential expense of long-term value. A minimum compensation deferral period aims
to curb incentives for such undesired behavior by increasing senior executive officers’
and significant risk-takers’ accountability for the potential adverse outcomes of their
actions that may be realized in the long run, which in turn may discourage short-termism
and inappropriate risk-taking and as a consequence lower the likelihood of default for the
covered institution and the potential risk such a default could pose to the greater financial

445

system.
As discussed above, the proposed minimum deferral periods required by the
proposed rule for Level 1 and Level 2 BDs and IAs covered institutions would relate to
the horizons over which the risks in these institutions may be realized. The deferral
periods are likely to overlap with a traditional business cycle to identify outcomes
associated with a senior executive officer’s or significant risk-taker’s performance and
risk-taking activities. As noted, the business cycle reflects periods of economic
expansion or recession, which typically underpin the performance of the financial sector.
There might be specific facts and circumstances (for example, the variety of assets held,
the changing nature of those assets over time, the normal turnover in assets held by
financial institutions, and the complexity of the business models of BDs and IAs) that
may affect the horizon over which risks may be realized for particular covered
institutions, so a uniform deferral period may be more or less aligned with the horizon
over which a particular covered institution realizes certain risks.
With regard to the type of incentive-based compensation instruments to be
deferred, the rule proposes to require deferred compensation to consist of substantial
amounts of both cash and equity-linked instruments. Whereas deferred equity-linked
compensation would be subject to both upside potential (for example, if the stock price of
the firm increases during the deferral period) and downside risk, the cash component of
deferred compensation would be mainly subject to downside risk, thus resembling the
payoff structure of a debt security. More specifically, the cash component of deferred
compensation would not appreciate in value if firm performance during the deferral
period is positive, but would be subject to downward adjustment, forfeiture, and
446

clawback if, for example, the executive has engaged in inappropriate risk-taking that
results in poor performance during the performance, deferral and post-deferral periods
respectively. This asymmetry in the payoff structure of the cash component of deferred
compensation is expected to provide incentives for responsible risk-taking by covered
persons thus lowering the likelihood of default at these institutions as well as the
corresponding risk to the greater financial system posed by certain large, complex, and
interconnected institutions. 411 Economic studies suggest a negative relation between precrisis levels of managerial debt holdings and measures of default risk during the crisis for
bank holding companies – bank holding companies whose executives held larger debt
holdings were less likely to default. 412

411

The academic literature provides evidence regarding the effect of compensation instruments
resembling a debtholder’s payoff and the effect of such compensation instruments on various
aspects of the agency costs of debt. For example, there is evidence of a negative relation between
levels of inside debt and the cost of debt; see Anantharaman et al. 2013. Inside debt and the
design of corporate debt contracts. Management Science 60, 1260−1280. Also, studies have
documented a negative relation between inside debt and restrictiveness of debt covenants and
demand for accounting conservatism, and a positive relation between CEO inside debt and firm
liquidation values; see Chen, F., Y. Dou, and X. Wang. 2010. Executive Inside Debt Holdings
and Creditors’ Demand for Pricing and Non-Pricing Protections. Working Paper. With respect to
the mechanism through which inside debt holdings lead to lower firm risk, evidence suggests that
such firms apply more conservative investment as well as financing choices. Inside debt in
particular has been shown to be negatively related to future stock return volatility, a market-based
measure of risk; see Cassell, Cory A., Shawn X. Huang, Juan Manuel Sanchez, and Michael D.
Stuart. 2012. The relation between CEO inside debt holdings and the riskiness of firm investment
and financial policies. Journal of Financial Economics 103, 588−610.
It must be noted that the academic literature proxies for such debt-like compensation instruments
mostly through pensions and other forms of deferred compensation. Such instruments may not
fully resemble the characteristics of deferred cash under the rule, particularly with respect to the
horizon of deferral as well as the vesting schedules (pro-rata vs. cliff-vesting).
412

See Bennett et al. (2015). Inside Debt, Bank Default Risk, and Performance during the Crisis.
Journal of Financial Intermdiation 24, 487−513. The study examines the relation between precrisis levels of inside equity vs. inside debt holdings by bank holding company CEOs and risk
and performance of these BHCs during the crisis. The findings reveal a negative relation between
pre-crisis CEO inside debt holdings and default risk during the crisis, and higher supervisory
ratings for these BHCs before the crisis.

447

As mentioned above, the deferral requirements of the proposed rule for senior
executive officers and significant risk-takers at the largest covered institutions are also
consistent with international standards on compensation. Having standards that are
generally consistent across jurisdictions would ensure that covered institutions in the
United States, compared to their non-U.S. peers, are on a level playing field in the global
competition for talent.
The mandatory deferral requirements of the proposed rule may impose significant
costs on affected BDs and IAs. 413 As a consequence of the mandatory deferral
requirement, the wealth of covered persons would be likely less diversified and more tied
to prolonged periods of a covered institution’s performance. This potential deterioration
of wealth diversification may induce covered persons to demand an increase in pay which
could result in higher compensation-related costs for covered institutions. 414 This
increase in compensation costs may be necessary in order for covered institutions to be
able to both attract and retain human talent. The SEC notes, however, that there may be
other factors affecting the ability of a covered institution to attract and retain human
talent, such as the supply of talent and non-pecuniary benefits of employment at covered
institutions. These factors may exacerbate or mitigate the potential increase in
compensation costs. For example, if senior executive officers and significant risk-takers
value non-pecuniary job benefits such as prestige, networking, and visibility, these

413

Several commenters raised accounting related issues with respect to covered institutions’
financial statements under the proposed rule (see, e.g., KPMG, CEC) and tax related issues with
respect to individuals affected by the proposed rule (see, e.g., KPMG, MFA, SIFMA, CEC,
PEGCC).
414

Three commenters argued that the proposed rule could result in unintended consequences such
as higher fixed compensation or other benefits (See FSR, WLF, U.S. Chamber).

448

benefits may offset the costs associated with deterioration in the diversification of their
portfolios.
As a result of the proposed compensation deferral requirement, covered persons at
BDs and IAs may be incentivized to curb inappropriate risk-taking given the increased
accountability over their actions. There could be situations, however, where bonus
deferral could actually lead to an increase in risk-taking incentives. 415 For example, if
firm performance during the deferral period significantly declines and causes a
significant loss in the value of deferred compensation, senior executive officers and
significant risk-takers could potentially have an incentive to engage in high-risk actions
in an effort to recoup at least some of the value of their deferred compensation.
As discussed above, deferral of the cash component of compensation resembles
the payoff structure of debt and as a consequence may expose managerial compensation
to risk without a corresponding upside. Whereas this may provide incentives to covered
persons to avoid actions that would expose a covered institution to higher likelihood of
default and for important institutions risks to the financial system, such incentives may
result in misalignment of interests between managers and shareholders and potentially
harm shareholder value. Several studies suggest that managers with significant debt
instruments in their compensation arrangement tend to undertake a more conservative

415

See Leisen, D. (2014). Does Bonus Deferral Reduce Risk Taking? Working Paper. The paper
develops a model comparing risk-taking incentives from bonuses with and without deferral. The
results challenge the common belief that bonus deferral unequivocally leads to reduced risktaking incentives; under certain conditions, deferral of bonus could lead to stronger risk-taking
incentives during the deferral period.

449

approach in managing their firms. 416 The significant use of debt in compensation
arrangements is viewed negatively by shareholders: stock prices of companies whose
executives hold significant debt positions experience a decrease upon disclosure of such
compensation arrangements. 417 Thus, whereas the utilization of debt-like instruments in
compensation arrangements in important institutions may lower the risk to the greater
financial system, this may come at the expense of shareholder value at these institutions.
One commenter suggested that the proposed rule could cause covered institutions to
perform in a less competitive way given lower incentives for risk-taking. 418
Alternatively, the Agencies could have proposed higher deferral percentages
and/or longer deferral horizons. Some commenters 419 suggested more stringent deferral
requirements, such as a longer deferral horizon, 420 a higher percentage subject to
deferral, 421 and holding the entire deferred amount back until the end of the deferral
period. 422 For example, the Agencies could have selected a seven-year deferral for senior
executive officers and a five-year horizon deferral horizon for significant risk-takers,
similar to the rules that the Prudential Regulation Authority has recently proposed in the
UK. Such long deferral periods may have allowed for longer-term risks to materialize

and thus be accounted for when calculating managerial compensation. On the other
hand, as mentioned above, longer deferral periods could result in inappropriate risktaking if firm performance during the deferral period significantly declines and causes a
significant loss in the value of deferred compensation. Additionally, a longer deferral
period increases the probability that financial performance is impacted by actions or
factors that are not related to covered persons’ actions and as such result in an inefficient
compensation contract. Moreover, lengthening of the deferral period is likely to lead to
increased liquidity issues for covered persons since their compensation cannot be cashed
out on a timely basis to meet their liquidity needs. Finally, it is also possible that further
prolonging of the deferral period could create incentives for institutions to shift away
from incentive-based compensation and increase the fixed component of compensation.
A potential consequence from such action may be distortion of value-enhancing
incentives that are generated through incentive-based compensation. Another potential
cost from deferral requirements that are more strict could be that affected institutions may
not be able to compete and as a consequence lose talent to other sectors that are not
subject to the proposed rule.
Another alternative could be shorter deferral periods (e.g., deferral period of less
than four years for the qualifying incentive-based compensation of senior executive
officers at Level 1 covered institutions; for example, 3 years as in the 2011 Proposed
Rule) and/or smaller deferral percentages (e.g., deferral of less than 60 percent of
qualifying incentive-based compensation for senior executive officers at Level 1 covered
institutions; for example, 50 percent as in the 2011 Proposed Rule). A shorter deferral
period and/or smaller deferral percentage amount, however, may not provide adequate

451

incentives to covered persons to engage in responsible risk-taking. On the other hand, if
the risk realization horizon is actually shorter than the deferral horizon proposed in the
rule, then using a shorter deferral period would avoid exposing covered persons’ wealth
to risks that do not result from their actions and would also impose lower liquidity
constraints on undiversified executives. From the baseline analysis of current
compensation practices, it appears that all of the Level 1 public parent institutions and
most of the Level 2 public parent institutions of BDs and IAs already have deferral
policies in place similar to the proposed rule requirements. Currently, about 50 percent to
75 percent of incentive-based compensation is deferred for a period of about three years,
and the deferral includes NEOs, non-NEOs and significant risk-takers.
If the compensation structure of BDs and IAs is similar to that of their parent
institutions, and the compensation structure of private institutions is similar to that of
public institutions, for the covered BDs and IAs the implementation of the deferred
aspect of the proposed rule is unlikely to lead to significant compliance costs. The only
potentially significant compliance costs that such covered institutions could incur with
respect to the deferral requirement is related to the deferral of cash compensation, which
currently only 20 percent to 25 percent of Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions defer,
and the prohibition on accelerated vesting, which very few of the Level 2 covered parent
institutions currently use. On the other hand, if the compensation practices of parent
institutions are significantly different than those at their subsidiaries, covered BDs and
IAs could experience significant compliance costs when implementing the proposed
deferral rule. Since the SEC does not have data on how many covered IAs have parent
institutions, it is also possible that a significant number of these IAs may be stand-alone

452

companies and therefore could have higher costs to comply with the proposed rule
compared to covered IAs and BDs that are part of reporting parent institutions. As
discussed above, the SEC has data regarding the incentive-based compensation
arrangements at the depository institution holding company parents of Level 1 and
unconsolidated Level 2 and unconsolidated Level 3 BDs and IAs because many of those
bank holding companies are public reporting companies under the Exchange Act. The
SEC lacks information regarding the compensation arrangements of BDs and IAs that are
not so affiliated, and hence the SEC cannot accurately assess the compliance costs for
those issuers. The same holds true if the incentive-based compensation practices at BDs
and IAs are generally different than those at banking institutions, which most of their
parent institutions are. Lastly, because some BDs and IAs are subsidiaries of private
parent institutions, if there is a significant difference in the compensation practices
between public and private covered institutions such private BDs and IAs could face
larger compliance costs. To better assess the effects of deferral on compliance costs for
BDs and IAs the SEC requests comments on these issues.
2. Options
For senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions, the proposed rule would limit the amount of stock option-based
compensation that can qualify for mandatory deferral at 15 percent, effectively placing a
cap on the use of stock options as part of the incentive-based compensation arrangements
for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2 covered

453

institutions. 423 This implies that 45 percent of incentive-based compensation would have
to be in some other form to fulfill the 60 percent deferral amount for a senior executive
officer or significant risk-taker at a Level 1 and Level 2 covered institution. As discussed
in the Broad Economic Considerations section, the payoff structure from stock options is
asymmetric and thus generates incentives for executives to undertake risks. For the
financial services industry in general, economic studies find that higher levels of stock
options in compensation arrangements of publicly traded bank CEOs are positively
related to multiple measures of risk, such as equity volatility. 424 Thus, limiting the use of
stock options in compensation arrangements could result, on average, in lower risk-taking
incentives for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions. As previously noted, however, the link between stock options and
risk-taking is not indisputable. For example, a study that examined the effect of a
decrease in the provision of stock options in compensation arrangements due to an
unfavorable change in accounting rules regarding option expensing, did not identify

423

If stock options awarded are not part of incentive-based compensation, there is no limit to such
awards.
424

See Mehran, H., Rosenberg, J. 2009. The Effect of CEO Stock Options on Bank Investment
Choice, Borrowing, and Capital. Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The study finds a positive
relation between the use of stock options in bank CEO compensation arrangements and risktaking as evident by higher levels of equity and asset volatility. The paper also finds that the
increased risk exposure in these banks comes from riskier project choices rather than increased
use of leverage.

induce risk-taking? An analysis of the banking industry. Journal of Banking and Finance 30, 915945. The paper examines whether option-based compensation is related to various measures of
risk for a sample of commercial banks. Option-based compensation is positively related to
various market measures of risk such as systematic and idiosyncratic risk. However, causality
cannot be inferred; risk also has an effect on the structure of compensation arrangements.

454

decreased risk-taking by executives as a response to a decrease in stock options
awards. 425
The unique characteristics of the financial services sector compared to the rest of
the economy—significantly higher leverage, 426 interconnectedness with other institutions
and markets, and the possibility for negative externalities—may create a conflict of
interest between shareholders (managers) of important financial institutions and
taxpayers with respect to the optimal level of risk-taking. In other words, shareholders
may enjoy the upside of risk-taking actions whereas taxpayers and other stakeholders
have to bear the costs associated with such risk-taking. While the literature does not
specifically reference BDs and IAs, but rather the financial services sector more
generally, the SEC believes that the global point may be applicable to BDs and IAs given
that these entities constitute a segment of the financial services sector. In addition, many
BDs and IAs that would be covered by the proposed rule are subsidiaries of bank holding
companies and as such these studies may be relevant for them. Thus, for BDs and IAs
the use of options in compensation arrangements could potentially amplify this conflict of
interest as it provides covered persons with an asymmetric payoff structure and an

taking: Evidence from FAS 123R’. Journal of Financial Economics 105, 174-190. This study
examines the effect of changes in option-based compensation, due to a change in the accounting
treatment of stock options in 2005, on risk-taking behavior. Firms significantly reduce the use of
stock options in compensation arrangements as a response to the unfavorable treatment of stock
options in financial statements. However, the study finds little evidence that the decline in option
usage resulted in less risky investment and financial policies.

incentive to undertake risks that may be optimal from shareholders’ point of view but
may provide risk-taking incentives to management that could lead to higher likelihood of
default at these institutions and potentially increase the risk to the greater financial
system. Consequently, capping the use of stock options and curbing covered persons’
incentives for inappropriate risk-taking at BDs and IAs could decrease their likelihood of
default, better align managers’ incentives with those of a broader group of stakeholders
and limit potential negative externalities generated by the default of particularly
important institutions. 427 However, although BDs and IAs are financial institutions, any
generalization based on the findings in the literature may not be very accurate because
BDs and IAs also have some differences with respect to other financial institutions. For
example, BDs and IAs differ from other financial institutions with respect to business
models, nature of the risks posed by the institutions, and the nature and identity of the
persons affected by those risks.
To the extent that the asymmetric payoff structure of options encourages covered
persons at BDs and IAs to undertake risks that are also suboptimal from a shareholders’
point of view, the proposed rule’s limitation on the use of options as part of compensation
arrangements may also improve incentive alignment between executives and
shareholders. However, as discussed in the Broad Economic Considerations section,
executives may be reluctant to undertake value-increasing but risky projects due to the
undiversified nature of their wealth and as such may engage in actions that lower firm

of Incentives’ for Executives of Financial Institutions. Journal of Applied Corporate Finance 22,

value (i.e., forgo risky but value-increasing projects). For example, an economic study
found that low sensitivity of compensation to risk resulted in a loss of firm value due to
suboptimal risk-taking by executives in these companies. 428 Mechanisms that are put in
place to curb such undesired behavior by executives include incentive-based
compensation components whose value is generally increasing in risk, such as stock
options. Thus, risk-taking incentives induced by options may be valuable in order to
provide covered persons at BDs and IAs with incentives to take risks that are desirable by
shareholders. As a consequence, a potential cost of the proposed limit to the use of stock
options in incentive-based compensation arrangements at covered institutions is the
potential for such limit to generate sub-optimally low risk-taking incentives for the
covered persons at BDs and IAs, potentially leading to lower shareholder values for these
institutions.
Limiting the amount of stock option based compensation that can qualify for
mandatory deferral at 15 percent suggests that a covered institution could theoretically
award up to 55 percent of its annual incentive-based compensation in the form of stock
options (for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions). Based on the SEC’s baseline analysis, it appears that the use of
options is increasingly infrequent in incentive-based compensation arrangements at
public parent institutions of BDs and IAs. Stock options at Level 1 covered institutions

See Low, A., 2009. Managerial risk-taking behavior and equity-based compensation. Journal
of Financial Economics 92, 470−490. The study examines changes in risk-taking by CEOs whose
firms have become more protected from a takeover due to a change in anti-takeover laws. The
study finds that CEOs with compensation arrangements with a low sensitivity of compensation to
volatility decrease risk-taking following the adoption of the anti-takeover law, and that such a
decrease in risk-taking activity is value destroying. The study also shows that as a response, firms
increase the sensitivity of CEO compensation to volatility to encourage risk-taking following the
adoption of the anti-takeover law.

457

represent about 4 percent of total incentive-based compensation, while at Level 2 covered
institutions they represent about 20 percent.
If the compensation structure of BDs and IAs is similar to that of their parent
institutions, and the compensation structure of private institutions is similar to that of
public institutions, the specific restriction imposed by the proposed rule would be
unlikely to affect the usage of options at Level 1 or unconsolidated Level 2 BDs and IAs
and would likely result in insignificant compliance costs. On the other hand, if the
compensation practices of parent institutions are significantly different from those at their
subsidiaries, covered BDs and IAs could experience significant compliance costs when
implementing the specific requirement of the proposed rule. Since the SEC does not
have data on how many covered IAs have parent institutions, it is also possible that a
significant number of these IAs may be stand-alone companies and therefore could have
higher costs to comply with this specific requirement of the proposed rule compared to
covered IAs and BDs that are part of reporting parent institutions.
As discussed above, BDs and IAs could also incur direct economic costs such as
decrease in firm value if the proposed rule leads to lower than optimal use of options in
senior executive officers and significant risk-takers incentive-based compensation
arrangements. The same holds true if the compensation of BDs and IAs is generally
different than that of banking institutions, which most of their parent institutions are.
Lastly, because some BDs and IAs are subsidiaries of private parent institutions, if there
is a significant difference in the compensation practices of public and private covered
institutions such BDs and IAs could face large compliance costs and direct economic
costs. The SEC does not have data for the use of options at subsidiaries of Level 1 or

458

Level 2 parents, and thus cannot quantify the impact of the proposed rule on those
institutions. To better assess the effects of options on compliance costs for BDs and IAs,
the SEC requests comments on the use of options in the compensation structures of BDs
and IAs below.
The Agencies could have selected as an alternative not to place a limit on the use
of stock options to meet the minimum required deferral amount requirement for a
performance period. Such an alternative would provide covered persons at BDs and IAs
with more incentives to undertake risks compared to the alternative the SEC has chosen
in the proposed rule. Taxpayers would potentially be worse off under the alternative
since the combination of high leverage and government guarantees, coupled with
additional risk-taking incentives from stock options could lead to inappropriate risktaking from taxpayers’ point of view. Such an alternative likely would have led to a
higher probability of default at covered institutions. For important institutions, such an
alternative would also increase the likelihood of risks at the institution also propagating
to the greater financial system. On the other hand, it is possible that shareholders would
potentially prefer increased risk-taking and as a consequence compensation arrangements
that encourage such behavior. From the SEC’s baseline analysis, provided that BDs and
IAs have similar compensation arrangements as their parents, the proposed rule should
not significantly affect existing compensation arrangements of covered institutions.
3. Long-Term Incentive Plans
For senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions the proposed rule would require a minimum deferral period and a
minimum deferral percentage amount of incentive-based compensation awarded through

459

long-term incentive plans (LTIPs), where LTIPs are characterized by having a
performance measurement period of at least three years. The proposed rule would
require deferral of 60 percent (50 percent) of LTIP awards for senior executive officers of
Level 1 (Level 2) covered institutions, and deferral of 50 percent (40 percent) of LTIP
awards for significant risk-takers of Level 1 (Level 2) covered institutions. The deferral
period for deferred LTIPs must be at least two years for covered persons of Level 1
covered institutions and at least one year for covered persons of Level 2 covered
institutions.
LTIPs are designed to reward long-term performance, performance that is usually
measured over the three-years following the beginning of the performance period. 429
Thus, these plans reward long-term performance outcomes and as such generate
incentives for long-term value. LTIP awards can be in the form of cash or stock and
these awards occur at the end of the performance period. The amount of the award
depends on the degree to which the company meets some predetermined performance
milestones. These performance milestones can include a variety of accounting-based
performance measures, such as sales and earnings, and research shows that the choice of
performance measures is related to company specific strategic goals. 430 Requiring a
minimum percentage of LTIP awards to be deferred would lengthen the period over
which senior executive officers and significant risk-takers receive compensation under
these plans and subject such compensation to downward adjustment during the
performance measurement period (prior to the award) as well as forfeiture and clawback

practices for executives.
430

See Li and Wang (2014)

460

during the deferral and post-deferral periods respectively. Some studies have criticized
LTIPs for having short performance periods. 431 The limited economic literature on
LTIPs currently does not provide a clear indication of the effect of LTIPs on excessive
risk-taking. The only study that investigates the role of LTIPs 432 suggests that companies
that use them experience improvement in operating performance and their NEOs do not
appear to take higher risks. Similar to the discussion on the benefits and costs of
mandatory deferral of other forms of incentive-based compensation, deferral of the LTIP
award could allow for long-term risks taken by BD and IA senior executive officers and
significant risk-takers to materialize and thus for their compensation to be more
appropriately adjusted for the risks they have taken. LTIP deferral may decrease risktaking because covered persons may have an incentive to manage the institution such that
they receive their full compensation under these plans. If the additional deferral of LTIPs
lowers risk-taking incentives at covered BDs and IAs to suboptimally low levels, then
firm value at these institutions could suffer as a consequence. However, if the additional
deferral of LTIPs mitigates incentives for inappropriate risk-taking at covered BDs and
IAs, then such outcome would lower the likelihood of default at these institutions, better
align managers’ incentives with those of a broader group of stakeholders, and also lower
the likelihood of negative externalities.
As an alternative, the Agencies could have selected a larger fraction of LTIPs to
be deferred (e.g., more than 60 percent for senior executive officer at a Level 1 covered
institution) and increased the LTIPs’ deferral period (e.g., for more than two years for
431

incentive design, IRRCI research report, 2014.
432

See Li and Wang, 2014.

461

senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at Level 1 covered institutions). A
longer deferral period for LTIPs would prolong the exposure of senior executive officers’
and significant risk-takers’ compensation to adverse outcomes of their actions. If
outcomes of some inappropriate risks are only realized in the longer-term, then
prolonging the deferral period for LTIPs would provide incentives to senior executive
officers and significant risk-takers to avoid such actions. On the other hand, such an
alternative might have exposed senior executive officers and significant risk-takers to
outcomes of actions that they are less likely to have been responsible for. Additionally,
long deferral period for LTIPs could create potential liquidity issues for senior executive
officers and significant risk-takers since their compensation cannot be cashed out on a
timely basis to meet their liquidity needs. 433 It is also possible that a long deferral period
for LTIPs would create incentives for institutions to pay higher fixed pay and as a
consequence distort the value-enhancing incentives that are generated through variable
pay.
As another alternative, the Agencies could have decided to exclude LTIPs from
the amount of incentive-based compensation that is to be deferred in a given year. Such
an alternative could have excluded a major part of covered persons’ incentive-based
compensation arrangements from the deferred amount. LTIPs typically have a
performance period of three years, which is shorter than the deferral period proposed in
the rulemaking. Under this alternative, not including LTIPs as part of the deferred

433

Interest rates charged to covered persons on loans used to cover their liquidity needs could
proxy for the related cost stated in the text. Such costs are likely to be determined by multiple
factors (for example, the macroecnomic environment) and vary over time and by individuals
making them difficult to quantify.

462

amount may have limited the ability of the proposed rule to curb inappropriate risktaking. However, if the current use of LTIPs by covered institutions is consistent with
generating optimal risk-taking incentives from the perspective of certain shareholders,
then not subjecting LTIPs to mandatory deferral would maintain these value-enhancing
incentives.
4. Downward Adjustment and Forfeiture
For senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions, the rule proposes placing at risk of downward adjustment all
incentive-based compensation amounts not yet awarded for the current performance
period and at risk of forfeiture all deferred but not yet vested incentive-based
compensation. As the analysis in the baseline section suggests, the triggers for
downward adjustment and forfeiture consist of adverse outcomes such as poor financial
performance due to significant deviations from approved risk parameters, inappropriate
risk-taking (regardless of the impact on financial performance), risk management or
control failures, and non-compliance with regulatory and supervisory standards resulting
in either legal action against the covered institution or a restatement to correct a material
error. The compensation of covered persons with either direct accountability or failure of
awareness of an undesirable action would be subject to downward adjustment and/or
forfeiture.
With regard to the determination of the compensation amount to be downward
adjusted or forfeited, the proposed rule would condition the magnitude of the adjustment
or forfeiture amounts on both the intent and the participation of covered persons in the
event(s) triggering the review, as well as the magnitude of costs generated by the related

463

actions (including financial performance, fines and litigation and related reputational
damage). Compensation would be subject to downward adjustment and forfeiture during
the performance period and the deferral period, respectively. As a consequence, this
requirement would provide incentives to senior executive officers and significant risktakers at BDs and IAs to avoid inappropriate risk-taking since they could be penalized in
situations where inappropriate risks had been undertaken, regardless of whether such
risks resulted in poor performance.
The downward adjustment or forfeiture amounts is conditional on the intent,
responsibility and the magnitude of the financial loss caused to the covered institution by
inappropriate actions of covered persons. In other words, the penalty imposed on the
covered person would increase with the intent, responsibility and the magnitude of
financial loss generated. This “progressiveness” characteristic in the proposed rule
requirement would imply that the covered person’s incentive-based compensation award
would be increasingly at stake. Thus, covered persons would be expected to have
incentives to avoid excessive risk-taking in order to secure at least part of incentive-based
compensation award.
Additionally, provided that senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at
BDs and IAs may be deemed accountable and risk their compensation for inappropriate
actions that were undertaken by other executives or significant risk-takers, they may have
an incentive to establish an effective governance system that would monitor risk
exposure. Such an incentive and the corresponding actions would strengthen risk
oversight within the covered institution and potentially lower the probability that any
inappropriate action taken might go undetected. To this point, a recent economic study

464

indicates that bank holding companies with strong risk controls, as proxied by the
presence of an independent and strong risk committee, were found to be exposed to lower
tail risk, lower amount of underperforming loans, and had better operating and financial
performance during the financial crisis. 434
On the other hand, the risk of downward adjustment and forfeiture could increase
uncertainty on covered persons’ expectations for receiving the compensation. A
possibility exists that risks a covered person believes ex-ante to be appropriate may be
classified as ex-post inappropriate and thus trigger downward adjustment or forfeiture of
related compensation. Such uncertainty about the interpretation of appropriate risktaking could generate incentives for managers to take approaches with respect to risktaking that are not optimal from the perspective of shareholders. Such an avoidance of
risks, if it occurs, could lead to lower firm value and losses for shareholders.
Based on the SEC’s baseline analysis of current compensation practices, it
appears that all of the Level 1 public parent institutions and most of the Level 2 public
parent institutions already employ forfeiture with respect to deferred compensation. The
forfeiture rules are based on various triggers and apply to NEOs, non-NEOs and
significant risk-takers. Thus, if the compensation structure of BDs and IAs is similar to
that of their parent institutions, and the compensation structure of private institutions is
similar to that of public institutions, the implementation of the proposed rule related to
forfeiture would be unlikely to lead to significant compliance costs. On the other hand, if
the compensation practices of parent institutions are significantly different than those at

434

See Ellul, A., Yerramilli, V. 2013. Stronger Risk Controls, Lower Risk: Evidence from U.S.
Bank Holding Companies. Journal of Finance 68, 1757−1803.

465

their subsidiaries (e.g., BDs and IAs do not use downward adjustment and forfeiture in
their compensation packages), covered BDs and IAs could experience significant
compliance costs when implementing this specific requirement of the proposed rule.
Since The SEC does not have data on how many covered IAs have parent institutions, it
is also possible that a significant number of these IAs may be stand-alone companies and
therefore could have higher costs to comply with this specific requirement of the
proposed rule compared to covered IAs and BDs that are part of reporting parent
institutions. BDs and IAs could also incur direct economic costs such as decrease in firm
value if the proposed rule requirements regarding downward adjustment or forfeiture lead
to less risk-taking than is optimal from shareholders’ point of view. The same holds true
if the compensation of BDs and IAs is generally different than that of banking
institutions, which most of their parent institutions are.
Lastly, because some BDs and IAs are subsidiaries of private parent institutions,
if there is a significant difference in the compensation practices of public and private
covered institutions such BDs and IAs could face large compliance costs and direct
economic costs. The SEC does not have data for the use of downward adjustment and
forfeiture at subsidiaries of Level 1 or Level 2 parents, and thus cannot quantify the
impact of the rule for those institutions. To better assess the effects of downward
adjustment and forfeiture on compliance costs for BDs and IAs. The SEC requests
comments below.
5. Clawback
For senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions, the proposed rule would require clawback provisions in incentive-

466

based compensation arrangements to provide for the recovery of paid compensation for
up to seven years following the vesting date of such compensation. Such a clawback
requirement would be triggered when senior executive officers and significant risk-takers
are determined to have engaged in fraud, intentional misrepresentation of information
used to determine a covered person’s incentive-based compensation, or misconduct
resulting in significant financial or reputational harm to the covered institution. Other
existing provisions of law contain clawback requirements that potentially have some
overlap with those in the proposed rulemaking. Thus, certain covered institutions may
have experience with recovering executive compensation via clawback. For example,
section 304 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act (“SOX”) contains a recovery provision that is
triggered when a restatement occurs as a result of issuer misconduct. This provision
applies only to the chief executive officer (“CEO”) and chief financial officer (“CFO”)
and the amount of required recovery is limited to compensation received in the year
following the first improper filing. 435 The Interim Final Rules under section 111 of the
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) required institutions receiving
assistance under TARP to mandate Senior Executive Officers to repay compensation if
awards based on statements of earnings, revenues, gains, or other criteria that were later
found to be materially inaccurate. 436 Relative to either SOX or EESA, the clawback
requirement of the proposed rule is more expansive in that its application is not only
435

See 15 U.S.C. 7243.

436

Under EESA a “Senior Executive Officer” was defined as an individual who is one of the top
five highly paid executives whose compensation was required to be disclosed pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. See Department of Treasury, TARP Standards for
Compensation and Corporate Governance; Interim Final Rule (June 15, 2009), available at
http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-06-15/pdf/E9-13868.pdf

467

limited to CEOs and CFOs but would cover any senior executive officer and significant
risk-taker in a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution. In addition to the broader scope of
the clawback provision in the proposed rule regarding covered persons, there is also a
broader scope with respect to the circumstances that would trigger clawback. More
specifically, the proposed rule includes misconduct that resulted in reputational or
financial harm to the covered institution as a trigger for clawback.
The inclusion of the clawback provision in the incentive-based compensation of
senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at BDs and IAs could increase the
horizon of accountability with respect to the identified actions that are likely to bring
harm to the covered institution. As a consequence of the clawback horizon, senior
executive officers and significant risk-takers are likely to have lower incentives to engage
in actions that may put the covered institution at risk in the longer run. Moreover, the
proposed rule may also increase incentives to senior executive officers and significant
risk-takers to put in place stronger mechanisms such as governance in an effort to protect
their incentive-based compensation from events that may trigger a clawback. Finally, in
addition to lowering the incentives of senior executive officers and significant risk-takers
for undesirable actions that may harm the covered institution, stakeholders of the covered
institution are also expected to benefit from the clawback provision since in the event of
an action triggering a clawback, any recovered incentive-based compensation amount
would accrue to the institution.
The fact that incentive-based compensation is to a large extent determined by
reported performance, coupled with the lowered incentives for covered persons to
intentionally misrepresent information, can lead to improved financial reporting quality

468

for covered institutions. Thus, indirectly the potential to claw back incentive-based
compensation that is awarded on erroneous financial information could generate
incentives for high quality reporting. The literature finds that market penalties for
reporting failures, as captured by restatements of financial reports, i.e., financial reports
of (extremely) low quality, are non-trivial and may translate into an increase in the cost of
capital for such firms. 437 To the extent that the quality of financial reporting increases as
a result of the proposed rule, capital formation may be fostered since the improved
information environment may lead to a decrease in the cost of raising capital for covered
institutions. 438
However, the relatively long clawback horizon may generate uncertainty
regarding incentive-based compensation of senior executive officers and significant risktakers. For example, that could be the case if certain actions that trigger a clawback are
outside of a covered person’s control. As a response to the potentially increased
uncertainty, senior executive officers and significant risk-takers may demand higher
levels of overall compensation, or substitution of incentive-based compensation with
other forms of compensation such as salary. Such potential may distort incentives for

risk-taking and as a consequence lower shareholder value. Also, the increased allocation
of resources to the production of high-quality financial reporting may divert resources
from other activities that may be value enhancing. Finally, covered persons may have a
decreased incentive to pursue those projects that would require more complex accounting
judgments, perhaps lowering shareholder value. 439
Moreover, the potential compliance costs related with the implementation of the
clawback provision could be significant. For example, covered institutions may have to
rely on the work of outside experts to estimate the amount of incentive-based
compensation to be clawed back following a clawback trigger.
Based on the SEC’s baseline analysis, it appears that all of the Level 1 covered
institutions and most of the Level 2 covered institutions already employ clawback
policies with respect to deferred compensation. The clawback policies are based on
various triggers and apply to NEOs, non-NEOs and significant risk-takers. Thus, if the
BDs and IAs have similar policies on clawback, and the compensation structure of
private institutions is similar to that of public institutions, the implementation of the
proposed clawback rule would unlikely lead to significant compliance costs. On the
other hand, if the compensation practices of parent institutions are significantly different
than those at their subsidiaries (e.g., BDs and IAs do not include clawback policies in
their compensation packages), covered BDs and IAs could experience significant

439

For example, if an executive is under pressure to meet an earnings target, rather than manage
earnings through accounting judgments, the executive may elect to reduce or defer to a future
period research and development or advertising expenses. This could improve reported earnings
in the short-term, but could result in a suboptimal level of investment that adversely affects
performance in the long run. See Chan, L., Chen, K., Chen, T., Yu, Y. 2012. The effects of firminitiated clawback provisions on earnings quality and auditor behavior. Journal of Accounting
and Economics 54, 180−196.

470

compliance costs when implementing the proposed rule. The same holds true if the
compensation of BDs and IAs is generally different than that of banking institutions,
which most of their parent institutions are. Additionally, since the SEC does not have
data on how many covered IAs have parent institutions, it is also possible that a
significant number of these IAs may be stand-alone companies and therefore could have
higher costs to comply with this specific requirement of the proposed rule compared to
covered IAs and BDs that are part of reporting parent institutions.
The SEC has attempted to quantify such costs using data in Table 14. We note
that these costs are not necessarily going to be in addition to the compliance costs
discussed above, as covered institutions may hire a compensation consultant to help them
with several requirements in the proposed rules.
Lastly, because some BDs and IAs are subsidiaries of private parent institutions,
if there is a significant difference in the compensation practices of public and private
covered institutions such BDs and IAs could face large compliance costs. The SEC does
not have data for the use of clawback at subsidiaries of Level 1 or Level 2 parents, and
thus cannot quantify the impact of the rule on those institutions. To better assess the
effects of clawback on compliance costs for BDs and IAs the SEC requests detailed
comments below.
6. Hedging
The proposed rule would prohibit the purchase of any instrument by a Level 1 or
Level 2 covered institution to hedge against any decrease in the value of a covered
person’s incentive-based compensation. As discussed above, introducing a minimum
mandatory deferral period for incentive-based compensation aims at increasing long-term
471

managerial accountability, including long-term risk implications associated with covered
persons’ actions. Using instruments to hedge against decreases in firm value would
provide downside insurance to covered persons’ wealth, including equity holdings that
are part of deferred compensation. If the value of (deferred) incentive-based
compensation is protected from potential downside through a hedging transaction, this is
likely to increase the covered person’s tolerance to risk. Thus, the effect of compensation
deferral would likely be weakened. 440 For BDs and IAs that currently initiate hedges on
behalf of their covered persons, a benefit from the prohibition on hedging is that the
incentives of covered persons to exert effort could be strengthened given the same
compensation contract. This in turn would imply a stronger alignment between
executives’ and taxpayers’ and other stakeholders’ interests for the same amount of
performance-based pay.
While the proposed rule intends to eliminate firm initiated hedging, a personal
hedging transaction by covered persons would still be permitted (unless the institution
prohibits such transactions from occurring). Thus, a covered person at BDs and IAs

440

See Bebchuk, L., Fried. J. Paying for long-term performance. University of Pennsylvania Law
Review 158, 1915−1959. The paper argues that potential benefits from tying executive
compensation to long-term shareholder value are weakened when executives are allowed to hedge
against downside risk.
See also Gao, H. 2010. Optimal compensation contracts when managers can hedge. Journal of
Financial Economics 97, 218−238. This study shows that the ability to hedge against potential
downside makes the executive more risk tolerant. In other words, holding the compensation
arrangement constant, hedging is predicted to weaken the sensitivity of compensation to
performance and also the sensitivity of compensation to risk. However, the study also shows that
for executives who can engage in low-cost hedging transactions, compensation contracts tend to
provide higher sensitivity of executive pay to both performance and volatility.

472

could potentially substitute the firm-initiated hedge with a personal hedging 441 contract
and restore any changes in incentives from the prohibition of the firm-initiated hedge.
To the extent that the covered person’s compensation contract is not adjusted as a
response to the elimination of the hedge, the covered person would face stronger
incentives to exert effort whereas her tolerance for risk-taking would decrease with the
prohibition on hedging. Whether the resulting lower risk-taking tolerance is beneficial
for BDs and IAs is difficult to determine. On one hand, if the covered persons’ risktaking incentives are at an optimal level with the hedging transaction in place, then
eliminating the hedge may reduce their risk-taking incentives to levels that could be
detrimental for shareholder value. If this were the case, however, the institution’s
compensation committees could adjust compensation structures in a manner to achieve
pre-prohibition risk-taking incentives if the distortion from hedging prohibition is deemed
to be detrimental to firm value; however, some provisions of the proposed rule could
potentially constrain board of directors’ flexibility to make such adjustments. 442 On the
other hand, if covered persons had incentives to undertake undesirable risks given the
downside protection provided by the hedge, then eliminating such protection could lead
them to engage in risk-taking which could lead to higher firm values.
Based on the SEC’s baseline analysis, it appears that most Level 1 covered
institutions (70 percent) and Level 2 covered institutions (60 percent) are already using

441

Refer to Tables 7a and 7b for statistics regarding thecomplete prohibition of hedging by parent
institutions of BDs and IAs.
442

For example, boards of directors or compensation committees at covered BDs and IAs would
be constrained from increasing the risk-taking incentives of covered persons through the
additional provision of stock options, if banning hedging lowers risk-taking incentives to a suboptimal level.

473

prohibition on hedging with respect to executive compensation of executives and
significant risk-takers. Additionally, 70 percent of Level 1 covered institutions and 100
percent of Level 2 covered institutions already prohibit hedging with respect to executive
compensation of non-employee directors. If BDs and IAs have similar policies as their
parent institutions, and the compensation structure of private institutions is similar to that
of public institutions, the implementation of the proposed rule in its part related to the
prohibition of hedging is unlikely to lead to significant compliance costs. The cost of
compliance with the proposed requirement of the rule would mostly affect the few BDs
and IAs whose parent institutions do not currently implement such a prohibition. On the
other hand, if the compensation practices of parent institutions are significantly different
than those at their subsidiaries (e.g., BDs and IAs do not prohibit hedging), covered BDs
and IAs could experience significant compliance costs when implementing the proposed
rule. Since the SEC does not have data on how many covered IAs have parent
institutions, it is also possible that a significant number of these IAs may be stand-alone
companies and therefore could have higher costs to comply with this specific requirement
of the proposed rule compared to covered IAs and BDs that are part of reporting parent
institutions. BDs and IAs could also incur direct economic costs such as decrease in firm
value if the proposed prohibition on hedging leads to less risk-taking than is optimal. The
same holds true if the compensation of BDs and IAs is generally different than that of
banking institutions, which most of their parent institutions are. If BDs and IAs do not
prohibit hedging and this provides incentives to their covered persons to undertake
undesirable risks because of the downside protection provided by the hedge, then
applying the rule provisions could lead to more appropriate risk-taking.

474

Lastly, because some BDs and IAs are subsidiaries of private parent institutions,
if there is a significant difference between the compensation practices of public and
private covered institutions such BDs and IAs could face large compliance costs and
direct economic costs. The SEC does not have data for a prohibition of hedging at
subsidiaries of Level 1 or Level 2 private parents, and thus cannot quantify the impact of
the rule on those institutions. To better assess the effects of the prohibition on hedging
on compliance costs for BDs and IAs the SEC requests comments below.
As an alternative, some commenters suggested disclosure of hedging transactions
instead of prohibition. 443 One commenter suggested instead of prohibiting the use of
hedging instruments to require full disclosure of all outside transactions in financial
markets by covered persons, including hedging transactions, to the extent that these
transactions affect pay-performance sensitivity. 444 This disclosure should be made to the
compensation committee of the board of directors and the appropriate regulator, and the
board of directors should attest to the fact that these transactions do not distort proper
risk-reward balance in the compensation arrangement. According to the commenter,
sometimes covered persons may have legitimate purposes for engaging in hedging
transactions such as when they are exposed excessively to the riskiness of the covered
institution and need to rebalance their personal portfolio. Such an alternative, however,
might not prevent covered persons from unwinding the effect of the mandatory deferral.
For example, it would not be easy to disentangle hedging transactions that diminish
individuals’ exposure to the riskiness of the covered institutions from transactions that

475

reverse the effect of the deferral. Additionally, the compensation committee might not
have the expertise to evaluate complex derivatives transactions.
7. Maximum Incentive-Based Compensation Opportunity
The proposed rule would prohibit Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions from
awarding incentive-based compensation to senior executive officers and significant risktakers in excess of 125 percent (for senior executive officers) or 150 percent (for
significant risk-takers) of the target amount for that incentive-based compensation.
Placing a cap on the amount by which the incentive-based compensation award can
exceed the target would essentially limit the upside pay potential due to performance and
a potential impact of such restriction could be to lower risk-taking incentives by senior
executive officers and significant risk-takers. That could be the case because the cap on
incentive-based compensation implies that managers would not be rewarded for
performance once the cap is reached.
As discussed above, high levels of upside leverage could lead to senior executive
officers and significant risk-takers taking inappropriate risks to maximize the potential
for large amounts of incentive-based compensation. Given the positive link between risk
and expected payoffs from managerial actions, a potential impact of such restriction
could be to lower risk-taking incentives by senior executive officers and significant risktakers. Whether such an effect is beneficial or not for covered BDs and IAs firm value is
likely to depend on many factors including the level of the incentive-based compensation
targets set in compensation arrangements. If the proposed cap excessively lowers
appropriate risk-taking incentives, then firm value could suffer. Moreover, another
potential cost from the proposed restriction is that effort inducing incentives may be
476

diminished once the cap is achieved, possibly misaligning the interests of shareholders
with those of managers. On the other hand, if the cap on incentive-based compensation
awards eliminates a range of payoffs that could only be achieved by actions associated
with taking suboptimally high risks, then such a restriction would improve firm value.
As the baseline analysis shows, the maximum incentive-based compensation
opportunity for Level 1 parent institutions is on average 155 percent and that for Level 2
parent institutions is on average 190 percent. Both are significantly higher than would be
permitted under the proposed rule. If BDs and IAs have similar policies as their parent
institutions, and the compensation structure of private institutions is similar to that of
public institutions, the implementation of the proposed rule in its part related to
maximum incentive-based compensation opportunity could lead to significant
compliance costs. The cost could result from changing the current practices and, as a
result, potentially having to compensate senior executive officers and significant risktakers for the decreased ability to earn compensation in excess of the target amount. If
the current compensation practices with regard to maximum incentive-based
compensation opportunity are optimal, it is possible than affected BDs and IAs could
experience loss of human capital. On the other hand, as discussed above, if the cap on
incentive-based compensation awards eliminates a range of payoffs that could only be
achieved by actions associated with taking suboptimally high risks, then such a restriction
would improve firm value. Since the SEC does not have data on how many covered IAs
have parent institutions, it is also possible that a significant number of these IAs may be
stand-alone companies and therefore could have higher costs to comply with this specific
requirement of the proposed rule compared to covered IAs and BDs that are part of

477

reporting parent institutions.
Additionally, because some BDs and IAs are subsidiaries of private parent
institutions, if there is a significant difference between the compensation practices of
public and private covered institutions such BDs and IAs could face large compliance
costs when applying this rule requirement. The SEC does not have data on the use of
maximum incentive-based compensation opportunity at subsidiaries of Level 1 or Level 2
private parents, and thus cannot quantify the impact of the rule on those institutions. To
better assess the effects of the proposed limitations to the maximum incentive-based
compensation opportunity on compliance costs for BDs and IAs the SEC requests
comments below.
8. Acceleration of Payments
The proposed rule would prohibit the acceleration of payment of deferred
regulatory incentive-based compensation except in cases of death or disability of covered
persons at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions. This would prevent covered
institutions from undermining the effect from the mandatory deferral of incentive-based
compensation by accelerating the deferred payments to covered persons. It could,
however, negatively affect covered persons that decide to leave the institution in search
for other employment opportunities. In such cases, these covered persons might have to
forgo a significant portion of their compensation.
As the analysis in the Baseline section shows, most Level 1 parent institutions
(approximately 70 percent) already prohibit acceleration of payments to their executives,
while very few of the Level 2 parent institutions do. The only exceptions are in cases of
death or disability. Given that current practices of BDs’ and IAs’ Level 1 parent

478

institutions already apply most of the prohibitions required by the proposed rule (except
employment termination), if those BDs and IAs have similar policies as their parent
institutions, and the compensation structure of private institutions is similar to that of
public institutions, the implementation of the proposed with respect to the prohibition on
the acceleration of payments is unlikely to lead to significant compliance costs. The cost
of compliance with the requirement of the rule will mostly affect the BDs and IAs whose
parent institutions are Level 2 covered institutions or Level 1 covered institutions that do
not currently implement such a prohibition. On the other hand, if the compensation
practices of parent institutions are significantly different than those at their subsidiaries
(e.g., BDs and IAs do not prohibit acceleration of payments), covered BDs and IAs could
experience significant compliance costs when implementing the proposed rule.
Additionally, since the SEC does not have data on how many covered IAs have parent
institutions, it is also possible that a significant number of these IAs may be stand-alone
companies and therefore could have higher costs to comply with this specific requirement
of the proposed rule compared to covered IAs and BDs that are part of reporting parent
institutions.
Lastly, because some BDs and IAs are subsidiaries of private parent institutions,
if there is a significant difference in the compensation practices of public and private
covered institutions such BDs and IAs could face large compliance costs when applying
this rule requirement. The SEC does not have data for the prohibition of acceleration of
payments at subsidiaries of Level 1 or Level 2 parents, and thus cannot quantify the
impact of the rule on those institutions. The SEC requests comment on the effects of the
prohibition on acceleration of payments may have on compliance costs for BDs and IAs.

479

9. Relative Performance Measures
The proposed rule would prohibit the sole use of relative performance measures in
incentive-based compensation arrangements at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions.
Although relative performance measures are widely used to filter out uncontrollable
events that are outside of management control and can reduce the efficiency of the
compensation arrangement, a peer group could be opportunistically selected to justify
compensation awards at a covered institution. To the extent that covered persons may
influence peer selection, opportunism in choosing a performance benchmark may
translate into covered persons selectively choosing benchmark firms in order to increase
or justify increases in their compensation awards.
Evidence on whether such practices take place is mixed. For example, one study
examined the selection of peer firms used as benchmarks in setting compensation for a
wide range of firms and showed that, on average, chosen peer firms provided higher
levels of compensation to their executives. The study asserts that managers tend to
choose higher paying firms as peers to justify increases in the level of their own
compensation. 445 The same study also found that the choice of highly paid peers is more
prevalent when the CEO is also the chair of the board of directors, re-enforcing the
argument for opportunism in peer selection. Another study found that executives attempt
to justify increases in their compensation by choosing relatively larger firms as their

445

See Faulkender, M., Yang, J. 2010. Inside the black box: The role and composition of
compensation peer groups. Journal of Financial Economics 96, 257−270. The study suggests that
companies appear to select highly paid peers as a benchmark for their CEO’s pay to justify higher
CEO compensation. The study also suggests that such an effect is stronger when governance is
weaker: in companies where the CEO is also the chairman of the board, has longer tenure, and
when directors are busier serving on multiple boards.

480

peers since larger firms are likely to offer higher compensation to their executives. 446
However, the study also showed that boards of directors exercise conservative discretion
in using information from benchmark firms when setting compensation practices.
Finally, a third related study447 suggests that firms choose peers with (relatively) highly
paid CEOs when their own CEO is highly talented, a finding that is not consistent with
opportunism regarding the choice of peers in compensation setting. Overall, empirical
studies suggest that opportunism in the peer group selection may exist, particularly in
companies where the CEO may exert influence over her compensation setting process.
By restricting the sole use of relative performance measures in compensation
arrangements, the proposed rule would curb the ability of covered persons to engage in
such opportunistic behavior, which would benefit covered BDs and IAs.
As mentioned above, the proposed rule would prohibit the sole use of relative
performance measures in determining compensation at covered institutions. Constraining
the use of relative performance measures in incentive-based compensation contracts has
potential costs. Absolute firm performance is typically driven by multiple factors and not
all of these factors are under the covered persons’ control. If incentive-based
compensation is tied to measures of absolute firm performance, then at least a part of
446

See Bizjak, J., Lemmon, M., Nguyen, T. 2011. Are all CEOs above average? An empirical
analysis of compensation peer groups and pay design. Journal of Financial Economics 100,
538−555. The study suggests that companies use compensation peer groups that are larger or
provide higher pay in order to inflate pay in their own company and this practice is more
prevalent for companies outside of the S&P500. However, the study also shows that boards
exercise discretion in adjusting compensation due to the peer group effect; pay increases only
close about one-third of the gap between company CEO and peer group CEO pay.
447

See Albuquerque, A., De Franco, G., Verdi, R. 2013. Peer Choice in CEO Compensation.
Journal of Financial Economics 108, 160−181. The study examines whether companies that
benchmark CEO pay against highly paid peer CEOs is driven by incentives to increase CEO pay.
Whereas the study suggests that benchmarking pay against highly paid peer CEOs is driven by
opportunism, such practice mostly represents increased compensation for CEO talent.

481

incentive-based compensation will be tied to events out of covered persons’ control. This
could generate uncertainty about compensation outcomes for covered persons, reducing
the efficiency of the incentive-based compensation arrangement. Whereas the proposed
rule would not prohibit the use of relative performance measures, if the proposed
limitation regarding the use of performance measures in determining compensation
awards leads to less filtering out of the uncontrollable risk component of performance,
then covered institutions may increase overall pay to compensate covered persons for
bearing uncontrollable risk.
The SEC’s baseline analysis of current compensation practices suggests that most
Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions use a mix of absolute and relative performance
measures. If BDs and IAs have similar policies as their parent institutions, and the
compensation structure of private institutions is similar to that of public institutions, the
SEC does not expect this rule requirement to generate significant compliance costs for
covered institutions. The cost of compliance with the proposed rule would mostly affect
the few BDs and IAs whose parent institutions do not currently implement such a
requirement. On the other hand, if the compensation practices of parent institutions are
significantly different than those at their subsidiaries (e.g., they do not use absolute
performance measures, or use mostly absolute measures), covered BDs and IAs could
experience significant compliance costs when implementing the proposed rule. Since the
SEC does not have data on how many covered IAs have parent institutions, it is also
possible that a significant number of these IAs may be stand-alone companies and
therefore could have higher costs to comply with this specific requirement of the
proposed rule compared to covered IAs and BDs that are part of reporting parent

482

institutions. The same holds true if the compensation of BDs and IAs is generally
different than that of banking institutions, which most of their parent institutions are.
The SEC has attempted to quantify such costs based on the estimates in Table 14.
The SEC also notes that these costs are not necessarily going to be in addition to the
compliance costs discussed above, as covered institutions may hire a compensation
consultant to help them with several requirements in the proposed rules. These costs
could be lower, however, if the parent institutions of BDs and IAs already employ
compensation consultants and could extend their services to meet the proposed rule
requirements for BDs and IAs. Lastly, because some BDs and IAs are subsidiaries of
private parent institutions, if there is a significant difference in the compensation
practices of public and private covered institutions such BDs and IAs could face large
compliance costs. The SEC does not have data for the prohibition of the sole use of
relative performance measures at subsidiaries of Level 1 or Level 2 parents, and thus
cannot quantify the impact of the rule on those institutions. To better assess the effects of
this prohibition on compliance costs for BDs and IAs. The SEC requests detailed
comments below.
10. Volume-Driven Incentive-Based Compensation
For covered persons at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions, the proposed rule
would prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that are based solely on the
volume of transactions being generated without regard to transaction quality or
compliance of the covered person with sound risk management. Such a compensation
contract would provide incentives for employees to maximize the number of transactions
since that outcome would lead to maximizing their compensation. A compensation
483

contract that solely uses volume as the performance indicator is likely to provide
employees with incentives for inappropriate risk-taking since employees benefit from one
aspect of performance but do not bear the negative consequences of their actions – the
associated costs and risks incurred to generate revenue/volume. There is limited
academic literature addressing the effect of volume-driven compensation on employee
incentives. A study examined the behavior of loan officers at a major commercial bank
when compensation switched from a fixed salary structure to a performance-based
structure where the measure of performance was set as loan origination volume. 448 The
study found a 31 percent increase in loan approvals, holding other factors related to the
probability of loan approvals constant. The study also found that the 12-month
probability of default in originating loans increased by 27.9 percent. Whereas the study
did not conclude whether the bank was better or worse off due to the introduction of the
compensation scheme, the authors found that interest rates charged to lower quality loans
did not reflect the increased riskiness of the borrowers. Another related study 449 finds
that loan officers who are incentivized based on lending volume rather than on the quality

448

See Agarwal, S., Ben-David, I. 2014. Do Loan Officers’ Incentives Lead to Lax Lending
Standards? NBER Working Paper. This study examines changes in lending practices in one of the
largest U.S. commercial banks when loan officers’ compensation structure was altered from fixed
salary to volume-based pay. The study suggests that following the change in the compensation
structure, loan origination became more aggressive as evident by higher origination rates, larger
loan sizes, and higher default rates. The study estimates that 10% of the loans under the volumebased compensation structure were likely to have negative net present value.
449

See Cole, S., Kanz, M., Klapper, L. 2015. Incentivizing Calculated Risk-Taking: Evidence
from an Experiment with Commercial Bank Loan Officers. Journal of Finance 70, 537-575. The
study examines the effect of different incentive-based compensation arrangements on loan
originators behavior in screening and approving loans in an Indian commercial bank. In general,
the study finds that the structure of incentive-based arrangements for loan officers affects their
decisions; the performance metric used in compensation arrangements of loan officers as well as
whether pay is deferred affect loan officers screening and approval incentives and corresponding
decisions.

484

of their loan portfolio originate more loans of lower average quality. The study also finds
that due to the presence of career concerns or reputational motivations, loan officers with
lending volume incentives do not indiscriminately approve all applications. Whereas the
study examines the effects of volume-driven compensation on employees that are not
likely to be covered by the proposed rule, it confirms intuition that providing incentives
for volume maximization may lead to behaviors that do not necessarily maximize firm
value.
It is unclear to the SEC whether volume-driven incentive-based compensation
arrangements are utilized by IAs and BDs given the nature of the business conducted by
IAs and BDs. Assuming that these incentive-based compensation arrangements are
relevant to IAs and BDs, restricting the sole use of volume-driven compensation practices
may curb incentives that reward employees of BDs and IAs on only partial outcomes of
their actions; partial in the sense that costs and risks associated with those actions are not
part of the performance indicators used to determine their compensation. As a
consequence, to the extent that BDs and IAs contribute significantly to the overall risk
profile of their parent institutions, covered persons’ incentives would likely become
aligned with the interests of stakeholders, including taxpayers, since covered persons
would bear both the benefits and the costs from their actions. Likewise, the prohibition
on the sole use of volume-driven compensation practices is also likely to limit covered
persons’ incentives for inappropriate risk-taking.
The effect of this proposed rule on BDs and IAs cannot be unambiguously
determined because of the lack of data on the current use of volume-driven compensation
practices. If BDs and IAs have already instituted similar policies with respect to senior

485

executive officers and significant risk-takers, the SEC does not expect this rule
requirement to generate significant compliance costs for covered institutions. On the
other hand, if covered BDs and IAs’ compensation practices with respect to senior
executive officers and significant risk-takers rely exclusively on volume-driven
transactions, covered BDs and IAs could experience significant compliance costs when
implementing the proposed rule. To better assess the effects of this prohibition on
compliance costs for BDs and IAs the SEC requests comments below.
11. Risk Management
The proposed rule would include specific requirements with regard to risk
management functions to qualify a covered person’s incentive-based compensation
arrangement at Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions as compatible with the rule.
Specifically, the proposed rule would require that a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution
have a risk management framework for its incentive-based compensation arrangement
that is independent of any lines of business, includes an independent compliance program
that provides for internal controls, testing, monitoring, and training, with written policies
and procedures consistent with the proposed rules, and is commensurate with the size and
complexity of a covered institution’s operations. Moreover, the proposed rule would
require that covered persons engaged in control functions be provided with the authority
to influence the risk-taking of the business areas they monitor and be compensated in
accordance with the achievement of performance objectives linked to their control
functions and independent of the performance of the business areas they monitor.
Finally, a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution would be required to provide
independent monitoring of all incentive-based compensation plans, events related to

486

forfeiture and downward adjustment and decisions of forfeiture and downward
adjustment reviews, and compliance of the incentive-based compensation program with
the covered institution’s policies and procedures.
The proposed requirements may strengthen the risk management and control
functions of covered BDs and IAs, which could result in lower levels of inappropriate
risk-taking. Academic literature suggests that stronger risk controls in bank holding
companies resulted in lower risk exposure, as evident by lower tail-risk and lower
fraction of non-performing loans; and better performance, as evident by better operating
performance and stock return performance, during the crisis. 450 This study also shows
that the risk management function is stronger for larger banks, banks with larger
derivative trading operations and banks whose CEOs compensation is more closely tied
to stock volatility. Additionally, the study shows that stronger risk function, as measured
by this study, was associated with better firm performance only during crisis years,
whereas the same relation did not hold during non-crisis periods. As such, a strong and
independent risk management function can curtail tail risk exposures at banks and
potentially enhance value, particularly during crisis years. Another study shows that
lenders with a relatively powerful risk manager, as measured by the level of the risk
manager’s compensation relative to the top named executives’ level of compensation,
experienced lower loan default rates. Thus, the evidence in the study seems to suggest
that powerful risk executives curb risk-taking with respect to loan origination. 451

487

It is also possible that the proposed requirements may not have an effect on the
current level of risk-taking at BDs and IAs. For example, if risk-taking is driven by the
culture of the institution, then governance characteristics (including risk management
functions) may reflect the choice of control functions that match the inherent risk-taking
appetite in the institution.452 A potential downside of applying a strict risk management
control function over covered BDs and IAs is that it could lead to decreased risk-taking
and potential loss of value for those BDs and IAs that already employ an optimal risk
management function. For such BDs and IAs, the implementation of the rule
requirements with respect to risk management could result in lower than optimal risktaking by covered persons.
Based on the SEC’s baseline analysis, it appears that all Level 1 parent
institutions and most Level 2 parent institutions (67 percent) of BDs already have an
independent risk management and control function (e.g., a risk committee) and
compensation monitoring function (e.g., a fully independent compensation committee) 453
that could apply the rule requirements. Similarly, all of the Level 1 and Level 2 parent
institutions of IAs have risk committees and substantial portion (80 percent and above)
have fully independent compensation committees. The SEC, however, does not have
information on whether risk committees review and monitor the incentive-based
compensation plans. The SEC’s analysis suggests that there are some Level 1 covered
institutions (30 percent) and Level 2 covered institutions (20 percent) where CROs

review compensation packages.
If BDs and IAs have similar policies as their parent institutions, and the risk
management structure of private institutions is similar to that of public institutions, the
implementation of the proposed rule in its part related to risk management and control is
unlikely to lead to significant compliance costs for the majority of covered BDs and IAs
because, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, a large percentage of the parent
institutions already have fully independent risk committees. Some BDs with Level 2
parent institutions and some IAs with Level 1 and Level 2 parent institutions may face
high compliance costs because their parent institutions currently do not employ risk
management and compensation monitoring practices similar to the one prescribed by the
proposed rule. On the other hand, if the risk management practices of parent institutions
are significantly different from those at their subsidiaries (e.g., BDs and IAs do not have
risk management and control functions), covered BDs and IAs could experience
significant compliance costs when implementing the proposed rule. Since the SEC does
not have data on how many covered IAs have parent institutions, it is also possible that a
significant number of these IAs may be stand-alone companies and therefore could have
higher costs to comply with this specific requirement of the proposed rule compared to
covered IAs and BDs that are part of reporting parent institutions. BDs and IAs could
also incur direct economic costs such as decrease in firm value if the proposed rule
requirements regarding risk management lead to less risk-taking than is optimal. The
same holds true if the risk management and controls of BDs and IAs is generally different
than that of banking institutions, which most of their parent institutions are.
Lastly, because some BDs and IAs are subsidiaries of private parent institutions,

489

if there is a significant difference in the risk management practices of public and private
covered institutions such BDs and IAs could face large compliance costs and direct
economic costs. The SEC does not have data for the risk management and control
functions at subsidiaries of Level 1 or Level 2 parents, and thus cannot quantify the
impact of the rule on those institutions. To better assess the effects of these rule
requirements on compliance costs for BDs and IAs the SEC requests comments below.
The SEC has attempted to quantify the potential compliance costs for BDs and
IAs associated with the proposed rule’s requirements regarding the existence and
structure of compensation committees and risk committees. BDs and IAs that are
currently not in compliance with the proposed committee requirements, either because
such a committee does not exist or because the composition of such committee is not
consistent with the rule requirements, may have to elect additional individuals in order to
either establish the required committees or alter the structure of such committees to be in
compliance with the rule’s requirements. Table 15 provides estimates of the average
annual total compensation of non-employee (i.e. independent) directors for Level 1 and
Level 2 parents of BDs and Level 1 and Level 2 parents of IAs covered by the proposed
rule. 454 Assuming that the cost estimates in the table approximate the compensation
requirements for independent members of compensation and/or risk committees, the
incremental compliance costs of electing an additional non-employee director to comply
with this specific provision of the rule for BDs and IAs that currently do not meet the
rule’s requirements could be approximately $333,086 and $309,513 annually per
independent director for a Level 1 BDs and IAs, respectively, and approximately
454

Data is taken from 2015 proxy statements.

490

$208,009 and $194,563 annually per independent director for unconsolidated Level 2
BDs and IAs, respectively.

and Level 2 covered institutions

The SEC considers these estimates an upper bound of potential costs that BDs and
IAs may incur to comply with these requirements of the proposed rule. It is possible that
some BDs and IAs are able to reshuffle existing personnel in order to comply with the
rule’s requirements (e.g., use existing directors to create a risk committee or fully
independent compensation committee) and as such would not incur any of the costs
described in the analysis.
12. Governance, Policies and Procedures
For Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions, the proposed rule would include
specific corporate governance requirements to support the design and implementation of
compensation arrangements that provide balanced risk-taking incentives to affected
individuals. More specifically, the proposed rule would require the existence of a
compensation committee composed solely of directors who are not senior executive
officers, input from the corresponding risk and audit committees and risk management
on the effectiveness of risk measures and adjustments used to balance incentive-based

491

compensation arrangements, and a written assessment, submitted at least annually to the
compensation committee from the management of the covered institution, regarding the
effectiveness of the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation program and
related compliance and control processes and an independent written assessment of the
effectiveness of the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation program and
related compliance and control processes in providing risk-taking incentives that are
consistent with the risk profile of the covered institution, submitted on an annual or more
frequent basis by the internal audit or risk management function of the covered
institution, developed independently of the covered institution’s management.
The proposed governance requirements would benefit covered BDs and IAs by
further ensuring that the design of compensation arrangements is independent of the
persons receiving compensation under these arrangements, thus curbing potential
conflicts of interest. It could also facilitate the optimal design of compensation
arrangements by incorporating relevant information from committees whose mandate is
risk oversight. For example, by having a fully independent compensation committee that
designs compensation arrangements and a risk committee that reviews those
compensation arrangements to make sure they are consistent with the institution’s
optimal risk policy, a BD or IA may be able to devise compensation arrangements that
provide a better link between pay and performance for covered persons.
Based on the SEC’s baseline analysis, it appears that the majority of Level 1 and
Level 2 covered parent institutions already have a fully independent compensation
committee. The SEC does not have information whether BDs and IAs that are
subsidiaries have compensation committees and boards of directors. In 2012, the SEC

492

adopted rules requiring exchanges to adopt listing standards requiring a board
compensation committee that satisfies independence standards that are more stringent
than those in the proposed rule. 455 Therefore, all covered parent institutions with listed
securities on national exchanges, or any covered BDs and IAs with listed securities,
should have compensation committees that would satisfy the proposed rule’s
compensation committee independence requirements. Thus, this proposed requirement
should place no additional burden on those IAs and BDs that have listed securities on
national exchanges, or have governance structures similar to those of their listed parent
institutions.
For those BDs and IAs that have compensation committees, the SEC does not
have information whether management of the covered BDs and IAs submits to the
compensation committee on an annual or more frequent basis a written assessment of the
effectiveness of the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation program and
related compliance and control processes in providing risk-taking incentives that are
consistent with the risk profile of the covered institution. Additionally, the SEC does not
have information on whether the compensation committee obtains input from the covered
institution’s risk and audit committees, or groups performing similar functions. If
covered BDs and IAs have already instituted similar policies with respect to the proposed
rule’s governance requirements, the SEC does not expect this proposed requirement to
generate significant compliance costs for them.
On the other hand, if covered BDs and IAs’ governance practices are significantly
different (e.g., they do not have independent compensation committees, or the
455

17 CFR Parts 229 and 240.

493

compensation committees do not obtain input from the risk and audit committees), then
covered BDs and IAs could experience significant compliance costs when implementing
the proposed rule. Similarly, for BDs and IAs that do not have securities listed on a
national exchange or have governance structures different from those of their parent
institutions with listed securities, this rule proposal may result in significant costs. Also,
since the SEC does not have data on how many covered IAs have parent institutions, or
whether the IAs themselves or their parents have listed securities, it is also possible that
a significant number of these IAs may be stand-alone companies that do not have
independent compensation committees, and therefore could have higher costs to comply
with the proposed rule compared to covered IAs and BDs that are part of reporting parent
institutions with independent compensation committees. To better assess the effects of
the proposed rule requirement on compliance costs for BDs and IAs, the SEC requests
comments below.
For Level 1 and Level 2 covered BDs and IAs, the proposed rule would require
the development and implementation of policies and procedures relating to its incentivebased compensation programs that would require among other things, specifying the
substantive and procedural criteria for the application of the various policies such as
forfeiture and clawback, identifying and describing the role of employees, committees, or
groups with authority to make incentive-based compensation decisions, and description
of the monitoring mechanism over incentive-based compensation arrangements.
The SEC does not have information about whether covered BDs and IAs have
policies and procedures in place as required by the proposed rule. If BDs and IAs have
already instituted similar policies, the SEC does not expect this rule requirement to

494

generate significant compliance costs for them. On the other hand, if the covered BDs
and IAs do not have such policies and procedures, or if their policies and procedures are
significantly different than what the proposed rule requires, then covered BDs and IAs
could experience significant compliance costs when implementing the proposed rule. To
better assess the effects of these rule requirements on compliance costs for BDs and IAs
the SEC requests comments below.
13. Additional Disclosure and Recordkeeping
All covered institutions would be required to create annually and maintain for a
period of at least 7 years records that document the structure of all incentive-based
compensation arrangements and demonstrate compliance with the proposed rules. Level
1 and Level 2 covered institutions would be required to create annually and maintain for
at least 7 years records that document additional information, such as identification of the
senior executive officers and significant risk-takers within the covered institution, the
incentive-based compensation arrangements of these individuals including deferral
details, and any material changes in incentive-based compensation arrangements and
policies. Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions must create and maintain such records
in a manner that allows for an independent audit of incentive-based compensation
arrangements, policies, and procedures.
The SEC is proposing an amendment to Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(e) 456 and
Investment Advisers Act Rule 204-2 457 to require that registered broker-dealers and
investment advisers maintain the records required by the proposed rule for registered

456
457

17 CFR 240.17a-4(e).
17 CFR 275.204-2.

495

Level 1 and Level 2 broker-dealers and investment advisers, in accordance with the
recordkeeping requirements of Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 and Investment Advisers Act
Rule 204-2, respectively. Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 and Investment Advisers Act Rule
204-2 establish the general formatting and storage requirements for records that
registered broker-dealers and investment advisers are required to keep. For the sake of
consistency with other broker-dealer and investment adviser records, the SEC believes
that registered broker-dealers and investment advisers should also keep the records
required by the proposed rule for registered Level 1 and Level 2 broker-dealers and
investment advisers, in accordance with these requirements.
Such recordkeeping requirements would provide information availability to the
SEC in examining and confirming the design and implementation of compensation
arrangements for a prolonged period of time. This may enhance compliance and facilitate
oversight.
The proposed requirement may increase compliance costs for covered BDs and
IAs. The SEC expects that the magnitude of the compliance costs would depend on
whether covered BDs and IAs are part of reporting companies or not. Most Level 1 and
Level 2 BDs are subsidiaries of reporting parent institutions. Reporting covered
institutions provide compensation and disclosure analysis and compensation tables for
their named executive officers in their annual reports, and disclose the incentive-based
compensation arrangements for named executive officers in the annual proxy statement.
In addition, reporting companies have to make an assessment each year whether they
need to make Item 402(s) disclosure, which, among other things includes disclosure of
compensation policies and practices that present material risks to the company and the
496

board of directors’ role in risk oversight. Thus, given that reporting covered institutions
create certain records and provide certain disclosures for their annual reports and proxy
statements and for internal purposes (e.g., for reports to the board of directors or the
compensation committee) that are similar to those required by the proposed rule, the BDs
and IAs that are subsidiaries of such parent institutions may experience lower disclosure
and recordkeeping compared to BDs and IAs of non-reporting parent institutions or
institutions that do not provide such disclosures. Even BDs and IAs of reporting
companies, however, would have to incur costs associated with disclosure and
recordkeeping of information required by the proposed rule that currently is not disclosed
by their parent institutions, such as identification of significant risk-takers details on
deferral of incentive-based compensation. The SEC also notes that because it does not
have information on the compensation reporting and recordkeeping at the subsidiary
level, the SEC may be underestimating compliance costs for BDs with reporting parent
institutions. For example, even if the parent institution reports and keeps records of the
incentive-based compensation arrangements, this might not be done on the same scale
and detail at the subsidiary level.
The compliance costs associated with this particular rule requirement may be
higher for non-reporting covered institutions, since they may not be disclosing such
information and as such may not be keeping the type of records required. However,
according to 2010 Federal Banking Agency Guidance, a banking institution should
provide an appropriate amount of information concerning its incentive compensation
arrangements for executive and non-executive employees and related risk-management,
control, and governance processes to shareholders to allow them to monitor and, where

497

appropriate, take actions to restrain the potential for such arrangements and processes to
encourage employees to take imprudent risks. Such disclosures should include
information relevant to employees other than senior executives. The scope and level of
the information disclosed by the institution should be tailored to the nature and
complexity of the institution and its incentive-based compensation arrangements. The
SEC expects the compliance costs to be lower for such covered institutions. Since the
SEC does not have data on how many covered IAs have parent institutions, it is also
possible that a significant number of these IAs may be stand-alone companies and
therefore could have higher costs to comply with this specific requirement of the
proposed rule compared to covered IAs and BDs that are part of reporting parent
institutions.
By requiring Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions to create and maintain
records of incentive-based compensation arrangements for covered persons, the proposed
recordkeeping requirement is expected to facilitate the SEC’s ability to monitor
incentive-based compensation arrangements and could potentially strengthen incentives
for covered institutions to comply with the proposed rule. As a consequence, an increase
in investor confidence that covered institutions are less likely to be incentivizing
inappropriate actions through compensation arrangements may occur and potentially
result to greater market participation and allocative efficiency, thereby potentially
facilitating capital formation. As discussed above, it is difficult for the SEC to estimate
compliance costs related to the specific provision. However, for covered institutions that
do not currently have a similar reporting system in place, there could be significant fixed
costs that could disproportionately burden smaller covered BDs and IAs and hinder

498

competition. Overall, the SEC does not expect that the effects of the proposed
recordkeeping requirements on efficiency, competition and capital formation to be
significant.
H. Request for Comment
The SEC requests comments regarding its analysis of the potential economic
effects of the proposed rule. With regard to any comments, the SEC notes that such
comments are of particular assistance to the SEC if accompanied by supporting data and
analysis of the issues addressed in those comments. For example, the SEC is interested
in receiving estimates, data, or analyses on incentive-based compensation at BDs and IAs
for all aspects of the proposed rule, including thresholds, on the overall economic impact
of the proposed rule, and on any other aspect of this economic analysis. The SEC also is
interested in comments on the benefits and costs it has identified and any benefits and
costs it may have overlooked.
1. In the SEC’s baseline analysis, the SEC uses data from publicly held covered
institutions as a proxy for incentive-based compensation arrangements at privately
held institutions. The SEC requests comment on the validity of the assumption
that privately held institutions employ similar compensation practices to publicly
held institutions. The SEC also requests data or analysis with respect to
incentive-based compensation arrangements of covered persons at privately held
covered institutions.
2. The SEC does not have comprehensive data on incentive-based compensation
arrangements for affected individuals, other than those senior executive officers
who are named executive officers (NEOs) and some significant risk-takers, for

499

either public or privately held covered institutions. The SEC requests data or
analysis related to compensation practices of all senior executive officers and
significant risk-takers at covered BDs and IAs as defined in the proposed rule.
3. The SEC uses incentive-based compensation arrangements of NEOs at the parent
level as a proxy for incentive-based compensation arrangements of covered
persons at covered BDs and IAs that are subsidiaries. The SEC requests comment
on the validity of the assumption that incentive-based compensation arrangements
for senior executive officers at the parent level is similar to incentive-based
compensation arrangements followed at the subsidiary level for other senior
executive officers or for significant risk-takers. The SEC also requests any data
or related analysis on this issue.
4. Are the economic effects with respect to the asset thresholds ($50 billion and
$250 billion) utilized to scale the proposed requirements for covered BDs and IAs
adequately outlined in the analysis? The SEC also invites comment on the
economic consequences of any alternative asset thresholds, as well as economic
consequences of potential alternative measures.
5. The proposed consolidation approach would impose restrictions on covered
persons’ incentive-based compensation arrangements in BDs and IAs that are
subsidiaries of depositary institution holding companies based on the size of their
parent institution. Are the economic effects from the proposed consolidation
approach adequately described in the analysis? Are there specific circumstances,
such as certain organizational structures, that would deem such a consolidation
approach more or less effective?

500

6. Are there additional effects with respect to the proposed definition of significant
risk-takers to be considered? Are there alternative ways to identify significant
risk-takers and what would be the economic consequences of alternative ways to
identify significant risk-takers?
7. Are the economic effects on the proposed minimum deferral periods and the
proposed minimum deferral percentage amounts adequately described in the
analysis? What would be the economic effects of any alternative? The SEC also
requests literature or evidence regarding the length and amount of deferral of
incentive-based compensation that would lead to incentive-based compensation
arrangements that best address the underlying risks at covered institutions.
8.

Are the economic effects from the proposed vesting schedule for deferred
incentive-based compensation adequately described in the analysis? What would
be the economic effects from any alternatives?

9. Are there additional economic effects to be considered from the proposed
prohibition of increasing a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker’s
unvested deferred incentive-based compensation? What would be the economic
effects of any alternatives?
10. The proposed rule would require deferred qualifying incentive-based
compensation to be composed of substantial amounts of both deferred cash and
equity-like instruments for covered persons. Are the economic effects of the
proposed rule adequately described in the analysis? Would explicitly specifying
the mix between cash and equity-like instruments to be included in the deferral
amount be preferred? What would be the economic effects of such an alternative?

501

Are there additional alternatives to be considered?
11. For senior executive officers and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions, the total amount of options that may be used to meet the
minimum deferral amount requirements is limited to no more than 15 percent of
the amount of total incentive-based compensation awarded for a given
performance period. Indirectly, this policy choice would place a cap on the
amount of options that covered BDs and IAs may provide to affected persons as
part of their incentive-based compensation arrangement. Are the economic
effects of the provision adequately described in the analysis? What would be the
economic effects from any alternatives?
12. Are the triggers for forfeiture or downward adjustment review effective for both
senior executive officers and significant risk-takers? Are some of the triggers
more effective for significant risk-takers while others are more effective for senior
executive officers? What other triggers would be effective for forfeiture or
downward adjustment review?
13. Are the economic effects from the 125 percent (150 percent) limit on the amount
by which incentive-based compensation may exceed the target amount for senior
executive officers (significant risk-takers) at covered BDs and IAs adequately
described in the analysis? Are there alternatives to be considered? What would
be the economic effect of such alternatives?
14. Are the economic effects regarding the prohibition of the sole use of industry peer
performance benchmarks for incentive-based compensation performance
measurement adequately described in the analysis? The SEC also requests data

502

on relative performance measures used by covered BDs and IAs and/or related
analysis that may further inform this policy choice.
15. The SEC requests any relevant data or analysis regarding the potential effect of
the proposed rule on the ability of covered BDs and IAs to attract and retain
managerial talent.
16. In general, are there alternative courses of action to be considered that would
enhance accountability and limit the potential for inappropriate risk-taking by
covered persons at BDs and IAs? What would be the economic effects of such
alternatives? Are there specific circumstances, such as certain types of
shareholders and other stakeholders, that would make these alternative approaches
more or less effective? For example, should such alternative approaches
distinguish between the effects on short-term shareholders and the effects on
long-term shareholders?
17. In recent years, several foreign regulators have implemented regulations
concerning incentive-based compensation similar to those in the proposed rule.
The SEC requests data or analysis regarding the economic effects of those
regulations and whether they are similar to or different from the likely economic
effects of the proposed rule.
J. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996
(“SBREFA”) 458 the SEC must advise the OMB whether the proposed regulation

458

Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996) (codified in various sections of 5 U.S.C.
and 15 U.S.C. and as a note to 5 U.S.C. 601).

503

constitutes a “major” rule. Under SBREFA, a rule is considered “major” where, if
adopted, it results or is likely to result in: (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100
million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual
industries; or (3) significant adverse effect on competition, investment or innovation.
The SEC requests comment on the potential impact of the proposed amendment
on the economy on an annual basis. Commenters are requested to provide empirical data
and other factual support for their views to the extent possible.

5641.
§ 42.1 Authority, scope and initial applicability.
(a) Authority. This part is issued pursuant to section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 5641), sections 8 and 39
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818 and 1831p-1), sections 3, 4,

506

and 5 of the Home Owners’ Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1462a, 1463, and 1464), and
section 5239A of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 93a).
(b) Scope. This part applies to a covered institution with average total consolidated
assets greater than or equal to $1 billion that offers incentive-based compensation
to covered persons.
(c) Initial applicability.
(1) Compliance date. A covered institution must meet the requirements of this
part no later than [Date of the beginning of the first calendar quarter that
begins at least 540 days after a final rule is published in the Federal Register].
Whether a covered institution is a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered
institution at that time will be determined based on average total consolidated
assets as of [Date of the beginning of the first calendar quarter that begins
after a final rule is published in the Federal Register].
(2) Grandfathered plans. A covered institution is not required to comply with the
requirements of this part with respect to any incentive-based compensation
plan with a performance period that begins before [Compliance Date as
described in § 42.1(c)(1)].
(d) Preservation of authority. Nothing in this part in any way limits the authority of
the OCC under other provisions of applicable law and regulations.
§ 42.2 Definitions.
For purposes of this part only, the following definitions apply unless otherwise specified:

507

(a) Affiliate means any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common
control with another company.
(b) Average total consolidated assets means the average of the total consolidated
assets of a national bank; a Federal savings association; a Federal branch or
agency of a foreign bank; a subsidiary of a national bank, Federal savings
association, or Federal branch or agency; or a depository institution holding
company, as reported on the national bank’s, Federal savings association’s,
Federal branch or agency’s, subsidiary’s, or depository institution holding
company’s regulatory reports, for the four most recent consecutive quarters. If a
national bank, Federal savings association, Federal branch or agency, subsidiary,
or depository institution holding company has not filed a regulatory report for
each of the four most recent consecutive quarters, the national bank, Federal
savings association, Federal branch or agency, subsidiary, or depository
institution holding company’s average total consolidated assets means the average
of its total consolidated assets, as reported on its regulatory reports, for the most
recent quarter or consecutive quarters, as applicable. Average total consolidated
assets are measured on the as-of date of the most recent regulatory report used in
the calculation of the average.
(c) To award incentive-based compensation means to make a final determination,
conveyed to a covered person, of the amount of incentive-based compensation
payable to the covered person for performance over a performance period.
(d) Board of directors means the governing body of a covered institution that
oversees the activities of the covered institution, often referred to as the board of
508

directors or board of managers. For a Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank,
“board of directors” refers to the relevant oversight body for the Federal branch or
agency, consistent with its overall corporate and management structure.
(e) Clawback means a mechanism by which a covered institution can recover vested
incentive-based compensation from a covered person.
(f) Compensation, fees, or benefits means all direct and indirect payments, both cash
and non-cash, awarded to, granted to, or earned by or for the benefit of, any
covered person in exchange for services rendered to a covered institution.
(g) Control means that any company has control over a bank or over any company
if—
(1) The company directly or indirectly or acting through one or more other
persons owns, controls, or has power to vote 25 percent or more of any class
of voting securities of the bank or company;
(2) The company controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors
or trustees of the bank or company; or
(3) The OCC determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the
company directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the
management or policies of the bank or company.
(h) Control function means a compliance, risk management, internal audit, legal,
human resources, accounting, financial reporting, or finance role responsible for
identifying, measuring, monitoring, or controlling risk-taking.
(i) Covered institution means:
509

(1) A national bank, Federal savings association, or Federal branch or agency of a
foreign bank with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $1
billion; and
(2) A subsidiary of a national bank, Federal savings association, or Federal branch
or agency of a foreign bank that:
(i) Is not a broker, dealer, person providing insurance, investment company, or
investment adviser; and

or
(2) That could lead to material financial loss to the covered institution.

performance, including considerations of risk-taking, that are relevant to a
covered person’s role within a covered institution and to the type of business
in which the covered person is engaged and that are appropriately weighted to
reflect risk-taking;
(2) The arrangement is designed to allow non-financial measures of performance
to override financial measures of performance when appropriate in
determining incentive-based compensation; and

to reflect actual losses, inappropriate risks taken, compliance deficiencies, or
other measures or aspects of financial and non-financial performance.

OCC determines that the Level 3 covered institution’s complexity of operations or
compensation practices are consistent with those of a Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institution.
(b) Factors considered. Any exercise of authority under this section will be in writing
by the OCC in accordance with procedures established by the OCC and will

526

Applicability.

(a) When average total consolidated assets increase.
(1) In general. A regulated institution shall become a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3
covered institution when its average total consolidated assets or the average
total consolidated assets of any affiliate of the regulated institution equals or

institution, respectively. Until that day, the Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3
covered institution will remain subject to the requirements of this part, if any,
that applied to the regulated institution on the day before the date on which it
became a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered institution.

reported on the covered institution’s regulatory reports, fall below $250 billion,
$50 billion, or $1 billion, respectively, for each of four consecutive quarters. The
calculation will be effective on the as-of date of the fourth consecutive regulatory
report.
(c) Compliance of covered institutions that are subsidiaries of covered institutions. A
covered institution that is a subsidiary of another covered institution may meet

requirement.
§ 236.4

Requirements and prohibitions applicable to all covered institutions.

(a) In general. A covered institution must not establish or maintain any type of

arrangement, that encourages inappropriate risks by the covered institution:
(1) By providing a covered person with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits;
or
555

(2) That could lead to material financial loss to the covered institution.
(b) Excessive compensation. Compensation, fees, and benefits are considered
excessive for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section when amounts paid are

covered person, taking into consideration all relevant factors, including, but not
limited to:
(1) The combined value of all compensation, fees, or benefits provided to the
covered person;
(2) The compensation history of the covered person and other individuals with
comparable expertise at the covered institution;

financial loss to the covered institution, unless the arrangement:
556

(1) Appropriately balances risk and reward;
(2) Is compatible with effective risk management and controls; and
(3) Is supported by effective governance.

(d) Performance measures. An incentive-based compensation arrangement will not be
considered to appropriately balance risk and reward for purposes of paragraph
(c)(1) of this section unless:

(1) The arrangement includes financial and non-financial measures of
performance, including considerations of risk-taking, that are relevant to a
covered person’s role within a covered institution and to the type of business
in which the covered person is engaged and that are appropriately weighted to
reflect risk-taking;
(2) The arrangement is designed to allow non-financial measures of performance
to override financial measures of performance when appropriate in
determining incentive-based compensation; and
(3) Any amounts to be awarded under the arrangement are subject to adjustment
to reflect actual losses, inappropriate risks taken, compliance deficiencies, or
other measures or aspects of financial and non-financial performance.
(e) Board of directors. A covered institution’s board of directors, or a committee
thereof, must:
(1) Conduct oversight of the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation
program;

annually and maintain for a period of at least seven years records that document
the structure of all its incentive-based compensation arrangements and
demonstrate compliance with this part. A covered institution must disclose the
records to the Board upon request. At a minimum, the records must include copies
of all incentive-based compensation plans, a record of who is subject to each plan,
and a description of how the incentive-based compensation program is compatible

(3) Is supported by effective governance.

(d) Performance measures. An incentive-based compensation arrangement will not be
considered to appropriately balance risk and reward for purposes of paragraph
(c)(1) of this section unless:

performance, including considerations of risk-taking, that are relevant to a
covered person’s role within a covered institution and to the type of business

592

in which the covered person is engaged and that are appropriately weighted to
reflect risk-taking;
(2) The arrangement is designed to allow non-financial measures of performance
to override financial measures of performance when appropriate in
determining incentive-based compensation; and

to reflect actual losses, inappropriate risks taken, compliance deficiencies, or
other measures or aspects of financial and non-financial performance.

total consolidated assets increase to an amount that equals or exceeds $250
billion, $50 billion, or $1 billion, respectively.
(2) Compliance date. A regulated institution that becomes a Level 1, Level 2, or
Level 3 covered institution pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall
comply with the requirements of this part for a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3
covered institution, respectively, not later than the first day of the first
calendar quarter that begins at least 540 days after the date on which the
regulated institution becomes a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 covered

respectively, for each of four consecutive quarters. A Federal Home Loan Bank
will remain subject to the requirements of a Level 2 covered institution under this
part unless and until the total consolidated assets of the Federal Home Loan Bank,
as reported on the Federal Home Loan Bank’s regulatory reports, fall below $1
billion for each of four consecutive quarters. The calculation will be effective on

§ 1232.4

Requirements and prohibitions applicable to all covered institutions.

(a) In general. A covered institution must not establish or maintain any type of
incentive-based compensation arrangement, or any feature of any such
arrangement, that encourages inappropriate risks by the covered institution:
(1) By providing a covered person with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits;
or
(2) That could lead to material financial loss to the covered institution.
(b) Excessive compensation. Compensation, fees, and benefits are considered
excessive for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section when amounts paid are

620

unreasonable or disproportionate to the value of the services performed by a
covered person, taking into consideration all relevant factors, including, but not
limited to:
(1) The combined value of all compensation, fees, or benefits provided to the
covered person;
(2) The compensation history of the covered person and other individuals with
comparable expertise at the covered institution;
(3) The financial condition of the covered institution;
(4) Compensation practices at comparable institutions, based upon such factors as
asset size, geographic location, and the complexity of the covered institution’s
operations and assets;

covered institution encourages inappropriate risks that could lead to material
financial loss to the covered institution, unless the arrangement:
(1) Appropriately balances risk and reward;
(2) Is compatible with effective risk management and controls; and

621

(3) Is supported by effective governance.

(d) Performance measures. An incentive-based compensation arrangement will not be
considered to appropriately balance risk and reward for purposes of paragraph
(c)(1) of this section unless:

(1) The arrangement includes financial and non-financial measures of
performance, including considerations of risk-taking, that are relevant to a
covered person’s role within a covered institution and to the type of business
in which the covered person is engaged and that are appropriately weighted to
reflect risk-taking;
(2) The arrangement is designed to allow non-financial measures of performance
to override financial measures of performance when appropriate in
determining incentive-based compensation; and
(3) Any amounts to be awarded under the arrangement are subject to adjustment
to reflect actual losses, inappropriate risks taken, compliance deficiencies, or
other measures or aspects of financial and non-financial performance.
(e) Board of directors. A covered institution’s board of directors, or a committee
thereof, must:
(1) Conduct oversight of the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation
program;

622

(2) Approve incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive
officers, including the amounts of all awards and, at the time of vesting,
payouts under such arrangements; and
(3) Approve any material exceptions or adjustments to incentive-based
compensation policies or arrangements for senior executive officers.
(f) Disclosure and recordkeeping requirements. A covered institution must create
annually and maintain for a period of at least seven years records that document
the structure of all its incentive-based compensation arrangements and
demonstrate compliance with this part. A covered institution must disclose the
records to the Federal Housing Finance Agency upon request. At a minimum, the
records must include copies of all incentive-based compensation plans, a record of
who is subject to each plan, and a description of how the incentive-based
compensation program is compatible with effective risk management and
controls.
(g) Rule of construction. A covered institution is not required to report the actual
amount of compensation, fees, or benefits of individual covered persons as part of
the disclosure and recordkeeping requirements under this part, though it may be
required to do so under other applicable regulations of the Federal Housing
Finance Agency.
§ 1232.5

Additional disclosure and recordkeeping requirements for Level 1

and Level 2 covered institutions.
(a) A Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution must create annually and maintain for a
period of at least seven years records that document:
623

(1) The covered institution’s senior executive officers and significant risk-takers,
listed by legal entity, job function, organizational hierarchy, and line of
business;

institution with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $10
billion and less than $50 billion to comply with some or all of the provisions of §§
1232.5 and 1232.7 through 1232.11 if the Federal Housing Finance Agency
determines that the Level 3 covered institution’s complexity of operations or
624

compensation practices are consistent with those of a Level 1 or Level 2 covered
institution.
(b) Factors considered. Any exercise of authority under this section will be in writing
by the Federal Housing Finance Agency in accordance with procedures
established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency and will consider the
activities, complexity of operations, risk profile, and compensation practices of
the Level 3 covered institution, in addition to any other relevant factors.

forfeiture and downward adjustment review set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of
this section.
(4) Determining forfeiture and downward adjustment amounts. A Level 1 or
Level 2 covered institution must consider, at a minimum, the following factors
when determining the amount or portion of a senior executive officer’s or
significant risk-taker’s incentive-based compensation that should be forfeited

senior executive officer or significant risk-taker engaged in:

632

(1) Misconduct that resulted in significant financial or reputational harm to the
covered institution;
(2) Fraud; or
(3) Intentional misrepresentation of information used to determine the senior

§ 751. 4

Requirements and prohibitions applicable to all credit unions subject to

this part.
(a) In general. A credit union must not establish or maintain any type of incentivebased compensation arrangement, or any feature of any such arrangement, that
encourages inappropriate risks by the credit union:
(1) By providing a covered person with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits;
or
(2) That could lead to material financial loss to the credit union.
(b) Excessive compensation. Compensation, fees, and benefits are considered
excessive for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section when amounts paid are
unreasonable or disproportionate to the value of the services performed by a
covered person, taking into consideration all relevant factors, including, but not

649

(1) The combined value of all compensation, fees, or benefits provided to the
covered person;
(2) The compensation history of the covered person and other individuals with
comparable expertise at the credit union;

union; and
(6) Any connection between the covered person and any fraudulent act or
omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, or insider abuse with regard to the
credit union.
(c) Material financial loss. An incentive-based compensation arrangement at a credit
union encourages inappropriate risks that could lead to material financial loss to
the credit union, unless the arrangement:
(1) Appropriately balances risk and reward;
(2) Is compatible with effective risk management and controls; and
(3) Is supported by effective governance.

650

(d) Performance measures. An incentive-based compensation arrangement will not be
considered to appropriately balance risk and reward for purposes of paragraph
(c)(1) of this section unless:

(1) The arrangement includes financial and non-financial measures of
performance, including considerations of risk-taking, that are relevant to a
covered person’s role within a credit union and to the type of business in
which the covered person is engaged and that are appropriately weighted to
reflect risk-taking;
(2) The arrangement is designed to allow non-financial measures of performance
to override financial measures of performance when appropriate in
determining incentive-based compensation; and
(3) Any amounts to be awarded under the arrangement are subject to adjustment
to reflect actual losses, inappropriate risks taken, compliance deficiencies, or
other measures or aspects of financial and non-financial performance.
(e) Board of directors. A credit union’s board of directors, or a committee thereof,
must:
(1) Conduct oversight of the credit union’s incentive-based compensation
program;
(2) Approve incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive
officers, including the amounts of all awards and, at the time of vesting,
payouts under such arrangements; and

651

(3) Approve any material exceptions or adjustments to incentive-based
compensation policies or arrangements for senior executive officers.

compliance with this part. A credit union must disclose the records to NCUA
upon request. At a minimum, the records must include copies of all incentivebased compensation plans, a record of who is subject to each plan, and a
description of how the incentive-based compensation program is compatible with
effective risk management and controls.

compensation, fees, or benefits of individual covered persons as part of the
disclosure and recordkeeping requirements under this part.

and Level 2 credit unions.
(a) A Level 1 or Level 2 credit union must create annually and maintain for a period
of at least seven years records that document:
(1) The credit union’s senior executive officers and significant risk-takers, listed
by legal entity, job function, organizational hierarchy, and line of business;
(2) The incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive officers
and significant risk-takers, including information on percentage of incentivebased compensation deferred and form of award;

652

(3) Any forfeiture and downward adjustment or clawback reviews and decisions
for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers; and
(4) Any material changes to the credit union’s incentive-based compensation
arrangements and policies.

consolidated assets greater than or equal to $10 billion and less than $50 billion to
comply with some or all of the provisions of §§ 751.5 and 751.7 through 751.11 if
NCUA determines that the Level 3 credit union’s complexity of operations or
compensation practices are consistent with those of a Level 1 or Level 2 credit
union.
(b) Factors considered. Any exercise of authority under this section will be in writing
by the NCUA Board in accordance with procedures established by the NCUA
Board and will consider the activities, complexity of operations, risk profile, and
compensation practices of the Level 3 credit union, in addition to any other
relevant factors.

credit union;
(2) Fraud; or
(3) Intentional misrepresentation of information used to determine the senior
executive officer or significant risk-taker’s incentive-based compensation.
§ 751.8

§ 303.4

Requirements and prohibitions applicable to all covered institutions.

(a) In general. A covered institution must not establish or maintain any type of
incentive-based compensation arrangement, or any feature of any such
arrangement, that encourages inappropriate risks by the covered institution:
(1) By providing a covered person with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits;
or
(2) That could lead to material financial loss to the covered institution.
(b) Excessive compensation. Compensation, fees, and benefits are considered
excessive for purposes of § 303.4(a)(1) when amounts paid are unreasonable or
681

disproportionate to the value of the services performed by a covered person,
taking into consideration all relevant factors, including, but not limited to:
(1) The combined value of all compensation, fees, or benefits provided to the
covered person;
(2) The compensation history of the covered person and other individuals with
comparable expertise at the covered institution;
(3) The financial condition of the covered institution;
(4) Compensation practices at comparable institutions, based upon such factors as
asset size, geographic location, and the complexity of the covered institution’s
operations and assets;
(5) For post-employment benefits, the projected total cost and benefit to the
covered institution; and
(6) Any connection between the covered person and any fraudulent act or
omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, or insider abuse with regard to the
covered institution.
(c) Material financial loss. An incentive-based compensation arrangement at a
covered institution encourages inappropriate risks that could lead to material
financial loss to the covered institution, unless the arrangement:
(1) Appropriately balances risk and reward;
(2) Is compatible with effective risk management and controls; and
(3) Is supported by effective governance.

682

(d) Performance measures. An incentive-based compensation arrangement will not be
considered to appropriately balance risk and reward for purposes of paragraph
(c)(1) of this section, unless:

(1) The arrangement includes financial and non-financial measures of
performance, including considerations of risk-taking, that are relevant to a
covered person’s role within a covered institution and to the type of business
in which the covered person is engaged and that are appropriately weighted to
reflect risk-taking;
(2) The arrangement is designed to allow non-financial measures of performance
to override financial measures of performance when appropriate in
determining incentive-based compensation; and
(3) Any amounts to be awarded under the arrangement are subject to adjustment
to reflect actual losses, inappropriate risks taken, compliance deficiencies, or
other measures or aspects of financial and non-financial performance.
(e) Board of directors. A covered institution’s board of directors, or a committee
thereof, must:
(1) Conduct oversight of the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation
program;
(2) Approve incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive
officers, including the amounts of all awards and, at the time of vesting,
payouts under such arrangements; and

683

(3) Approve any material exceptions or adjustments to incentive-based
compensation policies or arrangements for senior executive officers.
(f) Disclosure and recordkeeping requirements. A covered institution must create
annually and maintain for a period of at least seven years records that document
the structure of all its incentive-based compensation arrangements and
demonstrate compliance with this subpart. A covered institution must disclose the
records to the Commission upon request. At a minimum, the records must include
copies of all incentive-based compensation plans, a record of who is subject to
each plan, and a description of how the incentive-based compensation program is
compatible with effective risk management and controls.
(g) Rule of construction. A covered institution is not required to report the actual
amount of compensation, fees, or benefits of individual covered persons as part of
the disclosure and recordkeeping requirements under this subpart.
§ 303.5

Additional disclosure and recordkeeping requirements for Level 1

and Level 2 covered institutions.
(a) A Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution must create annually and maintain for a
period of at least seven years records that document:
(1) The covered institution’s senior executive officers and significant risk-takers,
listed by legal entity, job function, organizational hierarchy, and line of
business;

684

(2) The incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive officers
and significant risk-takers, including information on percentage of incentivebased compensation deferred and form of award;
(3) Any forfeiture and downward adjustment or clawback reviews and decisions
for senior executive officers and significant risk-takers; and
(4) Any material changes to the covered institution’s incentive-based
compensation arrangements and policies.

average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $10 billion and less than
$50 billion to comply with some or all of the provisions of §§ 303.5 and 303.7
through 303.11 if the Commission determines that the Level 3 covered
institution’s complexity of operations or compensation practices are consistent
with those of a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution.
(b) Factors considered. Any exercise of authority under this section will be in writing
by the Commission in accordance with procedures established by the Commission

685

and will consider the activities, complexity of operations, risk profile, and
compensation practices of the Level 3 covered institution, in addition to any other
relevant factors.

§ 303.7

Deferral, forfeiture and downward adjustment, and clawback

requirements for Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions.

significant risk-taker’s qualifying incentive-based compensation
awarded for each performance period.

executive officer’s qualifying incentive-based compensation awarded
for each performance period.

686

(D) A Level 2 covered institution must defer at least 40 percent of a
significant risk-taker’s qualifying incentive-based compensation
awarded for each performance period.
(ii) Minimum required deferral period.
(A) For a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker of a Level 1
covered institution, the deferral period for deferred qualifying
incentive-based compensation must be at least 4 years.
(B) For a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker of a Level 2
covered institution, the deferral period for deferred qualifying
incentive-based compensation must be at least 3 years.
(iii)Vesting of amounts during deferral period.
(A)

Pro rata vesting. During a deferral period, deferred qualifying

incentive-based compensation may not vest faster than on a pro rata
annual basis beginning no earlier than the first anniversary of the end of
the performance period for which the amounts were awarded.
(B)

Acceleration of vesting. A Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution

must not accelerate the vesting of a covered person’s deferred qualifying
incentive-based compensation that is required to be deferred under this
subpart, except in the case of death or disability of such covered person.
(2) Incentive-based compensation awarded under a long-term incentive plan must
be deferred as follows:
(i) Minimum required deferral amount.
687

(A) A Level 1 covered institution must defer at least 60 percent of a senior
executive officer’s incentive-based compensation awarded under a
long-term incentive plan for each performance period.
(B) A Level 1 covered institution must defer at least 50 percent of a
significant risk-taker’s incentive-based compensation awarded under a
long-term incentive plan for each performance period.
(C) A Level 2 covered institution must defer at least 50 percent of a senior
executive officer’s incentive-based compensation awarded under a
long-term incentive plan for each performance period.
(D) A Level 2 covered institution must defer at least 40 percent of a
significant risk-taker’s incentive-based compensation awarded under a
long-term incentive plan for each performance period.
(ii) Minimum required deferral period.
(A) For a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker of a Level 1
covered institution, the deferral period for deferred long-term incentive
plan amounts must be at least 2 years.
(B) For a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker of a Level 2
covered institution, the deferral period for deferred long-term incentive
plan amounts must be at least 1 year.
(iii)Vesting of amounts during deferral period.
(A)

Pro rata vesting. During a deferral period, deferred long-term

incentive plan amounts may not vest faster than on a pro rata annual basis
688

beginning no earlier than the first anniversary of the end of the
performance period for which amounts were awarded.
(B)

Acceleration of vesting. A Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution

must not accelerate the vesting of a covered person’s deferred long-term
incentive plan amounts that is required to be deferred under this subpart,
except in the case of death or disability of such covered person.

deferred long-term incentive plan compensation amounts. A Level 1 or Level
2 covered institution may not increase deferred qualifying incentive-based
compensation or deferred long-term incentive plan amounts for a senior
executive officer or significant risk-taker during the deferral period. For
purposes of this paragraph, an increase in value attributable solely to a change
in share value, a change in interest rates, or the payment of interest according
to terms set out at the time of the award is not considered an increase in
incentive-based compensation amounts.
(4) Composition of deferred qualifying incentive-based compensation and
deferred long-term incentive plan compensation for Level 1 and Level 2
covered institutions.

deferred qualifying incentive-based compensation or deferred long-term

689

incentive plan amounts must include substantial portions of both deferred
cash and equity-like instruments throughout the deferral period.
(ii) Options. If a senior executive officer or significant risk-taker of a Level 1
or Level 2 covered institution receives incentive-based compensation for a
performance period in the form of options, the total amount of such
options that may be used to meet the minimum deferral amount
requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) of this section is limited to
no more than 15 percent of the amount of total incentive-based
compensation awarded to the senior executive officer or significant risktaker for that performance period.
(b) Forfeiture and downward adjustment.

unvested deferred incentive-based compensation of any senior executive
officer or significant risk-taker, including unvested deferred amounts
awarded under long-term incentive plans.
(ii) A Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution must place at risk of downward
adjustment all of a senior executive officer’s or significant risk-taker’s
incentive-based compensation amounts not yet awarded for the current
performance period, including amounts payable under long-term incentive
plans.

690

(2) Events triggering forfeiture and downward adjustment review. At a minimum,
a Level 1 or Level 2 covered institution must consider forfeiture and
downward adjustment of incentive-based compensation of senior executive
officers and significant risk-takers described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section

significant risk-taker with direct responsibility, or responsibility due to the
senior executive officer’s or significant risk-taker’s role or position in the
covered institution’s organizational structure, for the events related to the
forfeiture and downward adjustment review set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of
this section.
(4) Determining forfeiture and downward adjustment amounts. A Level 1 or
Level 2 covered institution must consider, at a minimum, the following factors
when determining the amount or portion of a senior executive officer’s or
significant risk-taker’s incentive-based compensation that should be forfeited
or adjusted downward:
(i) The intent of the senior executive officer or significant risk-taker to
operate outside the risk governance framework approved by the covered
institution’s board of directors or to depart from the covered institution’s
policies and procedures;
(ii) The senior executive officer’s or significant risk-taker’s level of
participation in, awareness of, and responsibility for, the events triggering
the forfeiture and downward adjustment review set forth in paragraph
(b)(2) of this section;
(iii)Any actions the senior executive officer or significant risk-taker took or
could have taken to prevent the events triggering the forfeiture and
downward adjustment review set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;

provisions in incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive
officers and significant risk-takers that, at a minimum, allow the covered
institution to recover incentive-based compensation from a current or former
senior executive officer or significant risk-taker for seven years following the date
on which such compensation vests, if the covered institution determines that the
senior executive officer or significant risk-taker engaged in:
(1) Misconduct that resulted in significant financial or reputational harm to the
covered institution;
(2) Fraud; or

693

(3) Intentional misrepresentation of information used to determine the senior
executive officer or significant risk-taker’s incentive-based compensation.
§ 303.8
