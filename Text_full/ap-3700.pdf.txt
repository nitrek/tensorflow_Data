MOTION TO COMMISSION FOR
EXTENSION

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) on June 16, 2015, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of
1933. The OIP alleges that Equity Trust Company, a custodian of self-directed individual
retirement accounts, was a cause of violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities
Act by two individuals. OIP at 1, 12. Eight days of hearing concluded on December 10, 2015.
The record consists of almost 2,000 pages of transcript and over a thousand exhibits. The final
briefs were submitted on February 29, 2016. The due date for issuance of an initial decision is
April 15, 2016.
Rule of Practice 360(a)(3) provides that the Chief Administrative Law Judge may submit
to the Commission, at least thirty days in advance of the due date, a motion requesting an
extension of the time period for filing an initial decision where she determines that it will not be
possible to issue the initial decision in the time specified.
The presiding administrative law judge has advised me that because of the complex
issues to be resolved and the magnitude of the record, it would be best if she had additional time
to craft the initial decision. I have concluded that her request is both reasonable and necessary
and have directed that the assigned law clerk make assisting the presiding administrative law
judge his primary activity for the next several months.
For the reasons stated, I request that the Commission extend the due date for issuance of
the initial decision to June 29, 2016.
