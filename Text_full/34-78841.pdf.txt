In the Matter of
EXTENSION ORDER
JOSEPH J. FOX

On June 10, 2016, the Commission received a petition for review of an initial decision of
an administrative law judge by Joseph J. Fox (“Respondent”). On June 30, 2016, the
Commission issued an Order Granting Petition for Review and Scheduling Briefs, in which the
Commission ordered, pursuant to Rule of Practice 450(a), that a brief in support of the petition for
review be filed by August 1, 2016, a brief in opposition be filed by August 31, 2016, and any reply
brief be filed by September 14, 2016. On September 12, 2016, Respondent filed a motion for a
7-day extension to file his reply brief.
Extensions of time are disfavored. It appears appropriate, however, to grant the requested
extension. Therefore,
It is ORDERED that the time for the Respondent to file his reply brief for the petition for
review is extended to September 21, 2016.
For the Commission, by its Secretary and by the Office of the General Counsel, pursuant to
delegated authority.1
