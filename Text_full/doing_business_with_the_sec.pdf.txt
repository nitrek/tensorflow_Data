Things You Should Know to Make Doing Business with the Government Easier

Know the Mission of the Agency - Knowing the mission of the SEC will help you make a
determination as to whether or not the SEC may be able to utilize your products or services. You
can read more about the SEC Mission at www.SEC.gov.
Understand what the SEC procures – Prior to marking your products or services, research
historical procurement data. You may conduct your research via publically available domains
via www.USASpending.gov (USA Spending) and www.fpds.gov/fpdsng_cms/ (FPDS-NG).
Please do not waste time marketing to agencies that cannot or do not utilize your products or
services. For example: A company that manufacturers’ uniforms, medicines, or missiles should
not utilize resources by marketing to the SEC as we do not purchase these items.
