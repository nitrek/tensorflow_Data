In the Matter of
ROBERT A. BELLIA, JR.

ORDER VACATING NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING
ORGANIZATION AND MUNICIPAL ADVISOR BARS
Robert A. Bellia, Jr. seeks to vacate an administrative order, dated August 12, 2011 (the
"Order"), to the extent that it bars him from association with any nationally recognized statistical
rating organization ("NRSRO") or municipal advisor.1 The NRSRO and municipal advisor bars
at issue were imposed based solely on conduct occurring prior to July 22, 2010, the effective date
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.2 Accordingly, in our
discretion, we vacate the Order to the extent it prohibits Robert A. Bellia, Jr. from associating
with any NRSRO or municipal advisor, but otherwise leave the Order unmodified.
By the Commission.
