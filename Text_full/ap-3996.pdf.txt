Release No. 3996/July 18, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-16509

In the Matter of
EDWARD M. DASPIN,
a/k/a “EDWARD (ED) MICHAEL,”
LUIGI AGOSTINI, and
LAWRENCE R. LUX

MOTION TO THE COMMISSION
FOR EXTENSION

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding on April 23, 2015. On
January 6, 2016, I requested an extension of the initial decision due date based on delays caused by
Respondent Edward M. Daspin’s claimed medical condition and failure to attend the scheduled hearing.
Edward M. Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3470, 2016 SEC LEXIS 41. While the
Commission was considering that motion, the Second Circuit stayed this proceeding as to Respondent
Luigi Agostini “pending further order of [the] Court.” Agostini v. SEC, No. 15-4114 (Jan. 12, 2016), ECF
No. 49. On February 18, 2016, the Commission granted my motion and extended the initial decision
deadline to August 22, 2016. Edward M. Daspin, Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. 77177,
2016 SEC LEXIS 622. Judge Grimes has since found Daspin in default. Edward M. Daspin, Admin.
Proc. Rulings Release No. 3683, 2016 SEC LEXIS 886 (ALJ Mar. 8, 2016).
Because of the Second Circuit stay as to Agostini, the proceeding could not move forward with
respect to him, and remained stayed at the prehearing stage. On July 11, 2016, however, the Second
Circuit vacated the stay. Agostini v. SEC, No. 15-4114, ECF No. 72. After consulting with the presiding
law judge, I have determined that it will not be possible to hold a hearing and issue the initial decision as
to Agostini by the current August 22, 2016, deadline.
Accordingly, I move for a six-month extension of the initial decision due date, to February 22,
2017, pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 360(a)(3), 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(3). Taking into
consideration the time required for the parties to submit post-hearing briefs and for the presiding law
judge to issue an initial decision, while concurrently handling other matters, a six-month extension would
be most appropriate. Cf. 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2).
