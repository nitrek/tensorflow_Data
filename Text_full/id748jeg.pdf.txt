(A/K/A S.J. FORTENBERRY, JOHN
FORTENBERRY, AND JOHNNY
FORTENBERRY)

APPEARANCES:

INITIAL DECISON
March 2, 2015

Stephan J. Schlegelmilch, Michael C. Baker, and Corey A. Schuster for
the Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission
Stanley Jonathan Fortenberry, pro se
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision finds that Respondent Stanley Jonathan Fortenberry willfully
violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934
and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of
1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder (collectively, the antifraud provisions). The Initial Decision
orders Fortenberry to cease-and-desist from further violations of these provisions and
permanently bars him from the securities industry. Additionally, the Initial Decision orders
Fortenberry to pay civil penalties totaling $900,000 and to disgorge $146,500 plus prejudgment
interest.
I. INTRODUCTION
Relying on five provisions—Section 8A of the Securities Act, Section 21C of the
Exchange Act, Section 203(f) and (k) of the Advisers Act, and Section 9(b) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940—the Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding on
April 28, 2014, with an Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings
(OIP). The OIP alleges that Fortenberry violated the antifraud provisions.
I held a hearing in this matter in Dallas, Texas, over three days in October 2014. During
the hearing, the Division of Enforcement called five witnesses, including Fortenberry. Aside

from himself, Fortenberry called no witnesses. I admitted sixty-one of the Division’s exhibits
and eleven of Fortenberry’s exhibits.1
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
I base the following findings of fact and conclusions on the entire record and the
demeanor of the witnesses who testified at the hearing, applying preponderance of the evidence
as the standard of proof. See Steadman v. SEC, 450 U.S. 91, 100-04 (1981). All arguments and
proposed findings and conclusions that are inconsistent with this decision are rejected. 2 I find
the following facts to be true.
This case is about the collapse of Premier Investment Fund L.P. (Premier) and its
investors’ losses. Premier was run by Respondent Stanley Jonathan Fortenberry. Answer at 3.
Fortenberry, who is forty-eight and lives in San Angelo, Texas, is a man of many names. Id.
Apparently, he now goes by the name John. Tr. 199. In 2004, however, he entered into an
agreed cease-and-desist order with the Texas State Securities Board, in which his name was
listed as Stanley J. Fortenberry. 3 Div. Ex. 10. Stanley J. Fortenberry was also the name used by
the Pennsylvania Securities Commission in 2004 when it ordered Fortenberry to stop selling
unregistered securities in Pennsylvania while promising “100% return . . . within the first 12
months.” Div. Ex. 9. Fortenberry’s former counsel, John C. Nimmer, often referred to
Fortenberry as SJ. See Div. Ex. 38 at 6509, 6514, 6520.4
A.

Fortenberry solicits a loan for $170,000 from Dr. Allen Anderson

In 2009 and 2010, Fortenberry was associated with a company called Breadstreet.com
that generated investor leads. Tr. 249-51. During that time, Breadstreet.com operated out of a

Citations to the Division’s exhibits and Fortenberry’s exhibits are noted as “Div. Ex. ___,” and
“JF ___,” respectively. Fortenberry’s and the Division’s posthearing briefs are noted as “Resp.
Br. at ___” and “Div. Br. at ___,” respectively. Citations to the Division’s proposed findings of
fact and conclusions of law are noted as “Div. Proposed Findings at ___.”
2

I reject Fortenberry’s argument that the OIP was not timely filed due to the Division’s failure to
comply with the deadlines set forth in 15 U.S.C. § 78d-5. See Montford & Co., Advisers Act
Release No. 3829, 2014 SEC LEXIS 1529, *30-50 (May 2, 2014) (holding that 15 U.S.C.
§ 78d-5 does not create a statute of limitations or any right to dismissal of action due to
noncompliance with its deadlines).
3

In the cease-and-desist order, Fortenberry agreed that he failed to disclose certain risks
associated with unregistered securities he offered and sold in Texas. Div. Ex. 10 at 2-3. He also
agreed that he failed to disclose to investors his 1990 theft conviction and his bankruptcy filings
in 1992 and 1993. Id. at 2.

Many of the Division’s exhibits are paginated with numbers reflecting their previous use in
other contexts. Division Exhibit 38, for example, is paginated from HMC-E-006499 to
HMC-E-006523. In this Initial Decision, when an exhibit is paginated in this manner, I will
simply refer to the last four digits of the page in question.

building located at 221 South Abe Street, San Angelo, Texas (the South Abe Street building).
Tr. 249, 750. Fortenberry owned this building. Tr. 249-50. Fortenberry earned $89,000 in 2009
for his work with Breadstreet.com, making him the highest or second highest paid employee or
contractor affiliated with Breadstreet.com. Tr. 251. And his later-developed investment
company, Premier, operated out of the same location as Breadstreet.com. Tr. 229-31, 249. It
was thus the case that although Fortenberry attempted to distance himself from Breadstreet.com,
see Tr. 250-51 (“I wasn’t running the day-to-day operations. . . I was there basically as a cheer
leader . . . [a]nd I would occasionally hold a meeting or something for them.”), he was very
much involved with that company.5
In any event, Fortenberry was experiencing financial difficulties in early 2010. Tr. 678.
In January or February, he asked his friend, Dr. Allen Anderson, to loan him $170,000 in
exchange for a lien on the South Abe Street building. Tr. 201, 342, 678. Dr. Anderson first met
Fortenberry in 2008 or 2009. Tr. 676-77. Dr. Anderson graduated from medical school in 1966.
Tr. 671. Although he was previously an avid outdoorsman, he has been slowed since 2005 by
health issues and is now less ambulatory than in the past. 6 Tr. 672-73.
Dr. Anderson agreed to loan Fortenberry $170,000. Tr. 678. In February and March
2010, he gave Fortenberry two $10,000 checks, the first made out to John Fortenberry and the
second made out to Private Business Investments. Tr. 679-81; Div. Exs. 14, 20. Private
Business Investments was a division of Breadstreet.com. See Div. Ex. 26. Dr. Anderson made
the second check out to Private Business Investments because Fortenberry asked him to do so.
Tr. 681-85. In April 2010, Dr. Anderson entered into an agreement, purportedly with Private
Business Investments, but signed by Fortenberry. Div. Ex. 26. In the agreement, Dr. Anderson
agreed to “transfer” $150,000 to Private Business Investments in payments of $80,000 in April
2010, and $70,000 in May 2010. Id. In return, Dr. Anderson was to receive 2% of Private
Business Investments’ gross revenue and ownership of the South Abe Street building. Id. As
contemplated in the agreement, Dr. Anderson issued checks to Private Business Investments for
$80,000 and $70,000 in April and May 2010, respectively. Tr. 683-85; Div. Exs. 25, 26, 34.
For reasons that were not explained, Fortenberry did not transfer ownership of the South
Abe Street building to Dr. Anderson. Instead, in June 2010, Fortenberry executed a “real estate
lien note” in the amount of $170,000. Tr. 678, 685-86; Div. Ex. 43. In the note, Fortenberry
5

The reason behind Fortenberry’s desire to distance himself from Breadstreet.com was not
explored during the hearing in this matter. It appears that Fortenberry came to the Division’s
attention because the Division was investigating Breadstreet.com. See Declaration of Corey A.
Schuster in Support of the Division of Enforcement’s Memorandum in Opposition to
Respondent’s Motion for Summary Disposition (Schuster Declaration). During the Division’s
investigation of Breadstreet.com, Fortenberry refused to respond to the Division’s subpoena and
instead asserted that “[i]nformation relevant to the investigation is inherently incriminating.” See
Schuster Declaration, Ex. D at 2.

Dr. Anderson testified that he suffers from various ailments. Tr. 673. The statement above that
he has difficulty moving about is based on my personal observation of his movements to and
from the witness chair.

gave Dr. Anderson a lien on the South Abe Street building. Tr. 678; Div. Ex. 43. The note
reflected that Dr. Anderson had given Fortenberry an interest-free loan payable in three years.
Tr. 678; Div. Ex. 43.
B.

Fortenberry creates Premier to invest in Halsey Management Company

Meanwhile, in March 2010, Fortenberry heard a radio interview with Jim Halsey. Tr.
245-46. Mr. Halsey is well-known in the country music industry, having successfully managed
and promoted artists for decades. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Halsey (last visited Feb.
5, 2015); Tr. 50-51. During the radio interview, Mr. Halsey invited investors to invest in a new
venture he had conceived. Tr. 245.
Fortenberry soon e-mailed Mr. Halsey, saying “I bring investors and businesses together
for profit-- including the entertainment industry. I am curious how private money may be able to
profit from the music industry.” Div. Ex. 19. Mr. Halsey responded and asked whether
Fortenberry could “bring something to the table?” Id. Fortenberry replied:
I represent the Nimmer Law Office[.] 7 [W]e specialize in private
funding for worthwhile endeavors. I would like to see some
information on any projects you wish to get investor funds for. We
handle transactions ranging from one million up to twenty-five
million.
Id. (emphasis added).
As it turned out, the emphasized language was false. Fortenberry had never raised $1
million, let alone $25 million. Tr. 252-53, 593. He explained that he easily could have done so
if Mr. Halsey owned property worth $25 million that he was willing to mortgage. Tr. 252-53.
Unprompted during the hearing, Fortenberry defended his choice of words in the e-mail, offering
that “it’s not like lying.” Tr. 593. Rather, he said was conveying his capability and interest in
being involved with an investment involving that amount of money. 8 Tr. 593-94.
To the contrary, I find that Fortenberry’s statement that “[w]e handle transactions ranging
from one million up to twenty-five million,” was calculated to convey the message that he and
7

John C. Nimmer represented Fortenberry during the Division’s investigation and continued to
represent him until shortly before the scheduled hearing in this matter. See Stanley Jonathan
Fortenberry, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 1800, 2014 SEC LEXIS 3307 (Sept. 12, 2014).
8

The best word I can think of to describe Fortenberry’s explanation for his assertion in his
e-mail is “silly.” If a person owned property worth $25 million and was willing to mortgage it in
order to raise money, he or she would not need Fortenberry. For that matter, why stop at $25
million? If Fortenberry merely intended to depend on the value of a person’s property, why not
use the figure of $100 million or $1 billion? But, of course, Mr. Halsey did not broadcast an
appeal for help mortgaging his own property in order to raise money; he was looking for
investors to invest their money. Fortenberry’s explanation is thus silly.
4

Mr. Nimmer were serious investors because (1) they had experience raising up to $25 million;
and (2) ventures involving less than $1 million were too small to warrant their involvement. It is
thus apparent that both Fortenberry’s testimony on this point and his e-mail were false; contrary
to his testimony, he was “lying.” As will become evident, this was but the first in a long list of
false and misleading statements made by Fortenberry.
Mr. Halsey’s son, Sherman Halsey, also worked in the country music industry. Div. Ex.
5 at 4-5. After his initial e-mail exchange with Jim Halsey, Fortenberry arranged to travel to
Tulsa, Oklahoma, to meet with Jim and Sherman Halsey. Id. at 6-7. Fortenberry represented to
the Halseys that he ran Premier and that through it, he raised capital for entertainment ventures.
Id. The Halseys informed Fortenberry that they wished to create a new venture, eventually
called Halsey Management Company, to raise “money to develop new projects, and new artists,
and new businesses.” Id. at 7-8; see id. at 10-11. Most of the Halseys’ existing projects would
not be included in Halsey Management. See id. at 7-8, 10-11. In order to help generate revenue
for it, however, Sherman Halsey agreed to include within the venture sales of a Christmas DVD
starring the Oak Ridge Boys. Id. at 8.
Within Halsey Management, Sherman Halsey planned to develop a website called
Thundercloud 360. Div. Ex. 5 at 11-12. He envisioned this site as a “kind of broker” between
musicians willing to “provide their services” and anyone wishing to use those services. Id. at 12.
Sherman Halsey also hoped to develop an educational website called Starmaker360. Id. at 10.
Discussions with the Halseys culminated in a June 2010 agreement between Premier and
Halsey Management Company, LLC. Div. Ex. 39. Consistent with the understanding
Fortenberry conveyed that he could raise $3.5 million, see Div. 5 at 15, the agreement provided
that Halsey Management would deliver up to 3.5 million units of membership interest in the
company to Premier, at a cost of $1 per unit. Div. Ex. 39 at 6264-65. These 3.5 million units
would represent 48% of the total “Units of Membership Interest in the Company.” Id. at 6264.
The agreement also permitted the Halseys to engage in other ventures that were not part
of Halsey Management. Div. Ex. 39 at 6271-72. It provided, however, that a number of “[l]ines
of business . . . may be part of the Company as such may be developed by the Company,”
including the Billboard World Song Contest, “Online schooling” and other projects “to be
developed,” and new artist management. Id. at 6272 (emphasis added). Of relevance to this
proceeding, the agreement contained a dilution provision that provided that twenty-four months
after Premier recouped its entire investment plus 12% interest, Premier’s ownership in Halsey
Management would be reduced by half. 9 Id. at 6264-65. This provision is important because
Fortenberry testified that it actually represented Sherman Halsey’s guarantee that Premier would
receive a 12% annual return. Tr. 544-46, 583.
At some point after the agreement was signed, it became apparent to Sherman Halsey that
Fortenberry could not raise $3.5 million. Div. 5 at 15, 21. After one of the Halseys told
Fortenberry that he needed to raise at least $1.5 million in order for their venture “to work,”
9

The full text of this provision is reproduced as Exhibit A in the appendix attached to this Initial
Decision.
5

Fortenberry committed to raising that amount of capital. Div. Ex. 5 at 21. In the end, however,
Premier invested only $151,500 in Halsey Management. Div. 149 at 15, Ex. D.
C.

Fortenberry convinces Dr. Anderson to invest in Premier

After Fortenberry and Sherman Halsey signed the agreement between Premier and
Halsey Management, Fortenberry approached Dr. Anderson about investing in Premier. Tr. 690.
Fortenberry told Dr. Anderson that Premier would invest in entertainment ventures in general
and in projects involving Jim Halsey in particular. Tr. 690-91. For Dr. Anderson, knowing that
Jim Halsey would be involved “legitimized” the venture and made it less “speculative.” Tr. 692.
Fortenberry told Dr. Anderson that Fortenberry would manage Premier. Tr. 694-95.
Fortenberry also led Dr. Anderson to believe that Fortenberry’s compensation would consist
solely of profit he received as an owner of Premier units. Tr. 695. Fortenberry omitted several
other facts, however. He failed to mention his 2004 Pennsylvania Securities Commission
cease-and-desist order. Tr. 42-43, 720; see Div. Ex. 9. Fortenberry also neglected to mention
that he was the subject of a 2004 agreed cease-and-desist order issued by the Texas State
Securities Board. Tr. 42-43, 720; see Div. Ex. 10. Had Dr. Anderson known about those orders,
however, he would not have invested with Fortenberry. Tr. 720.
In August 2010, Dr. Anderson agreed to invest $100,000 in Premier. Tr. 695; see Div.
Ex. 45 at 1; Div. Ex. 53 at 0039. He did so by committing to purchase partial units over a period
of months, as outlined in a subscription agreement prepared by Mr. Nimmer at Fortenberry’s
direction. Tr. 234, 358, 695, 704; see Div. Ex. 45. The agreement stated that Fortenberry was
Premier’s general partner and described the proposed sale of up to 100 units of Premier for
$100,000 per unit. Div. Ex. 45 at 1. According to the agreement, Fortenberry received 100 units
for his preformation efforts. Id. In the agreement, Fortenberry affirmed that Premier would “use
generally accepted accounting principles [(GAAP)] . . . in keeping its books and records.” Id.
He also affirmed that each limited partner would “have a capital account that included invested
capital plus that partner’s allocations of net income, minus that partner’s allocation of net loss
and share of distributions.” Id. Fortenberry further committed to providing limited partners with
profit and loss statements every year by January 31. Id. at 2-3.
Critically for this proceeding, the subscription agreement contained the following
provision:
a portion of the proceeds from the sale of Units of the Company, as
well as profits from the Company’s investments, shall be allocated
to reasonable administrative expenses in connection with the Unit
offering and the day to day affairs of the Company, including but
not limited to salaries—inclusive of the general partner, office
space, office equipment, travel, legal, accounting costs, and any
other expense recognized by the Internal Revenue Code and
regulations as a business deduction or credit.
Div. Ex. 45 at 2 (emphasis added).
6

As it turned out, however, Fortenberry never intended to do the things he committed to
doing in the subscription agreement. He had no idea what it meant to use GAAP and no idea
what a capital account is. Tr. 296, 589-90, 618-19. He also never prepared profit and loss
statements or tax information for investors. Tr. 296-97, 299-300. In fact, when asked whether
Premier kept a balance sheet or an income statement, Fortenberry said that he kept neither
because doing so would not have been “typical of that type of organization at that stage.” Tr.
296-97. Indeed, Fortenberry boldly announced that Premier kept no records other than bank
account statements. Tr. 297. In his view, a bank statement was sufficient because “you could
easily have an accountant within a few days prepare those statements or plug [the bank account
information] into a piece of software and have a statement within a matter of minutes.” Tr.
298-99. According to Fortenberry “[i]n today’s world you plug in a piece of software like
Quicken, and in about 20 minutes you have a statement that would have rivaled an accounting
office of 20 men just 15 years ago.” Tr. 299.
Relying on Fortenberry’s false representations and unaware of his omissions, Dr.
Anderson drafted a $35,000 check in August 2010, made out to Fortenberry rather than Premier.
Tr. 363, 696-97; Div. Ex. 46 at 2375. On receiving the check, Fortenberry did not tell Dr.
Anderson that he should have made the check out to Premier. Tr. 363. Instead, he simply “went
with it.” Tr. 363. Indeed, Fortenberry “went with it” such that he waited one week before he
wired only $16,500, not the full $35,000, from his personal account to Halsey Management. See
Div. Ex. 31 at 2436-37. He did not deposit any of the $35,000 into Premier’s account. Tr.
363-64. Fortenberry was unsure what happened to the remaining $18,500 that he did not wire to
Halsey Management. Tr. 363. He testified that he thought he “used some of the money right
away. Just like . . . any businessman in [his] position with [his] background would probably
do.”10 Tr. 363. In Fortenberry’s opinion, it was reasonable for him to act in this manner. Tr.
364-65.
Subsequently, Dr. Anderson drafted checks made out to Premier in the following
amounts on the following dates: $10,000 on September 10, 2010; $7,800 on October 26, 2010;
$10,000 on November 22, 2010; $10,000 on December 10, 2010; $10,000 on January 10, 2011;
$10,000 and $100 on February 14, 2011; $5,000 on March 8, 2011; and $100 on March 13,
2011. Div. Ex. 46 at 2993, 2997, 2999, 3001, 3005, 3007-08, 3010, 3012. The aggregate total of
Dr. Anderson’s payments was $98,000. Dr. Anderson understood and expected that all of his
investment would be invested in Premier. Tr. 697-700. He did not expect that money to be used
for Fortenberry’s personal expenses. Tr. 701.
Because Dr. Anderson was investing over time, Fortenberry needed to create the
appearance that Premier was investing Dr. Anderson’s capital and was earning a profit.
Fortenberry thus began sending Dr. Anderson a monthly series of letters and invoices in which
he falsely represented that Premier was earning money. See, e.g., Div. Ex. 69 at 0033. As
discussed below, these statements and letters are notable because Fortenberry sent nothing
similar to a separate investor who invested in whole units rather than partial units over time. The
10

Fortenberry’s bank statement shows that sizeable percentages of the money went to Mr.
Nimmer, a mortgage company, child support, groceries, gasoline, hotel rooms, and plane tickets.
See Div. Ex. 31 at 2437-40.
7

letters and invoices are also notable because most of what Fortenberry conveyed in them had no
basis in fact and evidenced his intermingling of his personal finances and those of Premier.
On August 31, 2010, Fortenberry sent Dr. Anderson a letter, purportedly from Premier.
Div. Ex. 53 at 0039. In the letter, he said the Fund’s “first project is the Halsey Management
Company LLC managing the Billboard World Song and Video Contest.” Id. He additionally
asserted that Premier had “recently added . . . Bongiovi Entertainment, Inc.,” to its “portfolio.”
Id. In the letter, Fortenberry thanked Dr. Anderson for his commitment to purchase one unit in
Premier and included a “subscription invoice for the purchase of 0.1 Limited Partnership Unit[s]
in the amount of $10,000.” Id.
As it turned out, when he sent this letter, Fortenberry knew that inclusion of the Billboard
World Song was dependent on his raising $1.5 million. Div. Ex. 5 at 21. Inasmuch as he had
not raised a tenth of that amount, he knew the Billboard World Song aspect of Halsey
Management’s venture was merely aspirational. Indeed, he would later say a different project
was Premier’s “first project.” See Div. 69 at 0035. Additionally, contrary to what he said,
Premier had not “recently added . . . Bongiovi Entertainment, Inc.,” to its “portfolio.” Indeed,
Premier never invested in Bongiovi Entertainment at all. Tr. 238-39.
Dr. Anderson’s September payment of $10,000 was credited to Premier’s account on
September 10, 2010. Div. Exs. 41 at 2935, 46 at 2992. Eleven days later, Fortenberry wired
$3,000 out of Premier’s account to Halsey Management. Div. Ex. 41 at 2936.
Beginning in November 2010 and continuing through April 2011, Fortenberry sent
monthly letters to Dr. Anderson updating him on Premier’s projects and summarizing his
purported earnings for the month. Div. Exs. 69, 73, 79, 84, 89, 153. In the November 2010
letter to Dr. Anderson, Fortenberry announced that Premier would be “kicking off the first
project from [its] portfolio on” November 25. 11 Div. Ex. 69 at 0033. The letter explained that
the referenced first project was the intended release by Halsey Management of a DVD of “The
Oak Ridge Boys Christmas Classic, ‘An Inconvenient Christmas.’” Id. According to
Fortenberry, approximately 100 million people “watched this Holiday Classic on television every
year for the last eight years.” 12 Id. On the basis of this assertion and others, Fortenberry stated
that Premier believed that “this is the best time to re-invest investor earnings.” Id. He thus
proposed that Dr. Anderson re-invest his monthly “earnings for October in the amount of $550
(1% of $55,000)13 plus [Dr. Anderson’s] October earnings . . . regarding” the lien he held on the
South Abe Street building “in the amount of $156 for a total of $706.” Id. According to
11

Recall that on August 31, 2010, Fortenberry said that Premier’s “first project [was] the Halsey
Management Company LLC managing the Billboard World Song and Video Contest.” Div. Ex.
53 at 0039.
12

As it turned out, the DVD sales did not generate any income. Tr. 384-85; Div. Ex. 5 at 8.

13

Through October 2010, Dr. Anderson had invested $52,800, not $55,000. Div. Ex. 46 at 2375,
2993, 2997. Fortenberry appears to have miscalculated the amount of Dr. Anderson’s
investment in this and in subsequent letters.
8

Fortenberry, adding $706 to Dr. Anderson’s monthly $10,000 investment would give Dr.
Anderson 0.107 partnership units in Premier. Id. Fortenberry attached a subscription invoice to
this effect to his letter. Id. at 0034.
Fortenberry also attached an “Important Investor Update” to the letter. Div. Ex. 69 at
0035-36. In the update, Fortenberry reiterated the information about Premier’s projects and
wrote:
Investors already on board with Premier or coming on board prior
to the 25th of November will reap the profits from what we
anticipate to be a great Holiday Season! Additionally, investors
participating with the Premier Investment Fund LP will enjoy
being part of the Bongiovi Christmas film to be released in 2012,
“The Littlest Christmas Tree” as well as the book that will be
released in 2011. We realize this information is more than any
person can completely absorb. This is why you can trust our team
of experts to identify excellence in investing in the entertainment
industry.
Id. at 0035. Not surprisingly, this document falsely led Dr. Anderson to believe that Premier had
invested in the Bongiovi Christmas film. Tr. 709.
Division counsel asked Fortenberry about the calculation of the $550 earnings figure in
the November 2010 letter in light of the fact Premier never earned any money. Tr. 378.
Notwithstanding the fact that Fortenberry sent the letter from Premier, he testified that the $550
figure “was based on the $170,000 note and a separate agreement” he had with Dr. Anderson
“for getting a percentage of the profits of whatever business . . . [they] were involved in.” Tr.
378. In other words, Fortenberry claimed the letter had almost nothing to do with Premier.
Division counsel then asked for clarification of whether the letter conveyed that Dr.
Anderson had earned $550 on his Premier investment. Tr. 379. Fortenberry responded that—
despite the plain language of the letter—“obviously” it was not his “intent” to convey that Dr.
Anderson had received a return on an investment. Tr. 379. Instead, the $55,000 pertained to
some other, previously unnamed “earnings in one of the businesses.” Tr. 379. Fortenberry then
changed his testimony and identified the $550 as an interest payment on $55,000 that had been
invested. Tr. 380. According to Fortenberry, it was “pretty clear” or “fairly clear” that he was
referring to “interest earnings.” Tr. 380-81.
Notwithstanding Fortenberry’s testimony, what was clear is that Premier had earned no
money. Tr. 239-40. The statement to Dr. Anderson that he had earned $550 on his investment
was thus false. When he was later confronted with a subsequent letter showing $766.67 in
earnings, Fortenberry said that he actually meant that Dr. Anderson had earned interest on “the
note that was being created in part by virtue of this document evidencing that I am indebted to
Mr. Anderson for that amount of money is part of the earnings.” Tr. 792. When pressed on this,
Fortenberry said he construed the subscription agreement as evidencing a loan. Tr. 793-94.

As a factual matter, I cannot credit Fortenberry’s contradictory testimony regarding the
meaning of the language in the monthly letters. Contrary to what he said during the hearing, it is
plain that he intended to convey to Dr. Anderson that he had earned income on his investment
and that his investment was profitable. And the reason Fortenberry did this was so that Dr.
Anderson would continue to invest in Premier. Fortenberry thus showed a willingness to lie in
the face of clear contrary facts and revealed that he had hopelessly co-mingled his personal and
business affairs. This latter co-mingling would later also be shown through evidence that
Fortenberry treated Premier’s bank account as his own.
In December 2010, Fortenberry sent Dr. Anderson another Premier letter. Div. Ex. 73 at
0029. In this letter, he announced that Starmaker360.com, which he described as a project in
which Premier was investing, would be “airing the Oak Ridge Boys Christmas Special this
weekend.” Id. Fortenberry also told Dr. Anderson that sales of the previously-mentioned
Christmas DVD would be announced during the show. Id. According to Fortenberry’s letter, the
show would include a promotion of Starmaker360.com and a way for viewers to enter the
Billboard World Song Contest. Id. As it turned out, the Starmaker website did not “go live”
until 2013. Div. Ex. 5 at 23.
In the December letter, Fortenberry again asked Dr. Anderson to reinvest his monthly
Premier earnings “for November in the amount of $657 (1% of $65,706) plus your November
earnings” for the South Abe Street building lien “in the amount of $333.84 for a total of
$990.84” in Premier. Div. Ex. 73 at 0029. This language convinced Dr. Anderson that his
investment had earned $657. Tr. 711. During the hearing, however, Fortenberry insisted that
rather than “earnings,” “[a]nyone with an IQ above 90” would “know” he was referring in this
letter to interest. 14 Tr. 387. According to Fortenberry, despite the fact that Premier had no “cash
flow,” he was “ethically” obligated to pay Dr. Anderson interest. Tr. 387.
Three days after Fortenberry deposited Dr. Anderson’s $10,000 investment on December
13, 2010, he wired $5,000 to Halsey Management. Div. Exs. 41 at 2948, 46 at 3000. This would
be Premier’s last payment to Halsey Management. Tr. 785. Also in December 2010, Premier
paid Mr. Nimmer $1,000 and Fortenberry made a $2,000 cash withdrawal from Premier’s
account. Div. Ex. 41 at 2948.
Fortenberry’s pattern with Dr. Anderson continued. In January 2011, he sent Dr.
Anderson a letter, purportedly from Premier, in which Fortenberry told Dr. Anderson that his
“monthly Premier Investment Fund earnings for December are $766.97 (1% of $76,697)” and his
December earnings for the South Abe Street building lien “are in the amount of $195.22 for a
total of $962.19 earnings in December.” Div. Ex. 79 at 0022. The letter also represented that
“[s]tarting in February, we will start issuing a monthly statement showing accumulated
earnings.” Once again, Fortenberry’s letter led Dr. Anderson to believe that his investment in
Premier had earned money. Tr. 712. As in December, however, Premier had no actual earnings.
14

Fortenberry had the unfortunate habit during the hearing of responding to Division counsel’s
questions with sarcasm, as if counsel was a bit slow, or by saying that it was obvious that
language he used in written communications meant something other than what was conveyed by
the plain words he used. See Section II.F, infra (discussing Fortenberry’s credibility).
10

Tr. 391. Unlike the November and December letters, the January letter did not request that Dr.
Anderson reinvest his earnings, but thanked him for his “gracious permission allowing us to
defer payment of [his] earnings.” Div. Ex. 79 at 0022.
In his February 2011 letter, Fortenberry told Dr. Anderson that his “monthly Premier
Investment Fund earnings for January are $866.97 (1% of $86,697)” and his December earnings
for the South Abe Street building lien “are in the amount of $213.35 for a total of $1,080.32
earnings in January.” Div. Ex. 84 at 0017. Dr. Anderson understood the letter to convey to him
that his investment in Premier had earned $866.97. Tr. 713-14. Inasmuch as he had a lien on the
South Abe Street building, he did not understand what Fortenberry meant when he said Dr.
Anderson had earnings on the lien. Tr. 713. He presumably also failed to understand the portion
of the previous letters that referred to “earnings” on the South Abe Street building lien.
Fortenberry attached to the February 2011 letter a subscription invoice for $10,000 due
on February 20, 2010, which indicated that on receipt of his next $10,000 payment, Dr.
Anderson’s holdings in Premier would increase to 0.9669 units. Div. Ex. 84 at 0018. According
to an attached “Investment Statement,” Dr. Anderson held 0.8669 units of Premier as of
February 3, 2011. Id. at 0020. These units included the reinvestments of his October and
November “earnings,” which themselves included interest payments on Dr. Anderson’s personal
loan to Fortenberry. Id. The February letter did not ask Fortenberry to reinvest any additional
earnings, but stated that the investment statement reflected his “deferred earnings.”
As with the previous letters, the March 2011 letter contained misleading claims that Dr.
Anderson had earnings on his investment. See Div. Ex. 89 at 0015. This time, Fortenberry said
Dr. Anderson had earned “$966.97 (1% of $96,697)” on his Premier investment and $173.30 on
his South Abe Street building lien, for a total of $1,140.27. Id. Again, Dr. Anderson understood
the letter to convey to him that his investment in Premier had earned money. Tr. 718.
By the end of March 2011, Premier had a negative balance in its bank account. Tr. 400.
Nonetheless, Fortenberry continued to send Dr. Anderson letters with invented figures. In April
2011, Fortenberry told Dr. Anderson that he had earned $1,016.97 on his Premier investment and
$145.80 on the lien for a total of $1,162.77 in earnings. Div. Ex. 153 at 0012. Dr. Anderson
understood the letter to convey to him that his investment in Premier had earned money. Tr. 718.
According to the attached investment statement, Dr. Anderson held 1.0169 partnership units as
of April 13, 2011. Div. Ex. 153 at 0013. Fortenberry testified that Dr. Anderson’s earnings at
that point were “not based on Premier [having] invest[ed] money. The[] earnings [were] based
on the investment that Dr. Anderson [made] and a commitment to pay him interest on those
earnings - - I mean, on that investment.” Tr. 400.
Dr. Anderson’s last investment was in March 2011. Div. Ex. 112 at 0002. After the
April 2011 letter, Fortenberry continued to send Dr. Anderson statements on a quarterly basis
reflecting his purported earnings on his Premier investment and his loan to Fortenberry. See Div.
Exs. 112, 154-56. According to an investment statement issued in May 2012, Dr. Anderson had
earned over $16,000. Div. Ex. 112 at 0009. At this time, Premier had no money, having not
received any cash since Dr. Anderson’s March 2011 investment. Tr. 406.

11

In October 2012, Dr. Anderson executed a “release of lien” on the South Abe Street
building. Div. Ex. 114. The release contained an acknowledgement that he had been paid in full
on his $170,000 loan. Id. In fact, however, Fortenberry had made no payments on the note. Tr.
688. According to Dr. Anderson, Fortenberry presented him the release and said that he
“need[ed] money urgently because . . . taxes [were] due on the” building, and he needed the lien
released in order to conclude an unspecified deal or transaction. Tr. 689. Dr. Anderson testified
that he did not read the release carefully and did not realize he was stipulating that the loan had
been paid. Tr. 688, 769. As of October 2014, Fortenberry had paid Dr. Anderson between
$5,000 and $6,000 of the $170,000 Fortenberry owed him on the loan. Tr. 687.
D.

Michael Nasti invests $200,000 in Premier

Around the same time Dr. Anderson started investing with Fortenberry, Chris Kelly, a
contractor working for Breadstreet.com, phoned a man named Michael Nasti about investing
with Premier. Tr. 48; Div. Ex. 3 at 45. Mr. Nasti is 52 years old and lives on Long Island. Tr.
46. He “own[s] a few businesses,” including a building supply company and a realty company.
Tr. 47.
After Mr. Nasti responded positively to Breadstreet.com’s overtures, Fortenberry spoke
with him. Tr. 48-50. Fortenberry told Mr. Nasti about a “great opportunity” to invest in a
website that would allow musicians to share music with each other. Tr. 50. Mr. Nasti recalled
that the website was either called Starmaker360 or Thudercloud. Tr. 50. He was impressed
because the Halseys were involved in the venture. Tr. 50-51. Mr. Nasti understood that his
investment would be directed toward Halsey Management “because there were so many little”
projects under the Halsey umbrella. Tr. 51-52.
In order to verify the validity of what Fortenberry told him, Mr. Nasti arranged to visit
Tulsa, Oklahoma, so that he could meet Fortenberry and the Halseys. Tr. 56-57. Prior to the
trip, Fortenberry e-mailed Mr. Nasti a brochure about “Star Maker Central” (the Starmaker
Brochure).15 Tr. 67-68; see Div. Ex. 56 at 0183-88. Fortenberry created the Starmaker
Brochure. Tr. 236, 276. The Halseys neither created nor approved its content. Div. Ex. 5 at 30.
In the brochure, Fortenberry expressed “confiden[ce] that [Star Maker Central] will
achieve one million members” within two years and “average thirty dollars per month per
member.” Div. Ex. 56 at 0183. He further expressed that “[c]onsequently, Star Maker Central
will be grossing thirty million dollars per month.” Id. With costs running at less than $2 million
per month, Fortenberry said he expected a profit of $28 million per month. Id. Fortenberry then
promised prospective investors:
If you invest now, we will pay you twelve percent (12%) per
annum. Repayment of principle and interest will be paid back in
three years, along with you keeping your equity stake in the
holdings. Most importantly, our investors will receive twelve and
15

The Starmaker Brochure is included as Exhibit B in the attached appendix.
12

one half percent of twenty eight million dollars, which is three and
one half million dollars divided by our one hundred investors.
Thus, each investor will be paid thirty five thousand dollars per
month for the rest of his or her life. Additionally, these holdings
can be bequeathed to his or her heirs.
Id. (emphasis added). Later in the Starmaker Brochure, Fortenberry included a graphical display
showing StarMakerCentral.com as the central component in an array of ventures, including: (1)
Billboard World Song Contest; (2) Thundercast, providing online video and music streaming; (3)
Sonicbids, a site that allowed artists to find venues; (4) Thundercloud, a site that allowed artists
to transfer, compile, and sell their work; (5) Halseyjobs.com, a “music and video industry job
site;” and (6) Halsey Institute, a venture identified with an “i” within an “h” (the h and i logo)
which purported to be a “learning institute for . . . the music and entertainment industry.” Id. at
0186; see Tr. 293-94 (Fortenberry affirming that he created the graphic and explaining the
meaning of the h and i logo).
Most of what Fortenberry included in the Starmaker Brochure was unrealistically
optimistic, false, or simply invented. For starters, after seeing the first paragraph, regarding one
million members and gross revenue of $30 million per month, Sherman Halsey phoned
Fortenberry and told him these figures were “not realistic.” Div. 5 at 29. Fortenberry was also
aware that in order for any of the Halsey Management “entities to work,” he had to raise at least
$1.5 million. Id. at 21.
As to the graphical display, Sherman Halsey explained that he had never heard of
Halseyjobs.com or Thundercast. Div. Ex. 5 at 31. Indeed, he was derisive of the logo
Fortenberry created for Thundercast and placed in the Starmaker Brochure. Id. And while Sonic
Bids is “a major entity in the music business,” the Halseys had no ownership interest in it. Id.
Prior to his investigative testimony in July 2013, Sherman Halsey had never seen the h
and i logo purportedly related to the Halsey Institute.16 Div. Ex. 5 at 31. He testified that it was
not associated with Halsey Management or any Halsey company. Id. at 31-32. Fortenberry, by
contrast, testified that the Halsey Institute related to classes “Jim Halsey formed . . . at [the]
University of Oklahoma.” Tr. 294. He also said that Jim Halsey authorized him to use the h and
i logo. Id. The h and i logo, however, was plainly taken from the website for the Halsey
Institute for Contemporary Art at the College of Charleston. Compare http://halsey.cofc.edu
(last visited Feb. 4, 2015), with Div. Ex. 56 at 0186. The Halsey Institute for Contemporary Art
is named for William Halsey, an artist and native of Charleston, South Carolina. See
http://halsey.cofc.edu/about (last visited Feb. 4, 2015). Fortenberry’s testimony that Jim Halsey
authorized its use is thus false.
Having received the Starmaker Brochure, Mr. Nasti met with Fortenberry and the
Halseys. Tr. 57, 67-68. After talking to the Halseys, he met privately with Fortenberry in a
16

Sherman Halsey said that although Fortenberry previously sent him the Starmaker Brochure,
he never got past the first paragraph before phoning Fortenberry. Div. Ex. 5 at 29, 32.
13

conference room the Halseys provided. Div. Ex. 5 at 16. For Mr. Nasti, the 12% guarantee
described in the brochure was “everything.” Tr. 59. Because Fortenberry had mentioned the
possibility that Premier would invest in other ventures, Mr. Nasti wanted to ensure that his
money went only to Halsey Management. 17 Tr. 59, 70-71. He thus insisted that Fortenberry
write “this is the basis for investment by Mike Nasti in Premier Investment Fund” on the front of
the Starmaker Brochure. Tr. 71; see Div. Ex. 56 at 0183. He then had Fortenberry sign the front
page of the brochure and place his initials on each page of it.18 Tr. 71; see Div. Ex. 56 at
0183-86, 0188.
During his meeting with Fortenberry in Tulsa, Mr. Nasti asked whether and how
Fortenberry would be compensated. Tr. 60-61. Fortenberry said that his compensation would
come in the form of an ownership interest in Premier and thus a percentage of Premier’s profits;
he did not mention receiving a salary. Tr. 60-61, 150, 155. Moving on, Fortenberry presented
Mr. Nasti with a subscription agreement that was substantially similar to that which he presented
the month before to Dr. Anderson, except that Mr. Nasti’s agreement called for full payment of
$100,000 at the time of purchase. Tr. 72, 358; see Div. 56 at 0189-0206. As with Dr. Anderson,
Mr. Nasti’s subscription agreement contained the false promise that Mr. Nasti would have a
capital account and that Premier would use GAAP. Div. Ex. 56 at 0189. Fortenberry also
falsely promised to inform Mr. Nasti by January 31 of each year of Premier’s profits and losses.
Id. at 0190. Mr. Nasti’s subscription agreement contained a provision, like Dr. Anderson’s,
relating to “reasonable administrative expenses . . . including . . . salaries.” Id.
On September 13, 2010, Mr. Nasti gave Fortenberry a check for $100,000. See Div. Ex.
55. Mr. Nasti made the check out to the Nimmer Trust Account because Fortenberry said that
“until he had the investors all together,” investment funds had to be deposited in Mr. Nimmer’s
trust account. Tr. 64-65. Just three days before, however, Dr. Anderson had given Fortenberry a
$10,000 check made payable to Premier, see Div. Ex. 46 at 2993, which Fortenberry deposited
into Premier’s account the same day it was drafted, see Div. Ex. 41 at 2935. Indeed, Fortenberry
opened Premier’s banking account in June 2010. See Div. Ex. 41 at 2926.
As with Dr. Anderson, Fortenberry failed to mention to Mr. Nasti that he had been the
subject of a 2004 Pennsylvania Securities Commission cease-and-desist order related to
unregistered securities. Tr. 62; see Div. Ex. 9. Fortenberry also did not mention the Texas State
Securities Board order. Tr. 63; see Div. Ex. 10. According to Mr. Nasti, he would not have
invested in Premier had he known about these orders. Tr. 63.
17

Fortenberry had e-mailed Mr. Nasti about the possibility that Premier would invest in an
animated children’s program called the Littlest Christmas Tree. Div. Ex. 54 at 0003. According
to Fortenberry’s e-mail, the Littlest Christmas Tree would be produced by Tony Bongiovi, who
was described as having produced over fifty gold and platinum records. Id. at 0007. According
to Fortenberry, the Littlest Christmas Tree was “a seasonal, or perennial, property that will
continue generating profits in perpetuity.” Id.
18

Fortenberry’s initials do not appear on the fifth page of the Starmaker Brochure, which is the
first page of a legal disclaimer, though his initials are on the second page of the disclaimer. Div.
Ex. 56 at 0187-88.
14

Based on his conversations with Fortenberry, Mr. Nasti expected all of his $100,000 to be
passed on to Halsey Management. Tr. 66. He did not expect Fortenberry to divert any portion of
the money to any other use. Tr. 66, 147. Nonetheless, Mr. Nimmer retained $5,000 of the
$100,000 Mr. Nasti invested in September 2010. Tr. 322. Although Mr. Nasti wrote his check
on September 13, 2010, Mr. Nimmer did not transfer the remaining $95,000 into Premier’s bank
account until September 29, 2010. Div. Ex. 41 at 2935; Div. Ex. 55. On September 29, 2010,
Fortenberry wired $52,000 to Halsey Management. Div. Ex. 41 at 2936. By the next day,
September 30, 2010, Fortenberry had written and cashed three checks from the Premier bank
account payable to himself or “petty cash” in the aggregate amount of $20,000. See Div. Ex. 42
at 3017-19.
Mr. Nasti purchased a second unit in Premier in November 2010. Tr. 82-84; Div. Ex. 68.
After Premier received Mr. Nasti’s second $100,000 payment, he received an e-mail containing a
second subscription agreement. Tr. 84; Div. Ex. 70. Unbeknownst to Mr. Nasti, Fortenberry
changed the second subscription agreement to specifically allow him “to invest in Bongiovi
Entertainment, Inc[.], Halsey Management LLC, and other projects of comparable merit.” Div.
Ex. 70 at 0074; Tr. 85. The same day that Mr. Nasti wired his $100,000 to Premier’s account,
November 16, 2010, Fortenberry transferred $20,000 from Premier’s account to his personal
account. See Div. Exs. 41 at 2944, 42 at 3026. The next day, Fortenberry wired $70,000 to
Halsey Management. Div. 41 at 2944.
Unlike with Dr. Anderson, Fortenberry never gave Mr. Nasti monthly statements or
letters about how Premier was operating. Tr. 76-80. He also never provided tax records or
statements about its investments. Tr. 76-80, 101. During the hearing, Fortenberry was asked
why he supplied Dr. Anderson with statements showing that he had earnings when he had not
done so with Mr. Nasti. Tr. 388. According to Fortenberry, he “commit[ed] to pay [Dr.
Anderson] interest” because Dr. Anderson’s subscription agreement included a 12% interest
guarantee and Mr. Nasti’s did not. Tr. 388-89, 400. He also explained that he “wasn’t hanging
out with Mr. Nasti on a regular basis.” Tr. 799.
Of course, Fortenberry was mistaken. Fortenberry explicitly promised Mr. Nasti a 12%
annual return in the Starmaker Brochure. Div. Ex. 56 at 0183; see Tr. 389. Dr. Anderson’s
agreement did not contain such a promise. Div. Ex. 45. Given the time period in question, it is
apparent that Fortenberry was leading Dr. Anderson along by sending him monthly letters
reflecting earnings on his investment because he wanted Dr. Anderson to continue giving him
money. Because Mr. Nasti had already invested $200,000, there was no need to induce him with
additional false representations that he was earning money on his investment. Dr. Anderson,
however, was investing on a monthly basis. Fortenberry thus needed to extend his earnings
charade in order to ensure that Dr. Anderson would continue to invest.
Mr. Nasti never received any of his $200,000 investment back from Fortenberry or
Premier. Tr. 101. On September 21, 2012, Fortenberry left Mr. Nasti a voicemail saying that he
would like to “work out some kind of long-term note at a reasonable interest rate” so that he can
“get these amends made to [Mr. Nasti].” Tr. 97-99; Div. Exs. 113A, 113B. Not coincidentally,
on September 20, 2012, the District Court for the District of Columbia denied Fortenberry’s
motion to dismiss the Division’s subpoena enforcement action. See Minute Order, SEC v.
15

Fortenberry, No. 1:11-mc-0671 (D.D.C. Sept. 20, 2012).19 The voicemail, left long after
Fortenberry’s last contact with Mr. Nasti, shows Fortenberry’s consciousness of guilt.
E.

The Division’s investigation into Fortenberry’s and Premier’s bank accounts
shows that Fortenberry failed to account for his use of funds from Premier’s
account

In August 2013, the Division sent Fortenberry’s counsel a letter inviting counsel to file a
Wells submission. 20 Div. Ex. 128. In preparation for filing that submission, Fortenberry hired
an accountant, Christopher Odom, to prepare annual financial compilations for Premier. Tr.
450-51.
As an aside, preparation of a compilation does not entail the intense review and
reconciliation one would expect with an audit. See Div. Ex. 149 at 12-13. The accountant who
prepares a compilation would therefore not be expected to “independent[ly] test[] . . . the
reliability of the underlying data.” Id. at 12. Mr. Odom’s compilations were thus simply reports
of the transactions in Premier’s bank account, Tr. 606-07, 610, 655, based on Fortenberry’s
explanation of the nature of expenditures listed on bank statements, Tr. 610. Mr. Odom did not
audit compiled financial statements or look for errors. Tr. 607-08, 610, 656; Div. Ex. 132.
Needless to say, even if Fortenberry had used this method of reporting to timely provide
information to his investors, which he did not, it would not have been GAAP-compliant. Tr.
618; see Div. Ex. 149 at 13.
Aside from bank statements, Fortenberry did not keep financial records for Premier. Tr.
298-302. He obviously never disseminated financial reports to Dr. Anderson or Mr. Nasti. Tr.
304. In order to facilitate the preparation of Mr. Odom’s compilations, Fortenberry annotated
Premier’s bank statements. Tr. 451. He placed a handwritten B next to what he indicated were
business expenses and a handwritten P next to personal expenses. Tr. 451, 453; see Div. Ex. 78.
Initially, Fortenberry testified that a P was used to indicate his salary. Tr. 455. Mr. Odom,
however, testified that salary and management fees were considered business expenses. Tr. 614.
Mr. Odom’s 2010 compilation for Premier listed as an asset $165,000 invested in Halsey
Management and a note receivable from Fortenberry in the amount $208,000. Div. Ex. 129 at
0289. According to Mr. Odom, the $165,000 figure was calculated solely from Premier’s bank

Under 17 C.F.R. § 201.323, I take official notice of the district court’s order.

20

Under what is known as the Wells process, “Division staff, in its discretion, may advise a
prospective defendant or respondent of the general nature of the investigation and violations
contemplated by staff.” Montford & Co., 2014 SEC LEXIS 1529, at *32 n.60; see Harding
Advisory LLC, Securities Act Release No. 9561, 2014 SEC LEXIS 938, at *30 n.35 (Mar. 14,
2014); 17 C.F.R. § 202.5(c). The Division’s notice is called a Wells notification or Wells notice.
The prospective defendant or respondent “may . . . submit a written statement to the Commission
setting forth their interests and position in regard to the subject matter of the investigation.” 17
C.F.R. § 202.5(c). This response is known as a Wells submission.

statements. Tr. 640. The figure was based on checks written on the account and B annotations
made by Fortenberry. Tr. 665. Fortenberry told Mr. Odom that before Premier was created,
Fortenberry received $208,000 from Dr. Anderson. Tr. 642; Div. Ex. 137. Fortenberry told Mr.
Odom that Fortenberry and Dr. Anderson agreed to transfer that money to Premier. Tr. 642-43;
Div. Ex. 137. Because no actual funds were transferred to Premier, the $208,000 was listed as a
note receivable. Tr. 643; Div. Ex. 137. The compilation also listed as a liability of Premier a
$170,000 note payable to Dr. Anderson. Div. Ex. 129 at 0289.
The 2010 compilation did not identify any salary paid in 2010. Tr. 485; Div. Ex. 129 at
0290. It did, however, identify $85,729.01 in distributions. Div. Ex. 129 at 0289. According to
Fortenberry, no one but himself was entitled to distributions in 2010. Tr. 485. The figure of
$85,729.01 thus necessarily reflected payments to him. See Tr. 649-50. Mr. Odom explained
that the figure represented personal expenses taken out of Premier’s account, as designated by
Fortenberry on the bank statements. Tr. 647-48.
The 2010 compilation included $46,400 in capital contributions by Fortenberry. Div. Ex.
129 at 0289. Mr. Odom explained that this included $31,400 that was placed in the bank account
and $15,000 that Fortenberry told Mr. Odom that Fortenberry had paid in legal fees. Tr. 649.
Mr. Odom did not verify this latter figure and was not given documentary evidence to support it.
Tr. 649, 652-53.
Mr. Odom’s 2011 compilation continued to show a liability to Dr. Anderson in the
amount of $170,000. Div. Ex. 130 at 0305. It also continued to show as assets of $165,000
invested in Halsey Management and a note receivable from Fortenberry in the amount $208,000.
Id. Although Premier made no additional investments in 2011, the 2011 compilation reflected
total distributions to Fortenberry of $110,232.91, or over $24,000 in addition to the distributions
he received in 2010. Id.; see Tr. 487-88, 656-57.
Fortenberry used Mr. Odom’s compilations to support his Wells submission. Tr. 454,
477; see Div. Ex. 135 at 0142-49. Even so, the hearing revealed that Fortenberry’s annotations
on the bank statements he gave Mr. Odom were hopelessly unreliable and ad hoc. See Tr. 586.
Indeed, it is impossible to tell whether Fortenberry was simply making things up as he went
along or, due to the passage of time, had no idea what many of his expenses were or how to
classify them. In some instances, he could not remember, years after the fact, whether an
expense was for personal or business purposes. Tr. 459; see Div. Ex. 78 at 0086. In other
instances, he mislabeled expenses. For example, a $255 payment to a used car dealer and a
payment to Netflix were labeled as business expenses. Tr. 460-62; see Div. Ex. 78 at 0089.
Fortenberry also labeled overdraft fees as business expenses, because banking fees are tax
deductible. Tr. 460-61; see Div. Ex. 78 at 0093. In short, the hearing made plain that
Fortenberry treated Premier’s account as his own personal account without regard to the need to
justify expenditures.
In order to assess the reliability of Fortenberry’s annotations, and more generally, the
nature of Fortenberry’s opinion as to what constitutes a legitimate business expense, Division
counsel confronted Fortenberry about his annotations for checks written in late September

17

2010.21 Tr. 424-35; see Div. Ex. 42 at 3015-19. On September 20, 2010, Fortenberry wrote a
$2,000 check to “petty cash.” Div. Ex. 42 at 3015. According to Fortenberry, he deposited this
check into his personal bank account because he was in Nashville visiting Jim Halsey and was
“stranded” without money. Tr. 425-26. He testified that he “was on business and it was
legitimate.” Tr. 425-26. Accordingly, Fortenberry annotated this withdrawal with a B. Div. Ex.
78 at 0130.
On September 29, 2010, Fortenberry wrote himself two checks. The first was a $14,000
check, purportedly issued as a “management fee.” Div. Ex. 42 at 3018. The second was a
$2,000 check made payable to petty cash. Id. at 3019. The memo line for this check said “John
Fortenberry fee.” Id. The next day, he wrote himself a $4,000 check, also purportedly as a
management fee. Id. at 3017.
Fortenberry first testified that the two management fee checks were for salary, Tr.
429-30, and that salary would be annotated with a P, Tr. 455. The two checks, however, were
labeled inconsistently; one was annotated with a P and one with a B. Div. Ex. 78 at 0130. When
asked about this, Fortenberry said they should both have been labeled with a B because salary is
a business expense. Tr. 462-63; see Tr. 464 (“if a business pays employees payroll or salaries,
it’s usually labeled a business expense”). On further questioning, Fortenberry backtracked and
professed uncertainty as to how to label them. Tr. 465. For his part, Mr. Odom said he
categorized these expenses as indicated by Fortenberry’s annotations. Tr. 616.
Fortenberry also did not know what he purchased on September 13, 2010, at a business
named Skinny’s. Tr. 467; see Div. Ex. 78 at 0132. He nonetheless labeled that expense with a
B. Div. Ex. 78 at 0132. Likewise, although he was sure he did not spend Premier funds on
alcohol, he could not be sure what he purchased at Hollywood Liquors on September 27, 2010.
Tr. 468; Div. Ex. 78 at 0132. As with other expenses of which he was uncertain, this one was
annotated with a B. Div. Ex. 78 at 0132. Further questioning revealed that Fortenberry also
listed the cost of airline tickets for family members as business expenses. See Tr. 471-72.
Toward the end of questioning about his annotations, Fortenberry was left to claim the
annotations were “subject to further conversation” with Mr. Odom. Tr. 469. That “further
conversation” never occurred, however, because Fortenberry never identified any errors to Mr.
Odom. Tr. 619.
The Division’s investigation also revealed more irregularities, including evidence that
Fortenberry’s connection to Breadstreet.com was closer than he claimed. For example, several
of the initial payments to Halsey Management were sent from a Breadstreet.com account. See
Div. Ex. 5 at 25-27. Additionally, Fortenberry paid “bonuses” from Premier’s account to
Breadstreet.com employees. On September 29, 2010, Fortenberry wrote David Kent, whom
Fortenberry said managed the Breadstreet.com office, a $2,500 check with the word “bonus”
written on the memo line. Tr. 426-27; Div. Ex. 42 at 3016. Fortenberry said this was a “finder’s
fee,” but could not say what Mr. Kent found. Tr. 426-28. Instead, he vaguely said that “it would
21

bank statements as Exhibit C in the appendix.
18

stand to reason that with a success that everybody is working on that a bonus would be a
reasonable way of saying, hey, you’re doing a great job.” Tr. 427. Because Premier had no
employees, Premier never earned any money, and Fortenberry was only successful in soliciting
two investors, it is not clear what “success” it was that “everybody” was “working on.” Tr. 229,
239. When asked whether he was authorized under the subscription agreement to give bonuses
to nonemployees, Fortenberry non-responsively retorted that payments to contractors were
“acceptable” under the tax code. Tr. 428.
Two other Breadstreet.com employees also received “bonus” checks from Premier’s
account on September 29, 2010. Tr. 436. Chris Kelly received $5,000 and Margarita
Damianova received $2,500. Div. Ex. 42 at 3020-21. The three “bonus” checks to
Breadstreet.com employees, totaling $10,000, show that Fortenberry not only co-mingled his
personal and business finances, but that he co-mingled funds among his business interests.
The Division called Kevin M. Pierce to testify as an expert witness. See Tr. 777. Mr.
Pierce also submitted an expert report. See Div. Ex. 149. Mr. Pierce is a certified fraud
examiner and is certified in financial forensics. Tr. 780. Without contradiction, Mr. Pierce said
that Premier’s financial statements were not GAAP-compliant. Tr. 781. In his report, he
explained that Premier’s financial statements do not meet substantially all of the basic
requirements of financial reporting under GAAP. Div. Ex. 149 at 9-11; see id. at 5 (stating that
Premier’s financial statements “omit[ted] a substantial amount of the statements and disclosures
. . . required by GAAP”). Additionally, whereas “[f]inancial statements prepared in accordance
with GAAP are required to use the accrual basis of accounting,” the compilations Mr. Odom
prepared used cash basis accounting. Id. at 9.
Mr. Pierce highlighted other problems, as well. Because Premier’s financial statements
were not prepared until 2013, they were not useful to investors in 2010 and 2011. Div. Ex. 149
at 13-14. Premier also had no accounting system. Id. at 14. And Fortenberry kept no
documentation, such as receipts or invoices, which could be used to verify whether expenses
were legitimate business expenses. Id. Further, Premier never filed tax returns. Id.
Based on his investigation, Mr. Pierce concluded that $500,900 was received from
investors. Div. Ex. 149 at 15. This amount included $208,000 received by Fortenberry as a loan
from Dr. Anderson. Id. at 14-15, Ex. C. Because Fortenberry failed to transfer these funds to
Premier, Mr. Pierce could not “determine how the $208,000 . . . was ultimately expended.” Id. at
17. Mr. Pierce concluded that although $151,500 was actually invested in Halsey Management,
Fortenberry spent at least $317,000 on himself. Tr. 781; Div. Ex. 149 at 6, 15. Owing to an
absence of records, Mr. Pierce could not account for the balance of approximately $32,000. Tr.
781; Div. Ex. 149 at 6. He calculated that the last day Premier invested money in Halsey
Management was December 16, 2010. Tr. 785.
With respect to compensation, Mr. Pierce opined that “general partners of hedge funds
often times charge a 2% management fee (2% of the fund’s assets) as well as a performance fee
for as much as 20% of the annual gains.” Div. Ex. 149 at 17-18. Using these percentages as a
model, Mr. Pierce calculated that “Fortenberry would have been entitled to a maximum fee of
$3,030. Id. at 18.
19

By contrast, Fortenberry testified that he was entitled to a salary. Tr. 279-81. He
believed that he should be paid between $150,000 and $200,000 per year. Tr. 439, 511-12. This
belief was based on Fortenberry’s internet research that revealed that “as a general rule a person
that’s in the early stage business like this will make” roughly that amount of money. Tr. 439,
511-12. Fortenberry never disclosed this to any investor. Tr. 439-40. And because he did not
keep track of salary payments to himself or payments in lieu of salary, he had no way of
knowing whether he had reached that figure. Tr. 587-88.
Indeed, Fortenberry did not pay taxes on the payments he made to himself or the money
he paid out of Premier’s account for his own expenses. Tr. 291-92. When confronted with this
fact, he suggested that money he used for personal expenses might be considered a debt on
which he would not owe taxes. Tr. 291. That testimony, of course, is contradicted by what
Fortenberry told Mr. Odom and Fortenberry’s own testimony that he was entitled to a salary,
which he took.
F.

Fortenberry was not credible

As the preceding discussion of the facts suggests, Fortenberry was not credible. Indeed,
the record is replete with his outright false statements, many of which he attempted to explain
through imaginative use of the English language seemingly inspired by Humpty Dumpty. 22
A prime example of this concerned Bongiovi Entertainment. Recall that Premier never
invested in Bongiovi Entertainment. Tr. 238-39. Yet Fortenberry variously described Bongiovi
Entertainment to investors as Premier’s “showcase investment,” Div. Ex. 64 at 0353, an entity
with which Premier was “partnering,” Div. Ex. 82 at 0681, and part of Premier’s “portfolio,” Tr.
373, Div. Ex. 53 at 0039. Fortenberry thus intended to convey the false impression that Premier
had invested in Bongiovi Entertainment and intended to continue to do so.
When he was questioned about his use of the term “showcase” in light of the fact that
Premier had never invested with Mr. Bongiovi, Fortenberry said, “[w]ell, that’s why we referred
to it as our showcase. It is a showcase. It is not something that’s invested in yet, according to
my terminology, but it is something yet to be invested in. A showcase is an example.” Tr.
267-68. But saying that something is a company’s “showcase” investment means that one is
saying that the investment is perhaps the most important venture in which the company is
currently investing. It would not convey the impression the venture is merely an example of a
venture in which the company might invest in the future.
With respect to the term “partnering,” when asked how it could be that Premier was
partnering with Bongiovi Entertainment in light of the fact Premier had not invested in Bongiovi,
Fortenberry said he had met with Mr. Bongiovi and that “there was a lot happening.” Tr.
334-36; see Tr. 591 (claiming that partnering was a “loose term” that meant “we had developed a

more nor less.’” Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There, ch. 6
(1871).
20

relationship”). Whatever he meant by this explanation, it was apparent that Premier had not
“partnered” with Bongiovi Entertainment.
Fortenberry’s explanation of his statement that Bongiovi Entertainment had been added
to Premier’s portfolio was similarly nonsensical. He explained that “portfolio covers a broad
range of things, but it certainly was an investment that upon the Halseys having such an interest
in managing and providing music for it that we had added to our portfolio company.” Tr. 373.
In other words, according to Fortenberry, Bongiovi Entertainment was in Premier’s “portfolio”
because Premier or Halsey Management might invest in it in the future. For Fortenberry,
therefore, Bongiovi Entertainment was in Premier’s portfolio even though it was not in Premier’s
portfolio.
Division counsel asked Fortenberry whether he had paid Dr. Anderson anything on the
note he had executed with Dr. Anderson. Tr. 349-50. Fortenberry denied that he had failed to
pay Dr. Anderson any money on the note and said “[t]he money that was delivered to him in
those quarterly statements on Premier investment letterhead was money paid based on this note.”
Tr. 349. Of course, the figures listed in the statements were invented and did not represent actual
money.
Indeed, the record contains a host of instances in which Fortenberry simply lied or
quibbled about semantics or inconsequential details. For example, he lied when he said Jim
Halsey created the Halsey Institute and lied when he said Jim Halsey authorized him to use the h
and i logo for the Halsey Institute. As discussed above, the institute did not exist and
Fortenberry took the logo from the website for the Halsey Institute for Contemporary Art at the
College of Charleston. He also lied when he said that he “obviously” did not intend to convey
that Dr. Anderson had received returns on his Premier investment. Tr. 379. This was in fact
precisely what he was trying to convey.
During the Division’s investigation, Fortenberry refused to comply with the Division’s
subpoenas and forced the Division to go to district court to enforce its subpoenas. See Schuster
Declaration at 2-4. According to Fortenberry, successfully delaying his investigative testimony
for eighteen months, based on the argument that the District of Columbia lacked jurisdiction over
him, did not show that he was uncooperative.23 See Tr. 414-16; Schuster Declaration at 3.
During the hearing, the Division presented a video showing Fortenberry soliciting investors in
2012 for a company called First Choice Energy Partners. Tr. 508; Div. Ex. 110. In the video,
Fortenberry said that First Choice offers a “no dry holes guarantee.” Tr. 510. In other words, as
in 2004 and with Mr. Nasti, he was guaranteeing returns. When asked about this fact,
Fortenberry said that he did not guarantee returns and instead, simply repeated what a
subcontractor guaranteed. Tr. 509-10. This is not even specious. In the video, Fortenberry was
First Choice’s spokesman. He thus guaranteed returns.
Fortenberry’s demeanor also suggested that he was not being truthful. He often resorted
to the words “obviously” or “clearly” as if through bluster he hoped to cause the listener not to

I take official notice, under 17 C.F.R. § 201.323, of the content of Fortenberry’s motion to
dismiss filed with the district court.
21

notice what had actually occurred, much like the Wizard of Oz when standing behind an opened
curtain. See Tr. 364, 379, 380, 387-89, 431, 461, 464, 470, 483, 535-36. Pertinent examples of
these statements include: (1) saying that Dr. Anderson “obviously” made his first Premier
investment check out to Fortenberry “without being asked,” Tr. 364; (2) saying that he
“obviously” did not intend to convey in his monthly letters that Dr. Anderson had received
returns on his Premier investment, Tr. 379; and (3) saying that Dr. Anderson’s subscription
agreement “clearly identified a 12 percent interest,” Tr. 388-89. That these statements were
often delivered sarcastically only added to the perception that Fortenberry was not telling the
truth.
Fortenberry sometimes adopted a lecturing tone as if trying to convey the impression that
he was so experienced in matters of finance and securities that the Division’s attorneys were
simply not intelligent enough to understand his business. He thus hoped to make his unlikely
statements believable. The most egregious example of this concerned Fortenberry’s December
2010 letter to Dr. Anderson in which he referred to Dr. Anderson’s “Premier Investment Fund
earnings for November in the amount of . . . 1%” of what Dr. Anderson had already invested.
Div. Ex. 73 at 0029. Fortenberry told Division counsel that “[a]nyone with an IQ above 90”
would “know” he was referring to interest, rather than investment earnings. Tr. 387; see Tr.
379-81 (testifying that when he referred to Premier Investment Fund earnings, he was referring
to interest payments). Fortenberry’s lecture about “today’s world,” in which bank statements
and “software like Quicken” are sufficient to meet record-keeping requirements was in a similar
vein. See Tr. 298-301.
Finally, I cannot ignore the fact Fortenberry admittedly failed to pay taxes on his earnings
and, as discussed below, repeatedly committed fraud. These facts further support the
determination that he is not credible. See United States. v. Bustamante, 45 F.3d 933, 946 (5th
Cir. 1995) (“the failure to report income” is “relevant to the issue of honesty”); cf. Alim v.
Gonzales, 446 F.3d 1239, 1255 (11th Cir. 2006) (holding that where a petitioner “committed
multiple acts of fraud,” substantial evidence supported an agency’s adverse credibility
determination).

III. ISSUE
The antifraud provisions prohibit frauds committed in connection with the offer,
purchase, or sale of securities. Fortenberry made numerous material false statements and
omissions in order to induce investments. Did Fortenberry violate the antifraud provisions?
IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
A. Antifraud liability
1. Legal Principles
Fortenberry is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Securities Act Section
17(a), Exchange Act Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5. Section 17(a) of the Securities Act provides
that:
It shall be unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any
securities . . . directly or indirectly
(1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, or
(2) to obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement
of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading; or
(3) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business
which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the
purchaser.
15 U.S.C. § 77q(a). The terms “sale” and “offer” are “define[d] broadly,” such that they
“encompass the entire selling process.” United States v. Naftalin, 441 U.S. 768, 773 (1979); see
15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(3).
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act makes it:
unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly. . .
....
(b) To use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of
any security . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or
contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the
Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors.

15 U.S.C. § 78j(b). Rule 10b-5 makes it:
unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly . . .
(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,
(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, or
(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which
operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,
in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. Together, “Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 prohibit fraudulent practices in
connection with the purchase or sale of a security.” United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285,
1297 (2d Cir. 1991).
To establish liability under Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act, the Division must show that Fortenberry “acted with scienter.” Gregory O.
Trautman, Exchange Act Release No. 61167, 2009 SEC LEXIS 4173, at *52 (Dec. 15, 2009);
see Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 695-97 (1980). To establish a violation of Section 17(a)(2) and
(3) of the Securities Act, the Division need only show negligence. Aaron, 446 U.S. at 696-97;
Trautman, 2009 SEC LEXIS 4173, at *52.
“[T]he term ‘scienter’ refers to a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or
defraud.” Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 n.12 (1976). The term “includes
recklessness, defined in this context as ‘an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care
. . . to the extent that the danger was either known to the [respondent] or so obvious that the
[respondent] must have been aware of it.’” Trautman, 2009 SEC LEXIS 4173, at *61 (quoting
Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd. v. Tellabs Inc., 513 F.3d 702, 704 (7th Cir. 2008)). “Scienter may
be inferred from circumstantial evidence.” Brian A. Schmidt, Exchange Act Release No. 45330,
2002 SEC LEXIS 3424, at *31 (Jan. 24, 2002) (relying on Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston,
459 U.S. 375, 390 n.30 (1983)).
In addition to establishing the requisite mental state, the Division must show that
Fortenberry “engaged in fraudulent conduct, [and] that such conduct was in connection with the
offer, sale, or purchase of securities. Trautman, 2009 SEC LEXIS 4173, at *52. To show that
Fortenberry “engaged in fraudulent conduct,” the Division must show that he:
(1) made an untrue statement of material fact; (2) omitted a fact
that made a prior statement misleading; or (3) committed a
deceptive or manipulative act as part of a scheme to defraud.

24

Id. at *53. If one has a duty to speak, an omission of material fact is the equivalent of an untrue
statement of material fact. John J. Kenny, Securities Act Release No. 8234, 2003 SEC LEXIS
1170, at *23 (May 14, 2003).
Fortenberry is also charged with violating Advisers Act Section 206(1), (2), and (4) and
Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. Subsections (1), (2), and (4) of Section 206 make it:
unlawful for any investment adviser, by use of the mails or any
means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, directly or
indirectly-(1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client
or prospective client;
(2) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business
which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective
client;
...
(4) to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which is
fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative. The Commission shall, for
the purposes of this paragraph (4) by rules and regulations define,
and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent, such acts,
practices, and courses of business as are fraudulent, deceptive, or
manipulative.
15 U.S.C. § 80b-6(1), (2), (4). As with Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b)
of the Exchange Act, the Division must show that Fortenberry acted with scienter in order to
establish a violation of subsection (1) of Section 206. See Vernazza v. SEC, 327 F.3d 851, 85960 (9th Cir. 2003); SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d 636, 641 & n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1992). A showing of
negligence, however, is sufficient to establish a violation of subsections (2) and (4). Vernazza,
327 F.3d at 859-60; Steadman, 967 F.2d at 643 n.5, 647.
Section “206 establishes ‘federal fiduciary standards’ to govern the conduct of
investment advisers.” Transamerica Mortg. Advisors v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 17 (1979) (quoting
Santa Fe Indus. v. Green, 430 U.S. 462, 471 n.11 (1977)). Investment advisers must therefore
fully disclose all material facts and “employ reasonable care to avoid misleading [their] clients.”
Montford & Co., Investment Advisers Act Release No. 3829, 2014 SEC LEXIS 1529, at *50
(May 2, 2014).
Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-8 provides:
(a) Prohibition. It shall constitute a fraudulent, deceptive, or
manipulative act, practice, or course of business within the
meaning of section 206(4) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80b-6(4)) for any
investment adviser to a pooled investment vehicle to:
25

(1) Make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit
to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
made, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, to any investor or prospective
investor in the pooled investment vehicle; or
(2) Otherwise engage in any act, practice, or course of
business that is fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative with
respect to any investor or prospective investor in the pooled
investment vehicle.
17 C.F.R. § 276.206(4)-8.
2. Fortenberry made numerous false material statements and omitted material
information in order to induce Dr. Anderson and Mr. Nasti to invest
Fortenberry lied, repeatedly, to Dr. Anderson and Mr. Nasti. He promised to do things he
had no intention of doing. He reported news about Premier that was wholly invented.
Fortenberry’s lies were material and induced his victims to invest $298,000. Once he had his
victim’s money in his hands, Fortenberry proceeded to spend that money for his own personal
expenses. Fortenberry’s lies were made in connection with the offer, purchase, and sale of
securities.
A. Fortenberry lied about his salary and failed to disclose how he
intended to receive it
Before they invested, Fortenberry led Dr. Anderson and Mr. Nasti to believe that his
compensation would consist solely of profit he received as an owner of Premier units when he
actually intended to take a salary. Tr. 61, 695. When Mr. Nasti specifically asked how
Fortenberry would be compensated, Fortenberry said that he would be compensated through
profit based on his ownership of Premier units. Tr. 61. He did not say that he would also receive
a salary. Tr. 76. And he never told either Mr. Nasti or Dr. Anderson that, based on what he had
read on the internet, he felt entitled to a salary of up to $200,000. Tr. 439.
Fortenberry also omitted several material facts about how he intended to draw and
account for his salary. Fortenberry did not pay himself a salary designated as such. Instead, he
treated Premier’s bank account in the same manner one might treat a personal account. He thus
drew money directly out of Premier’s account, effectively treating those withdrawals as
payments in lieu of salary. Tr. 450; Div. Ex. 149 at 15-16. But Fortenberry kept no records, no
receipts, and no invoices. Div. Ex. 149 at 16. As a result, he had no way of knowing whether
his expenditures in lieu of salary had reached his salary limit or not. Tr. 587-88. Any reasonable
investor would want to know that a fund’s general partner intended to treat the fund’s account
like his own personal account.
It is true, as Fortenberry contended during the hearing, that the subscription agreements
permitted him to take a reasonable salary. Div. Exs. 45 at 2, 56 at 0190, 70 at 0074. But these
26

provisions, which Fortenberry did not call to the attention of his victims, did not alter the fact
that he had already told Dr. Anderson and Mr. Nasti that he would only be compensated in profit.
In other words, they do not make true the material false statements he had already conveyed or
eliminate the material omissions.
Moreover, even if the salary language in the subscription agreement could have remedied
the existing lies, the subscription agreements only permitted “reasonable” salary expenses. See
Div. Exs. 45 at 2, 56 at 0190, 70 at 0074. Almost by definition, however, Fortenberry’s
payments to himself were not reasonable. When he used money from Premier’s account as if it
were his own personal account, he treated payments to businesses such as Starbucks, Victorios
Pizza, and Hollywood Liquors, as payments in lieu of salary. See Div. Ex. 41 at 2936. But by
failing to keep records, receipts, or invoices, and by spending money directly out of Premier’s
account without regard for the propriety of his expenditures, Fortenberry made it impossible to
determine whether his expenses were legitimate. As Division counsel demonstrated when he
questioned Fortenberry about his after-the-fact annotations on Premier’s bank statements,
Fortenberry’s annotations were unreliable. As a result, he had no “reasonable” salary expenses.
Fortenberry thus made material misrepresentations and omissions about his salary.
B. Fortenberry repeatedly lied to Dr. Anderson and Mr. Nasti in their
subscription agreements
Fortenberry told Dr. Anderson and Mr. Nasti in their subscription agreements that
Premier would use GAAP “in keeping its books and records.” Div. Exs. 45 at 1, 56 at 0189, 70
at 0073. This was false for two reasons. First, Fortenberry had no clue what complying with
GAAP entailed. Tr. 589-90, 618-19. He thus did not intend to fulfill this promise.
Second, by saying that he would use GAAP “in keeping [Premier’s] books and records,”
he demonstrated his understanding that investors would expect him to keep books and records.
Yet, Fortenberry kept no books or records. Tr. 297; Div. Ex. 149 at 16. Indeed, during the
hearing, he insisted that in order to run his investment company, he only needed to rely on
account statements from Premier’s bank. Tr. 297-98. There can be no doubt that if Mr. Nasti,
Dr. Anderson, or any reasonable investor were told about this absurd perspective, they would not
have invested with Premier. Indeed, it is likely any reasonable investor would laugh if told that
Fortenberry planned to rely only on bank statements. Fortenberry’s false statement that he
would keep records, and his omission that he intended to keep no records other than bank
statements, were thus both material.
Fortenberry also falsely said in the subscription agreements that investors would each
have a capital account and would receive a profit and loss statement by January 31. Div. Ex. 45
at 1-3; Div. Ex. 56 at 0189-90; Div. Ex. 70 at 0073-74. Fortenberry, however, had no idea what
a capital account was and never supplied a profit and loss statement. Tr. 296. Indeed, he
opined—based on no evident experience whatsoever—that keeping a balance sheet or an income
statement would not be typical for a company such as Premier. Tr. 296-97. But, saying you will
do something you do not intend to do is a lie. See United States ex rel. Grenadyor v. Ukrainian
Village Pharmacy, 772 F.3d 1102, 1105 (7th Cir. 2014) (“If you say ‘I agree’ [to abide by the
Medicare laws] when you don’t agree, you’re making a false statement.”).
27

Fortenberry also omitted from his communications with investors the fact that he was
subject to cease-and-desist orders issued by Texas and Pennsylvania securities authorities.24 Tr.
42-43, 62, 720; see Div. Exs. 9, 10. Although Fortenberry claims otherwise, because he
controlled Premier, his securities disciplinary history is material. Philip A. Lehman, Exchange
Act Release No. 54660, 2006 SEC LEXIS 2498, at *8 & n.12 (Oct. 27, 2006). In fact, neither
Dr. Anderson nor Mr. Nasti would have invested with Fortenberry had they known about those
orders.25 Tr. 62-63, 720.
C. Fortenberry lied to Mr. Nasti in the Starmaker Brochure
Fortenberry induced Mr. Nasti to invest by e-mailing him the Starmaker Brochure in
which Fortenberry promised Mr. Nasti a fantastic return. Tr. 58-59, 67-69; see Div. Ex. 56 at
0183-88. Fortenberry not only promised a 12% return, he also said that Starmaker would gross
$30 million per month and “each investor will be paid thirty five thousand dollars per month for
the rest of his or her life.” Div. Ex. 56 at 0183. These promises were part of the basis for Mr.
Nasti’s investment. See id. Because the information Fortenberry conveyed regarding returns
and profits would be relevant to any reasonable investor’s decision to invest, this information
was material. Promised returns of this nature, however, are “inherently misleading.” Philip A.
Lehman, 2006 SEC LEXIS 2498, at *8. Moreover, based on what Sherman Halsey told him,
Fortenberry knew or should have known these figures were either inaccurate or unrealistically
optimistic. Div. Ex. 5 at 29; see id. at 21 (stating that Fortenberry knew that for the Halsey
Management “entities to work,” he had to contribute at least $1.5 million).
Fortenberry also lied about the breadth of Premier’s involvement with Halsey
Management. In the Starmaker Brochure, he invented entities that did not exist in order to create
a false impression. Specially, the graphical display he invented included Thundercast,
24

As discussed below, Fortenberry was an investment adviser. As a result, he was a fiduciary of
his victims and thus had a duty to disclose material information. Montford & Co., 2014 SEC
LEXIS 1529, at *50-51. As such, his omissions are actionable. I thus reject Fortenberry’s
suggestion that his victims are to blame for not researching his background, research that may
have been futile in light of Fortenberry’s use of different names. Resp. Br. at 11-12; cf. Miller v.
Thane Int’l., Inc., 519 F.3d 879, 887 & n.2 (9th Cir. 2008) (holding, in an action under Securities
Act Section 12(a)(2), 15 U.S.C. § 77l(a)(2), that the fact “truthful information is available
elsewhere does not relieve a defendant from liability for misrepresentations in a given filing or
statement”); John P. Flannery, Securities Act Release No. 9689, 2014 SEC LEXIS 4981, at
*72-73 (Dec. 15, 2014) (addressing liability under Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5(b), and Section
17(a)(2) and holding that the public availability of accurate information does not relieve a
respondent of liability for a misrepresentation).
25

Because the test of materiality is objective, “‘the reaction of individual investors is not
determinative of materiality.’” S.W. Hatfield, CPA, Exchange Act Release No. 73763, 2014 SEC
LEXIS 4691, at *23 (Dec. 5, 2014) (quoting David Henry Disraeli, Exchange Act Release No.
57027, 2007 SEC LEXIS 3015, at *23 (Dec. 21, 2007)). The subjective reactions of Dr.
Anderson and Mr. Nasti are nonetheless informative and serve to confirm the evident materiality
of Fortenberry’s omissions.
28

Halseyjobs.com, and the Halsey Institute, none of which existed. Div. Ex. 5 at 31-32; see Div.
Ex. 56 at 0186. Indeed, Fortenberry took the logo he used for the invented Halsey Institute from
the website for the Halsey Institute for Contemporary Art at the College of Charleston. Compare
http://halsey.cofc.edu/, with Div. Ex. 56 at 0186. Fortenberry also included Sonicbids in the
graphical display, but the Halseys had no ownership interest in it. Div. Ex. 5 at 31.
Fortenberry claimed that the he did not lie about the 12% return because Sherman Halsey
guaranteed him returns in the contract between Halsey Management and Premier. Tr. 544-46,
554, 583-84; see Div. Ex. 39 at 6264-65. Specifically, Fortenberry testified that the dilution
provision represented a guaranteed return. I do not believe that Fortenberry thought the dilution
provision provided a guarantee, however, because the provision’s plain language says nothing
about a guaranteed return. Div. Ex. 39 at 6264-65. And, Fortenberry never testified that he
negotiated such a guarantee with Sherman Halsey. Further, Sherman Halsey told Fortenberry
that the $30 million per month figure in the Starmaker Brochure, the apparent basis for the
promised 12% return, was inaccurate. Div. Ex. 5 at 29.
Moreover, even if Fortenberry thought the dilution provision might be a guarantee that he
would receive a 12% return, he was absurdly reckless in not verifying that understanding with
Sherman Halsey or his counsel, Mr. Nimmer. And he was doubly reckless to purportedly rely on
that previously unmentioned guarantee when promising a like return to Mr. Nasti.
D.

Fortenberry repeatedly lied to Dr. Anderson in the letters and statements
he mailed to Dr. Anderson

Fortenberry lied to Dr. Anderson in his August 31, 2010, letter, which falsely stated that
Bongiovi Entertainment had been added to Premier’s “portfolio.” Div. Ex. 53 at 0039.
Fortenberry continued to lie to Dr. Anderson in the monthly and quarterly statements he mailed
to Dr. Anderson. In November 2010, he told Dr. Anderson that Dr. Anderson should reinvest his
monthly earnings on his Premier investment. Div. Ex. 69 at 0033. As Fortenberry intended, this
gave Dr. Anderson the impression that Premier was earning money when it had actually earned
nothing. On the basis of this assertion and others, Fortenberry stated that Premier believed that
“this is the best time to re-invest investor earnings.” Id. Fortenberry also falsely gave Dr.
Anderson the impression that Premier had invested in a Christmas film produced by Bongiovi
Entertainment, when it had not, thus conveying a materially false impression of the depth and
breadth of Premier’s investments. Tr. 709; see Div. Ex. 69 at 0035.
Fortenberry then continued his charade for months, falsely trumpeting Dr. Anderson’s
earnings. Div. Exs. 73, 79, 84, 89, 112, 153-56. Not surprisingly, the language in these letters
convinced Dr. Anderson that his investment had earned money. Tr. 710-15. These lies were
material because they were designed to induce further investment. Any reasonable investor
would want to know whether the capital he or she had already committed was earning returns.

29

3. Fortenberry violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act
As noted, in order to demonstrate liability under Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act and
10(b) of the Exchange Act, the Division must show that Fortenberry “engaged in fraudulent
conduct, that such conduct was in connection with the offer, sale, or purchase of securities, and
that he acted with scienter,” or in the case of Section 17(a)(2) and (3), with negligence.
Trautman, 2009 SEC LEXIS 4173, at *52. An untrue statement of material fact or omission of a
fact that made a prior statement misleading suffices to demonstrate fraudulent conduct. Id. at
*53. “A fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would
consider it important in determining how to act.” Philip A. Lehman, 2006 SEC LEXIS 2498, at
*9 n.11. The Division easily meets these requirements.
Fortenberry’s false statements, detailed above, are legion. 26 He lied about his salary,
complying with GAAP, creating capital accounts, keeping books and records, and preparing
profit and loss statements. He falsely guaranteed Mr. Nasti returns and lied about the ventures
with which Premier was involved. He lied to Dr. Anderson every time he mailed Dr. Anderson
invoices with invented earnings. He failed to disclose how he intended to draw his salary. He
failed to disclose his disciplinary history. All of these false statements and omissions were
material because they are things that a reasonable investor would consider important before
investing.
Fortenberry’s statements and omissions were made in connection with the offer,
purchase, and sale of securities, to wit, units of Premier. See SEC v. Edwards, 540 U.S. 389, 393
(2004) (a “security” includes “virtually any instrument that might be sold as an investment,” “in
whatever form they are made and by whatever name they are called” (internal quotation marks
omitted)). Fortenberry carried out his scheme by using electronic and regular mail, which are
instrumentalities of interstate commerce. See United States v. Barlow, 568 F.3d 215, 220 (5th
Cir. 2009); SEC v. Solucorp Indus., Ltd., 274 F.Supp.2d 379, 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).
Fortenberry also acted with scienter. Each of his false statements and omissions was
intentional or so hopelessly reckless as to amount to the same thing. Fortenberry knew he
invented the graphic in the Starmaker Brochure and, because it had no basis in fact, knew he
could not guarantee Mr. Nasti a 12% return. He knew he had no intention of doing the things he
promised to do in the subscription agreement—he did not even know what some of the things
were. He knew Premier had no earnings, yet falsely told Dr. Anderson that he was earning
money. And Fortenberry did that because he wanted Dr. Anderson to give him more money.
Indeed, each of the misrepresentations and omissions identified above were part of a scheme to
26

Fortenberry had authority over the content of each statement in the subscription agreements,
monthly and quarterly letters to Dr. Anderson, and the Starmaker Brochure, and decided whether
and how to communicate those statements. See Tr. 72, 234, 236, 276-77, 358, 376, 386, 390,
392, 395, 399, 404-06, 411-12, 704; Div. Exs. 69, 73, 79, 84, 112, 153-56. As a result, he was
the “maker” of the false statements in the subscription agreements, monthly and quarterly letters
to Dr. Anderson, and the Starmaker Brochure. See Janus Capital Grp., Inc. v. First Derivative
Traders, 131 S. Ct. 2296, 2302 (2011).
30

defraud his investors by using deceit and manipulation to convince them to trust Fortenberry
with their investments. Fortenberry thus violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section
10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.
4.

Fortenberry violated Section 206 of the Advisers Act

At the threshold, Fortenberry claims the Advisers Act does not apply to him because he
was not an investment advisor. Resp. Br. at 16. In this regard, an investment adviser is a
“person who, for compensation, engages in the business of advising others . . . as to the value of
securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities, or who, for
compensation and as part of a regular business, issues or promulgates analyses or reports
concerning securities.” 15 U.S.C. § 80b-2(a)(11). Fortenberry falls within the terms of this
definition.
First, as he testified, Fortenberry received compensation as Premier’s general partner. Tr.
279. Second, Dr. Anderson and Mr. Nasti were Fortenberry’s clients, whom he advised
regarding investments in securities. It is true that ordinarily, a fund adviser’s client is the fund,
not the limited partners. See Goldstein v. SEC, 451 F.3d 873, 876 (D.C. Cir. 2006). If, however,
the general partner’s relationship with a limited partner is more akin to that of an investment
adviser to a client, then the general partner will be regarded as an investment adviser to that
limited partner. See Goldenson v. Steffens, 802 F. Supp. 2d 240, 267-68 (D. Me. 2011); see also
United States v. Lay, 612 F.3d 440, 446-47 (6th Cir. 2010).
Here, Premier had only two investors and Premier served simply as a conduit for their
investments. Fortenberry met individually with Dr. Anderson and Mr. Nasti. With respect to Dr.
Anderson, Fortenberry co-mingled his personal and business finances in multiple letters and
statements and relied on his personal relationship with Dr. Anderson to induce investment. With
respect to Mr. Nasti, Fortenberry made specific promises as to how money would be invested, in
accordance with Mr. Nasti’s personal investment goals. Given these facts, Fortenberry’s
relationship with Dr. Anderson and Mr. Nasti evidenced an adviser-client relationship.
Fortenberry was thus an investment adviser to Mr. Nasti and Dr. Anderson. See Goldenson, 802
F. Supp. 2d at 268. In consequence, the Advisers Act applies to Fortenberry. Because
Fortenberry qualified as an investment adviser, he owed his clients a fiduciary duty, which he
breached, to disclose material facts and use reasonable care to avoid misleading them. See
Montford & Co., 2014 SEC LEXIS 1529, at *50.
The determination that Fortenberry is liable for violating Sections 17(a) and 10(b) largely
resolves the question of his liability for violating Section 206. See SEC v. Rana Research, Inc., 8
F.3d 1358, 1363, n.4 (9th Cir. 1993) (“Section 206 parallels section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in
prohibiting ‘any act, practice, or course of business which is fraudulent, deceptive or
manipulative.’”); SEC v. Haligiannis, 470 F. Supp. 2d 373, 383 (S.D.N.Y. 2007); SEC v. Blavin,
557 F. Supp. 1304, 1315 (D. Mich. 1983). As noted above, he used the means of interstate
commerce and mail to carry out his scheme. He acted with scienter, and the conduct described
above was fraudulent, deceptive, and involved repeated material misstatements and omissions.
Fortenberry thus violated Advisers Act Section 206(1), (2), and (4) and Rule 206(4)-8
thereunder.
31

V. SANCTIONS
The Division requests a cease-and-desist order, a permanent collateral bar, disgorgement
of $318,500, and civil monetary penalties totaling $1,500,000. Div. Br. at 38-44. As discussed
below, Fortenberry is (1) ordered to cease-and-desist from committing or causing violations of
Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5
thereunder, and Section 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder;
(2) permanently barred from the industry; (3) ordered to disgorge $146,500; and (4) ordered to
pay third-tier penalties totaling $900,000.
A.

Sanction Considerations

In determining the appropriateness of any remedial sanction in this proceeding, I am
guided by the public interest factors set forth in Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir.
1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981); see Gary M. Kornman, Exchange Act
Release No. 59403, 2009 SEC LEXIS 367, at *22 (Feb. 13, 2009), pet. denied, 592 F.3d 173
(D.C. Cir. 2010). These factors include:
the egregiousness of the respondent’s actions, the isolated or
recurrent nature of the infraction, the degree of scienter involved,
the sincerity of the respondent’s assurances against future
violations, the respondent’s recognition of the wrongful nature of
his or her conduct, and the likelihood that the respondent’s
occupation will present opportunities for future violations.
Kornman, 2009 SEC LEXIS 367, at *22. The Commission also considers the age of the
violation and the degree of harm to investors and the marketplace resulting from the violation.
Ralph W. LeBlanc, Exchange Act Release No. 48254, 2003 SEC LEXIS 1793, *26 (July 30,
2003). Additionally, in conjunction with other factors, the Commission considers the extent to
which the sanction will have a deterrent effect. Peter Siris, Exchange Act Release No. 71068,
2013 SEC LEXIS 3924, *48 n.72 (Dec. 12, 2013), pet. denied, 773 F.3d 89 (D.C. Cir. 2014).
The “‘inquiry into the appropriate sanction to protect the public interest is . . . flexible . . .
and no one factor is dispositive.’” Kornman, 2009 SEC LEXIS 367 at *22 (quoting David Henry
Disraeli, Exchange Act Release No. 57027, 2007 SEC LEXIS 3015, at *61 (Dec. 21, 2007), pet.
denied, 33 F. App’x 334 (D.C. Cir. 2009)). The determination of what is in the public interest
“extends . . . to the public-at-large,” Christopher A. Lowry, Investment Company Act Release
No. 2052, 2002 SEC LEXIS 2346, at *20 (Aug. 30, 2002), aff’d, 340 F.3d 501 (8th Cir. 2003),
“the welfare of investors as a class[,] and . . . standards of conduct in the securities business
generally,” Arthur Lipper Corp., Exchange Act Release No. 11773, 1975 SEC LEXIS 527, at
*52 (Oct. 24, 1975), penalty modified, pet. otherwise denied, 547 F.2d 171 (2d Cir. 1976). In
assessing an appropriate sanction, I may consider matters outside the scope of the OIP. See
Calais Res. Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 67312, 2012 SEC LEXIS 2023, at *29 n.40 (June
29, 2012).

32

Fortenberry’s case involved repeated fraudulent conduct, making “a severe sanction”
warranted. Toby G. Scammell, Advisers Act Release No. 3961, 2014 SEC LEXIS 4193, at *25
(Oct. 29, 2014) (“Fidelity to the public interest requires a severe sanction when a respondent’s
misconduct involves fraud because the securities business is one in which opportunities for
dishonesty recur constantly.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Fortenberry’s fraudulent
conduct was recurrent; it permeated this case. In many ways, it would be easier to recount the
people to whom he did not lie. He lied to Jim Halsey during their first communication. He lied
to Mr. Nasti. He lied to Dr. Anderson nearly every chance he had. He lied when he testified.
Fortenberry’s conduct reflects a high degree of scienter. He invented figures and entities
in the Starmaker Brochure. He invented investment returns in monthly and quarterly statements
he sent to Dr. Anderson. He promised in the subscription agreements to do things he had no
intention of doing.
Fortenberry showed no recognition of the wrongful nature of his conduct. Indeed, he was
indignant in blaming the Division’s investigation for the collapse of Premier. Tr. 208, 304. To
hear Fortenberry tell it, his complete failure to maintain records or account for expenditures was
the Division’s fault, Tr. 304, and his material false statements were irrelevant. This is
particularly egregious because the Division’s investigation began after Fortenberry failed to keep
any records while freely spending from Premier’s bank account.
Fortenberry’s conduct is clearly likely to continue. During the hearing, the Division
presented evidence that after Premier collapsed, Fortenberry attempted to solicit investors in an
energy company using the same fraudulent lure he used with Mr. Nasti: guaranteed returns. See
Div. Ex. 110.
Finally, Fortenberry has previously been sanctioned, but has failed to heed lessons from
those sanctions. See Div. Exs. 9, 10. Of particular relevance, the Pennsylvania cease-and-desist
order described how Fortenberry offered “projections of 100% return[s] . . . within . . . 12
months.” Div. Ex. 9. That Fortenberry is a repeat offender shows all the more that a severe
sanction is warranted.
B. Cease-and-desist order
Sections 8A of the Securities Act, 21C of the Exchange Act, and 203(k) of the Advisers
Act authorize the Commission to issue a cease-and-desist order against a person who “is
violating, has violated, or is about to violate” any provision of those Acts or rules thereunder. In
deciding whether to issue a cease-and-desist order, I must consider: (1) whether future violations
are reasonably likely; (2) the seriousness of the violations at issue; (3) whether the violations are
isolated or recurrent; (4) Fortenberry’s state of mind; (5) whether he recognizes the wrongful
nature of his conduct; (6) the recency of the violations; (7) “whether the violations caused harm
to investors or the marketplace”; (8) “whether [he] will have the opportunity to commit future
violations”; and (9) the “remedial function [a] cease-and-desist order would serve in the overall
context of any other sanctions sought in the same proceeding.” Gordon Brent Pierce, Securities
Act Release No. 9555, 2014 SEC LEXIS 4544, at *82-83 (Mar. 7, 2014); KPMG Peat Marwick
LLP, Exchange Act Release No. 43862, 2001 SEC LEXIS 98, at *101 (Jan. 19, 2001), recon.
33

denied, Exchange Act Release No. 44050, 2001 SEC LEXIS 422 (Mar. 5, 2001), pet. denied,
289 F.3d 109 (D.C. Cir. 2002).
“Absent evidence to the contrary,” a single past violation ordinarily suffices to establish a
risk of future violations. KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, 2001 SEC LEXIS 98, at *102; see id. at
102-03 (“evidence showing that a respondent violated the law once probably also shows a risk of
repetition that merits our ordering him to cease and desist”). The showing necessary to
demonstrate the likelihood of future violations is “significantly less than that required for an
injunction.” Id. at *114.
Here, a cease-and-desist order is necessary and appropriate. Fortenberry committed
repeated frauds and violated his position as a fiduciary. Fortenberry’s actions cost his investors
substantial amounts of money. He is also a repeat offender, having previously been sanctioned
by Pennsylvania and Texas. Fortenberry’s actions were intentional and he has shown no
appreciation for the wrongfulness of his conduct. Although the violations occurred
approximately three years ago, it is significant that Fortenberry has continued to solicit investors
with dubious claims of guaranteed returns. See Div. Ex. 150 at 3; Div. Ex. 110. But see Tr. 509
(denying that he had guaranteed returns).
Although Fortenberry testified that he currently works for himself doing “nothing but
sell[ing] Microsoft databases of leads,” Tr. 493, his lack of credibility causes me to doubt this
testimony. During the Division’s examination of Fortenberry, he conceded that he provided
leads to a company called Rancher’s Exploration, Tr. 495, and that he “help[s]” run his son’s
business, Tr. 496. Indeed, Dr. Anderson testified that Fortenberry told him that Fortenberry was
working for an oil company in Colorado. Tr. 721.
Fortenberry testified that his twenty-two year-old son Stephen, who resides at
Fortenberry’s address and who had been hospitalized for a period of time, runs a company called
Wattenberg Energy Partners. Tr. 500, 503; see Div. Ex. 122. And Wattenberg’s business
address in Colorado is the same address used by Rancher’s Exploration and a company called
Energy Services. Tr. 502, 506. Additionally, as the Division showed, Fortenberry has been
promoting investment in First Choice Energy Partners. In a video shown during the hearing,
Fortenberry can be seen doing exactly what he did with Premier: luring investors with promises
of guaranteed returns. See Div. Ex. 150 at 3; Div. Ex. 110. Fortenberry thus has the opportunity
to continue to engage in fraudulent conduct.
Given the foregoing, I conclude that it is necessary and appropriate to order Fortenberry
to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Securities Act Section 17(a),
Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Advisers Act Section 206(1), (2),
and (4) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.
C. Collateral Bar
The Division requests a permanent industry-wide collateral bar against Fortenberry. Div.
Br. at 39. Collateral bars are authorized by Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act. 15 U.S.C.

34

§ 80b-3(e)(5), (f). Additionally Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act authorizes a bar
from acting or serving in enumerated registered investment company roles. 15 U.S.C. § 80a-9.
In Ross Mandell, the Commission directed that before imposing an industry-wide bar, an
administrative law judge must “review each case on its own facts to make findings regarding the
respondent’s fitness to participate in the industry in the barred capacities.” Exchange Act
Release No. 71668, 2014 SEC LEXIS 849, at *7-8 (Mar. 7, 2014) (internal quotation marks
omitted). The administrative law judge’s analysis “should be grounded in specific findings
regarding the protective interests to be served by barring the respondent and the risk of future
misconduct.” Id. at 8 (internal quotation marks omitted).
At best, Fortenberry set up an investment company with no idea of how to competently
fulfill his role as a managing general partner. At best, he honestly thought that, no matter his
lack of experience, he was entitled to $200,000 simply by virtue of having a business card that
labeled him as Premier’s general partner. Even if Fortenberry actually believed his absurd
statement that he did not need to keep records beyond bank accounts, he would be a menace
because losing investors’ money is the inevitable consequence of that belief. Even taking
Fortenberry at his word, he is uniquely unqualified to remain in the industry.
Of course, Fortenberry was not credible. He was repeatedly dishonest, showed disregard
for his investors’ funds, and looted Premier for his own benefit. These facts show that
Fortenberry lacks the fitness necessary to remain in the industry. See Mark A. Feathers,
Exchange Act Release No. 73634, 2014 WL 6449870, at *3 (Nov. 18, 2014) (“His repeated
dishonesty and callous disregard for the funds’ investors combined with his contempt for, or at
the very least his misunderstanding of, his responsibilities as a securities professional
demonstrate his unfitness to remain in the securities industry in any capacity.”). Additionally,
Fortenberry’s numerous violations raise an inference that he will engage in future violations.
Tzemach David Netzer Korem, Exchange Act Release No. 70044, 2013 SEC LEXIS 2155, at *24
n.50 (July 26, 2013). Under the circumstances of this proceeding, I find that imposing a
permanent collateral bar best comports with the statutes’ remedial purpose and is in the public
interest for the reasons discussed and the public interest factors weighed above.
D. Disgorgement
Section 8A(e) of the Securities Act, Section 21C(e) of the Exchange Act and Section
203(j) and (k)(5) of the Advisers Act permit the Commission to order disgorgement, including
reasonable interest, in this proceeding. 15 U.S.C. §§ 77h-1(e), 78u-3(e), 80b-3(j), (k)(5).
Disgorgement is equitable in nature and is intended to prevent unjust enrichment and to act as a
deterrent. SEC v. First City Fin. Corp., 890 F.2d 1215, 1230 (D.C. Cir. 1989). A disgorgement
order “need only be a reasonable approximation of profits causally connected to the violation.”
Montford & Co., 2014 SEC LEXIS 1529, at *94 (internal quotation marks omitted). At that
point, “the burden shifts to the respondent to show that the amount of disgorgement is not a
reasonable approximation.” Id. It is thus the case that “[t]he risk of uncertainty in calculating
disgorgement . . . fall[s] on the wrongdoer whose illegal conduct created that uncertainty.” Id.
(internal quotation marks omitted).

Mr. Nasti gave Fortenberry $200,000 and Dr. Anderson gave him $98,000, for a total of
$298,000. Based on Mr. Pierce’s investigation, we know that Premier invested $151,500 in
Halsey Management. Subtracting $151,500 from $298,000, yields a total of $146,500 in unjust
enrichment. According to the Division, however, I should add the $170,000 Fortenberry
transferred from himself as a personal loan to Premier. Div. Br. at 41. This would result in a
disgorgement total of $316,500.27 Id.
I am not willing to go as far as the Division wishes. While it is true that Fortenberry
transferred the $170,000 he owed Dr. Anderson, the Division did not tie that transfer or the
initial loan to any fraudulent conduct in relation to the offer or sale of a security. I would thus
subtract $170,000 from the proposed $316,500 for a total of $146,500.
In regard to this figure, the OIP alleged that Fortenberry induced $300,000 in investments
and that he looted Premier of at least $148,500. OIP at 8,10. It did not address the $170,000
loan. Based on the allegations in the OIP, it would be inappropriate to include the $170,000 in
the total, no matter how much it might appear apt to order Fortenberry to disgorge that amount as
well. Accordingly, I order disgorgement in the amount of $146,500, plus prejudgment interest
calculated from April 1, 2011, through the last day of the month preceding the month in which
disgorgement is paid.28 See 17 C.F.R. § 201.600(a). I will define the prejudgment interest rate
in section seven of this Initial Decision. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.600(b).
E. Civil Penalties
Securities Act Section 8A(g) authorizes the Commission to impose civil monetary
penalties against any person where such penalties are in the public interest and the person has
violated certain provisions of the securities laws. See 15 U.S.C. § 77h-1(g). Exchange Act
Section 21B(a)(2) and Advisers Act Section 203(i)(1)(B) apply in cases, such as this one, that

27

The Division actually calculated that Fortenberry should disgorge $318,500. Div. Br. at 40.
This figure was partly based on the contention that Dr. Anderson invested $100,000. Id. at 14,
40. In a post-hearing filing, however, the Division “submit[ted] that” the evidence “in this
matter establish[es] that Dr. Anderson contributed at least $98,000 to Premier.” See Division’s
Memorandum Regarding Dr. Allen Anderson’s Investment at 3.
28

With respect to Fortenberry’s violations that induced Mr. Nasti’s investments, Fortenberry met
with Mr. Nasti in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on September 13, 2010. This was the date of Mr. Nasti’s
first $100,000 investment. Mr. Nasti made his second $100,000 investment in November 2010.
With respect to Dr. Anderson, Fortenberry’s violations were continuing until Dr. Anderson’s
final investment on March 13, 2011. Given the foregoing, for purposes of Rule 600,
prejudgment interest should be calculated starting April 1, 2011, which is the first day of the
month following Fortenberry’s last violation. In the absence of a proposal breaking down the
prejudgment interest amount by violation date, using the date of the last violation is most
appropriate.
36

were instituted under Section 21C of the Exchange Act and Section 203(k) of the Advisers Act. 29
See 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u-2(a)(2), 80b-3(i)(1)(B). Under Sections 21B(a)(2)(A) and 203(i)(1)(B), a
civil monetary penalty may be imposed based simply on the determination that a respondent has
committed a violation. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u-2(a)(2)(A), 80b-3(i)(1)(B). The statutes set out a
three-tiered system for determining the maximum civil penalty for each act or omission. 15
U.S.C. §§ 77h-1(g), 78u-2(b), 80b-3(i)(2). For the time period at issue, the maximum first,
second, and third-tier penalty for each violation for a natural person is $7,500, $75,000 and
$150,000, respectively. 15 U.S.C. §§ 77h-1(g), 78u-2(b), 80b-3(i); 17 C.F.R. § 201.1004 &
Subpt. E, Table IV (adjusting the statutory amounts for inflation).
A maximum third-tier penalty is permitted if: (1) the violations involved fraud, deceit,
manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement; and (2) such acts or
omissions directly or indirectly resulted in substantial losses or created a significant risk of
substantial losses to other persons or resulted in substantial pecuniary gain to the person who
committed the acts or omissions. 15 U.S.C. §§ 77h-1(g)(2)(C), 78u-2(b)(3), 80b-3(i)(2)(C).
Second-tier penalties may be imposed if the misconduct involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or
deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement. 15 U.S.C. §§ 77h-1(g)(2)(B), 78u2(b)(2), 80b-3(i)(2)(B). First-tier penalties may be imposed simply for each violation. 15 U.S.C.
§§ 77h-1(g)(2)(A), 78u-2(b)(1), 80b-3(i)(2)(A). Although the tier determines the maximum
penalty, “each case ‘has its own particular facts and circumstances which determine the
appropriate penalty to be imposed’” within the tier. SEC v. Opulentica, LLC, 479 F. Supp. 2d
319, 331 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting SEC v. Moran, 944 F. Supp. 286, 296-97 (S.D.N.Y. 1996)). I
thus have discretion in determining the appropriate penalty within a given tier. SEC v. Kern, 425
F.3d 143, 153 (2d Cir. 2005); S.W. Hatfield, CPA, Exchange Act Release No. 73763, 2014 SEC
LEXIS 4691, at *48 (Dec. 5, 2014).
Six factors may be considered in determining whether a penalty is in the public interest.
These include: (1) whether the violation involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or
reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement; (2) the resulting harm to other persons; (3) any
unjust enrichment and prior restitution; (4) the respondent’s prior regulatory record; (5) the need
to deter the respondent and other persons; and (6) such other matters as justice may require. 15
U.S.C. §§ 77h-1(g), 78u-2(c), 80b-3(i)(3).
The statutory requirements for imposition of third-tier penalties are met in this case.
Fortenberry’s violations involved fraud, deceit, and manipulation and his conduct directly
resulted in substantial losses to his investors and substantial pecuniary gain to Fortenberry.
Consideration of the public interest factors likewise supports imposition of third-tier penalties.
As noted, Fortenberry’s conduct involved fraud, deceit, and manipulation. It resulted in
substantial harm to Dr. Anderson and Mr. Nasti, who lost their investments and conversely
resulted in substantial gain to Fortenberry.

29

The Division also requests civil penalties under Section 9(d) of the Investment Company Act.
Div. Br. at 42. Because this provision does not appear in the OIP, however, see OIP at 10-11, I
do not consider it here.
37

Furthermore, this is not Fortenberry’s first brush with regulatory authorities. As
discussed, he has previously been sanctioned by securities authorities in Pennsylvania and Texas.
Fortenberry has continued to solicit investors with promises of guaranteed returns, Div. Ex. 110,
and he has refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing, choosing instead to blame the Division’s
investigation for the demise of Premier, see Tr. 208. Moreover, Fortenberry violated his
fiduciary duty for his own benefit, to the harm of his victims.
A monetary penalty may be assessed for “each act or omission.” 15 U.S.C.
§§ 77h-1(g)(2)(C), 78u-2(b)(3), 80b-3(i)(2)(C). I find the following distinct acts or omissions
relevant to this calculation: (1) false statements in Dr. Anderson’s subscription agreement and
omissions related to salary and record keeping; (2) false statements in Mr. Nasti’s subscription
agreement and omissions related to salary and record keeping; (3) false promises of returns in the
Starmaker Brochure given to Mr. Nasti and false assertions of fact about investments in the same
brochure; (4) false representation in the August 31, 2010, letter to Dr. Anderson that Bongiovi
Entertainment was in Premier’s portfolio; (5) false indication of returns in the November 2010
letter to Dr. Anderson with a false representation about Bongiovi Entertainment; (6) false
indication of returns in the December 2010 invoice to Dr. Anderson; (7) false indication of
returns in the January 2011 invoice to Dr. Anderson; (8) false indication of returns in the
February 2011 invoice to Dr. Anderson; and (9) false indication of returns in the March 2011
invoice to Dr. Anderson.
As detailed above, Fortenberry made a host of other false statements. The nine sets of
statements and omissions listed here, however, are those that were directly tied to investment
decisions by Fortenberry’s victims. While is it true that Fortenberry looted Premier and treated
its bank account as his own, see Div. Br. at 44, I do not regard Fortenberry’s behavior in respect
to the bank account as a separate act or omission. Rather, I view this behavior as being part of
the false statements and omissions concerning the subscription agreements. Fortenberry made
various representations in the subscription agreements that were belied by his subsequent failure
to maintain records and his personal spending out of Premier’s bank account.
Bearing in mind that repeated fraudulent conduct warrants “a severe sanction,” Toby G.
Scammell, 2014 SEC LEXIS 4193 at *25, I note that each of the nine sets of false statements and
material omissions reflect a high degree scienter and resulted in substantial harm to
Fortenberry’s victims. Moreover, Fortenberry has been sanctioned before but has continued to
commit securities violations. I thus impose a civil penalty of $100,000 per set of false statements
or omissions, resulting in a total civil monetary penalty of $900,000, which is approximately
three times the amount Fortenberry fraudulently induced his investors to invest.
I find that this monetary penalty will serve the important interest of deterring Fortenberry
from future securities violations. It will also serve as a general deterrent to others who seek to
defraud potential investors.

Exhibit A


Paragraph 3 of Purchase and Sale Agreement between Premier and Halsey
Management (Division Exhibit 39).
Units and Conversion upon Payout. The Units being purchased represent up to
3,500,000 Units if all of the Maximum Committed Units are purchased hereunder
and up to 48% of the total Units of Membership Interest in the Company. The
actual Units purchased may vary. The Units actually purchased by Premier
hereunder are referred to herein as the “Premier Purchased Units.” Upon Payout
(as defined below), each Premier Purchased Unit shall automatically be converted
to one half Unit without further action or consent being required. For
example, if all 3,500,000 Units have been issued to Premier hereunder and Payout
occurs, the 3,500,000 Units shall automatically be converted into 1,750,000 Units
thus reducing the ownership of Premier by one half of its former amount of Units.
For purposes hereof, “Payout” means that date after twenty four months from the
date hereof upon which the Company has made distributions to Premier equal to
the Purchase Price of such Units paid by Premier hereunder plus 12% per annum
interest thereon calculated from the date of the purchase of such Unit(s).

The reason all of this is slated to work so weii is the fact that Billboard has been the industr•; leader in
entertainment ratings and charts dating back to Hi94. For the past 60 years, and in the current v:cr!d,
even the most famous musical artists desire, more than virtuaily anything eise, to be ·on the char-..sM; t..'le
Billboard charts that is. Moreover, Billboard is the provider of the ran kings for the American Top 40 pop
songs, along with the same credibility in all other genres. July 6. 2010 marked the 40th anniversary of
the first airing of the American Top 40, which counts down the top 40 positions on the Biiiboard Hot 100.
From 1970 to 1988, it was hosted by Casey Kasem. Ryan Seacreast hosts it now. Biliboard has
unparalleled credibility and a proven record of accomplishment in the entertainment industry.
So all music industry people, especially performers and songwriters want to be as close to Billboard as
they can, as soon as possible in their careers. After aU, Billboard's influence, in essence, says who's hot
and -.vhors not!
Biiiboard has partnered exclusively wi~h our company, Halsey Management LLC, to manage and conduct
the contest. There are rnany reasons we Selected to partner with BH!board, a few of which were explained
eariier. Biiiboard aiso has many reasons for teaming with us, but the fact that our company has been a
dominant leader in music promotion and management since 1949 is of paramount importance. We will
be the foremost point for fans and iisteners aiike, because we will have all the newest music. Our listeners

For those who are not fully aware of the integration in the high tech world and music, the numbers may
be hard to grasp. however, SoundCioud is an excellent example. SoundCioud gives artists an easy way to
send and receive audio files, embed audio tracks for people to hear and allow others to remix their works.
It also has a social network that allows musicians to track, communicate and collaborate with others.
SoundC!oud landed about $3.3 million in funding in late 2009. Since then, it has solidified its position as a
leader in its category. The company tells Billboard it has grown from an early stage company to 1.2
mil! ion users ~n the last 12 months. The average monthly cost to use the system is roughly 12 dollars per

member per month.
Another example of what's taking place in high tech-mee~:s-mus!c industry is Sonicbids. They allow
promoters to find and book artists over the Internet Additionally, we see wp executives from high tech
companies that have been gravitating to the online music scene. For example, Martin Kelleher, the new
CFO and COO of SonjcBjds.com, is a former Monsier.corn CFO. Nitzan Achsaf is Sonicbids' new VP of
product; he was the fanner product manager at Yahoo.
