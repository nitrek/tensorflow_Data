OPERATION OF THE SECURITIES ACTS AMENDMENTS OF
1964; IMPLEMENTATION
OF SPECIAL STUDY RECOM.
MENDATIONS
OPERATION OF 1964 AMENDMENTS

Fiscal year 1965 marked the enactment and the beginning of the
Commission's administration of the Securities Acts Amendments of
1964, the most significant statutory advance in Federal securities regulation and investor protection since 1940. The principal objectives
of the 1964 amendments were to extend to investors in securities traded
over the counter the same fundamental disclosure and insider trading
protections as were previously afforded by the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 to investors in listed securities, to strengthen the standards
of entrance into the securities business, and to make more effective the
disciplinary controls of the Commission and the rules of industry selfregulatory organizations over securities brokers and dealers and persons associated with them.
Obviously, the full impact of such far-reaching legislation could not
be felt during the fiscal year. Aside from certain built-in delays in
the statutory scheme, the Commission moved forward deliberately,
well aware of the need of newly regulated companies for adequate
time to prepare for bringing themselves into compliance and of the
need for further study in some areas before taking definitive action.
Nevertheless, the amendments have already had significant consequences and a substantial beginning has been made toward full incorporation of the new provisions into the fabric of securities regulation.
In the course of the year, among other things, over-the-counter issuers
filed a total of 1,508 registration statements pursuant to new Section
12(g) of the Exchange Act, and thus took the first step toward bringing themselves within the full panoply of the Exchange Act's disclosure and reporting requirements. The Commission, in addition to making the necessary internal preparations to meet its additional responsibilities, took steps to implement the legislation through the adoption
or revision of various rules and forms. In a number of administrative
proceedings against broker-dealers and persons associated with them,
it imposed the new direct sanctions available against such associated
persons. It made use in two instances of its new authority to suspend
over-the-counter trading in specified securities. These matters and
other action taken pursuant to the amendments are discussed in more
detail in the following sections.

Extension of Disclosure Requirements

COMMISSION

to Over-the-Counter Securities

The 1964 amendments extended to a significant portion of the securities traded in the over-the-counter markets the registration, periodic
reporting, proxy solicitation and insider reporting and trading provisions of the Exchange .Act previously applicable to securities 'listed
on the securities exchanges. The principal statutory mechanism for
achieving this extension was the enactment of new Section 12 (g) which
requires an issuer of securities traded in over-the-counter markets with
total assets exceeding 1 million dollars and a class of non-exempt
equity security held of record by '750 or more persons 1 to register such
security by filing a registration statement with the Commission within
120 days after the last day of its first fiscal year ended after July 1,
1964, on which it meets the above standards.
In order to provide a
reasonable period for preparation of the required filing by the issuers
involved and to permit gradual assumption by the Commission of its
administrative burdens, the Commission postponed the required filing
date until.April30, 1965, for those issuers which otherwise would have
been required to file at an earlier date, except for companies required to
file reports with the Commission under Section 13 or 15 (d) of the .Act.2
In an effort to bring the new legislation to the attention of companies which might be subject thereto, the Commission notified more
than '7,000 companies not previously subject to the Commission's reporting requirements which, according to information obtained from
over-the-counter quotation services and commercial financial reporting
services, appeared possibly to be subject to Section 12(g), of the applicability of that Section. Those companies which on the basis of responses to a questionnaire were apparently required to register securities with the Commission were provided with copies of the appropriate
forms, rules and regulations.
The first registration statements under Section 12(g) were filed in
the second quarter of the fiscal year. From a total of 50 statements
filed in that quarter, the number increased to 186 in the third quarter
and to 1,2'72 in the final quarter.
Thus, as has been noted, a total of
1,508 registration statements had been filed pursuant to Section 12(g)
by the end of the fiscal year. Two statements were withdrawn before
the end of the year by the issuers when it was determined that they
were not required to file under the .Act. Of the total of 1,508 registration statements, 929 were filed on behalf of issuers already subject
to the reporting requirements of Section] 3 or 15 (d) of the .Act.
During the fiscal year, requests by 180 issuers for extensions of time
for filing were granted.
.A majority of these requests was based on the
l.After July 1, 1966, this number will be reduced to 500.

difficulties encountered by independent accountants in preparing certified financial statements within the prescribed time where prior
financial statements had not been certified.
During the year the Commission adopted rules defining terms which
are key factors in determining whether an issuer is required to register its securities. Pursuant to its authority under Section 3 (a) (11)
of the Act to include within the term "equity security" securities it
deems similar to those specified in that section, the Commission
adopted Rule 3all-1 which includes within that term a broad range of
equity interests," Rules 12g5-1 and 12g5-2 define the terms "held of
record" and "total assets." 4 Generally speaking, Rule 12g5-1 includes as a separate holder each person identified on records maintained in accordance with accepted practice as the owner of the security. However, if the issuer knows or has reason to know that the
form of holding securities of record is used primarily to circumvent
the provisions of the Exchange Act, the rule as adopted provides that
the beneficial owners shall be deemed to be the record holders thereof.
At the time of the adoption of Rule 12g5-1 the Commission indicated that it would continue to evaluate the rule to determine in the
light of experience whether it may he necessary or appropriate, in
order to prevent circumvention of the Act and to achieve the intended
coverage on a uniform and acceptable basis, to count securities held
in customers' accounts, 'but registered in the name of a broker, dealer
or bank, as being "held of record" by the number of separate accounts
for which they are held. The Commission also indicated it would
give similar consideration to the necessity of including as record holders employees who have a direct beneficial interest in securities held
by an employee plan.
Rule 12g5-2 defines "total assets" to mean the total assets as shown
on the issuer's balance sheet or the balance sheet of the issuer and its
subsidiaries consolidated, whichever is larger, prepared in accordance
with the pertinent provisions of Regulation S-X.
As a result of the 1964:amendments, the date on which securities become "registered" pursuant to Section 12 assumes great importance.
That date determines the applicability of the periodic reporting, proxy
solicitation and insider reporting provisions of Sections 13, 14 and 16
of the Act. In addition, Section 15(d) of the Act, as amended, provides that the obligation of an issuer to file periodic reports thereunder is suspended if and so long as the issuer has a class of security
"registered" pursuant to Section 12. In order to resolve any uncert.ainty as to when a security is "registered," the Commission adopted
Rule 12b-6 which provides that for the purposes of the above Sections

and the rules and regulations thereunder, securities are not deemed
to be registered pursuant to Section 12 until an application for exchange registration or a registration statement filed with respect to
over-the-counter securities has become effective,"
The rules of the Commission adopted under Section 14(a) of the
Act governing the solicitation of proxies were redesignated as Regulation 14A and were amended to apply to solicitations with respect to
securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) as well as securities
registered on a national securities exchange." However, the amendment applies only to solicitations commenced on or after July 1, 1965,
and the proxy rules therefore did not apply to over-the-counter securities registered during the fiscal year/
As a result of the extension of the proxy rules to over-the-counter
securities, the Commission also amended Rule 14a-3, relating to the
information to be furnished to security holders in connection with the
solicitation of proxies," This rule previously provided, in part, that
where the management of an issuer solicits proxies with respect to an
annual meeting of security holders at which directors are to be elected,
its proxy statement must be accompanied or preceded by an annual
report to such security holders containing such financial statements
for the last fiscal year as will in the opinion of management adequately reflect the financial position and operations of the issuer, and
if such statements differ materially from those filed with the Commission, an explanation of the effect of the difference. As amended,
the rule also requires an issuer which has not previously submitted
to its security holders an annual report pursuant to the rules and regulations under Section 14 to include in its first such annual report such
information as to its business operations during the past fiscal year
as will, in the opinion of management, indicate the general nature
and scope of the business of the issuer and its subsidiaries. In connection with the adoption of the amendment the Commission indicated that after it gained additional experience with respect to the
reporting practices of unlisted companies, it would consider whether
such companies should be required to include a description of their
business in each annual report to security holders.
Section 14(c) of the Exchange Act, which was added by the 1964
amendments, provides that issuers of registered securities shall, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission,
transmit to security holders from whom proxies are not solicited in

connection with meetings of security holders information comparable
to that which would be furnished in proxy material. During the fiscal
year, the Commission announced that it has under consideration a new
Regulation 14C to implement Section 14(c), and invited public commerits," The proposed regulation would provide that in connection
with every annual or other meeting of holders of a class of registered
securities, the issuer shall transmit a written information statement
containing substantially the same information as that which would be
required in a proxy statement to every security holder who is entitled
to vote in regard to any matter to be acted upon at the meeting and
from whom a proxy is not solicited on behalf of the management. In
the case of an annual meeting the issuer would also be required to
transmit an annual report including financial statements which with
some exceptions would have to be certified by independent public or
certified public accountants.
Section 16 (a) of the Act, as amended by the Securities Acts Amendments of 1964, requires the directors, officers and principal equity
security holders of listed companies and companies registered pursuant
to the new Section 12(g) of the Act to file reports of their beneficial
ownership of equity securities of their respective companies. The rules
under this Section were amended during the fiscal year to make them
applicable to the additional reports required by the amended section."
Section 16 (b) of the Act provides that profits realized by persons
beneficially owning more than 10 percent of any class of equity security
registered pursuant to Section 12, or any director or officer of the issuer
of such security, from the purchase and sale, or sale and purchase,
of any equity security of such issuer, whether or not registered, within
a period of less than 6 months, inure to and are recoverable by or on
behalf of the issuer. In interpreting this Section, the courts have
indicated that recovery may be allowed of profits realized by a director
or officer as a result of the purchase (sale) of an equity security before
the effective date of the first registration of an equity security of the
issuer under Section 12 and a sale (purchase) made subsequent to
such effective date. In order to provide directors and officers of issuers
registering under new Section 12(g) with an opportunity to become
familiar with the provisions of Section 16 (b), the Commission adopted
Rule 12h-3 which exempts from the operation of Section 16 (b) any
acquisition or disposition of an equity security by a director or officer
of the issuer of such security made prior to the first registration of

an equity security by the issuer under Section 12 (g).u The exemption
is limited to transactions by directors or officers of issuers which first
file a registration statement under Section 12 (g) on or prior to
October 31,1967.12
The revision of Section 15(d) and the addition of Section 12(g)
necessitated certain amendments to Rule 12f-4, which provides exemptions from Sections 13, 14 and 16 of the Act for issuers having
securities admitted only to unlisted trading privileges on a national
securities exchange. IS Prior to the 1964 amendments, some companies
exempt under that rule were required to :file with the Commission
certain annual and periodic reports pursuant to Section 15(d). Since
Section 12(Â£) (6) of the Act provides that securities admitted to unlisted trading privileges are deemed to be "registered on a national
securities exchange," the amendment to Section 15 (d) suspending
the obligation to file reports if any security of the issuer is "registered
pursuant to Section 12" had the effect of eliminating the need for
issuers to file under that Section where they had a class of securities
admitted to unlisted trading privileges. The effect of the amendment
to Rule 12f-4 is to subject such issuers to the reporting requirements
of Section 13 if they would be subject to the equivalent requirements
under Section 15 (d) but for the fact that they now are deemed to have
a class of security "registered on a national securities exchange."
The General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act were
amended to make them applicable to issuers required to register pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Act.14 And various forms heretofore
used for the registration of securities on a national securities exchange

banks under their respective primary supervisory jurisdiction. The
Commission understands that information regarding the operation of
the Securities Acts Amendments of 1964 with respect to banks under
the supervision of these agencies is discussed in their respective annual
reports or is otherwise available from them."
Exemptions

From Registration

Section 12 (h) of the Act authorizes the Commission, either by rules
and regulations, or by order upon application of an interested person,
to grant exemptions from the provisions of Section 12(g) or Sections
13, 14, 15(d) or 16, if it finds that such action is not inconsistent with
the public interest or the protection of investors by reason of the number of public investors, the amount of trading interest in the securities,
the nature and extent of the activities of the issuer, the income or assets
of the issuer, or otherwise. Pursuant to this authorization, the Commission adopted Rule 12h-2 which exempts from registration pursuant to Section 12(g) any interest or participation in an employee
stock bonus, stock purchase, profit sharing, pension, retirement, incentive, thrift, savings or similar plan if the interest or participation is
not transferable except in the event of death or mental incompetency,
as well as any security which is issued solely to fund such plans."
Other exemptions may be provided by rule as the Commission gains
experience under the new requirements of the Act. In addition, 43
applications for complete or partial exemptions from the above provisions of the Act were filed during the fiscal year. Of these, 16 were
granted, 3 were denied and the remainder were pending at the close
of the fiscal year.

empts various types of securities from the registration requirements of
Section 12(g), including securities issued by an insurance company if
all of the following conditions are met: (1) the company is required
to and does file an annual statement, conforming to that prescribed by
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("N.AIC"),
with the insurance regulatory authority of its domiciliary state;
(2) it is regulated in the solicitation of proxies as prescribed by the
N.AIC; and (3) after July 1, 1966, the purchase and sale of securities
issued by such insurance company by beneficial owners, directors or
officers of the company are subject to reporting and trading regulations
by its domiciliary state in the manner provided by Section 16 of the
Act.
The N.AIC has prescribed a uniform annual reporting form which
has been adopted in every state and the District of Columbia as the
required annual report form for insurance companies. In addition,
the N.AIC, as part of that form, has developed a "stockholders' information supplement" which is designed to elicit whether the company's
stockholders have been furnished information substantially equivalent
to that which the Commission would require under its periodic reporting requirements and proxy rules. The Commissioners of each of the
50 states and the District of Columbia have stated that they would
require insurance companies within their respective jurisdictions to
file the supplement and any future revisions thereof and to comply
with the proxy solicitation practices referred to therein. However,
subsequent to the passage of the 1964 amendments, the insurance regulatory authorities of many states expressed the opinion that it may be
necessary or desirable to receive express legislative authority to adopt
the proxy regulations prescribed by the N.AIC. In order to provide
additional time for this purpose, the Commission adopted Rule
12h-1 granting insurance companies a temporary exemption from
the registration requirements of Section 12(g) for the calendar year
1965, even if they do not meet the condition relating to the regulation
of proxies," As of August 15, 1965, 29 states had passed the necessary
legislation. In some of the remaining states such legislation is not
believed necessary and it is pending in the others and in the District
of Columbia.
The NAJC has also undertaken a program to bring about enactment of a "model insider trading statute" in each state and the District
of Columbia which would afford investor protections comparable to
those provided in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. As of August 15,
1965, 40 states had passed such legislation and the remainder of the
states and the District of Columbia have such legislation pending.

The NAIC expects that all jurisdictions will have complied with condition (3) by July 1, 1966,the date specified in the Act.
Section 12(g) (3) specifically authorizes the Commission to exempt
foreign securities and certificates of deposit issued against such securities from the registration requirements if it finds that such action is in
the public interest and is consistent with the protection of investors.
Pursuant to this authority, the Commission has adopted Rule 12g3-1
which provides a temporary exemption from such requirements for
foreign issuers until 120 days after their first fiscal year end following
November 30, 1965.20 The adoption of Rule 12g3-1 was intended to
give the Commission time to study the problems involved in the coverage of foreign securities. During the fiscal year, the Commission and
its staff engaged in a study of these problems and, with the cooperation
of various representatives of the foreign securities industry, extensive
information relating to the various aspects of these problems has been
collected. On the basis of this study, proposed rules will be formulated which will determine the extent to which various foreign issuers
and their insiders will be subject to the disclosure requirements of the
Exchange Act. Prior to the adoption of any rules, all interested persons-including foreign issuers, groups of foreign issuers, and American broker-dealers interested in foreign securities-will
have an
opportunity to present their comments.wThe Commission believes that, to the extent practicable, American
investors in foreign securities should be afforded the same protections
as American investors in domestic securities. However, the Commission recognizes the practical problems of enforcement and compliance
and of differing foreign laws. The Commission believes that it can
administer the provisions of the 1964 amendments with respect to
foreign securities in a manner that will provide the greatest practicable benefits for American investors, while at the same time not disrupting existing trading markets.
Changes in Prospectus

Delivery Requirements

The effect of the dealers' transaction exemption, now contained in
Section 4(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, is to require all dealers,
whether or not they participate in the initial distribution of a registered security, to deliver a prospectus for a designated period in
connection with all transactions in such security in which the mails

or facilities of interstate commerce are used, excepting only unsolicited brokers' transactions. Prospectuses must be delivered by an
underwriter continuing to act as such and by a dealer effecting transactions in securities constituting the whole or a part of an unsold
allotment to or subscription by such dealer as a participant in the
distribution so long as such underwriter or dealer is participating
in a distribution, no matter how much time has elapsed since the
commencement of the offering. In other situations, the period during
which prospectus delivery was required prior to the Securities Acts
Amendments of 1964, in the case of a security as to which a registration statement had been filed, expired 40 days after the effective date
of such registration statement or the first date upon which the security was bona fide offered to the public by or through an underwriter
after such effective date, whichever was later. In addition to renumbering the various provisions of Section 4 of the Act, the 1964 amendments made two substantive changes in the dealers' transaction
exemption. First, the 40-day period was extended to 90 days if no
securities of the issuer had previously been sold pursuant to an earlier
effective registration statement-so-called
"first registered offerings."
Second, the amendments give the Commission power to shorten the
40-day or 90-day period by rule, regulation or order.
In order that dealers will be apprised more readily of their obligation to deliver a prospectus, the Commission adopted a new Rule
425A, which requires a statement on the cover of a prospectus specifying the date on which the relevant 40 or 90-day period will expire."
At the same time, the Commission also adopted Rule 1'74 which
exempts offerings of certain types of securities from the propectusdelivery requirements, establishes 40 days as the maximum period
during which dealers must deliver a prospectus if the issuer has a
class of securities listed and registered on a national securities
exchange, and provides that where securities are to be offered at
different times by one or more of several offerors, no new prospectusdelivery period will begin for dealers trading in the offering after the
first 40- or 90-day prospectus-delivery period has expired following
the initial offering of any of the registered securities for the accounts
of any of the offerors." Other suitable relaxations of the dealers'
exemption in Section 4(3) may become apparent as the Commission
and the financial community gain experience under the amended
requirements of the Securities Act. In the meantime, the rule
reserves to the Commission the power to modify the applicable period
by order upon application or on its own motion in particular cases.

Enlargement of Disciplinary Authority as to Broker-Dealers

The 1964 amendments modified in important respects the provisions
of Section 15 of the Exchange Act relating to disciplinary action
against brokers and dealers and persons associated with them. For
the first time, the Commission was authorized to proceed directly
against individuals associated with broker-dealer firms and to impose
sanctions on such individuals, including suspension or bar from being
associated with a broker-dealer. The sanctions which the Commission may impose upon broker-dealers were expanded to include censure and suspension of registration for up to 12 months, and the
statutory disqualifications from being registered as a broker-dealer
or associated with a broker-dealer were expanded to include certain
additional types of injunctions, convictions and violations.
The Commission has generally not applied these new provisions
in any administrative proceeding commenced prior to August 20, 1964,
the date when the Securities Acts Amendments were enacted. Since
most of the administrative proceedings concluded during the fiscal
year were commenced prior to that date, the operation of the amendments in this area was correspondingly limited. However, as a result
of the consents of respondents in several such cases and the defaults
or consents of respondents in a number of cases commenced subsequent to such date, 25 persons were barred during the fiscal year from
association with any broker or dealer, three persons were suspended
for varying periods from such association and one person was formally censured. In addition, one broker-dealer firm was censured and
the registration of another was suspended. One proceeding was instituted only against individuals and not against their employer firm.
Regulation of Broker-Dealers Who Are Not Members of Registered Securities
Association

Prior to the passage of the 1964 amendments, broker-dealers registered with the Commission who were not members of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (N.A.SD), or one of the principal exchanges, were not subject to any comprehensive regulation
concerning qualifications, experience in the securities business, or fair
business practices. A major objective of the amendments, according
to the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, was
''to insure that the Commission has the necessary authority to provide
regulation of non-member brokers and dealers comparable to that imposed by (self-regulatory) associations on their membership, including the requirement that these non-member brokers and dealers pay
fees which will compensate the Commission for this additional
regulation." 23

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In August 1964, the Commission, as contemplated by new subsections (8), (9),and (10) of Section 15 (b) of the Exchange Act, began
to formulate a regulatory program for those broker-dealers who are
not members of a registered securities association. The new provisions authorize the Commission to adopt rules and regulations prescribing standards of training, experience and other qualifications
for such brokers and dealers and persons associated with them, and
to adopt rules and regulations governing non-member broker-dealers
designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to provide
safeguards against unreasonable profits or unreasonable rates of commissions or other charges, and in general to protect investors and
the public interest and to remove impediments to and perfect the
mechanism of a free and open market.
In February and March 1965, the Commission prepared studies of
non-NASD broker-dealers, based upon information obtained in replies
to a questionnaire sent to all such firms. On the basis of these studies,
and after conferences with securities industry representatives, the
Commission published for comment proposed Rule 15b8-1,24which
proposed to establish qualification requirements and set fees for nonNASD broker-dealers who do an over-the-counter business, and for
their principals, salesmen and other persons associated with them.
Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the Commission adopted
Rule 15b8-1 with revisions that took into account comments from
broker-dealers, the NASD, state securities administrators and others."
The rule includes a requirement that persons associated with nonmember broker-dealers in certain capacities successfully complete a
qualifications examination; that non-member broker-dealers file with
the Commission a personnel form for each of their associated persons
engaged in securities activities; and that they pay fees to defray the
additional costs of regulation incurred between August 20, 1964, the
date of the enactment of the 1964 amendments, and June 30, 1965.
The rule exempts from its provisions broker-dealers who are members of a national securities exchange if they do not carry customers'
accounts and if their annual gross income derived. from over-thecounter business is no more than $1,000. This exemption applies
mainly to exchange specialists and other floor members who on occasion introduce accounts to other members.
The Commission is currently drafting rules under Section 15(b)
(10) relating to broker-dealers' business conduct, and under Sections
15{b) (8) and (9) relating to a permanent fee schedule. In drafting

these rules, the rules of the NASD and the principal stock exchanges
are being carefully considered.
Revision of RetaU Quotations System

One of the most significant recent developments in the regulation
of trading in the over-the-counter markets occurred during the past
year when the NASD adopted a revision of its retail quotations system.
The Special Study had recommended that the existing system of providing the public with quotations be improved to reflect more accurately the best prevailing inter-dealer bid and asked quotations. In
the 1964 amendments Congress added a new provision to the Exchange
Act (Section 15A(b) (12Â» which requires national securiti~s associations to promulgate rules designed to produce fair and informative
quotations.
Under the revised NASD system, which was adopted in response to
the Congressional mandate and the Study recommendations, newspaper quotations for securities on the "National List" are now published on the basis of prevailing inter-dealer quotations as of a particular time and the masthead accompanying such published quotes
states that the prices shown 'are subject to markups, markdowns or commissions in retail transactions. "Local List" securities are quoted as
before but the masthead has been revised to provide a more accurate
description of what the quotations purport to be. The NASD has
engaged an outside management consulting firm to study the effects of
the revised system and to determine the appropriateness of further
changes in this and various related areas of the over-the-counter
markets.
Summary Suspension of Over-the-Counter Trading

The 1964 amendments provide the Commission in new Section
15(c) (5) with authority to summarily suspend over-the-counter trading in any security (except an exempted security) for periods of 10
days if, in its opinion, the public interest and protection of investors
so require. Broker-dealers are prohibited from trading in any such
security during the period of suspension. This provision is a counterpart to Section 19(a) (4), which provides for summary suspension of
trading in securities listed on a national securities exchange.
During the 1965 fiscal year the Commission used this new authority
in two instances. Trading in the stock of Empire Petroleum Company was suspended for a 5-day period to permit adequate dissemination of the company's annual report which contained adverse information, so that brokers and dealers as well as investors would be apprised
of the facts before engaging in any further transactions in such stock.
Trading in Idamont Oil and Mining Co. securities was suspended
following the institution by the Commission of, court action to enjoin
violations of the Federal securities acts in the offer and sale of such

14

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

securities. The suspension was later terminated following entry of
a court order preliminarily enjoining the further offer and sale of such
securities in violation of the Securities Act registration and anti-fraud
provisions.
IMPLEMENTATION

OF

SPECIAL

STUDY

RECOMMENDATIONS

Aside from the enactment of the 1964 amendments and the implementation of that legislation as described above, further significant
progress was made during the 1965 fiscal year in the implementation
of recommendations of the Special Study Report.
.
Minimum

Net Capital

The Special Study recommended the adoption of a minimum net
capital requirement as one of several different approaches to assuring
a broker-dealer community of principals and firms "reasonably qualified in terms of responsibility and commitment."
Its Report commented that such requirement need not and should not be a uniform
one for all firms but should be appropriately scaled to reflect the type
and size of business engaged in.
Following extensive discussions with a number of industry groups
and several statistical studies conducted by the Commission in an effort
to arrive at a meaningful and workable proposal which would carry
out the recommendation of the Special Study, the Commission adopted
amendments to Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act which provide
for a minimum net capital requirement of $5,000 for firms engaged in
a general securities business and $2,500 for firms solely engaged in
transactions in shares of registered investment companies," These requirements are minimum figures and broker-dealers subject to the rule
must also comply with the requirement that their ratio of aggregate
indebtedness to net capital not exceed 2000 percent.
The Commission postponed the effectiveness of the minimum capital
provisions until December 1, 1965, in order to provide broker-dealers
with sufficient time to bring. themselves into compliance. It stated
that after the minimum net capital requirements had been in effect for
a reasonable period the adequacy of such requirements would be given
further study to determine whether it is necessary for the protection
of investors to modify such requirements and if so, to what extent.
In order to permit the Commission to exempt particular brokers or
dealers from the provisions of the rule in unusual circumstances, a
new paragraph (b) (3) provides that the Commission may, upon written application, exempt from the rule either unconditionally or on
specified terms and conditions, a broker or dealer wh~ satisfies the
Commission that because of the special nature of his 'business, his
financial position, and the safeguards he has established for the pro-

THIRTY-FIRST

15

tection of customers' funds and securities it is not necessary in the
public interest or for the protection of investors to subject him to the
provisions of the rule. The Commission also adopted an amendment
to paragraph (b) (1) of the rule which limits the scope of the exemption previously provided by that paragraph. The amended exemptive
provision now applies only to a broker who is also licensed as an
insurance agent, whose securities business is limited to selling variable
annuity contracts as agent for the issuer, who promptly transmits all
funds and delivers all variable annuity contracts, and who does not
otherwise hold funds or securities for or owe money or securities to
customers, and only if the issuer files with the Commission a satisfactory undertaking that it assumes responsibility for all valid claims
arising out of the activities of the agent.
Supervision of Selling Practices

The Special Study pointed out serious inadequacies in the supervisory controls utilized by broker-dealers in their surveillance of the
selling activities of salesmen and other employees and recommended
the strengthening of such procedures and the adoption by the selfregulatory agencies of clearer standards and stronger enforcement
procedures to assure more effective supervision by their member firms.
In the 1964:amendments, Congress clearly recognized the importance
of proper supervision by providing in new Section 15(b) (5) (E) of
the Exchange Act that failure to supervise properly which results in
the violation of the securities acts or rules thereunder is a ground for
disqualification from broker-dealer registration or from being a person
associated with a broker-dealer.
During fiscal 1965,new rules establishing or clarifying standards of
supervision were adopted in response to the Special Study recommendations by the American, Midwest, New York, and Pacific Coast
Stock Exchanges. In addition, the N ew York Stock Exchange and
the N.A.SDcontinued the expansion and improvement of their existing
branch officeinspection programs. These inspection programs have as
a primary function the surveillance of supervisory procedures executed at the branch office level.
A major step taken during the past year in this area was the adoption by the NASD of new rules which incorporate required standards
of supervision by its members. These rules require the establishment
and enforcement of written supervisory procedures and designation of
a partner or officer as responsible for their execution. The internal
procedures must include periodic review of customer accounts and at
least an annual inspection of each branch office. The rule governing
discretionary accounts has also been amended to require written customer authorization and supervisory review and approval of activity
in such accounts. The NASD also adopted a revised statement for

16

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

inclusion in its Manual which enumerates many of the selling practices
which violate members' responsibility for fair dealing. To aid in the
implementation of these rules the Association has prepared and
distributed to its members a comprehensive supervision manual which
contains detailed guidelines and suggestions for effective supervisory
procedures.
Research and Investment Advice

Significant progress has been made since the publication of the Special Study Report with respect to the upgrading of standards applicable to the research and investment advice disseminated by brokerdealers and investment advisers. The major self-regulatory agencies
have amended their rules to include interpretations and statements
of policy designed to meet important deficiencies. These rules now
generally provide that recommendations must have a basis that can
be substantiated as reasonable; firms must accurately describe their
research facilities and staffs; and existing proprietary positions or
other interests must be disclosed. 'With respect to the activities of
investment advisers who are not subject to rules of a self-regulatory
body, the Commission staff has prepared a draft rule under the Investment Advisers Act incorporating similar requirements. This rule
is presently being circulated to affected industry groups for informal
comment and discussions.
Financial

Responsibility

Inthe area of financial responsibility and the protection of customers'
funds and securities there have been several significant developments
since the publication of the Special Study Report. As discussed in
last year's annual report, the adoption of Rule 15c3-2 provides investors with meaningful information regarding the status and nature of
free credit balances left with broker-dealers. Several of the selfregulatory organizations have revised their rules on the hypothecation
and lending of securities to require that there be a "reasonable relationship" between the amount of each customer's securities that can
by hypothecated or lent by a member broker-dealer and the amount
of the customer's indebtedness. In addition, the NASD has revised
its Rules of Fair Practice to require the segregation and identification
of customers' free and excess margin securities.
As a result of the Ira Haupt & Co. insolvency, the New York Stock
Exchange established a Special Trust Fund of $25 million which can
be utilized to satisfy the claims of customers in the event of the insolvency of any member organization of that Exchange. Furthermore, the NYSE and the other major exchanges have amended their
rules to provide special adjustments and "haircuts" in the computation
of members' net capital to reflect the commodities activities of their
members. In the recent amendments to Rule 15c3-1 the Commission

TIDRTY-FIRST

ANNUAL REPORT

17

also provided that in computing net capital there should be deducted
from net worth an amount equal to 1% percent of the greater of customers' long or short commodities positions in each commodity.
Specialists and Floor Traders

Two of the areas which were studied in great depth by the Special
Study were the activities and responsibilities of floor traders and specialists on the exchanges. The recommendations of the Special Study
in these areas gave rise to extended discussions between members of the
staff and of the New York and American Stock Exchanges culminating in the adoption on June 2,1964, of Rule lIa-l under the Exchange
Act,27regarding floor trading, and the adoption on November 23, 1964,
of Rule lIb-12s respecting specialists. These rules were discussed at
pages 3 and 4 of the Commission's 30th Annual Report and the plans
filed by the New York and American Stock Exchanges pursuant to
Rule lIa-l were discussed at pages 13 and 14. Both exchanges have
also adopted the necessary rule changes and additions required for
compliance with Rule Ll.b-L
The "Third Markel"

The Special Study described a sharp increase in recent years in
the volume of off-board trading in common stocks traded on the New
York Stock Exchange and other national securities exchanges. To
correct the deficiency of information concerning this growing market,
which it described as the "third market," the Study recommended
establishment of a system for identification of market makers and for
reporting of trading activity. The adoption of Rule 17a-9 and related reporting forms X-17A-9(1), X-17A-9(2), and X-17A-9(3) 29
implements this recommendation by providing a system for the identification of broker-dealers making off-board markets in common stocks
traded on national securities exchanges and for the reporting of summaries of over-the-counter trading in common stocks traded on those
national securities exchanges whose annual sales volume exceeds $20
million.
Under the rule and the forms, brokers and dealers are required to
report their trading over the counter and on exchanges in common
stocks in which they are market makers, and to report certain offboard trading in common stocks traded on exchanges in which they do
not make a market. Broker-dealers who are not market makers are
also required to report certain third market transactions. It is expected that the Commission will regularly publish summaries of third
market trading, as compiled from the reports filed under the rule.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

However, the reports of transactions filed by individual broker-dealers
will not be made public.
The Commission plans periodically to conduct detailed transaction
studies for the purpose of analyzing particular aspects of activities
in the off-board market. The data to be obtained from the reports
under Rule 17a~9 and from the transaction studies will enable the
Commission to evaluate the need for more detailed reporting and further regulation of this market.
Over-the-Counter

Markets and NASD Organization

Reference has already been made to the very significant development in the regulation of trading in the over-the-counter markets that
occurred during the past year-the revision by the NASD of its retail
quotations system which was adopted in response to the Congressional
mandate in new Section 15A(b) (12) of the 1934 Act and the recommendations of the Special Study." As noted, the NASD has engaged
an outside management consulting firm to study the effects of the
revised system. This study is also designed to determine the possible
effects and appropriateness of the Study's recommendations regarding the prohibition of so-called "riskless" principal transactions and
requiring certain disclosures to investors of prevailing inter-dealer
quotations.
The NASD has taken further steps to improve its organizational
structure 'and internal operations in response to certain criticisms inthe
Special Study Report. For example, during the year the NASD submitted to its membership for approval proposed revisions in its
bylaws which are intended to expedite disciplinary actions and proceedings relating to employment of disqualified persons. The changes
were approved by vote of the members after the end of the year. In
addition, the Board of Governors has approved a new fee structure
which will go into effect in 1966.
Other recommendations regarding the over-the-counter market have
received attention in the past fiscal year. Rule 15c2-7 under the Exchange Act, which relates to the operation of the inter-dealer, quotation systems, was adopted during fiscal 1965. The rule, which was
proposed last year, was discussed in detail at pages 4,16 and 17 of the
Commission's 30th Annual Report. The staff has held several conferences with representatives of the NASD Trading Committee in an
effort to develop appropriate standards and/or policy statements concerning a broker-dealer's obligation to provide his customer with the
best execution and to furnish bonafide and firm price quotations. In
addition, a special committee of the NASD has had under consideration a clarification of its standards with respect to members' pricing
practices in transactions with the public .

Level and Structure of Commission Rate

In connection with staff research on the level of the commission
rate, major efforts were directed to improving and expanding the income and expense reports of broker-dealer firms in cooperation with
the staff of the New York Stock Exchange. Agreement was reached
with the Exchange on a new Exchange rule that would make mandatory the filing of such reports by firms conducting a public commission business; and an understanding was reached that if studies now
underway establish the feasibility of certain reports, all New York
Stock Exchange firms may be required to report on a mandatory basis.
This building-up of an inventory of financial information for securities firms is an essential first step in the gauging of the reasonableness of the commission rate level. The Commission is also pursuing
the development of reporting forms to provide detailed financial information regarding all broker-dealers and investment advisers.
These reports would give the Commission a more complete picture of
the economics of the securities industry and are expected to assist the
Commission in the determination of many of the complex matters
which are within its responsibilities.
In the last half of the fiscal year, the Commission staff engaged in
a series of discussions with the New York Stock Exchange staff on the
commission rate structure. These initial steps were directed towards
gaining a fuller understanding of the various practices now in effect
which permit arrangements allowing for deviation from the fixed
minimum commission schedule established by the Exchange. Based
partly on the results of these discussions, the Commision staff has been
directed to develop proposals for submission to the Commision aimed
at evaluating such current practices as "give-ups," reciprocal arrangements and the provision of special services, with a view to insuring a
reasonable commission rate structure.
Odd-Lot Differential

The Commission staff has also undertaken a review of the odd-lot
differential charged by New York Stock Exchange firms. The Special
Study recommended that the Exchange, with the cooperation of the
Commission, undertake a cost study of the odd-lot business. This
study was begun by Price Waterhouse & Co. in fiscal 1964 and completed in fiscal 1965. During 1965the Commission staff: (1) met with
the Exchange Committee on odd-lots, (2) maintained a continuing
oversight of the progress of the Price Waterhouse & Co. cost study,
(3) analyzed the cost study report, and (4) began analysis of the oddlot differential in anticipation of a report from the Exchange Committee on odd-lots.
Antomation of Market Facilities

Throughout the past year the staff has met frequently with representatives of the various exchanges, the National Association of Secur-

20

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

ities Dealers, suppliers of stock market information and others, on the
subject of automation of market facilities. The purpose of these meetings has been twofold. First, they have served to keep the Commission informed of the many developments in this field. Secondly, the
meetings have enabled the Commission to make judgments on the direction in which these developments have been moving and to suggest
changes, if necessary, for the protection of the public investor.
Discussions with the exchanges have dealt with the central bookkeeping systems, automating surveillance procedures, improving quotations, a central depository for securities, automation of the clearing
operation, and the institution of procedures for automating the execution of odd-lot transactions.
Automation in the over-the-counter market has been discussed with
the National Association of Securities Dealers and broker-dealers, as
well as with vendors who hope to supply the equipment and related
services for any such program.

PART II
LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES
Early in the fiscal year the President signed Public Law 88-467,
the Securities Acts Amendments of 1964. This legislation, amending
the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
represented the most significant statutory advance in Federal securities regulation and investor protection since 1940. A summary of the
amendments appeared in. the 30th Annual Report, at pages 8 and 9.
In March 1965, the Commission submitted to the 89th Congress a
proposed amendment to the Securities Act of 1933 to provide for an
increase in the fees paid in connection with the filing of registration
statements for securities offerings, in order to enable the Commission
to recover to a greater extent the costs of administration of the Federal securities laws. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the
proposed amendment was enacted into law.
On July 23, 1964, then Acting Chairman Cohen testified before
Subcommittee No.1 on Foundations of the Select Committee to Conduct Studies and Investigations of the Problems of Small Business,
House of Representatives, concerning the relation of the Commission's
administration of the Federal securities laws to the Federal Government's supervision of tax-exempt foundations and charitable trusts.
On June 2, 1965, Chairman Cohen also appeared before the Subcommittee on Domestic Finance of the Committee on Banking and Currency, House of Representatives, and testified. with respect to H.R.
7372, a bill to amend the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.
During the fiscal year the Commission and its staff analyzed or commented on 36 bills and other legislative matters referred to it by
various committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, by
individual members of Congress, and by the Bureau of the Budget.
21

PART
ADMINISTRATION

m

OF THE SECURITIES

ACT OF 1933

The Securities Act of 1933 is designed to provide disclosure to
investors of material facts concerning securities publicly offered for
sale 'by the use of the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce,
either 'by an issuing company or by any person in a control relationship to such company, and to prevent misrepresentation, deceit, or
other fraudulent practices in the sale of securities generally.
Disclosure is obtained by requiring the issuer of such securities to file
with the Commission a registration statement which includes a prospectus containing significant financial and other information about
the issuer and the offering. The registration statement is available
for public inspection as soon as it is filed. Although the securities
may be offered for sale as soon as the registration statement. has been
filed, actual sales may not 'be made until the registration statement
has become "effective." A copy of the prospectus must be furnished
to each purchaser at or before the sale or delivery of securities in order
to provide him with an opportunity to evaluate such securities and
make an informed investment decision. The issuer and the underwriter are basically responsible for the contents of the registration
statement. The Commission has no authority to control the nature
or quality of a security to be offered for public sale or to pass upon
its merits or the terms of its distribution.
Its action in permitting a
registration statement to become effective does not constitute approval
of the securities, and any representation to the contrary to a prospective purchaser is made unlawful by Section 23 of the Act.
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRATION PROCESS
Registration Statement and Prospectus

Registration of any security proposed to be publicly offered may
be effected by filing with the Commission a registration statement on
the applicable form containing the prescribed disclosure. Generally
speaking, a registration statement relating to securities issued by.a
corporation or other private issuer must contain the information
specified in Schedule A of the Act, while a statement relating to
securities issued by a foreign government must include the information specified in Schedule B. These schedules specify in considerable
detail the items of information which must be disclosed in order to
permit prospective investors to make a realistic appraisal of the issuer
22

THIRTY-FIRST

ANNUAL REPORT

23

and the securities being offered. The Act empowers the Commission

to classify issues, issuers and prospectuses, to prescribe appropriate
forms, and to increase, or in certain instances vary or diminish, the
particular items of information required to be disclosed as the Commission deems appropriate in the public interest or for the protection
of investors. To facilitate the registration of securities by different
types of issuing companies, the Commission has prepared special
registration forms which vary in their disclosure requirements so as
to provide maximum disclosure of the essential facts pertinent in a
given type of case while at the same time minimizing the burden and
expense of compliance with the law.
In general, the registration statement of an issuer other than a foreign government must disclose such matters as the names of persons
who participate in the management or control of the issuer's business;
the security holdings and remuneration of such persons; the general
character of the business, its capital structure, past history and earnings; underwriters' commissions; payments to promoters made within
2 years or intended to be made; the interest of directors, officers and
principal stockholders in material transactions; pending or threatened
legal procedings; and the purposes to which the proceeds of the
offering are to be applied, and must include financial statements
certified by independent accountants. The registration statement of
a foreign government must contain comparable information in regard
to the underwriting and distribution of the securities being registered,
the natural and industrial resources of the country, its revenues, obligations and expenses, a description of the securities being registered,
and similar matters. The prospectus constitutes a part of the registration statement and presents the more important of the required
disclosures.
Examination

Procedure

Registration statements are examined for compliance with the
standards of adequate and accurate disclosure by the Commission's
staff. This examination is primarily the responsibility of the Division
of Corporation Finance; however, as a result of a reallocation of
functions during the fiscal year,' statements filed by investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 are now
examined by the Division of Corporate Regulation. If it appears that
a statement does not conform in material respects with the applicable
requirements, the registrant is usually notified by an informal letter
of comment and is afforded an opportunity to file correcting or clarifying amendments.
addition, the Commission has the power, after
notice and opportunity for hearing, to issue an order suspending the
effectiveness of a registration statement if it finds that material repre-

In

Act Release No. 4731 (November 10, 1964).

24

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

sentations are misleading, inaccurate or incomplete. In certain instances, such as where the deficiencies in a registration statement
appear to stem :from careless disregard o:f applicable requirements
or :from a deliberate attempt to conceal or mislead, the letter of comment procedure is not used and the Commission either institutes an
investigation to determine whether "stop-order" proceedings should
be instituted or immediately institutes such proceedings. Information
regarding the exercise of the "stop-order" power during fiscal year
1965 appears below under the heading "Stop-Order Proceedings."
Time Required to Complete Registration

The Commission's staff endeavors to complete its examination of
registration statements in as short a time as possible. The Act provides that a registration statement shall become effective on the 20th
day after it is filed (or on the 20th day after the filing of any amendment thereto) . Since most registration statements require one or more
amendments, they usually do not become effective until some time
after the original 20-day period. The period between filing and
effective date is intended to afford investors an opportunity to become
familiar with the proposed offering through the dissemination of the
preliminary form of prospectus. The Commission is empowered to
accelerate the effective date so as to shorten the 20-day waiting period,
taking into account the adequacy of the information respecting the
issuer theretofore available to the public, the facility with which the
facts about the offering can be understood, and the public interest and
the protection of investors. The note to Rule 460 under the Act lists
some of the more common situations in which the Commission considers that the statute generally requires it to deny acceleration.
The median number of calendar days which elapsed :from the date of
original filing to the effective date with respect to the 1,097 registration
statements that became effective during the 1965 fiscal year 2 was 36,
the identical figure as in the previous year when only 960 registration
statements became effective. The corresponding figure for fiscal year
1963 was 52 days for 985 registration statements. The number of
registration statements filed during fiscal year 1965 was 1,376, as compared with 1,192 and 1,159, respectively, in the 2 preceding years,"

VOLUME OF SECURITIES

REGISTERED

A total of 1,266 statements registering securities in the amount of
$19.4 billion became effective under the Securities Act of 1933 during
the fiscal year 1965. This was an increase of 13 percent in the number
of statements, and an increase of 15 percent in the dollar amount of
securities registered over the preceding fiscal year. The chart all
page 26, shows the number and dollar amounts of registrations from
1935 to 1965.
The figures for 1965 cover all registrations which became effective,
including secondary distributions and securities registered for other
than cash sale, such as issues exchanged for other securities, and securities reserved for conversion. Of the dollar amount of securities registered in 1965, 75 percent was for the account of issuers for cash sale, 10
percent for the account of issuers for other than cash sale, and nearly

The amount of securities offered for cash sale for the account of
issuers, $14.7 billion, was about the same as in the preceding :fiscalyear.
Registration of new common stock issues aggregated $10.6 billion, $632
million more than in the 1964 fiscal period, largely reflecting increased
registrations of investment company issues which totaled a record $6.4
billion.
Registration of new bonds, notes and debentures declined
19 percent from the previous year and accounted for $3.7 billion of the
1965 volume. Preferred stock issues registered for the account of
issuers amounted to $307 million, an increase of 37 percent. Appendix

billion, the largest amount since the 1962 fiscal period. Among the
other industry groups, registration of financial and real estate issues
declined slightly to $922 million while issues classified in the "commercial and other" group were somewhat larger in amount than in
1964. Registrations of foreign government issues were almost three
times larger than in the previous year, amounting to $303 million.

STOP ORDER PROCEEDINGS

Section 8 (d) of the Act provides that, if it appears to the Commission at any time that a registration statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the Commission may institute proceedings to determine
whether a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration
statement should be issued. Where such an order is issued, the offering
cannot lawfully be made, or continued if it has already begun, until
the registration statement has been amended to cure the deficiencies
and the Commission has lifted the stop order.
At the beginning of the 1965 fiscal year, four stop order proceedings
were pending. Three additional proceedings were instituted during
the year, six were terminated (four through issuance of stop orders,'
one through dismissal, subject to distribution of the Commission's
opinion," and one through withdrawal of the registration statement
pursuant to an offer of settlement 6), and one was pending at the end of
the year. For the first time, stop orders were issued pursuant to delegated 'authority (by the Director of the Officeof Opinions and Review)
in those instances where the registrants concerned consented to the
issuance of such orders,"

These proceedings raised issues as to the adequacy of three registration
statements (all of which had become effective) filed by a large cash flow
real estate company and of a series of post-effective amendments to
one of those statements. The Commission found the registration statements materially false and misleading because of their failure to disclose that large sums had been transferred from registrant to its
controlling stockholder and chief executive officer for use in his own
business ventures and that such controlling person had pledged his
holdings in registrant as collateral for high-interest loans from unconventional sources, which loans had placed him in a strained financial
position, had created a likelihood of a shift in control, and had also
given rise to potential conflicts between his interests and those of the
other shareholders. In its discussion of these matters the Commission
pointed out that all of registrant's public offerings had been predicated
on its controlling person's reputed expertise as an investor in and manager of real property. Although the diversion of registrant's funds
was known only to the controlling person and one subordinate, the
Commission held that regar.dless of the diligence which may have been
exercised in the preparation of a registration statement, such statement was materially false and misleading whenever it failed-for
whatever reason-to meet the statutory standard of disclosure.
In holding that the controlling person's pledges should have been
disclosed, the Commission rejected registrant's contentions that such
disclosure would have been an unwarranted intrusion into his personal
affairs and was in any event not called for by the registration forms
under the Securities Act. The Commission pointed out that an insider
of a corporation that is asking the public for funds cannot keep private
those of his personal affairs that impinge significantly on the affairs
of the company. The Commission disposed of the second contention by
observing that its registration forms are not exhaustive enumerations
of every item that might possibly be material in the special circumstances of a particular offering and by pointing out that Rule 408
under the Securities Act requires the disclosure of all material information that may be necessary to keep the required statements from
being misleading.
As to one important issue, however, the Commission agreed with the
registrant and rejected the staff's charges. The staff contended that
registrant's filings should have disclosed that its directors had failed
to exercise the necessary diligence with respect to the day-to-day operations of the company. While noting that it had required disclosure
concerning directors' performance where there was a virtual abdication of responsibility or where affirmative representations had been
â€¢ Securities Act Release No. 4710 (July 31, 1964).

THIRTY-FIRST

made regarding such performance, the Commission held that, in view
of the diverse and uncertain standards applicable, "to generally require information in Securities Act prospectuses as to whether directors have performed their duties in accordance with the standards of
responsibility required of them under state law would stretch disclosure beyond the limitations contemplated by the statutory scheme and
necessitated by considerations of administrative practicality." 9
The Commission considered the deficiencies in registrant's effective
filings extremely serious, but did not issue a stop order. In its view
the distribution of copies of its opinion to all of registrant's past and
present stockholders, as registrant proposed, was sufficient under the
circumstances to give adequate public notice of the deficiencies in the
filings. Among the factors that led the Commission to this conclusion
were the departure of the wrongdoing chief executive, the transfer of
his controlling shares to a management that had made a substantial
investment in registrant's securities, had made voluntary remedial disclosures to the Commission's staff and to registrant's stockholders, and
had filed post-effective amendments which represented a bona fide
effort to remedy the deficiencies in the effective filings, and the unusually extensive publicity that had already been given to such deficiencies.
The Commission refused however to declare the post-effective
amendments effective. It found some of those amendments deficient
because of their failure to state clearly that registrant's cash distributions to its stockholders would exceed the cash derived from its operations, and it found all of them deficient because of the absence of a
lucid disclosure of the complex of risk elements peculiar to cash flow
real estate securities. Among the risk elements that were in the Commission's view inadequately presented were: (1) the adverse leverage
effect of the high ratio of debt to equity capital characteristic of cash
flow real estate companies; (2) the ambiguity of the phrase "cash
derived from operations," which should, the Commission held, be precisely defined so as to make it clear whether extraordinary non-recurring receipts were or were not included therein; and (3) the limited
duration of the tax advantages derived from the cash flow system and
their eventual transformation into tax disadvantages. The format of
â€¢ Ina decision rendered subsequent to the end of the fiscal year (lmperw,l Financial Services, Inc., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7684 (August 26,1965Â»,
the Commission noted that while its decision in f.ranchard had rejected a standard of requiring on a routine basis in prospectuses an evaluation of directors' performances, it had recognized that there were 'areas where disclosure might be
necessary as to acttvttles of directors which do not comply with applicable
standards.
The Commission went on to hold that the prospectuses of an investment company which failed to disclose that unaffiliated directors were not informed of material transactions were matertally misleading.

the post-effective amendments was also found objectionable.
The
Commission pointed out that each non-effective post-effective amendment consisted of a prospectus that had been rendered obsolete by lapse
of time and by numerous material changes in registrant's affairs, and
of a lengthy supplement thereto, concluded that this "obscure and
uncoordinated presentation" was inadequate and misleading, and held
that a thorough-going revision that would "give investors the clear,
comprehensive picture of the registrant's business and affairs contemplated by the Securities Act" was necessary.
Clinton Engines Corporation lO-Here a registration statement
that had become effective in 1960 was found seriously deficient because:
(1) The unaudited financial material therein was materially deceptive
by reason of a substantial inventory overstatement which led to
material overstatements of earnings and assets, distorted the historical
operating record, and "had the effect of presenting the financially
straitened registrant in a wholly illusory picture of incipient prosperity"; (2) the discussion of the causes of registrant's low profit
margins concealed significant adverse factors; and (3) a suggestion
that significant improvements in efficiency could be effected by a program to be financed out of the registrant's future earnings was highly
misleading since the prospectus failed to point out that such improvements would have required a massive program of capital investment
that had not even been formulated and could not be financed without
the sale of long-term debt or equity securities as to the successful
flotation of which there was no assurance. The Commission concluded
that deficiencies of such seriousness required the issuance of a stop
order. Registrant's assertion that the issuance of a stop order would
have an adverse effect on it was held insufficient in view of the fact that
registrant had never taken adequate steps to bring the deficiencies in
its registration statement to the attention of investors and of the demonstrated effectiveness of stop orders in achieving that result.
EXAMINATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission is authorized by Section 8 (e) of the Act to make
an examination in order to determine whether a stop order proceeding
should be instituted under Section B(d), and in connection therewith
is empowered to examine witnesses and require the production of pertinent documents. The Commission is also authorized by Section 20 (a)
of the Act to make an investigation to determine whether any provision of the Act or any rule or regulation prescribed thereunder has
been or is about to be violated. In appropriate cases, investigations
are instituted under this Section as an expeditious means of determining whether a registration statement is false or misleading or

EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION OF SMALL ISSUES

The Commission is authorized under Section 3(b) of the Securities
Act to exempt, by its rules and regulations and subject to such terms
and conditions as it may prescribe therein, any class of securities from
registration under the Act, if it finds that the enforcement of the
registration provisions of the Act with respect to such securities is
not necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors
by reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of the
public offering. The statute imposes a maximum limitation of
$300,000 upon the size of the issues which may thus be exempted.
Acting under this authority, the Commission has adopted the following exemptive rules and regulations :
Rule 234: Exemption of first lien notes.
Rule 235: Exemption of securities of cooperative housing corporations.
Rule 236: Exemption of shares offered in connection with certain transactions.
Regulation A: General exemption for United States and Canadian issues up to
$300,000.
Regulation B: Exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights
up to $100,000.
Regulation F: Exemption for assessments on assessable stock and for assessable
stock offered or sold to realize the amount of assessment thereon.

Under Section 3( c) of the Securities Act, which was added by Section
307(a) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, the Commission
is authorized to adopt rules and regulations exempting securities issued
by a company which is operating or proposes to operate as a small
business investment company under the Small Business Investment
Act. Acting pursuant to this authority, the Commission adopted
Regulation E which exempts, subject to terms and conditions substantially similar to those contained in Regulation A, securities offerings not in excess of $300,000 by any small business investment company which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Exemption from registration under Section 3 (h) or 3 (c) of the Act
does not carry with it any exemption from the provisions of the Act
prohibiting fraudulent conduct in the offer or sale of securities and
imposing civil liability or criminal responsibility for such conduct.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation

Regulation A permits a company to obtain needed capital not in excess of $300,000 (including underwriting commissions) in anyone year

from a public offering of its securities without registration, provided
specified conditions are met. These include the filing of a notification
supplying basic information about the company with the Regional
Office of the Commission in the region in which the company has its
principal place of business and the filing and use in the offering of an
offering circular. However, an offering circular need not be filed or
used in connection with an offering not in excess of $50,000by a company with earnings in one of the last 2 years.
During the 1965 fiscal year, 397 notifications were filed under
Regulation A, covering proposed offerings of $77,367,235,compared
with 462 notifications covering proposed offerings of $89,317,615 in
the 1964 fiscal year. Included in the 1965 total were 29 notifications
covering stock offerings of $3,298,877by companies engaged in the exploratory oil and gas business, 12 notifications covering offerings of
$2,732,760 by mining companies and 14 notifications covering offerings
of $3,102,095 by companies featuring new inventions, products or

Reports of Sales

The Commission requires, within 30 days after the end of each 6month period following the date of the original offering circular
required by Rule 256, or the statement required by Rule 257, that the
issuer or other person for whose account the securities are offered
shall file a report containing specified information and that a final
report shall be made upon completion or termination of the offering.
During the fiscal year 1965,795 Reports of Sales were filed reporting
an aggregate amount of sales of $45,554,313.
...
Suspension of Exemption

Regulation A provides for the suspension of an exemption thereunder where, in general, the exemption is sought for securities for

TffiRTY-FIRST

ANNUAL REPORT

35

which the regulation provides no exemption or where the offering is
not made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the regulation
or with prescribed disclosure standards. Following the issuance of a
temporary suspension order by the Commission, the respondents may
request a hearing to determine whether the temporary suspension
should be vacated, or made permanent. If no hearing is requested within 30 days after the entry of the temporary suspension order and none
is ordered by the Commission on its own motion, the temporary suspension order becomes permanent.
During the 1965fiscal year, temporary suspension orders were issued
in 23 cases, which, added to the 19 cases pending at the beginning of
the fiscal year, resulted in a total of 42 cases for disposition. Of these,
the temporary suspension order was vacated in 3 cases and became
permanent in 32: in 14 by lapse of time, in 12 by withdrawal of the
request for hearing, and in 6 after hearing. Thus, there were 7 cases
pending at the end of the fiscal year.
Three of the cases disposed of during the year are summarized below
to illustrate the type of misrepresentations and other noncompliance
with the regulation which led to the issuance of suspension orders:
Isthmus Steamship & Salvage Co., IncP-The issuer was organized in 1956, for the stated purposes of salvaging cargoes of sunken
ships and engaging in the general steamship business. After filing a
notification under Regulation A, the issuer in February 1958 commenced a public offering of 150,000shares at $2 per share. The efforts
of three broker-dealers to sell the offering having been largely unsuccessful, Robert Edelstein was designated sole underwriter on a "bestefforts" basis in May 1959. On August 7, 1959, issuer filed a report of
sales on Form 2-A stating that 148,088 shares had been sold and that
the offering had been terminated as to the unsold shares.
In consolidated Regulation A and broker-dealer proceedings, the
Commission found that the offering circular used by the issuer was
materially misleading in regard to the value of salvage rights which it
stated the issuer owned in the sunken ship 8.8. Bayard which had gone
down off the Louisiana coast in 1942. The circular stated that the ship
carried "copper wire, copper tubing, slab zinc, nickel, sheet brass and
other salvageable materials" having an estimated "maximum delivered
market value ... in excess of $2 million." However, a certified copy
of a 43-page manifest, filed in the New Orleans officeof the Bureau of
Customs the day before the ship had sunk, showed that the Bayard
cargo consisted primarily of perishable goods and not the valuable
and salvageable goods referred to in the offering circular.
The Commission stated in its Opinion that "while the truth of the

that it was so filed, its very existence casts serious doubt upon the
affirmative representations contained in the offering circular" and
"this apparent conflict clearly should have 'been disclosed to prospective investors .... "
The Commission permanently suspended the issuer's exemption
and revoked the broker-dealer registration of Edelstein's successor
firm, finding among other things that Edelstein as underwriter failed
to exercise reasonable care to satisfy himself as to the accuracy of the
offering circular and made false and misleading statements in the sale
of issuer's securities.
Marion Oil Company, Inc.12-The issuer, a Pennsylvania corporation, was organized in February 1963, to engage in the business of
prospecting for, producing and selling petroleum and natural gas.
Issuer filed a notification with the Commission on March 12, 1964,
with respect to a proposed public offering under Regulation A of'
100,000 shares of its Class B non-voting stock at $3 per share.
On May 11, 1964, the exemption was temporarily suspended. On
the basis of the record established at a hearing requested by the
issuer, the Commission permanently suspended the exemption. It
found that the issuer's offering circular was materially misleading in
that it did not disclose the existence of a predecessor of the issuer
of which the issuer's general manager and secretary had been president and secretary-treasurer, respectively, nor that such predecessor
had undertaken production of oil on the same tract to be developed
by Marion and had lost the lease to the tract through foreclosure
because of a lack of operating funds. The offering circular was further deficient in failing to disclose the production history of the tract
and unfavorable production information as to bordering properties
which it characterized as "oil producing property."
The Commission also found that the offering circular was materially
misleading in not adequately disclosing the immediate dilution of a
purchaser's investment from $3 per share to .45 cents per share if all
the securities were sold. Issuer also failed to meet the requirements
of Regulation A in not escrowing certain insider shares pursuant to
Rule 253(c), and consequently the filing involved an offering in
excess of the $300,000 limitation on Regulation A offerings.
Capitol Leasing Corporation IS_An affiliate of the issuer, .American Trailer Rental Company (ATR), had managed and rented a
fleet of automobile-type utility trailers which it obtained through
sale-leaseback arrangements. Some of the trailer owners were entitled to receive monthly a percentage of the cost of the trailer and
others a percentage of the amount realized through the use of the

trailer. .A.TR had sustained 3 years of substantial losses and was
delinquent in its payments to trailer owners. .A.TR's directors realized
that the company's financial position probably would deter trailer
owners from exchanging their interests for an equity position in .A.TR,
and therefore decided to form the issuer, which would acquire
$300,000 of trailers in exchange for its shares and would then make
an additional public offering of $6 million for the purpose of purchasing trailers, including those owned by .A.TR. When this plan was
not successful, issuer offered its stock under Regulation A, primarily
to .A.TR trailer owners, at $2 per share, or alternatively for trailers
at an exchange rate based on the retail cost of the trailers.
The Commission found that the issuer's offering circular was
materially misleading in that it failed to disclose that the issuer was
formed, and the proposed offering was designed, for the purpose of
effecting a program of financial relief for ATR; that the offering
was primarily being made to ATR trailer owners; that persons to
whom the offer was made were merely being given an opportunity to
exchange their rights under the .A.TR contracts for an equity interest
in substantially the same enterprise; that ATR had never operated at
a profit; that the subject offering was one step in a larger financing
plan involving a much larger public offering; and that efficers and
directors of the issuer were also creditors and stockholders of ATR.
The Commission permanently suspended the exemption, rejecting the
issuer's argument that the proceedings should be dismissed because
it had not been given an opportunity to correct the deficiencies in the
offering circular.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1965, 173 offering sheets and
203 amendments thereto were filed pursuant to Regulation Band
were examined by the Oil and Gas Section of the Commission's Division of Corporation Finance. During the 1964 and 1963 fiscal years,
242 and 231 offering sheets, respectively, were filed. The following

Reports of sales.-The Commission requires persons who make offerings under Regulation B to file reports of the actual sales made
pursuant to that regulation. The purpose of these reports is to aid
the Commission in determining whether violations of law have occurred in the marketing of such securities. The following table shows
the number of sales reports filed under Regulation B during the past
3 fiscal years and the aggregate dollar amount of sales during each
of such fiscal years.

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation E

Regulation E provides a conditional exemption from registration
under the Securities Act for securities of small business investment
companies which are licensed under the Small Business Investment
Act of 1958 or which have received the preliminary approval of the
Small Business Administration and have been notified by the Administration that they may submit an application for such a license. As
has been noted, the terms and conditions of the exemption are substantially similar to those provided by Regulation A. Two notifications were filed under Regulation E during the 1965 fiscal year. One
was subsequently withdrawn and the other was pending at the close
of the year.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation F

Regulation F provides an exemption for assessments levied upon
assessable stock and for delinquent assessment sales in amounts not
exceeding $300,000 in anyone year. It requires the filing of a simple
notification giving brief information with respect to the issuer, its
management, principal security holders, recent and proposed assessments and other security issues. The regulation requires a company
to send to its stockholders, or otherwise publish, a statement of the
purposes for which the proceeds of the assessment are proposed to be
used. Copies of any other sales literature used in connection with the
assessment must be filed. Like Regulation A, Regulation F provides
for the suspension of an exemption thereunder where the regulation
provides no exemption or where the offering is not made in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the regulation or in accordance with
prescribed disclosure standards.
During the 1965 fiscal year, 19 notifications were filed under Regulation F, covering assessments of $789,508. Underwriters were not
employed in any of the Regulation F assessments. No Regulation F
filings were suspended during
.fiscalyear.

REVISION OF RULES, REGULATIONS AND FORMS

In addition to the matters discussed below, two new rules (174 and
425A) were adopted during the fiscal year in implementation of the
1964 amendments to Section 4 of the Securities Act. The substance
of these rules is discussed in Part I of this Report.
Proposed Amendment of Rule 485

During the fiscal year, the Commission invited comments on certain
proposed amendments to Rule 485.14 This rule sets forth the procedure
to be followed by a registrant in applying to the Commission for confidential treatment of a material contract or a portion of such a contract. The proposed amendments would have required that the
registration statement indicate that the contract or a portion thereof
has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. A further
amendment would have required applications pursuant to the rule to
state whether or not the applicant would be willing to permit the disclosure of the contract or portion thereof to other agencies of the
Federal Government.
Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the Commission, after further consideration of the matter in the light of the comments and
suggestions received, determined not to adopt the proposed
amendments and accordingly withdrew them.>
Amendments to Forms S-l,

S-8 and 8-11

The amendments to the above forms adopted during the fiscal year
are discussed at pp. 75-76, infra, in connection with the discussion of
related amendments of Rules 10b-6 and 16b-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

.. Securities Act Release No. 4801 (September 13, 1965).

PART IV
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by the Securities
Acts Amendments of 1964,provides for the registration and regulation
of securities exchanges, the registration of securities listed on such
exchanges and, under new Section 12(g), the registration of securities
traded over the counter where the issuers of such securities have total
assets in excess of $1 million and the securities constitute a class of
equity securities held of record by at least 750 persons (after July 1,
1966, the number will be reduced to 500). It establishes, for issuers
of securities registered under the Act, financial and other reporting
requirements and regulation of proxy solicitations and, for directors,
officers and principal security holders of such issuers, reporting requirements and restrictions on trading in the securities of their companies. The Act also provides for the registration and regulation of
national securities associations and of brokers and dealers doing business in the over-the-counter markets, contains provisions designed to
prevent fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative acts and practices on
the exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets and authorizes the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to regulate the use
of credit in securities transactions. The principal purpose of the various statutory provisions is to ensure the maintenance of fair and
honest markets in securities transactions on the organized exchanges
and in the over-the-counter markets.

The Wheeling Stock Exchange ceased activity and its exemption
from registration as a national securities exchange was terminated
effective April 30, 1965.
Commission Inspections of the Exchanges

One of the Commission's primary roles under the regulatory scheme
of the Exchange Act is the oversight of the national securities exchanges in the performance of their self-regulatory activities. To
facilitate this oversight the Office of Regulation in the Division of
Trading and Markets conducts regular and periodic inspections of
various phases of exchange activity. During the past year, 11 such
inspections were made of the New York and American Stock Exchanges and general inspections were conducted of the Cincinnati,
Detroit, Honolulu, Pacific Coast and Salt Lake Exchanges. These
periodic inspections enable the Commission to insure that the exchanges are complying with their self-regulatory responsibilities and
to recommend improvements and refinements designed to increase the
effectiveness of self-regulation.
The inspections conducted of the two New York exchanges covered
such areas as procedures relating to the financial responsibility of
member organizations, surveillance of registered traders, surveillance
of specialists, procedures for handling public complaints, and practices and procedures regarding admission and qualification standards
for members and registered representatives.
Where it appeared to the staff of the Commission that revisions in
exchange procedures or policies were desirable in order to improve
an exchange's performance, its views were communicated to the particular exchange and discussions were held between the Commission and
exchange staffs to arrive at appropriate solutions. During the past
year a number of significant improvements in exchange operations
were accomplished as a result of the inspection program and the subsequent discussions.
Section 19(a) (1) Proceedings Against San Francisco Mining Exchange

During the fiscal year further progress toward a final determination
was made in the pending proceedings under Section 19(a) (1) of the
Act to determine whether the registration of the San Francisco Mining Exchange should be withdrawn for the protection of investors.
The proceedings are based on allegations that the Exchange failed to
require its members and issuers of securities registered on the Exchange to comply with the Act's reporting, proxy-soliciting, recordkeeping and other requirements, that it permitted its facilities to be
used in connection with unlawful securities distributions, and that it

42

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

did not have adequate listing or delisting standards and was not properly organized to discharge the responsibilities of a national securities
exchange under the Act. Following an evidentiary hearing, the hearing examiner filed a recommended decision in May 1965, in which he
found the existence of a number of serious deficiencies but recommended that the Exchange be given a further opportunity to effect
a thorough reorganization and change of management and that if such
reorganization were not accomplished within a 90-day period the Exchange's registration be withdrawn.
In July 1965, subsequent to the
end of the fiscal year, the Commission heard oral argument.
The Exchange urged acceptance of the hearing examiner's recommendations,
while the Division of Trading and Markets urged that the registration of the Exchange be withdrawn.
Exchange Disciplinary Action

Each national securities exchange reports to the Commission disciplinary actions taken against its members, member firms or persons connected therewith for violation of any rule of the exchange or of the
Securities Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder.
During the fiscal year, six exchanges reported 127 such actions, including impositions of fines in 23 cases ranging :from $25 to $20,000,
with total fines aggregating $28,875, and the suspension from membership of 14 individuals and three member organizations.
These exchanges also reported the imposition of various sanctions against 60
registered representatives and employees of member firms. In addition, a number of informal staff actions of a cautionary nature were
reported by several exchanges.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES

Unless a security is registered on a national securities exchange under the Securities Exchange Act or is exempt from such registration it
is unlawful for a member of such exchange or any broker or dealer to
effect any transaction in the security on the exchange. In general, the
Act exempts from registration obligations issued or guaranteed by a
state or the Federal Government or by certain subdivisions or agencies
thereof and authorizes the Commission to adopt rules and regulations
exempting such other securities as the Commission may find.necessary
or appropriate to exempt in the public interest or for the protection of
investors. Under this authority the Commission has exempted securities of certain banks, certain securities secured by property or
leasehold interests, certain warrants and, on a temporary basis, certain
securities issued in substitution for or in addition to listed securities.
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, an issuer may register
a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission and

THIRTY-FIRST

ANNUAL REPORT

43

the exchange an application which discloses pertinent information
concerning the issuer and its affairs. Information must be furnished
regarding the issuer's business, its capital structure, the terms of its
securities, the persons who manage or control its affairs, the remuneration paid to its officers and directors, and the allotment of options,
bonuses and profit-sharing plans, and financial statements certified by
independent accountants must be filed as part of the application.
Form 10 is the form used for registration by most commercial and
industrial companies. There are specialized forms for certain types
of securities, such as voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit
and securities of foreign governments. These forms are also used for
the registration under new Section 12(g) of securities traded in the
over-the-counter markets.
Section 13 requires issuers having securities registered on an exchange to file periodic reports keeping current the information furnished in the application for registration. These periodic reports include annual reports, semi-annual reports, and current reports.
The principal annual report form is Form 10-K which is designed to
keep up-to-date the information furnished in applications filed on
Form 10. Semi-annual reports required to be filed on Form 9-K
are devoted chiefly to furnishing mid-year financial data. Current
reports on Form 8-K are required to be filed for each month in which
any of certain specified events have occurred. A report on this form
deals with matters such as changes in control of the registrant, important acquisitions or dispositions of assets, the institution or termination of important legal proceedings and important changes in the
issuer's capital securities or in the amount thereof outstanding. The
above requirements are now also applicable to issuers having securities
registered under new Section 12(g).
The following table shows the number of reports filed during the
fiscal year pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act and those filed
under Section 15(d) of the Act by issuers obligated to file reports by
reason of having publicly offered securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933. As of June 30, 1965, there were 3,184 such issuers, including 315 that were also registered as investment companies
under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The table also includes
the number of annual reports, quarterly reports and reports to stockholders filed by issuers subject to the reporting requirements of Section 30 of the Investment Company Act.

STATISTICS RELATING TO SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES
Number of Issuers and Securities

As of June 30, 1965, a total of 2,522 issuers had 4,127 classes of
securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges, of
which 2,913 were classified as stocks and 1,214 as bonds. Of these
totals, 1,417 issuers had 1,625 stock issues and 1,118 bond issues listed
and registered on the New York Stock Exchange. Thus, 56 percent
of the issuers, 156percent of the stock issues and 92 percent of the bond
issues were on the New York Stock Exchange. Table 4 in the appendix
to this report contains comprehensive statistics as to the number of
securities issues admitted to exchange trading and the number of
issuers involved, as of June 30, 1965.
During the 1965 fiscal year, 149 issuers listed and registered securities on a national securities exchange for the first time, while the
registration of all securities of 94 issuers was terminated. 'A total of
279 applications for registration of securities on exchanges was filed
during the year.
Market Value of Securities Available for Trading

The market value on December 31, 1964, of stocks and bonds, both
listed and unlisted, admitted to trading on one or more stock exchanges
in the United States was approximately $636 billion.
The New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange
figures were reported by those exchanges. There was no duplication
of issues between them. The figures for all other exchanges were for
the net number of issues appearing only on such exchanges, excluding

of December 31 annually by the Commission since 1948. The available
data since 1936 appear in Table 5 in the appendix of this Annual

over the years reflect not only changes in prices of stocks but also such
factors as new listings, mergers into listed companies, removals from
listing and issuance of additional shares of a listed security.

Foreign Stocks on Exchanges

The market value on December 31, 1964, of all shares and certificates
representing foreign stocks on U.S. stock exchanges was $17 billion,
of which $14.1 billion represented Canadian and $2.9 billion represented other foreign stocks. The market values of the entire Canadian
stock issues were included in these aggregates.
Most of the other
foreign stocks were represented by .American Depository Receipts or
American shares, only the outstanding amounts of which were used
in determining market values.

The number of foreign stocks on the exchanges has declined in
recent years, owing principally to a reduction on the American Stock
Exchange from 145 issues in 1960, to 102 in 1964. However, trading
in foreign stocks represented 17.9 percent of the reported share volume

THIRTY-FIRST

ANNUAL REPORT

on that Exchange in 1960, and 18.5 percent in 1964. Trading in
foreign stocks on the N ew York Stock Exchange has declined from
2.7 percent of its reported share volume in 1960, to 2 percent in 1964.
Reported trading volumes in foreign shares during 1964 consisted
of about 44.7 million Canadian shares and 24.6 million other foreign
shares on the American Stock Exchange and about 12.3 million Canadian shares and 11.7 million other foreign shares on the New York
Stock Exchange.
While the share volume on the American exceeded
that on the N ew York Stock Exchange, it would appear that in view
of higher average share prices, the latter exchange had a greater
dollar volume in foreign shares.
Comparative Exchange Statistics

During fiscal year 1965, there was a moderate increase in the number
of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, consistent with the
trend of recent years; the number listed on the American Stock
Exchange also increased moderately, representing the first gain since
1962; and the number of stocks available for trading exclusively on
the other exchanges continued to decline.

DELI STING OF SECURITIES FROM EXCHANGES

Application may be made to the Commission by exchanges to strike
securities or by issuers to withdraw their securities from listing and

June 30, 1965, the Commission granted applications by exchanges and
issuers to remove 64 stock issues, representing 62 issuers, from listing
and registration. Since 8 stocks were each delisted by two exchanges,
there was a total of 72 stock removals, as follows:

Revisions in the listing and delisting standards of the American
and New York Stock Exchange became effective in February and
April 1965, respectively. The Midwest Stock Exchange adopted a
number of listing policy changes in 1964,and adopted delisting standards in January 1965.

Delisting Proceedings Under Section 19(a) (2)

Section 19(a) (2) authorizes the Commission to suspend for a period
not exceeding 12 months, or to withdraw, the registration of a security
on a national securities exchange if in its opinion such action is necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors and it finds, after
notice and opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has
failed to comply with any provision of the Act or the rules and
regulations thereunder. The one proceeding under this Section pending at the beginning of the fiscal year 1 was terminated, and no additional proceedings were instituted during the year.
UNLISTED TRADING PRIVILEGES ON EXCHANGES

Stocks with unlisted trading privileges which are not also listed
and registered on other exchanges continued to decline in number,
from 140 on June 30, 1964, to 132 on June 30, 1965. The American
Stock Exchange accounted for all the removals. The distribution of
unlisted stocks and share volumes therein among the exchanges is
shown in Appendix Table 9.
The statutory provisions regarding unlisted trading privileges were
amended in several respects by the Securities Acts Amendments of
1964. Thus, the provision authorizing an exchange, with the approval
of the Commission, to extend unlisted trading privileges to any security as to which the disclosure requirements and other duties and
obligations of the issuer were substantially equivalent to those applicable to listed securities has been deleted. The Commission is now
authorized to extend unlisted trading privileges only for securities
listed and registered on another national securities exchange. In addition, the 1964 amendments broadened the standards by which the
Commission must judge applications for unlisted trading privileges
by deleting a requirement that an applicant exchange demonstrate
the existence of widespread public distribution and trading activity
in the security in the vicinity of the exchange. The Commission is now
allowed to consider all factors affecting the public interest or the protection of investors in extending, suspending or terminating unlisted
trading.
During the calendar year 1964,the reported volume of trading on the
exchanges in stocks with only unlisted trading privileges was about
24,521,000 shares or about 1.2 percent of the total share volume on
all exchanges. About 96 percent of this volume was on the American
Stock Exchange while four other exchanges contributed the remaining
4 percent. The share volume in these stocks on the American Stock

Exchange represented 5.9 percent of the total share volume on that
Exchange.
Unlisted trading privileges on exchanges in stocks listed and registered on other exchanges numbered 1,661 as of June 30, 1965. The
volume of trading in these stocks for the calendar year 1964 was
reported at about 67,927,000 shares. About 14 percent of this volume
was on the American Stock Exchange in stocks listed on regional
exchanges, and. 86 percent was on regional exchanges in stocks
listed on the New York or American Stock Exchange. While the
67,927,000 shares amounted to only 3.3 percent of the total share
volume on all exchanges, they constituted substantial portions of the
share volume of the leading regional exchanges, as reflected in the
following approximate percentages: Boston 74 percent; Cincinnati
73 percent; Detroit 68 percent; Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington
68 percent; Pittsburgh 52 percent; Midwest 32 percent; and Pacific
Coast 30 percent.
Applications for Unlisted Trading Privileges

Applications by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges in stocks
listed on other exchanges, filed pursuant to Rule 12f-1 under Section
12(f) (1) (B) of the Securities Exchange Act, were granted by the

BLOCK DISTRmUTIONS

REPORTED BY EXCHANGES

The usual method of distributing blocks of listed securities considered too large for the auction market on the floor of an exchange
is to resort to "secondary distributions" over the counter after the close
of exchange trading.
Secondary distributions, as reported since 1942,
reached a peak of $926,514,000 during the calendar year 1961, and the
total of $909,821,000 during 1964 is close to this peak. During the
first 6 months of 1965, there were 74 secondary distributions aggregating $1,099,121,000, or more than the total for the entire year 1964.
This record total includes two unusually large secondary distributions, one by Ford Motor Co. and one by General Motors Co., which
together accounted for more than half of the total value.
In an effort to keep as much trading as possible on their floors, the
leading exchanges adopted Special Offering Plans in 1942, and the
somewhat more flexible Exchange Distribution Plans in 1953. Spe-

TEITRTY-FIRST~AL

cial offerings have disappeared in the last few years, while the number
of exchange distributions has grown. The largest number of special
offerings was 87 in 1944, with $32,454,000 aggregate value. In 1962,
there were only two offerings and in 1963 and 1964 there were none.
Exchange distributions reached a record with 72 in 1963, compared
with 68 in 1964; the value of such distributions was $107,498,000 in
1963,compared with $97,711,000 the following year.

REGISTRATION OF OVER.THE-COUNTER SECURITIES

The provisions of Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act requiring the
registration of certain securities traded in the over-the-counter markets, which was added by the Securities Acts Amendments of 1964,
the implementation of that Section and of Section 12(h) (relating to
exemptions from the requirements of Section 12 (g) ) through the adoption or amendment of various rules and forms by the Commission,
statistics regarding the number of registration statements filed during
the fiscal year pursuant to Section 12 (g), and related matters are discussed in some detail in Part I of this Report.
MANIPULATION AND STABILIZATION
Manipulation;

Market Surveillance

The Exchange Act describes and prohibits certain forms of manipulative activity in any security registered on a national securities exchange. The prohibited activities include wash sales and matched
orders effected for the purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance of trading activity in, or with respect to the market for, any such
security; a series of transactions in which the price of such security
is raised or depressed, or in which actual or apparent active trading is
created, for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales of such security
by others; circulation by a broker, dealer, seller, or buyer, or by a
person who receives consideration from a broker, dealer, seller or buyer,
of information concerning market operations conducted for a rise or a

52

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

decline in the price of such security; and the making of any false or
misleading statement of material information by a broker, dealer,
seller, or buyer regarding such security for the purpose of inducing
purchases or sales. The Act also empowers the Commission to adopt
rules and regulations to define and prohibit the use of these and other
forms of manipulative activity in any security registered on an exchange or traded over the counter.
In August 1964, the Commission transferred to the headquarters
officeresponsibility for overall surveillance of the securities markets.
To implement a more effective and expanded program of surveillance,
designed to be integrated into the Commission's regulatory program,
procedures were adopted whereby the activities of the Commission's
market surveillance staff were closely coordinated with the stockwatching operations of the New York and American Stock Exchanges.
Within this framework, the Commission's market surveillance staff
reviews the daily and periodic stock watch reports prepared by these
exchanges and on the basis of its analysis of the information developed
by the exchanges and from other sources, determines the matters of
interest, the apparent violations, if any, of applicable law and the
appropriate action to be taken.
The Commission's market surveillance staff also observes the tickertape quotations of securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange
and on the American Stock Exchange, the sales and quotation sheets
of regional exchanges, and the bid and asked prices published by the
National Daily Quotation Service for unlisted securities to observe
any unusual or unexplained price variations or market activity. The
financial news ticker, leading newspapers, and various financial publications and statistical services are also closely followed. Investigations are conducted if it appears that violations have occurred.
When securities are to be offered to the public, their markets are
watched very closely to make sure that the price is not unlawfully
raised prior to or during the distribution. During the fiscal year,
such surveillance took place with respect to a total of 1,163 registered
offerings, with a value of $12.8 billion, and 397 offerings under the
small issues exemption from registration (Regulation A under the
Securities Act) with a value of $77 million. In addition, 204 other
offerings, such as secondary distributions and distributions of securities under special plans filed by the exchanges, having a total value
of $1,039 million, were also kept under surveillance.
Stabilization

Stabilization involves open-market purchases of securities to prevent or retard a decline in the market price in order to facilitate a
distribution. It is permitted by the Exchange Act subject to the
restrictions provided by the Commission's Rules 1Ob-6,7 and 8. These

THIRTY-FIRST

ANNUAL REPORT

53

rules are designed to confine stabilizing activity to that necessary for
the above purpose, to require proper disclosure and to prevent unlawful
manipulation.
During fiscal year 1965, stabilizing was effected in connection with
stock offerings totaling 42,092,451shares having an aggregate public
offering price of $1,634,723,254 and bond offerings having a total
offering price of $427,105,000. In these offerings, stabilizing transactions resulted in the purchase of 1,443,148 shares at a cost of
$52,005,854and bonds at a cost of $1,651,630. In connection with these
stabilizing transactions, 6,418 stabilizing reports, showing purchases
and sales of securities effected by persons conducting the distribution,
were received and examined during the fiscal year.
INSIDERS' SECURITY HOLDINGS AND TRANSACTIONS

Corporate insiders, by virtue of their position, may have knowledge
of a company's condition and prospects which is unavailable to the
general public and may be able to use such information to their personal advantage in trading in the company's securities. Section 16 of
the Exchange Act and corresponding provisions in Section 17 of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and Section 30(f) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 are designed to prevent the unfair
use of such information by giving publicity to insiders' security transactions and holdings, and removing the profit incentive in short-term
trading.
Ownership Reports

Prior to the 1965 fiscal year, Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act required eyery person who was a direct or indirect beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of any class of equity security
which was registered on a national securities exchange, or who was a
director or an officerof the issuer of any such security, to file statements
with the Commission and the exchange disclosing his ownership of
the issuer's equity securities and changes in such ownership. The
Securities Acts Amendments of 1964 extended the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) to the insiders of issuers of securities registered
Similar provisions applicable to insiders of
under Section 12(g).
registered public-utility holding companies and registered closed-end
investment, companies are contained in Section 17(a) of the Holding
Company Act and Section 30(f) of the Investment Company Act,
respectively. The administration of the insider reporting provisions
of the three Acts is combined in one section in the Division of Corporation Finance.
During the fiscal year, 56,554 ownership reports (14,594 initial
statements of ownership on Form 3 and 41,960 statements of changes in

54

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

ownership on Form 4) were filed with the Commission. This represents an increase of 11,923 over the 44,631 reports (6,573 initial statements and 38,058 statements of changes) filed during the 1964 fiscal
year. The bulk of the increase is attributable to the extension of the
reporting requirements to insiders of issuers of over-the-counter securities registered under new Section 12(g), although the majority
of the initial statements of ownership by the insiders of the more than
1,500 companies affected was not filed until after the close of the fiscal
year.
All ownership reports are made available for public inspection as
soon as they are filed at the Commission's officein Washington and at
the exchanges where copies are filed. In addition, the information
contained in reports filed with the Commission is summarized and
published in the monthly "Official Summary of Security Transactions
and Holdings," which is distributed by the Government Printing
Office on a subscription basis to more than 20,000 persons.
Recovery of Short-Swing Trading Profits by Issuer

In order to prevent insiders from making unfair use of information
which may have been obtained by reason of their relationship with a
company, Section 16(b) of the Exchange .1\ct, Section 17(b) of the
Holding Company Act, and Section 30(f) of the Investment Company
Act provide for the recovery by or on behalf of the issuer of any
profit realized by insiders in the categories described under "Ownership Reports" from certain purchases and sales, or sales and purchases,
of securities of the company within any period of less than 6 months.
The Commision has certain exemptive powers with respect to transactions not comprehended within the purpose of these provisions, but
is not charged with the enforcement of the civil remedies created
thereby.
REGULATION OF PROXIES
Scope of Proxy Regulation

Under Sections 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 12( e) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and 20(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Commission has adopted Regulation 14A requiring the disclosure in a proxy statement of pertinent
information in connection with the solicitation of proxies, ,consents
and authorizations in respect of securities subject to those provisions,
in order to enable holders of such securities to act intelligently on the
matters involved. The regulation also provides, among other things,
that when the management is soliciting proxies, any security holder
desiring to communicate with other security holders for a proper
purpose may require the management to furnish him with a list of
all security holders or to mail his communication to security holders

THIRTY-FIRST

A.L"'~UAL REPORT

55

for him. A security holder may also, subject to reasonable prescribed
limitations, require the management to include in its proxy material
any appropriate proposal which such security holder desires to submit
to a vote of security holders. Any security holder or group of security
holders may at any time make an independent proxy solicitation upon
compliance with the proxy rules, whether or not the management is
making a solicitation. Certain additional provisions of the regulation
are applicable where a contest for control of the management of an
issuer or representation on the board is involved.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminary form prior to the date of the proposed solicitation.
Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed disclosure
standards, the management or other group responsible for its preparation is notified informally and given an opportunity to correct the
deficiencies in the preparation of the definitive proxy material to be
furnished to security holders.
The Securities Acts Amendments of 1964 extended the proxy solicitation requirements to those over-the-counter securities which are
registered under Section 12(g) of the Act. As previously noted,"
Regulation 14A is applicable to solicitations of proxies with respect
to such securities where the solicitation is commenced on or after
July 1, 1965. The amendments also authorize the Commission to
promulgate rules and regulations requiring an issuer to send information to security holders even though a proxy solicitation is not made,
and requiring broker-dealers to transmit proxy material to customers. 3
Proposed Regulation HC to implement the former provision is discussed in Part I of this report.
Statistics Relating to Proxy Statements

During the 1965 fiscal year, 2,661 proxy statements in definitive
form were filed under the Commission's Regulation 14A for the
solicitation of proxies of security holders; 2,639 of these were filed
by management and 22 by non-management groups or individual stockholders. These 2,661 solicitations related to 2,433 companies, 228 of
which had more than one solicitation during the year, generally for a
special meeting not involving the election of directors. There were
2,391solicitations of proxies for the election of directors, 248 for special
meetings not involving the election of directors, and 22 for other
assents and authorizations.
During fiscal year 1965, the votes of security holders were solicited
with respect to the following types of matters, other than the election
of directors:

Stockholders' Proposals

During the 1965 fiscal year, 191 proposals submitted by 42 stockholders were included in the proxy statements of 132 companies under
Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14A.
Typical of such stockholder proposals submitted to a vote of security
holders were resolutions relating to amendments to charters or by-laws
to provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors, limitations on the grant of stock options to and their exercise by key
employees and management groups, the sending of a post-meeting
report to all stockholders, a change of the place of the annual stockholders' meeting, and the approval by stockholders of management's
selection of independent auditors.
A total of 54 additional proposals submitted by 38 stockholders
was omitted from the proxy statements of 29 companies in accordance
with Rule 14a-8. The principal reasons for such omissions and the
number of times each such reason was involved (counting only one
reason for omission for each proposal even though it may have been
omitted under more than one provision of Rule 14a-8) were as follows:

Registration

Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires the registration of all brokers and dealers who use the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce to effect or induce transactions in
securities in the over-the-counter market. Brokers and dealers conducting an exclusively intrastate business or dealing only in exempted
securities, commercial paper, commercial bills or bankers' acceptances
are exempt from registration. The 1964 amendments added Section
15(a) (2) which permits the Commission to exempt broker-dealers or
classes of broker-dealers, either unconditionally or upon specified terms
or conditions, from the requirement of registration.
The following tabulation reflects certain data with respect to registrations of brokers and dealers during the fiscal year ended June 30,

Proceedings

The scope of the administrative sanctions which the Commission
may impose against brokers and dealers and persons associated with
a broker or dealer, pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 15A of the Exchange Act, was enlarged in significant respects by the Securities Acts
Amendments of 1964. Thus, in addition to the previously available
sanctions against a broker-dealer of denial or revocation of registration and expulsion or suspension from a registered securities association or national securities exchange, the Commission may now
suspend a broker-dealer's registration for a period not to exceed 12
months and may impose censure. Under prior law the Commission
could not proceed directly against individuals associated with a
broker-dealer firm, although incidental to a proceeding against the
firm it could make findings with respect to such individuals which had
the effect of disqualifying them from employment in the securities
industry. The Act, as amended, permits direct action against
associated persons, with or without joining the firm. The Commission
may censure an associated person, may suspend or bar him from being

TIITRTY-FIRST

ANNUAL REPORT

59

associated with a broker or dealer, and may suspend or bar him from
being associated with a member of a registered securities association.
Under Section 15(b), a sanction of revocation, denial or suspension
of registration, or censure may be imposed upon a broker-dealer if,
after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that
such sanction is in the public interest and that the broker-dealer, or
any person associated with such broker-dealer, is subject to one or
more of the specified statutory disqualifications. The Commission
may censure, or bar or suspend from association with a brokerdealer, an associated person where it finds that such action is in the
public interest and that such person has committed or omitted any act
or omission which would be a basis for the imposition of a sanction if
such person were a broker-dealer. The statutory disqualifications,
which have been enlarged by the 1964 amendments, include the
following:
(1) wilfully false or misleading statements in an application forregistration or other report required to be filed under the Exchange
Act;
(2) conviction within the previous 10 years of a felony or misdemeanor which involved the purchase or sale of securities; arose out of
the conduct of business as a broker-dealer or investment adviser; involved embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, or misappropriation of
funds or securities; or involved violation of the provisions of the
United States Code dealing with various frauds and swindles committed by use of the mails, telephone, telegraph, radio or television;
(3) injunction by a court of competent jurisdiction against engaging
in certain practices related to the securities business;
(4) wilful violation of any provision of the Securities Act of 1933,
the Exchange Act, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or the Investment Company Act of 1940 or any of the Commission's rules or regulations thereunder;
(5) wilfully aiding or abetting another person in a violation of the
Federal securities laws or rules and regulations thereunder or failing
reasonably to supervise other persons who commit such violations; and
(6) employing a person barred or suspended from being associated
with a broker-dealer.
Section 15A of the Exchange Act as amended empowers the Commission to suspend or expel a broker-dealer from membership in a
registered securities association or to suspend or bar any person from
being associated with a member, upon a finding of violation of the
Federal securities laws or any rule or regulation thereunder. The
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD") is the
only such association. Section 19(a) (3) of the Act gives the Commission power to take similar action against members of national
securities exchanges.

Decisions of Particular Interest

The physical limitations imposed upon this report preclude an
extensive review of the many decisions rendered by the Commission
during the 1965fiscal year in administrative proceedings with respect
to brokers and dealers. However, a few cases of unusual interest or
significance are set forth in some detail in the following paragraphs:
In ..Axe Securities (Iorporatiotu: the Commission censured Axe
Securities Corporation, a registered broker-dealer, E. W". Axe & Co.,
a registered investment adviser, and a principal of both firms on the
basis of findings that they had wilfully violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Investment Advisers Act.
The violations resulted from the publication by respondents of an
article, "Your Investment Program," in a book entitled To the Bride.
The book, which also contained recipes, household hints and recommendations of various products and was distributed to prospective
brides by about 96 department stores, urged brides to initiate an investment program by purchasing shares in a mutual fund. It stated that
E. W. Axe & Co. was "one of the outstanding nationally recognized
investment counsels" whose "proven ability in economic research and
evaluation, and their record in economic and market analysis, had led
many financial institutions to retain them."
The article was paid for by Axe Securities and E. W. Axe & Co.
and described, analyzed and recommended a group of mutual funds of
which the registrants were the underwriter and investment adviser,
respectively. The book contained no statement of the receipt and
amount of the consideration paid by the registrants for the recommendations made.
The Commission found that the article may have carried to unwary
readers the implication of an objective unpaid endorsement of, the
funds by the publisher, and that its publication violated the antifraud provisions. The Commission also found that other provisions
of the Federal securities statutes were violated, including those relating to transmission of prospectuses. Because of certain mitigating
factors, including cooperation with the Commission's staff in its investigation, rescission offers to recipients of the books who purchased
the funds and adoption of internal procedures with respect to the
distribution of sales materials, the Commission found that the public
interest did not require a more severe sanction than censure.
In Oapital Funds, Ino.," the Commission denied broker-dealer
registration to the firm and found its principals each a cause of the
denial on the basis of a finding, among others, that respondents wilâ€¢ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7442, Investment Advisers Act Release

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

fully violated the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933
in the sale of stock of Peoples Loan & Investment Co. Inc., an
Arkansas corporation.
Capital Funds was the underwriter of a public offering of stock
of Peoples, assertedly limited to residents of Arkansas. One thousand shares of stock, however, were sold to two residents of Oklahoma. Respondents claimed the transactions in fact represented sales
by one of the firm's salesmen of stock which he had previously purchased from the firm. The Commission rejected this contention, however, finding that the salesman had not become the bona fide owner of
the shares or, even if he had, that under all the circumstances such
shares had not come to rest in the hands of a resident before being
sold to non-residents.
The Commission accordingly concluded that no intrastate exemption under Section 3 (a) (11) of the Securities Act was available for the
respondents' offering of Peoples stock and pointed out that it is incumbent upon an underwriter and others connected with a public
offering in reliance on that exemption to make certain that the offering
does not in fact become interstate in character.
The Commission also rejected the further contention that the
securities of Peoples were exempt from registration under Section
3(a) (2) of the Securities Act as securities issued by 'a banking institution, finding that Peoples was an industrial loan institution rather
than a banking institution.
Early in the fiscal year, the Commission, pursuant to an offer of
settlement, entered an order with respect to J. H. Gorklard &: 00.,
Inc. suspending registrant from membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. for a period of 45 days and, upon
termination of such suspension, from membership in the Boston Stock
Exchange for 90 days." Subsequently, the Commission issued its
Findings and Opinion," It found that registrant sold shares of
unregistered stock of United Security Life Insurance Co. at increasing prices resulting from its manipulative market activities accompanied by the dissemination of false and misleading market letters.
It further found that, in entering bids in the "pink" sheets and purchasing such securities while engaged in their distribution, registrant
violated Rule 10~6 under Section lO(b) of the Exchange Aot.
In Sidney Tager, doing business as The Tager Oompany,8 the
Commission revoked the broker-dealer registrations of Tager and
Darius Incorporated, expelled Tager from membership in the NASD,

suspended Englander & Co., Inc. from NASD membership for a
period of 15 days, and found certain individual respondents to 'be
causes of the sanctions imposed on their firms. The Commission
found that Tager, together with or aided and abetted by the other respondents, wilfully violated the anti-fraud provisions of the securities
acts, including Rule 10b-6.
Tager, while engaged as underwriter in distributing stock of Diversified Collateral Corporation, induced Darius to enter quotations
for the stock in the National Quotation Bureau sheets at prices suggested by Tager. Englander also entered quotations in the sheets
during the same period. Both were told by Tager that the stock
was free for trading. The Commission pointed out that under Rule
1Ob-6 it is a manipulative or deceptive device for an underwriter
engaged in a distribution of a security to bid for or purchase such
security for any account in which he has a beneficial interest or to
attempt to induce any person to purchase any such security. It held
that Tager wilfully violated the rule since he attempted to induce
purchases by others by causing Darius and Englander to make a
market in the stock and insert quotations in the sheets while he was
still engaged in the distribution of the stock. The Commission further
held that the participation of Darius and Englander and the individual respondents in Tager's violations was wilful since they failed
to take reasonable precautions to satisfy themselves that the distribution was over instead of merely accepting Tager's self-serving
assertion that it was, before making a market in the security.
The Commission added that its findings and conclusions did not
mean that a dealer is not free to trade in a stock being distributed
by another dealer. The gravamen of the violations here was that
these respondents joined with Tager in activities designed to stimulate
purchases and maintain or increase the price of Diversified stock at
a time when Tager was engaged in a distribution which they knew
or should have known was not yet terminated.
In Albert J. DiGiacomo, doing business as Albert James 00.,9 the
Commission, pursuant to an offer of settlement submitted by respondent, and based on findings that he had wilfully violated the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities acts in the sale of unregistered shares of J-F Machine, Diesel and Electronics, Inc.
through the use of a false and misleading offering circular, and had
wilfully violated the record-keeping requirements under the Exchange Act, suspended his broker-dealer registration for 120 days
subject to the conditions that he would withdraw his registration
at the end of the suspension period and that the findings and order

sion to his future employment in the securities business upon a showing that he would be employed under appropriate supervision. The
case is of interest in that it is the first instance in which the Commission, as newly empowered under Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act,
imposed a suspension of broker-dealer registration for a specified
period.
In Vidor R. Redstone, 10 the Commission found registrant responsible for wilful violations of the Federal securities laws committed by
persons whom he permitted to conduct a securities business under his
trade name and revoked his registration as a broker-dealer.
It was found that registrant, a sole proprietor, doing business as
Vanguard Investment Company, had agreed with two other persons to
form a corporation, also to be known as Vanguard Investment Company, to engage in the securities business at a time when his securities
business was dormant and he was engaged in the insurance business.
The other two parties to the agreement opened an officeand engaged
in the securities business under registrant's trade name. Thereafter,
these two individuals sold unregistered securities by means of false
and misleading statements in wilful violation of the Federal securities
statutes.
The Commission rejected registrant's claim that he was unaware
that securities were being sold under his trade name, citing several
instances evidencing his knowledge of such fact. It stated that registrant was under a duty to exercise control and supervision over the
securities activities being conducted under his trade name, and since
he failed to do so, must be held responsible for the violations which
such activities entailed.
The Commission revoked the broker-dealer registration of Financial
Uounsellors, Lnc., and found Ernest F. Boruski, Jr. a cause of such
action, on the basis of findings that the registrant failed to disclose
in its application for registration, and amendments thereto, that Boruski controlled its business." The Commission found that Boruski,
a registered broker-dealer specializing in the retail sale of mutual
fund shares, conceived the idea of forming the registrant after revocation proceedings were instituted against him, in order to protect future
concessions on sales of mutual fund shares previously effected. The
record showed that the registrant was entirely under his control,
domination and management. In considering the question of what
remedial action was required in the public interest, the Commission
look into account the "intentional concealment and evasion," and

emphasized the importance of the application for registration to the
performance of its enforcement functions.
Subsequently, the Commission revoked Boruski's broker-dealer registration and expelled him :from membership in the NASD on the
basis of his wilful violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 17a-5 thereunder." The Commission found that for several
years Boruski had submitted reports of financial condition which
were not certified, as required by the rule, despite the fact that no exemption from certification was available. Following each submission
he was advised by the Commission's staff that the uncertified reports
did not qualify as a filing under the rule and that in order to avoid
a violation it would be necessary for him to file a proper report. Boruski contended that he was unable to find an accountant to certify his
reports and that the certification requirement was illegal since he could
not compel an accountant to do so.
The Commission rejected this argument, stating that the certification requirement contemplates a thorough review of a broker-dealer's
accounts and financial affairs for the purpose of safeguarding funds
and securities of customers and to give the public the protection which
an audit is designed to achieve, including the detached objectivity of
a disinterested person. The Commission stated that a broker-dealer
who submits a financial report which is not certified, whether because
he chose not to have it certified or because he submitted it to an accountant for certification in a form or under circumstances which
caused the accountant to refuse to certify it, is not complying with its
reporting requirements.
The Commission at the same time denied Boruski's application for
registration as an investment adviser, on the basis of its findings in the
B01'Uski and Financial Oouneellors broker-dealer proceedings.
Indicative of the fact that "boiler-rooms" present a continuing
problem are the decisions during the fiscal year in Albion Securities
Oompany, Inc.,I3 Wright, ~!lfyers &: Bessell, Inc.,14 lVilliam Glal1zman
&: 00., Inc.,t5 and Fabrikant Securities Oorporaiionr"
The Commission, finding wilful violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities acts by principals and salesmen of each of these firms,
revoked their broker-dealer registrations and in the Fabrikomt Securities case barred 12 individuals, most of them salesmen, from being associated with any broker or dealer.

COMMISSION

In all these proceedings the Commission found that the respondents had engaged in the sale of securities by the use of high pressure
telephone selling techniques, including the use of false and misleading
statements concerning the securities being sold and their issuers. As
is typical of "boiler-room" activities, the securities involved were unseasoned and speculative and were generally sold to persons with
whom the respondents were not acquainted and whose financial needs,
objectives and circumstances were unknown to them.
Suspension of Registration Pending Final Determination

Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to suspend a broker-dealer's registration pending final determination as to whether registration should be revoked. In order to
suspend registration, the Commission must find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that suspension is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest or for the protection of investors. The registrations of two broker-dealers were suspended during the past fiscal year
on the basis of such findings." The entry of a suspension order is of
course not determinative of the ultimate issue whether registration
should be revoked.
Net Capital Rule

As previously noted," Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act, commonly known as the net capital rule, was amended during the fiscal
year to impose minimum net capital requirements on brokers and dealers (effective December 1, 1965) and in certain other respects. The
amendments do not affect the previously existing requirement which
limits the amount of indebtedness which may be incurred by a brokerdealer in relation to its capital, by providing that the "aggregate indebtedness" of a broker-dealer may not exceed 20 times the amount
of its "net capital" as computed under the rule. During the past fiscal
year, violations of the net capital rule were charged in 11 injunctive
actions and in 16 administrative proceedings instituted against brokerdealers.
Registered broker-dealers who participate in "firm commitment"
underwritings must have sufficient capital to permit the participation
provided by the underwriting contract without impairing the capitaldebt ratio or minimum net capital prescribed by the rule. If a brokerdealer is unable to meet such requirements, he must decrease his "firm
commitment" until compliance with the rule is reached. If necessary
he may have to withdraw from the underwriting or particpiate on a
"best efforts" basis only.

REPORT

Financial Statements

Rule 17a-5 under Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act requires registered broker-dealers to file annual reports of financial condition with
the Commission. Such reports must be certified by a certified public
accountant or public accountant who is in fact independent, with certain limited exemptions applicable to situations where certification
does not appear necessary for customer protection. A broker-dealer's
first report must reflect his flnancial condition as of a date between the
end of the 1st and 5th months after the effective date of registration.
All reports must be filed within 45 days after the date as of which the
report speaks.
Through these reports the Commission and the public may evaluate the financial position and responsibility of broker-dealers. The
financial report is one means by which the staff of the Commission determines whether the registrant is in compliance with the net capital
rule. Failure to file the required reports may result in the institution
of revocation proceedings.
During the fiscal year 4,317 reports of financial condition were filed
with the Commission, compared to tlie 1964total of 4,503.
Broker-Dealer Inspections

Section 11(a) of the Exchange Act provides for regular and periodic inspections of registered broker-dealers. During the fiscal year
a total of 1,392 such inspections was conducted. Inspections provide
one of the most useful means available to the Commission for the protection of investors. Among other things, the inspection determines
a broker-dealer's financial condition, reviews his pricing practices,
evaluates the safeguards employed in handling customers' funds and
securities, and determines whether adequate and accurate disclosures
are made to customers.
The Commission's inspectors also determine whether brokers and
dealers are keeping books and records as required by the Exchange
Act and the Commission's rules thereunder and are conforming to the
margin and other requirements of Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Inspectors also look for excessive trading or switching in customers' accounts. They frequently
find evidence of the sale of unregistered securities or of fraudulent
practices such as use of improper sales literature or sales techniques.
When an inspection reveals that a broker-dealer is in violation of applicable statutory provisions or rules, the action taken depends on the
type of violation and its effect on the public. The Commission does
not take formal action as a result of every infraction discovered. However, if the violation appears to be wilful and the public interest is
best served by formal action against the broker-dealer, the Commission promptly institutes appropriate proceedings.

The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and the principal stock exchanges also conduct inspections of their members, and
some states have inspection programs. Each inspecting agency conducts inspections in accordance with its own procedures and with particular reference to its own regulations and jurisdiction. Inspections
by the Commission are primarily concerned with the detection of violations of the Federal securities laws and the Commission's rules and
regulations. The inspection programs of the self-regulatory agencies
and of the states afford added protection to the public. The Commission and certain other inspecting agencies coordinate their inspections to avoid duplication and to obtain the widest possible coverage of
brokers and dealers. Agencies now participating in this coordination
program include the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock
Exchange, the Boston Stock Exchange, the Midwest Stock Exchange,
the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia-BaltimoreWashington Stock Exchange, the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange, and the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. It is hoped that even
closer coordination may become possible in the future as recommended
by the Special Study of Securities Markets. This coordination, however, does not preclude the Commission from inspecting any brokerdealer that has also been inspected by another agency, and such
inspections are made whenever reason therefor exists.

Section 15A of the Exchange Act provides for the registration with
the Commission of national securities associations and establishes
standards and requirements for such associations. The Act contemplates that such associations will serve as a medium for self-regulation
by over-the-counter brokers and dealers. Their rules must be designed
to protect investors and the public interest, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to meet other statutory requirements.
They are to operate under the general supervision of the Commission,

which is authorized to review disciplinary actions taken by them and
to consider all changes in their rules. The National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) is the only association registered
under the Act.
The Securities Acts Amendments of 1964 significantly changed several statutory provisions regarding registered securities associations.
Such associations are now required to adopt appropriate standards
regarding the training, experience and other qualifications of members
and persons associated with members and to have rules designed to
produce fair and informative quotations of over-the-counter securities.
In addition, they may now bring disciplinary action directly against
individuals associated with members. The revision by the NASD of
its retail quotations system during the fiscal year is discussed in Part
I of this Report.
In adopting legislation permitting the formation and registration
of national securities associations, Congress provided an incentive to
membership by permitting such associations to adopt rules which preclude a member from dealing with a non-member except on the same
terms and conditions as the member affords the investing public. The
NASD has adopted such rules. Accordingly, membership is necessary
to the profitable participation in underwritings since members may
properly grant price concessions, discounts and similar allowances
only to other members. Loss or denial of membership due to expulsion or suspension or other ineligibility due to a statutory disqualification, or the failure to meet standards of qualification established in
NASD rules, may thus impose a severe economic sanction.
At the close of the fiscal year the NASD had 3,865 members, reflecting a net decrease of 292 members during the year. This decrease was
the net result of 193 admissions to and 486 terminations of membership.
During the year the registered representative population, which generally includes all partners, officers, traders, salesmen and other persons employed by or affiliated with member firms in capacities which
involve their doing business directly with the public, declined by 992
to stand at 16,843 as of June 30,1965. This decline was the net result
of 9,836 initial registrations, 10,288 re-registrations and 21,116
terminations of registrations during the year.
NASD Disciplinary

Actions

The Commission receives from the NASD copies of its decisions in
all disciplinary actions against members and registered representatives.
In general, such actions are based on allegations that the respondents
violated specified provisions of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice.
mere violations are found the NASD may impose one or more sanctions upon a member, including expulsion, suspension, fine or censure.
If an individual is involved his registration as a representative may

be suspended or revoked, he may be suspended or barred from being
associated with all members, and he may be fined or censured. Under
Section 15A(b) (4) of the Exchange Act and the NASD's by-laws, no
broker-dealer may be admitted to or continued in NASD membership
without Commission approval if he has been suspended or expelled
from membership in the NASD or a national securities exchange;
is barred or suspended from association with a broker or dealer or with
all members of the NASD or an exchange; his registration as a brokerdealer has been denied, suspended or revoked; he has been found to be
a cause of certain sanctions imposed by the Commission, the NASD or
an exchange; or he has associated with him any person subject to one
of the above disqualifications.
During the past fiscal year the Association reported to the Commission its final disposition of disciplinary complaint actions against
294 member firms and 266 individuals associated with them.> With
respect to 80 members, complaints were dismissed as a result of findings
that the allegations of violations had not been sustained.w In the remaining cases, violations were found and penalties were imposed on
214 members and 186 registered representatives or other individuals.
The maximum penalty of expulsion from membership was imposed
against 43 members, and 20 members were suspended from membership for periods ranging from 1 day to 2 years. In many of these
cases, substantial fines were also imposed. In another 124 cases, members were fined amounts ranging from $50 to $20,000. In 27 other
cases, the only sanction imposed was censure, although censure was
usually a secondary penalty where a more severe penalty was also
imposed.
Various penalties were also imposed on registered representatives
found in violation of NASD rules. The registrations of 86 representatives were revoked and 45 had their registrations suspended for periods
:a Some members were involved in more than one action and some decisions
covered more tban a single complaint. Thus, two members were eacb expelled in
two disciplinary actions reported in separate decisions. On the other band, three
decisions each related to four complaints wbicb bad been consolidated for
purposes of hearing and decision .
.. The majority of the cases wbere allegations against members were dismissed
involved misuse of customers' and/or firm securities or funds by a representative
under such circumstances that the member could not bave known of or prevented
such impropriety.
Association procedures did not, in this period, permit disciplinary action solely against a registered representative 'but required the naming of
the member as a respondent even though it was clear that the member was blameless. Tbe Securities Acts Amendments of 1964 in etrect autborized registered
securities associations to take disciplinary action directly against individuals
associated with members. The NASD has amended its rules to provide for such
action.

TEURTY-FIRST ANNUAL

71

ranging from 2 weeks to 3 years." Fines in various amounts were
also imposed against many revoked or suspended representatives.
In
addition, 40 other representatives were fined amounts ranging from
$50 to $3,000. Allegations of violations against 80 representatives
were dismissed on findings that no violations had been established.
Commission Review of NASD Disciplinary Action

Section 15A(g) of the Act, as amended, provides that disciplinary
actions by the NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its
own motion or on the timely application of any aggrieved person.
This Section also provides that upon application for review or institution of review by the Commission the effectiveness of any penalty imposed by the NASD is automatically stayed pending Commission review, unless the Commission otherwise orders after notice and opportunity for hearing. Section 15A(h) of the Act defines the scope of
the Commission's review. If the Commission finds that the disciplined
party engaged in or omitted such acts or practices as were found by
the NASD, that such acts, practices, or omissions to act are in violation
of such rules of the Association as have been designated in the determination, and that such conduct was inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade, the Commission must dismiss the review proceedings unless it finds that the penalties imposed are excessive or
oppressive, having due regard to the public interest, in which case it
must cancel or reduce such penalties.
At the start of the fiscal year, 19 NASD disciplinary decisions were
pending before the Commission on review. During the year 18 additional cases were brought up for review as a result of timely petitions
by aggrieved parties."
Two review petitions were withdrawn prior
to determination and 16 cases were disposed of by the Commission. In
7 of these cases, the Commission sustained the disciplinary action
taken by the NASD,28 in 4 it set aside the Association action," and
in the remaining 5 cases the Commission reduced the penalties imposed
%1.As has been noted, a person found a cause of the expulsion or suspension
of a member is disqualified from associwtion with a member. The cause finding is
therefore often used where an individual found ,00have violated Association rules
should have been but was not registered as a registered representative.
The
numbers used in the text include unregistered individuals found to have been a
cause of the expulsion or suspension of a member with registered representatives
whose registrations were revoked or suspended, since this is the practical consequence of a cause finding.

by the Association.s"

Nineteen cases were pending as of the end of the

year.
In a significant decision reversing an NASD decision adverse to
Southern Brokerage 00., Ino., the Commission found that the failure
of the firm to consummate a stock-purchase contract resulted from the
firm's good faith belief that the transaction was part of a manipulative and fraudulent scheme," The Commission concluded that under
these circumstances the firm's action did not violate an NASD rule
requiring the observance of "high standards of commercial honor and
just and equitable principles of trade," and it set aside the penalties
imposed by the NASD of censure, a $1,000 fine and a 30-day suspension of the firm from NASD membership.
Southern Brokerage had failed to accept delivery of and pay for
400 shares of Jerome, Richard & Co., Inc., a New York broker-dealer
firm, in July 1963. According to the Commission's decision, the firm
refused to consummate the transaction after it learned that Commission employees were investigating transactions in Jerome stock, that
one of the firms to which it was supposed to deliver Jerome stock had
refused to pay a draft and another had turned out to be non-existent,
and that the only persons with whom it had had any personal dealings
in Jerome stock had suddenly left their employment and were una vailable. For these and other reasons, the Commission concluded that the
firm "honestly and with reasonable basis" believed that its transaction
with the complainant was part of a fraudulent scheme, and that its refusal to carry out the transaction "did not constitute unethical or dishonorable conduct" in violation of the NASD rule.
'
In another opinion issued on the same day, the Commission sustained NASD disciplinary action against Nassau Securities Service
for its failure to pay the $325 balance arising out of a "buy-in." 27
Such failure had been found by the NASD to violate its rules and it
had censured the firm and fined it $1,000.
According to the Commission's decision, the Nassau firm made a
short sale of 100 shares of stock of Cryplex Industries, Inc., at $6.75
per share for delivery October 31st (later extended). The purchaser
(complainant), in a separate transaction, sold 100 shares of Cryplex
stock to a third firm, which later executed a buy-in against the complainant by purchasing Cryplex shares at $10 per share. The complainant then notified Nassau that the buy-in was being treated as a

close-out of Nassau's transaction with the complainant. In the meantime, Nassau had purchased 100 Cryplex shares at $8.25 per share, but
by reason of late delivery the tender of these shares to complainant
was not made until a day after the November 13th deadline fixed by
complainant, and was refused as too late. Complainant paid the
balance owed by it to the third firm, but Nassau did not pay complainant the $325 difference between its contract price and the buy-in price.
Nassau defended its action by claiming that the market for Cryplex
stock was being manipulated and that the buy-in procedure was being
used as a part of the manipulation scheme. However, according to
the Commission's decision, Nassau participated (with some 16 other
firms) in the making of a market in Cryplex when it was aware of
most of the factors which it was claiming suggested a manipulation.
Furthermore, when bought-in by complainant, Nassau did not communicate its asserted suspicions of fraud to complainant but, instead,
sought a further extension for delivery of the Cryplex shares. Although Nassau offered to put the $325 in escrow pending an investigation of the Cryplex market, it only made this offer to the NASD, not
to complainant. The Commission concluded that applicant was not
justified in resorting to non-payment of an obligation owed a fellow
NASD member as a lever to secure an investigation, that in view of all
the circumstances Nassau "had no equitable justification for its refusal to honor its obligation to complainant," and that its conduct
therefore violated NASD rules.
The Commission also sustained action by the NASD revoking
the registration of Hugh M. Casper, president and a registered representative of an NASD member."
The sole issue was whether the penalty, which was imposed as a result of Casper's admittedly taking, on behalf of a trainee of the member, an NASD qualification examination for registered representatives, was excessive. Casper urged in mitigation that he was a close
friend of and had a deep personal interest in the trainee, that his decision to take the examination for the trainee, at the latter's request, was
made on the spur of the moment, and that it involved no personal
profit or gain and was motivated by kindness and charity for the
trainee who was beset by financial, health and other problems.
The Commission, in its decision, concluded that the record failed to
provide an adequate basis for leniency. After stressing the importance of examinations in upgrading the level of competence in the securities business, the Commission's decision stated, "we regard a deception in connection with the taking of those examinations, particularly as was practiced in this case, to be so grave that we would not
find the extreme sanction of revocation or expulsion to be excessive or
.. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7479 (December 7, 1964).

74

oppressive unless the most extraordinary
mitigative facts were
shown." The Commission regarded Casper's conduct as "particularly
reprehensible" because he agreed to take the examination for the
trainee even though, as president of the member, he had previously
certified as to the trainee's good character and competence in the application for registration of the trainee submitted to the NASD by
the member.
Commission Review of NASD Action on Membership

As previously noted, Section 15A(b) (4) of the Act and the by-laws
of the NASD provide that, except where the Commission finds it
appropriate in the public interest to approve or direct to the contrary,
no broker or dealer may be admitted to or continued in membership
if he, or any person associated with him, is under any of the several
disabilities specified in the statute or the by-laws. A Commission order
approving or directing admission to or continuance in Association
membership, notwithstanding a disqualification under Section 15A (b)
(4) of the Act, or under an effective Association rule adopted under
that Section or Section 15A (b) (3), is generally entered only after the
matter has been submitted initially to the Association by the member
or applicant for membership.
The Association in its discretion may
then file an application with the Commission on behalf of the petitioner. If the Association refuses to sponsor such an application the
broker or dealer may apply directly to the Commission for an order
directing the Association to admit or continue him in membership.
At the beginning of the fiscal year, two applications for approval of
admission to or continuance in membership were pending. During
the year four additional applications were filed, four were approved,"
and one was denied," leaving one application pending at the year's
end.
Commission Inspections of the NASD

Under the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act the Commission
is also charged with general oversight of national securities associations in the performance of their self-regulatory activities. In carrying out this responsibility the Commission staff conducts periodic
inspections of various phases of NASD activity. These inspections
assist the Commission in insuring that the NASD is complying with
its self-regulatory responsibilities and enable the Commission to recommend improvements designed to increase the effectiveness of such
self-regulation.
During the past fiscal year, inspections were made of the operations
of the Association's district offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles and

the review of members' advertising and securities sales literature pursuant to the recently adopted NASD statement of policy with respect
to such literature. Where it appeared to the staff of the Commission
that modifications of NASD procedures or policies were desirable in
order to improve the Association's performance, the staff's views were
communicated to the Association and conferences where held to arrive
at appropriate solutions. During the year the NASD took steps to
upgrade its regulatory performance in several areas as a result of
the inspection program and these discussions.
REVISION OF RULES, REGULATIONS AND FORMS

Part I of this Report discusses a number of new rules and forms,
and amendments to existing rules and forms, which were adopted or
proposed during the fiscal year in connection with the implementation
of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1964 and the Report of the
Special Study of Securities Markets. Additional revisions are summarized below.
Adoption of Rule 0-8

Section 15 (b) (4) of the Exchange Act, as amended in 1964, provides
that any section of that Act' (other than Section 5 and subsection (a)
of Section 15) which prohibits any act, practice, or course of business
if the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce
are used in connection therewith, shall also prohibit any such act, practice, or course of business by any broker-dealer registered under Section 15 (b) or by any persons acting on behalf of such broker or
dealer irrespective of any use of the mails or interstate facilities. In
order to conform those rules and regulations under the Act which refer
to the use of the mails or interstate facilities, the Commission during
the fiscal year adopted Rule o.-.:s which is in the terms of the statutory
provision."
Amendments of Rules lOb-6 and 16b-iJ

During the fiscal year the Commission extended the exemptive provisions of Rule 16b-3 and paragraph (e) of Rule 10b-6 to options
which meet the conditions set forth in Section 4:24(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code for "restricted stock options" except for the fact that
they were granted after January 1, 1964.82
Rule .10b-6 makes it unlawful for participants in a distribution of
securities, including the issu~r of the securities, to purchase any such
security, or any security of the same class or series, until completion
of their participation in the distribution, subject to specified excepSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 7406 (August 28, 19(4) .

tions. Paragraph (e) of Rule 10b-6 provides that the prohibitions of
the rule do not apply, inter alia, to any distribution of securities by an
issuer to its employees, or to employees of its subsidiaries, or to a trustee
or other person acquiring securities for the account of such employees,
pursuant to a stock option plan involving only "qualified stock options"
or "restricted stock options" or qualifying as an "employee stock purchase plan." Previously these terms were defined only by reference to
Sections 422 through 424 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as
amended.
Rule 16b-3 provides an exemption from Section 16(b) for shares of
stock (other than stock acquired upon the exercise of an option, warrant, or right) acquired by an officer or director pursuant to a stock
bonus, profit sharing, retirement, incentive, thrift, savings or similar
plan meeting specified conditions. The rule also exempts the acquisition of a "qualified" or a "restricted" stock option pursuant to a qualified or a restricted stock option plan, or a stock option pursuant to an
"employee stock purchase plan." As with Rule 10b-6 (e), the terms
"qualified stock option," "restricted stock option" and "employee stock
purchase plan" previously were defined only by reference to Sections
422 through 424 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.
On August 27, 1964, the Commission adopted certain amendments
to Rules 10b-6 and 16b-3 and Form 10 under the Exchange Act and
Forms S-1, S-8, and S-l1 under the Securities Act with respect to stock
options which are eligible for special tax benefits." These amendments
were designed to make the Commission's forms and rules consistent
with the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Revenue Act of
1964, i.e., to provide all tax-favored options the same exemptive or
favorable treatment as had been extended to the previous tax-favored
options. Thereafter, it was brought to the attention of the Commission
that certain companies desired to continue to grant options which met
the former requirements for "restricted stock options" but which were
not eligible for special tax benefits as a result of the amendments to the
Internal Revenue Code. The effect of the further amendments of
Rules 10b-6 and 16b-3 is to make the exemptive provisions of those
rules applicable to such options if they meet the requirements of Section 424 (b) for "restricted stock options" except for the fact that they
were granted after January 1, 1964. At the same time, the Commission
amended Form S-8 to authorize its use for the registration of stock to
be offered pursuant to such options."
An additional amendment to Rule 16b-3 adopted during the fiscal
year extended the exemption to certain plans which could not presa Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7403, Securities

viously meet the conditions of the rule." One of the conditions of the
exemption is that the plan must have been approved by the holders of
a majority of the securities of the issuer present, or represented, and
entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or by the written consent
of the holders of a majority of the securities of the issuer entitled to
vote.
Prior to the amendment, the rule required that the security holders'
vote or written consent must have been solicited substantially in accordance with the rules and regulations in effect under Section 14(a)
of the Act at the time of such vote, whether or not such rules and regulations were applicable to the solicitation. In order to extend the
benefits of the exemption to plans approved, prior to registration of
securities under Section 12 of the Act, by the vote or written consent
of shareholders not solicited substantially in accordance with the
rules and regulations under Section 14(a) because such rules were not
then applicable, the rule as amended requires only, subject to certain
conditions, that such vote or written consent have been obtained in
accordance with the applicable laws of the state or other jurisdiction
in which the issuer was incorporated.
Rescission of Rule 12f-5

The 1964 amendments deleted from Section 12(f) of the Exchange
Act the provision requiring "any national securities exchange" or "any
person directly or indirectly controlled by such exchange" to differentiate, in the publication of quotations or transactions, between listed
securities and securities to which unlisted trading privileges have been
extended. Rule 12f-5 which provided for the manner in which quotations or transactions should be differentiated was therefore
rescinded;"
Amendments to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15

During the fiscal year, the Commission on two occasions adopted
amendments to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 which require the filing of
quarterly reports by certain real estate companies. Rule 13a-15 relates to real estate companies having securities registered on a national
securities exchange pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Act and to overthe-counter real estate companies having securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to the new Section 12 (g) of the Act. Rule
15d-15 relates to real estate companies which have registered securities
under the Securities Act of 1933 and are required to file reports with
the Commission pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act. The first amendments adapted the rules to the Securities Acts

Amendments of 1964.31 The subsequent amendments made some language corrections in the rules."
Amendments and Proposed Amendments to the Proxy Rules

As previously noted, the Commission amended. the proxy rules during the fiscal year to make them applicable to solicitations, commenced
on or after July 1, 1965, with respect to securities registered. pursuant
to the new Section 12(g) .39 In addition, the proxy rules, which were
adopted pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Act and were previously
designated "Regulation 14," were redesignated "Regulation 14A"
in order to differentiate them from other rules which the Commission may adopt pursuant to Sections 14(b) and (c) of the Act. The
Commission also amended Rule 14a-6 of Regulation 14A, which requires the filing of proxy material with the Commission and with
any exchange on which the issuer has securities listed and registered.
The amendment increased from four to eight the number of definitive copies of the proxy statement, form of proxy and other soliciting
material required to be filed with the Commission. Four copies will
be kept in the Commission's principal office for the use of the staff
and for public inspection. The additional copies will be placed in
the principal regional offices of the Commission and in the regional
office for the region in which the registrant has its principal office.
This is intended to make the information contained in such material
more readily available to interested persons, in line with the recommendations of the Special Study of Securities Markets.40
Prior to the adoption of the foregoing amendments, the Commission
invited public comments on a number of proposed amendments to the
proxy rules which would clarify the existing rules and embody in
the rules certain long-standing practices of the Commission. A limited number of substantive changes in the rules were also proposed.
For example, a proposed amendment to Rule 14a-4 would require
that, in certain instances, the form of proxy contain a provision
whereby a security holder may grant or withhold authority to vote
for elections to offices where other specified matters are being voted
upon. In addition, the scope of Item 7 (f) of Schedule 14A, calling
for a description of any material interest of certain persons in transactions with the issuer, would be clarified and extended, A detailed.
description of all of the proposed amendments is contained in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7481 (December 7,1964).

and Form BD

As has been noted, the 1964 amendments to Section 15(b) of the
Exchange Act expanded the grounds on which the Commission is
empowered to deny broker-dealer registration or to impose a sanction
on a registered broker-dealer. Although consideration is being given
to substantive amendments to Form BD (the form used for applications for registration as a broker-dealer and for amendments to such
applications) and applicable rules, it was deemed necessary in the
meantime to amend Form BD to include reference to the new disqualifications.v At the same time the Commission also amended Rule
15b-2 which requires the filing of amendments to applications for
broker-dealer registration when pertinent facts have changed, to
delete certain archaic provisions and to provide that every amendment
filed pursuant to the rule shall constitute a "report" within the meaning of all applicable provisions of the Act, as amended."
Amendments of Rule lSb-9 under the Exchange Act and Rule 9(b) under the
Commission's Rules of Practice

The procedures relating to the participation of associated persons
in broker-dealer proceedings are prescribed by Rule 15b-9 under the
Exchange Act and Rule 9(b) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.
In order to implement the amendments to the Exchange Act which
permit direct action against such persons, the Commission amended
these rules during the fiscal year to provide that unless the Commission otherwise directs, such rules shall apply only to proceedings
instituted prior to August 20, 1964, the date of the enactment of the
Securities Acts Amendments of 1964.43
Rescission of Rule lSc2-2

Section 15(c) (5) which was added to the Exchange Act by the
Securities Acts Amendments of 1964, authorizes the Commission summarily to suspend over-the-counter trading in any non-exempt security
for a period not exceeding 10 days. It also prohibits any broker
or dealer from effecting any transaction in, or inducing the purchase
or sale of, any security in which trading is suspended. This Section
eliminated the need for Rule 15c2-2 which prohibited a broker or
dealer from effecting transactions in, or inducing the purchase or sale
of, a security in which trading was suspended pursuant to Section
19 (a) (4) and that rule was therefore rescinded."

Amendment of Rule 15c3-1

The amendments of Rule 15c3-1, the net capital rule, have already
been discussed in some detail." Among the amendments, in addition
to one providing for minimum net capital requirements, was one
requiring broker-dealers not subject to exchange rules to make appropriate adjustments in computing net capital if they carry futures
commodities contracts for customers. The New York Stock Exchange
and other national securities exchanges whose members handle the
great majority of commodities futures transactions have imposed
additional capital requirements on those members who conduct such
a business. These changes resulted from a recognition that there are
situations in which, either because of the nature of trading in commodities futures or the limited amount of margin required to be
obtained from customers under the rules of various commodity
exchanges, brokers who effect futures commodities transactions for
customers may incur liabilities which create additional risks for the
iunds and securities of securities customers. Additional amendments
relate to the circumstances under which subordinated loans may be
excluded from "aggregate indebtedness" and to the exemptions from
the requirements of the rule.
Amendments of Rules 15ab-l

and 15ag-l

In implementation of the 1964 amendments to Section 15A expanding the conditions under which a person may be ineligible for membership in a national securities association or for association with a
member thereof, and reducing from 60 days to 30 days the time within
which an application for review of association disciplinary action
must be filed, the Commission amended Rule 15ab-1 (procedures for
applying for relief from statutory disqualification) and Rule 15ag-l
(procedures for applying for review of disciplinary action or denial
of membership by a registered securities association) to conform
their provisions to the amended statutory provisions."
Amendment of Rule 16a-2

During the fiscal year the Commission invited public comments on
a proposed amendment of Rule 16a-2 relating to the method of computing percentage ownership under Section 16(a) of the Act,47 and,
shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the rule was amended.v
As amended, Rule 16a-2 provides in general that for the purposes
of computation under Section 16(a) of the Act the amount of a class
of equity securities shall be deemed to consist of the total amount of

securities outstanding of the class, exclusive of any securities of the
class held by or for the account of the issuer. Previously, the rule
provided that such computations should be based on the amount of
the class issued, whether or not any portion of the class was held by
or for the account of the issuer.
The amended rule provides that a person acting in good faith may
rely on information with respect to the amount of securities outstanding of a class contained in the issuer's latest consolidated financial
statement in a registration statement or annual report (e.g., Form
lO-K or 12-K) filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act.
Adoption of Rule 16b-IO

The Commission adopted a new Rule 16b-l0 which exempts from
the operation of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act (providing for
the recovery of "short swing" profits realized by insiders) certain
acquisitions of securities from the issuer made in exchange for other
securities by a railroad or other person subject to Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act.49
Proposed Amendments of Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4

During the fiscal year the Commission announced that it had under
consideration a proposal to amend Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4. 50 The
proposed amendments would require certain members of national
securities exchanges and other broker-dealers to prepare a record of
computation of the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital as
of the date of the trial balance they are now required to make at least
once a month and to preserve such computation for not less than 3
years. One purpose of the proposed requirement is to assist members, brokers and dealers to keep currently informed of their capital
positions under Rule 15c3-l.
The proposed amendments were still under consideration at the
close of the fiscal year.
Proposed Amendments to Form 8-K

Form 8-K is prescribed for current reports filed pursuant to Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act. During the fiscal
year, the Commission announced that it has under consideration
certain proposed amendments to Form 8-K and invited public comments."" Proposed amendments to Form 8-K have been published
on two previous occasions." The comments and suggestions received
in response to those proposals were carefully considered in the preparation of the current proposals .

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

Prompt public disclosure of significant developments in the business
and financial affairs of a company is of the utmost importance to
insure fair dealing in the company's securities. This fact has received
increasing recognition. To a growing extent the national securities
exchanges have supplemented the basic disclosure requirements of the
Commission (as set forth in Form 8-K) with provisions in their listing agreement forms, and with other policies under which listed
companies must make immediate public disclosure of a variety of
material developments which might significantly affect the market
for their securities and the interests of investors.
The proposed amendments are largely of a clarifying nature. In
some instances they operate to make explicit certain long-standing
administrative interpretations.
In addition, certain new requirements have been added to elicit information which experience has
shown to be of significance to investors. The principal changes proposed involve the reporting of timely information in connection with
the pledging of securities which may result in a change in control
if there is a default under the pledge agreement, the acquisition or
disposition of a significant amount of assets otherwise than in the
ordinary course of business, the interest of management and others
in certain transactions and the issuance of debt securities by
subsidiaries.
These amendments were still under consideration at the close of the
fiscal year.
Amendments to Forms 10 and 100K

Form 10 is a general form for registration of securities on a national
securities exchange or pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act. Form 1G-K is a general form for annual reports of
issuers having securities registered on a national securities exchange,
issuers required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Act,
and issuers of securities registered under Section 12(g) of the Act.
As previously noted," Forms 10 and 1G-K were amended during the
fiscal year for the principal purpose of making them available for
registration of securities pursuant to Section 12(g) and for annual
reports of issuers of such securities.
Adoption of Forms 12 and 12-K

During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted new special forms
under the Securities Exchange AFt for registration of securities, and
for annual reports, of certain issuers which file reports with the Federal Power Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission or the
Federal Communications Commission."

Form 12 may be used by such issuers for the registration of securities
on a national securities exchange pursuant to Section 12(b) or for the
registration of equity securities pursuant to Section 12(g). Registration statements on the new form consist largely of copies of the annual
reports of such issuers to the other Federal agencies together with
certain other exhibits, including copies of material contracts. Use of
the form is optional and any issuer may use Form 10 if it desires to
do so.
Form 12-K may be used for annual reports of such issuers pursuant
to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Act. Annual reports on the new form
consist largely of copies of the annual reports of such issuers to the
other Federal agencies together with certain other exhibits. Use of
the form is optional and any issuer may use Form 100K if it so desires.
Proposed Amendments

to

Forms 16 and 16-K

During the fiscal year, the Commission announced that it has under
consideration proposed revisions of Forms 16 and 16-K under the
Securities Exchange Act and invited public comrnents."
Form 16 is prescribed for the registration of voting trust certificates
on a national securities exchange. The revised form would be prescribed for that purpose and also for registration of voting trust
certificates pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Act.
Form 16-K is now prescribed for annual reports relating to voting
trust certificates which are registered on a national securities exchange.
The revised form would also be used for annual reports relating to
voting trust certificates registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the
Act and for annual reports filed pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Act
relating to voting trust certificates registered under the Securities Act
of 1933. Reports pursuant to Section 15(d) are now filed on Form
3-MD, which would be rescinded.
The format of the revised forms would, in general, follow that of the
Commission's more recently adopted forms. The separate instruction
books would be abolished and the necessary instructions contained
therein would be incorporated in the forms proper in accordance with
current practice. Some of the general instructions, including certain
definitions which are now contained in the General Rules and Regulations, would be dropped from the forms to avoid duplication. Appropriate references to the General Rules and Regulations would be
contained in the revised forms.
Certain additional items would be added to Form 16-K to require
disclosure with respect to matters such 3S the amounts of securities
deposited and withdrawn during the year and the exercise of voting
and other powers by the voting trustees .

PART V
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935

In administering the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
the Commission regulates interstate public-utility holding-company
systems engaged in the electric utility business and/or in the retail distribution of gas. The Commission's jurisdiction also extends to natural gas pipeline companies and other non-utility companies which
are subsidiaries of registered holding companies. Although the matters under the Act dealt with by the Commission and its staff embrace
a variety of intricate and complex questions of law and fact generally
involving more than one area of regulation, briefly there are three
principal regulatory areas. The first covers those provisions of the
Act, contained principally in Section 11(b) (1), which require the
physical integration of public-utility companies and functionally related properties of holding-company systems and those provisions,
contained principally in Section 11 (b) (2), which require the simplification of intercorporate relationships and financial structures of holding company systems. The second covers the financing operations of
registered holding companies and their subsidiaries, the acquisition
and disposition of securities and properties, and certain accounting
practices, servicing arrangements
and intercompany transactions,
The third includes the exemptive provisions of the Apt, the provisions
covering the status under the Act of persons and companies, and those
regulating the right of a person affiliated with a public-utility company to acquire securities resulting in a second such affiliation. Matters embraced within this last area of regulation come before the Commission and its staff frequently.
Many such matters do not result in
formal proceedings and others are reflected in such proceedings only
in an indirect manner when they are related to issues principally under
one of the other areas of regulation.
The Branch of Public Utility Regulation of the Commission's
Division of Corporate Regulation performs the principal functions
under the Act. It observes and examines problems which arise in
connection with transactions which are or may be subject to regula84

TEIRTY-FIRST

ANNUAL REPORT

85

tion under the Act and discusses such problems with interested persons
and companies and advises them as to the applicable sections of the
Act, the rules thereunder and Commission policy with respect thereto.
Questions are raised with and problems presented to the staff daily.
These include questions raised by security holders and problems presented by companies contemplating transactions which require the
filing of an application or declaration, particularly financing operations and the acquisition and disposition of securities and properties.
This day-to-day activity includes prefiling discussions and conferences,
in person and by telephone, with company representatives and with
other persons where the matter under consideration affects their interests. In those instances where formal proceedings are held, members
of the staff actively participate in hearings and often aid the Commission in the preparation of its decision on a particular matter. The
staff continually re-examines the status of exempt companies, examines
the annual reports filed with the Commission and those sent to stockholders and must keep abreast of new technical developments in the
electric and gas industry, including the use of atomic energy as a
source of power.
COMPOSITION OF REGISTERED HOLDING-COMPANY SYSTEMS

At the close of the fiscal year there were 23 holding companies registered under the Act. Of these, 18 are included in the 16 remaining
holding-company systems which are herein classified as "active registered holding-company systems," 2 of the 18 being subholding companies in these active systems,' The remaining 5 registered holding
companies are of relatively small size and are excluded from the active
holding-company systems. 2 In the 16 active systems there are 86 electric and/or gas utility subsidiaries, 42 non-utility subsidiaries, 9 inactive companies, or a total, including the 18 parent holding companies, of 155 system companies. The following table shows the
number of holding companies and the number of subsidiaries (classified as utility, nonutility, and inactive) in each of the active systems
as of June 30, 1965, and the aggregate assets of these systems, less
valuation reserves, as of December 31, 1964:
The two subholding companies are The Potomac Edison Co., a subsidiary of
Allegheny Power System, Inc., and Southwestern Electric Power Co., a subsidiary
of Central and South West Corp.
â€¢ These holding companies are American Gas Co.; British American Utilities
Corp.; Kinzua Oil & Gas Corp., and its subholding company, Northwestern
Pennsylvania Gas Corp.; and Standard Gas & Electric Co., which is in process
of dissolution.

SECTION II

MA1TERS IN REGISTERED

HOWING.COMPANY

SYSTEMS

On March 19, 1964,the Commission issued its Findings, Opinion and
Order directing New England Electric System to divest itself of its
gas properties,"
The Commission found that these properties were
not retainable as an additional integrated public-utility system under
clause (A) of Section 11(b) (1), which requires as a basis of retention
a finding that divestment would result in a "loss of substantial
economies". The Commission in this case, as in prior cases (some of
which had been affirmed on review), had interpreted this provision to
mean a loss of such a nature that the additional system, if separated
from the principal system, would be incapable of independent
economic operation. On review, the Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit reversed the Commission's order and remanded the case to the

Commission for further proceedings,' primarily because, in the Court's
view, "substantial economies" means "economies which in ordinary
business parlance and by ordinary business standards are of a substantial nature, considering, of course, the size of the companies to
which the economies relate."
The Commission's Order 5 approving Step 2 of a plan filed by Eastern Utilities Associates ("EU A") pursuant to Section 11(e),
providing for the sale of all the outstanding common stock of Valley
Gas Co., was enforced by the district court," On November 23, 1964,the
Commission issued a supplemental order approving the proposed subscription price for the Valley Gas Co. common stock,' and the sale was
consummated in December 1964. The consummation of Step 2 completed disposition by the EUA system of its interests in all its gas
utility properties pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(b) (1).8
A Section 11(b) (1) problem still exists as to whether Middle South
Utilities, Inc. may, through its subsidiary company, New Orleans Public Service Inc., retain its interest in the gas and transportation properties of that subsidiary company together with the system's electric
properties. The latter properties have heretofore been found by the
Commission to constitute a single integrated public-utility system.
Since 1962 a bill has been introduced in each Congress providing, in
effect, that New Orleans Public Service Inc. shall not be required to
dispose of its gas and transportation properties pursuant to any provision of the Holding Company Act,". The House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, to which these bills have been referred,
took no action on any of the prior bills and, as of the close of the fiscal
year, had taken no action on the present bill, and no proceedings have
been instituted by the Commission.t"

Commission has heretofore ordered the elimination of public minority
interests in most of the registered holding-company systems, but the

problem remains in several others." On November 13, 1964, the Commission approved a plan filed by Allegheny Power System pursuant to
Section 11(e) of the Act, providing for the elimination of a 4.8 percent
public minority interest in the common stock of its subsidiary company, "'iVestPenn Power Company, through the exchange of 3.4 shares
of Allegheny's $2.50 par value common stock for each share of
publicly-held ""VestPenn common stock.P The plan was enforced by
order of the District Court."
On December 31, 1964, the Commission approved a plan filed by
American Electric Power Company, Inc. pursuant to Section 11(e),
providing for the elimination of outstanding publicly-held scrip for
fractional shares of American Electric's common stock.> The plan
provided for the distribution of approximately 1,590 full shares of
American Electric common stock and/or cash in exchange for the
scrip. Thereafter, the plan was enforced in the district court."
On February 3, 1965, the Commission entered an order approving
a plan filed by Genesee Valley Gas Company, Inc., pursuant to Section 11(e), providing for the pro rata distribution to Genesee's stockholders of the common stock of Pavilion Natural Gas Company,
Genesee's sole direct public-utility subsidiary oompany.>"
Subsequently, upon application by Genesee, the Commission on June 1,
1965, entered an order, pursuant to Section 5(d), declaring Genesee
to be no longer a holding company."
EXEMPT

HOLDING

COMPANIES

A "holding company" is defined by Section 2(a) (7) (A) of the
Act to mean any company which owns or controls 10 percent or more
of the outstanding voting securities of an electric or gas public-utility
company. Section 3 (a) of the Am provides that the Commission shall
exempt any holding company (and its subsidiary companies, as such)
11 Holding-company
systems in which a minority interest problem exists, and
as to which no proceedings have been instituted, are The Columbia Gas System,
Jne., Eastern Utilities Associates, and New England Electric System. The minority interests of the last-named holding-company system are confined to several of
the gas utility subsidiaries, the retainability of which, as noted above, has not
been finally resolved.

from the duties and obligations of the Act if the company meets one
or more of the exemptive standards set forth in that section, unless
the Commission finds that the exemption would be detrimental to
the public interest. An exemption may 'begranted by the Commission
by order upon application, or (as to certain types of exemption) may
be claimed by the holding company by the filing in "good faith" of
a statement pursuant to Rule 2 promulgated by the Commission under
Section 3. During the fiscal year, the Commission issued orders
granting three applications for exemption under Section 3 (a) .18 At
the close of the fiscal year there were on file with the Commission
exemption statements under Rule 2 submitted by a total of 58 companies." Each initial Rule 2 statement filed and each annual statement renewing the claimed exemption is carefully reviewed by the
Commission's Division of Corporate Regulation to ensure that the
claimant holding company is entitled to its asserted exempt status.
Exempt holding companies are nevertheless subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) (2) of the Act, which prohibits them from
acquiring 5 percent or more of the voting stock of any other publicutility company unless the acquisition has been approved by the Commission under Section 10. During the fiscal year two exempt holding companies applied for and were granted authority to acquire
controlling interests in additional public-utility companies; 20 and at
the close of the fiscal year another such application was pending
before the Commission.
When an exempt holding company proposes to acquire 10 percent
or more of the voting securities of a public-utility company, there invariably arises the question whether as a consequence of the acquisition the exemption from the Act will continue to be available. The
same question is presented in the case of such acquisition 'by a company which at present is not a holding company as defined in the Act.
Generally these matters are explored informally with the staff of the
Division. In some instances, the proposed acquisition, although satisfying the requirements of Section 10, has been abandoned when it
appeared that no exemption from the Act would be available for the
acquiring company.

COMPANIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES

During the fiscal year 1965, 9 active registered holding-company
systems sold to the public and financial institutions for cash 21 issues
of long-term debt and capital stocks aggregating $386 million, 21 pursuant to authorizations granted by the Commission under Sections
6 and 7 of the Act. All but one of these issues were sold for the
purpose of raising new capital. The one exception was an issue by
Arkansas Power & Light Company, a subsidiary of Middle South
Utilities, Inc., of 75,000 shares of preferred stock of $100 par value
for the purpose of refunding preferred stock of the same par value
carrying a higher dividend rate.

Section 6(b) of the Act) the issuance of notes having a maturity of
9 months or less where the aggregate amount does not exceed 5 percent of the principal amount and par value of the other securities of
the company.
Competitive Bidding

All of the 21 issues of securities sold for cash in fiscal 1965, as shown
in the preceding table, were offered for competitive bidding pursuant
to the requirements of Rule 50 promulgated under the Act.
During the period from May 7, 1941, the effective date of Rule 50,
to June 30, 1965, a total of 905 issues of securities with an aggregate
value of $13,513 million were sold at competitive bidding under the
rule. These totals compare with 231 issues of securities with an aggregate value of $2,371 million which have been sold pursuant to
orders of the Commission granting exceptions from the competitive
bidding requirements of the rule under paragraph (a) (5) thereof."
Of the total amount of securities sold pursuant to such orders, 126 issues with a total value of $1,888 million were sold by the issuers and the
balance of 105 issues with a dollar value of $483 million were portfolio
sales. Of the 126 issues sold by the issuers, 70 were in amount from
$1 to $5 million and 2 bond issues were in excess of $100 million eaoh.>
POllCY AS TO REFUNDABILITY OF BONDS

In accordance with its long-standing policy under the Act, the Commission has continued to require that bonds and preferred stock sold
by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries be fully refundable at the option of the issuer upon reasonable notice and that any redemption premium be reasonable in amount. During fiscal year 1965
one issuer subject to the Act took advantage of the refunding privilege
and of prevailing favorable market conditions to refund a preferred
stock issue at a lower dividend rate.25 The annual dividend savings on
this issue were $42,300.26

presence or absence of a restriction on free refundability has not affected the number of bids received by an issuer at competitive bidding.
With respect to the ability of the winning bidder to market the bonds,
the data for fiscal year 1965 are at some variance with the data for the
previous fiscal year and for all but one of the prior fiscal years covered
in the staff's study. The 30th Annual Report, at pages 95-96, contains
a summary of the results of an examination of all electric and gas
utility bond issues (including debentures) sold at competitive bidding between May 14,1957, and June 30,1964, by companies subject
to the Act as well as those not so subject. This study was extended
to include fiscal year 1965.
During the period from May 14, 1957, to June 30, 1965, a total of
512 electric and gas utility bond issues, aggregating $11,550.9 million
principal amount, was offered at competitive bidding. The refundable issues numbered 379 and accounted for a total of $7,280.5 million,
while the non-refundable issues-all being non-refundable for a period
of 5 years, except one which was non-refundable for a period of 7
years-numbered
133 and totaled $4,270.4 million principal amount.
The number of refundable issues thus represented 74.0 percent of the
total number of issues, while, in terms of principal amount, the
refundable issues accounted for 63.0 percent."
The weighted average number of bids received on the refundable
issues for the period was 4.77, while on the nonrefundable issues it was
4.30. The median number of bids was 5 on the refundable and 4 on
the non-refundable issues." With respect to the success of the marketing of the bond issues, an issue was considered to have been successfully marketed if at least 95 percent of the issue was sold at the syndicate price up to the date of termination of the syndicate. On this
basis, 67.0 percent of the refundable issues were successful, while 63.9
percent of the non-refundable ones were successful." In terms of
principal amount, 63.5 percent of the refundable issues were successful,
while 61.5 percent of the nonrefundable ones were successful. so Extension of the comparison to include the aggregate principal amounts

fiscal year 1965, a total of 46 bond issues was offered, aggregating
$1,149 million principal amount, consisting of 29 refundable issues totaling $679
million and 17 nonrefundable issues totaling $470 million. The number of refundable issues represented 63.0 percent of all the issues, while, in terms of principal amount, the refundable issues accounted for 59.1 percent.
'" During fiscal year 1965, the weighted average number of bids was 5.34 on the
refundables and 5.06 on the non-refundables, while the median number of bids
was 5 on the refundables and 5 on the nonrefundables .

that 84.1 percent of the combined principal amount of all the refundable issues were so sold, as compared with 81.8 percent for the non-refundable issues." While the statistics for the total period from May
14, 1957, to June 30, 1965, developed in respect of the two groups of
bond issues support the Commission's policy of requiring free refundability of utility bond issues subject to the Act, the Commission's staff
will continue its studies of refundability provisions, particularly in
light of the inconsistent marketing results in fiscal year 1965.
OTHER MA1TERS

The Southern Company and its four electric utility subsidiary companies, including Alabama Power Company, filed an applicationdeclaration with the Commission, pursuant to Section 6 (b) ; proposing,
among other things, the issue and sale to Southern of $14 million aggregate par value of common stock by Alabama Power. That company
proposed to use these and other funds for the construction of electric
facilities within the State of Alabama where it was organized and
carries on its public-utility business. The Alabama Electric Cooperative, Inc. requested leave to intervene and a hearing on the asserted
ground that certain of the proposed electric facilities would duplicate
the Cooperative's facilities, would invade the service area of the Cooperative, and were consequently unnecessary and not in the public
interest or the interest of investors or consumers. On June 1, 1965,
the Commission issued its Findings, Opinion and Order, authorizing
Alabama Power's proposed financing and denying the Cooperative's
petition." The Commission found, among other things, that the proposed financing had been expressly approved by the Alabama Public
Service Commission (before which the Cooperative had also appeared
in opposition to the company's proposals) and that the issues raised
and contentions advanced by the Cooperative were exclusively within
the jurisdiction of the State authorities. The Cooperative filed a
petition for review in the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit."

PART VI
PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE RE.
ORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANK.
RUPTCY ACT
The Commission's role under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act,
which provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the U.S.
district courts, differs from that under the various other statutes which
it administers. The Commission does not initiate Chapter X proceedings or hold its own hearings, and it has no authority to determine any
of the issues in such proceedings. The Commission participates in
proceedings under Chapter X in order to provide independent, expert
assistance to the courts, the participants, and investors in a highly
complex area of corporate law and finance. It pays special attention
to the interests of public security holders who may not otherwise be
represented effectively.
Where the scheduled indebtedness of a debtor corporation exceeds
$3 million, Section 172 of Chapter X requires the judge, before approving any plan of reorganization, to submit it to the Commission for its
examination and report. If the indebtedness does not exceed $3 million, the judge may, if he deems it advisable to do so, submit the
plan to the Commission before deciding whether to approve it. Where
the Commission files a report, copies or a summary must be sent to all
security holders and creditors when they are asked to vote on the
plan. The Commission has no authority to veto or to require the
adoption of a plan of reorganization.
The Commission has not considered it necessary or appropriate to
participate in every Chapter X case. Apart from the excessive administrative burden, many of the cases involve only trade or bank creditors
and few public investors. The Commission seeks to participate principally in those proceedings in which a substantial public investor
interest is involved. However, the Commission may also participate
because an unfair plan has been or is about to be proposed, public
security holders are not represented adequately, the reorganization
proceedings are being conducted in violation of important provisions
of the Act, the facts indicate that the Commission can perform a useful
service, or the judge requests the Commission's participation .
. The Commission has lawyers, accountants and financial analysts

engaged actively in Chapter X cases in which the Commission has
filed its appearance. Supervision and review of the regional offices'
Chapter X work is the responsibility of the Division of Corporate
Regulation of the Commission, which, through its Branch of Reorganization, also serves as a field officein cases arising in the Atlanta and
Washington, D.C. regional areas.
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

In fiscal year 1965, the Commission continued to maintain a high
level of activity under Chapter X. During the year, the Commission
entered its appearance in 17 new proceedings involving companies
with aggregate stated assets of $168 million and aggregate indebtedness of approximately $150 million. These proceedings involved the
rehabilitation of corporations engaged in various businesses including,
among others, heavy manufacturing, real estate and mortgage investments, operation of hospitals and motels, the manufacture of mechanical and electronic components, the manufacture and distribution of
chemicals and motor freighting.
During the year the Commission was a party in a total of 104 reorganization proceedings, including the new proceedings. The stated assets
of the companies involved in these proceedings totaled approximately
$963 million and their indebtedness approximately $899 million. The
proceedings were scattered among district courts in 32 states and the
District of Columbia, as follows: 15 in New York; 11 in Florida; 9
in California; 6 in Illinois; 5 each in Kentucky and Michigan; 4 each
in New Jersey and North Carolina; 3 each in Arizona, Iowa, Nevada,
Oklahoma, Texas, Pennsylvania and Washington; 2 each in Colorado,
Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana and Ohio; and 1 each in the
District of Columbia, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Massachusetts,
New Mexico, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Wyoming, West Virginia and Virginia. Proceedings involving 15 principal debtor corporations were closed during the year. Thus, at the end of the year
the Commission was participating in 89 reorganization proceedings.
JURISDICTIONAL, PROCEDURAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE MATfERS

In Chapter X proceedings in which it participates, the Commission
seeks to have the courts apply the procedural and substantive safeguards to which all parties are entitled. The Commission also attempts
to secure judicial uniformity in the construction of Chapter X and the
procedures thereunder.

Subsequently, the Commission moved to vacate the order of confirmation on the ground that, because of a substantial increase in earnings
since confirmation and other developments, the debtor may be solvent.
In view of the pendency of the appeal, the district judge prepared an
order vacating the order of confirmation, and this proposed order was
presented to the court of appeals as the basis for a motion to remand.
In the interim, the purchasers under the plan filed in the district court
a motion for rehearing of the Commission's motion to vacate. The
court of 'appeals continued the hearing on the motion to remand, stating that it would grant the motion if the district court denied the
motion for rehearing.
Certain stockholders of the debtor appealed from a district court
order in Shawano Development Oorporatiorc: which adjudicated the
debtor a bankrupt and thereby precluded the Chapter X trustee from
proceeding with pending suits against former members of management
and others. The court of appeals agreed with the Commission's view
that a proceeding under Chapter X rather than in bankruptcy is a
preferable forum for the prosecution of a debtor's lawsuits where such
suits are financed, in part, by the stockholders. However, the court
held, inter alia, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in
adjudicating the debtor a bankrupt and that appellants had failed
to appeal from an earlier order refusing approval of a proposed
plan of liquidation which included a provision for the prosecution
of these Iawsuits."
In Texas Independent Ooffee Organization,5 the Commission objected to the trustee's petition to cancel all delinquent investment
contracts held by the public and to forfeit the installments paid
thereon. The Commission urged that the bankruptcy court, as a court
of equity, should not countenance forfeitures, especially where, as
in this case, there was no assurance that investors would receive in
value that for which they had contracted. It was also urged that
investors should not be required to make payments, under penalty
of forfeiture, on contracts which had been sold in violation of the
registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. The court
agreed with the Commission and denied the trustee's petition.
In Investors Associated, Ine.,6 the debtor contested an involuntary
Chapter X petition on the ground that it was not insolvent as alleged
in the petition. The debtor had issued and sold.over $1 million principal amount of subordinated debentures, $691,000 of which had been
exchanged for common stock. The Commission, appearing at the

request of the district judge, supported the petition, urging that the
stockholders who had acquired stock in this manner be treated as
creditors for the purpose of determining insolvency since they had
been induced to convert their debentures into common stock by the
fraudulent assertions of management. Prior to the filing of the
Chapter X petition, the Commission had obtained an order against
the debtor, its officers,directors, and others enjoining violations of the
registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws in the
sale of securities of the debtor. The special master's report adopted
the Commission's views and the district judge approved the petition.
As reported previously,' in J oe Newcomer Finance Oompany 8 a
debentureholders committee was enjoined, on motion of the Commission, from further soliciting contributions from public investors,
and the funds already collected were ordered held in escrow pending a
ruling on their disposition. The court subsequently required the return
of the funds to the contributors and refused to allow committee members reimbursement of expenses from these funds.
In Trans-United Industries, Inc.,9 the Chapter X court in Connecticut held that it had jurisdiction to determine the validity of tax
assessments levied against the debtor's property in Philadelphia by
the City of Philadelphia, and disallowed the claim.
TRUSTEE'S INVESTIGATION

A complete accounting for the stewardship of corporate affairs by
the old management is a requisite under Chapter X. One of the primary duties of the trustee is to make a thorough study of the debtor
to assure the discovery and collection of all assets of the estate, including claims against officers, directors, or controlling persons who may
have mismanaged the debtor's affairs. The staff of the Commission
often aids the trustee in his investigation.
In Automatic Washer 00.,10 reported previously," the court of appeals affirmed 12 the order of the district court, which held that the
stock interests of Bankers Life & Casualty Company and of Bellanca
Corporation (now Olson Brothers, Inc.) should be subordinated to the
publicly held stock of the debtor to the extent of $1.50 per share. As
the Commission urged, the court held that subordination was not precluded because of a money judgment for fraud obtained by the trustee
against Bankers, nor because the plan of reorganization was one of
liquidation. The subordination nearly doubled the distribution to the

public stockholders, and, since the per share distribution to them was
substantially less than $1.50, was tantamount to a disallowance of the
stock interests of Bankers and Bellanca.
In Swan-Fi11XJh Oil 001'pOTation,13 the trustee settled an action
against the American Stock Exchange and J osephthal & Co. for
$150,000 and $300,000,respectively. The action had been based upon
alleged violations of the securities laws in the sale, through dummy
accounts at Josephthal & Co., of 578,000shares of unregistered SwanFinch common stock in a rigged market and by use of the facilities
of the Exchange. The trustee had also alleged that the Exchange
did not carry out its responsibilities under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The proceeds of the settlement will enhance the distribution to creditors and stockholders under the proposed plan of
liquidation. Substantially all of the facts alleged in the trustee's
complaint were derived from an investigation conducted by the Commission's staff.14
The court, in The Sire Plan, lno./5 authorized the trustees to accept
$20,000in settlement of an action against two attorneys. The trustees
had alleged, inter alia, that, within 1 year prior to the filing of the
reorganization petition, at a time when the debtor corporations were
insolvent, they transferred funds to the attorneys without fair
consideration.
In Dilbert's Quality Supe'T"'J'narkets,Ina.,IG the court authorized the
trustee to settle for $60,000 a suit against a supplier and its directors
for monies allegedly paid as a commercial bribe to a former officer
of the debtor. In Equitable Plan 00.,17 the court authorized the
trustee to settle a suit against Doeskin Products, Inc., based upon
allegedly fraudulent acts committed by Lowell M. Birrell when he
controlled Doeskin. Under the settlement, Doeskin recognized as
validly issued 150,000 shares of the 194,000 shares of its stock held
by the trustee. The 150,000 shares had a market value of about
$450,000 at the time of settlement. IS

to make an oral or written presentation to amplify the Commission's
views. During this fiscal year the Commission published two formal
advisory reports." The Commission conveyed its views to the court
on 14 other plans, on some by oral statement of its counsel at the
hearing, and on the others by letter and supporting memoranda."
In TMT Trailer Ferry, Ino., 21 the district court, on remand by the
court of appeals," held further hearings on the internal plan of
reorganization, which gives no recognition to the interests or claims
of the debtor's public common stockholders. For reasons previously
stated to the court, the Commission's report concluded that the plan
was not fair and equitable because the evidence as to insolvency was
not adequate and because of the failure to treat as creditors public
stockholders who, as urged by the stockholders committee, had claims
against the debtor based upon the sale to them of the debtor's stock
in alleged violation of the Federal securities laws. The district court
confirmed the plan and the stockholders committee appealed." After
the close of the fiscal year, the court of appeals denied the Commission's motion for a stay pending appeal, and reserved decision on the
trustee's motion to dismiss the appeal or to affirm summarily."
In Yuba Oonsolidated Industries, lno.,25 the plan provided for the

subordinated to creditor claims which arose after the issuance of the
debentures. The plan provided for a distribution to the unsecured
creditors of a minimum of $1,050,000in cash, a maximum of 550,000

shares of $10 par value preferred stock and a like or greater number
of shares of $10 par value common stock, the total of all of which to
equal Yuba's reorganization value as determined by the court. The
creditors whose claims predated the debenture issue would receive
their proportionate amount of the cash and of the preferred and common stocks. The creditors to whom the debentures are subordinated
would receive the remaining cash and preferred stock and, depending
upon Yuba's reorganization value, all or part of the remaining common
stock, but not exceeding in aggregate par value an amount which, together with the cash and par value of the preferred stock, would equal
the dollar amount of their claim. The debentureholders would receive such amount of any remaining common stock as was not required
for the purpose of satisfying the claims of the creditors, to whom the
debentureholders are subordinated.
The court determined the value of the debtor's assets to be
$12,536,000, which included the capitalized value of prospective earnings, excess working capital, and the present value of the tax loss carry
forward and of the earnings and sales proceeds of the liquidating properties. In its report the Commission had recommended a value of
$13,398,000. The court agreed with the Commission's conclusion that
the proposed distribution under the plan provided fair and equitable
treatment among the three classes of creditors since it accorded appropriate recognition to their status and priority inter se.26 As was suggested in the Commission's report, the plan was amended to provide for
the issuance of no par value common stock and to permit the reorganized company, at its option after a specified date, to redeem the preferred stock at par plus a premium and accrued dividends. In its
supplemental advisory report, the Commission concluded that the plan,
as amended, was fair and equitable and feasible, 27 and the plan, as
amended, has been approved."

were claimed by both the parent and the subsidiary, should be held in

ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD TO ALLOWANCES

Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem
of determining the allowance of compensation to be paid to the various
parties for services rendered and for expenses incurred in the proceeding. The Commission, which under Section 242 of the Bankruptcy Act
may not receive any allowance for the services it renders, has sought
to assist the courts in assuring economy of administration and in allocating compensation equitably on the basis of the claimants' contributions to the administration of estates and the formulation of plans.
During the fiscal year 350 applications for compensation totaling about
$9.5 million were reviewed.
In Bevis Shell Homes, I n{].,30 a partner of the attorney representing
the debentureholders protective committee sold, at a loss, 500 shares of
the debtor's stock during the Chapter X proceeding. It was represented to the court that the selling partner had no knowledge of the
proceeding other than that disseminated by the trustee to all of the
stockholders, and that the partner representing the committee had no
knowledge that his partner owned and then sold this stock until after
the firm filed its application for a final allowance. The firm then filed
a petition requesting the court to approve the sale and, in its discretion,
to award an allowance. The district court, as urged by the Commission, ruled that, although the services performed were meritorious and
contributed to the confirmed plan, Section 249 was an absolute bar to
the award of any compensation.
In Hudson &: Manhattan Railroad Oompany, 31 the court of appeals,
agreeing with the Commission, increased the final allowance to special
counsel to the trustee." The court said that "the district judge erred in
giving weight to the fact that the firm on six occasions did not seek the
maximum interim allowance; this only encourages firms to apply for
the maximum allowance regardless of the value of the services rendered." Counsel had requested a total 'allowance of $107,350, the Commission recommended $75,000, the district court allowed $50,000, and
the court of appeals increased the allowance to $65,000. In this connection, the court noted that counsel had not kept accurate time records
and emphasized that "any attorney who hopes to obtain an allowance
from the court should keep accurate and current records of work done
and time spent. . .. There is no excuse for an established law firm

to rely on estimates made on the eve of payment and almost entirely
unsupported by daily records or for it to expect a court to do so."
In the same decision the court of appeals ruled that the district
judge erroneously denied any allowance to a law firm which represented a bondholder who made continued purchases and one sale of the
debtor's bonds. The court held that Section 249 did not bar the law
firm which did not trade and whose appearance for its client did not
facilitate trading. It stated, "as the Commission points out 'the record
indicates no problems of shifting interests and contains no indication
that knowledge gained by the applicant was used to assist [the client's]
trading.' We agree with the Commission that, where a client has
traded in the debtor's securities, weight must be given to the purpose
for which the attorney appeared in the proceeding." 33
Walco Building Oorporationr: the debtor, operated an officebuilding constructed on land leased from the fee owners. The Chapter X
proceeding was dismissed, and bondholders appealed. The appeal was
thereafter dismissed under the terms of a settlement with the fee owners who advanced $25,000 to the indenture trustee to be paid as compensation to the bondholders' attorneys. The court agreed. with the
Commission that, since the services of counsel were rendered in connection with the Chapter X proceeding, the district court had exclusive jurisdiction to review and determine their compensation, even
though such compensation was not to be paid by the estate.
INTERVENTION

IN CHAPTER XI PROCEEDINGS

Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure by which
debtors can effect arrangements with respect to their unsecured debts
under court supervision. Where a proceeding is brought under that
chapter but the facts indicate that it should have been brought under
Chapter X, Section 328 of Chapter XI authorizes the Commission or
any other party in interest to make application to the court to dismiss
the Chapter XI proceeding unless the debtor's petition is amended to
comply with the requirements of Chapter X, or a creditors' petition
under Chapter X is filed.
In American Trailer Rentals Oompany,ss reported previously," the
Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals which had affirmed the
district court's order denying the Commission's motion under Section
328.31 The Supreme Court held that "... although there is no absolute rule requiring that Chapter X be utilized in every case in which

the debtor is publicly owned, or even where publicly held debt is adjusted, as a general rule Chapter X is the appropriate proceeding for
adjustment of publicly held debt." The Court indicated that there
were "... narrow limits within which there are exceptions to this
general rule. .. for example, where the public investors are few in
number and familiar with the operations of the debtor, or where, although the public investors are greater in number, the adjustment of
their debt is relatively minor, consisting, for example, of a short
extension of time for payment."
The Commission's motion under Section 328 was granted by the district court, with the debtor's consent, in Liberty Mortgage Corporation.58 The debtor then filed an amendment petition under Chapter X,
but the petition was dismissed for lack of good faith, the court having
found that rehabilitation of the debtor as a going concern was not
possible and that there was no alternative but to liquidate the debtor.
Referring to the decision in Amerioan Trailer Rentals,59 the district
court stated that, while the granting of a motion under Section 328
will be determinative of one of the elements of good faith specifically
stated in Section 146(2)-that adequate relief is not obtainable under
Chapter XI-the
court must still determine whether it is reasonable
to expect that a plan of reorganization can be effected. In S.E.O. v.
Orumpton Builders, Irw.,40 decided before American Trailer Rentals,
the court of appeals reversed the district court's denial of the Commission's Section 328 motion. On remand, the district court dismissed
the debtor's amended petition under Chapter X, since it appeared that
a successful reorganization under Chapter X was not feasible.
In Oanandaigua Enterprises Oorp.,41 reported previously," the
court of appeals, prior to the American Trailer Rentals decision, reversed the order of the district court denying the Commission's Section 328 motion to dismiss the Chapter XI petition." The court stated
that "... the need for a readjustment of publicly held debt creates
a presumption in favor of Chapter X, whereas a case calling only for
modification of the claims of trade creditors or others who have had
private dealings with the debtor is presumptively to be handled under
Chapter XI."

and the case was pending for decision at the end of the fiscal year.

appeared that the motion was no longer appropriate and, by leave of

PART VII
ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes, debentures and similar securities publicly offered :for sale, except as specifically exempted by the Act, be issued under an indenture which meets
the requirements of the Act and has been duly qualified with the Commission. The Act requires that indentures to be qualified include
specified provisions which provide means by which the rights of
holders of securities issued under such indentures may be protected and
enforced. These provisions relate to designated standards of eligibility and qualification of the corporate trustee to provide reasonable
financial responsibility and to minimize conflicting interests. The Act
outlaws exculpatory provisions formerly used to eliminate all liability
of the indenture trustee and imposes on the trustee, after default, the
duty to use the same degree of care and skill in the exercise of the
rights and powers vested in it by the indenture as a prudent man
would use in the conduct of his own affairs.
The provisions of the Trust Indenture Act are closely integrated
with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant
to the Securities Act of securities to be issued under a trust indenture
subject to the Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective unless the indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter
Act, and necessary information as to the trustee and the indenture
must be contained in the registration statement. In the case of securities issued in exchange for other securities of the same issuer and
securities issued under a plan approved by a court or other proper
authority which, although exempted from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, are not exempted from the requirements
of the Trust Indenture Act, the obligor must file an application for the
qualification of the indenture, including a statement of the required
information concerning the eligibility and qualification of the trustee.

REVISION OF RULES, REGULATIONS AND FORMS
Proposed Rule 7a-9

Public comments were invited during the fiscal year on a proposed
new rule, to be designated Rule 7a-9, under the Trust Indenture Act.'
The new rule would provide for the filing with an application for the
qualification of an indenture under the Act, or as an amendment to
such an application which has not become effective, of an amendment
which would delay the effectiveness of the application until a further
amendment superseding the delaying amendment is filed, or until the
Commission accelerates the effective date upon request of the obligor.
Applications for qualification of an indenture are required to be filed
in those cases, not otherwise exempt, where the securities to be issued
under the indenture are not required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933. Rule 473 under the Securities Act makes similar provision for the filing of delaying amendments to registration statements
under that Am.
This matter was pending at the close of the fiscal year.
Proposed Amendments to Forms T-I and T-2

During the fiscal year, the Commission invited public comments on
proposed amendments to Forms T-1 and T-2 under the Trust Indenture Act.2 Form T-1 is prescribed for statements of eligibility
and qualification of corporations designated to act as trustees under
indentures qualified under the Act. Form T -2 is prescribed for statements of eligibility and qualification of individuals designated to act
as trustees under such indentures. The proposed amendments would
clarify and simplify the forms in certain respects, would delete certain
required information deemed not essential to a determination of the
eligibility and qualifications of the trustee, would require certain additional information deemed significant in such determination, and
would bring the forms in line with the format of the Commission's
more recently adopted forms under other acts.

PART VIII
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT
OF 1940
The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides for the registration
and regulation of companies primarily engaged in the business of
investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, The
Act, among other things, requires disclosure of the financial and
investment policies of such companies; prohibits changing the nature
of their business or their investment policies without shareholder
approval; regulates the means of custody of the companies' assets;
requires management contracts to be submitted to security holders for
approval; prohibits underwriters, investment bankers, and brokers
from constituting more than a minority of the directors of such companies; and prohibits transactions between such companies and their
officers, directors, and affiliates except with approval of the Commission. The Act also regulates the issuance of senior securities and
requires face-amount certificate companies to maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity payments upon the certificates.
The securities of investment companies which are offered to the
public are also required to be registered under the Securities A.,ctof
1933 and the companies must file periodic reports. Such companies
are also subject to the Commission's proxy rules and certain "insiders"
of closed-end companies are subject to reporting and "short swing"
trading rules. In November 1964, certain functions relating to investment companies were reallocated from the Division of Corporation
Finance to the Division of Corporate Regulation, including the administration of the disclosure requirements with respe~t to registration
statements filed by such companies under the Securities Act of 1933
and the administration of the periodic reporting, proxy solicitation
and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with
respect to registered investment companies. On the basis of the experience since the transfer of functions, the resulting concentration of
responsibility in the Division of Corporate Regulation for the administration of the securities laws as they apply to investment companies
has been of material convenience to registrants and other persons
concerned with investment companies.

INSPECTION AND INVESTIGATION PROGRAM

During fiscal year 1965, a total of 146 investment company inspections was completed pursuant to the statutory authority conferred on
the Commission by Section 31 (b) of the Investment Company .Act.
.A large number of the inspections disclosed violations not only of the
Investment Company .Act but also of other statutes administered by
the Commission. .A number of the violations uncovered during the
course of routine inspections were serious in character. These included
inadequate arrangements for safekeeping of the investment company's
portfolio securities or failure to observe the safekeeping procedures
which had been established. The inspections also disclosed several
situations in which the procedures for pricing shares for purposes of
purchase or redemption were not in conformity with the statute or the
investment company's prospectus. Several instances were found in
which the investment company failed to redeem shares within the
required statutory period. The inspections further uncovered a number of instances in which transactions violating Section 17 of the .Act
had been effected by affiliated persons.

TIDRTY-FIRST

ANNUAL REPORT

111

Largely as an outgrowth of information obtained during these inspections, 23 private investigations were commenced during the fiscal
year. On the basis of the facts obtained in the investigations, two
civil actions were instituted by the Commission. One of the actions
(S.E.O. v, Oapital Funds, Ino., et al.)l sought to enforce compliance
with the proxy solicitation requirements of the Investment Company
Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with a
proxy solicitation of shareholders of Modern American Mortgage Corporation, a then registered investment company. In that civil action,
the Commission also sought to enjoin the defendants from offering to
purchase the securities of Modern American Mortgage Corporation by
means of allegedly fraudulent statements concerning, among other
things, the net worth, earnings, assets and future market value of the
securities of that company.
As a result of the Commission's inspection and investigation program, a total of $1,541,000 was returned during fiscal 1965 to investment companies for the benefit of shareholders or to the shareholders
directly. Following one inspection, a court-ordered liquidation of an
unregistered investment company resulted in a distribution of assets
totalling $1,287,170 to that company's shareholders." In another instance, the Commission's staff, during a routine examination, discovered that an investment company officer had been converting funds by
causing the company to purchase worthless short-term notes of a fictitious enterprise. Following this discovery, the investment company
was fully indemnified for its losses, which aggregated $195,000. In
a third instance, through the efforts of the Commission's staff, $39,441
was returned to an investment company in settlement of that company's claims against an affiliated broker-dealer firm arising from
excessive brokerage commissions and trading profits and from the
broker-dealer's activities in causing the company to engage in certain
unauthorized principal trades with another affiliated business entity.
REVISION

OF ANNUAL REPORT FORM FOR MANAGEMENT
INVESTMENT COMPANIES

Even under an expanded inspection program, such as has been pursued by the Division of Corporate Regulation in the past few years,
certain investment companies inevitably require closer or prompter
scrutiny. Because of this and the continued growth in the number and
size of investment companies, the Commission considered that the
public interest and the protection of investors would be served by
strengthening the annual report filed by investment companies, and

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

adopted a revised form, captioned Form N-1R, effective for all fiscal
years ending on and after December 31, 1964.3
In adopting Form N-1R the Commission determined to amend
the reporting requirements in two major respects.' First, the previous form was revised to provide for additional information in the
public reports filed by registered management investment companies.
Second, a new nonpublic report is provided as a part of the form.
The data in both reports will materially assist the Commission in its
inspection program.
In addition, the reports will serve the
purpose of bringing to the attention of the persons responsible for
the management and operations of investment companies information
which will assist them to determine more readily whether the statutory
standards and requirements are, in fact, being complied with, and
thus contribute to the achievement of a substantial degree of selfinspection.
BLINGS REVIEWED

Investment companies offering their shares for sale to the public
must file a registration statement for their securities under the Securities Act of 1933 as well as register under the Investment Company
Act. The registration statements and revised prospectuses of investment companies filed pursuant to the Securities Act are reviewed for
compliance with that Act and the Investment Company Act. The
Commission's rules promulgated under the Investment Company Act
generally require that the basic information contained in notifications
of registration and in registration statements of investment companies
be kept current through periodic and other reports. In addition,
proxy soliciting material filed by investment companies is reviewed
for compliance with the Commission's proxy rules. The following
table sets forth the volume of filings processed during the past fiscal
year:
3 Investment
Company Act Release No. 4151 (January 25, 1965). Because of
the increased scope of this form, the due date of the first annual report filed by a
registered company on the form was extended, from not more than 120 days as
previously required for the filing of annual reports, to not more than 180 days
after the close of the fiscal year covered by the report. For companies whose
fiscal year ended on December 31, 1964, the first report on Form N-1R was thus
required to be filed not later than June 29, 1965.
â€¢ As noted at p, 116, intra, the proposal to amend Rule 2Oa-2 with respect to
information to be disclosed in proxy statements was withdrawn.
In connection
with the withdrawal the Commission indicated that further consideration of an
amendment of Rule 20a-2 will be undertaken, including the extent to which the
information called for by certain items of Form N-1R should be disclosed
in proxy statements, prospectuses and reports to shareholders of registered
investment companies.

APPLICATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

Under Section 6(c) of the Act, the Commission, by rules and regulations, upon its own motion or by order upon application, may exempt
any person, security, or transaction from any provision of the Act
if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the
Act. Other Sections, such as 6(d), 9(b), 10(f), 17(b), 17(d), and
23(c), contain specific provisions and standards pursuant to which
the Commission may grant exemptions from particular sections of the
Act or may approve certain types of transactions. Also, under certain
provisions of Sections 2, 3, and 8 the Commission may determine
the status of persons and companies under the Act. One of the principal activities of the Commission in its regulation of investment
companies is the consideration of applications for orders under the
sections referred to.
During the fiscal year, 260 applications filed under various sections
of the Investment Company Act were before the Commission. The
sections of the Act with which these applications were concerned and
the disposition of such applications are shown in the following table:

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Some of the more significant matters in which applications were
considered are summarized below:
On November 9, 1964, the Commission issued a notice and order for
hearing with respect to an application of American & Foreign Power
Company Inc. ("Foreign Power") for an order pursuant to (i) Section 3 (b) (2) of the Act declaring that Foreign Power is not an investment company or (ii) Section 6(c) exempting Foreign Power from
the provisions of the Act," The application was occasioned by Foreign
Power's sales of or contracts to sell, between 1958 and 1964, its interests in public utility subsidiaries in Argentina, Mexico, Columbia, and Brazil t.o the governments or government agencies of those
countries largely in exchange for notes of such governments or
agencies. The proceeding on Foreign Power's application was consolidated with the proceeding on an application which had previously been
filed by Electric Bond and Share Company ("Bond and Share"), the
majority stockholder of Foreign Power, for an order pursuant to (i)
Section 8(f) of the Act declaring that Bond and Share had ceased to be
an investment company as defined in Section 3 (a), or (ii) Section 3 (b)
(2) of the Act declaring that Bond and Share is not an investment
company."
Hearings were held during which Bond and Share amended its application to include a request, pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act, for
an order exempting it from the provisions of the Act. On January
29,1965, the Division of Corporate Regulation filed its proposed findings and conclusions and brief in support thereof recommending that
the Commission deny the applications of Bond and Share and Foreign
Power. On February 16, 1965, Foreign Power entered into an agreement providing for the sale of its interests in its public utility subsidiaries in Chile to an agency of the Chilean Government primarily in
exchange for notes guaranteed by that Government. Following the
reopening of the record of the proceedings to receive evidence with
respect to that sale, reply briefs were filed by the applicants and by
the Division of Corporate Regulation, and oral argument by the parties was heard by the Commission. At the close of the fiscal year
the matter was pending.
On April 7, 1965, the Commission issued its opinion and order granting an application filed pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act by Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company of America ("V ALIC"), for
a limited exemption from the provisions of Sections 22 (d) and 27 (a)
of the Act.'

The Commission's order under Section 22( d) permits VALIC to sell
group variable annuities to those employers satisfying the provisions
of Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended,
("Code") at the same sales load charged employees' pension and profitsharing trusts which satisfy Section 401 of the Code and also charged
tax exempt organizations enumerated under Sections 501(c) (3) and
(13) of the Code. The exemption also permits variation in the sales
load charged to those employers enumerated in Section 403 (b) of the
Code so as to increase the amount of purchase payments on behalf of
any individual at any time after the first year in order that the same
uniform sales load can be charged during the contract year in which
the increase is made.
With respect to Section 27(a), the Commission's order permits
VALIC to charge, in the sale of its variable annuities to pension
trusts, a sales load of up to 12.08 percent in each of the first 6 contract
years, 5.5 percent in each of the next 6 contract years, and 2 percent
each year for the remainder of the accumulation period. Under the
order, the total cumulative deductions for sales load will be less at any
point over the life of such contracts than the maximum cumulative deductions permitted by Section 27(a), namely, 50 percent the first year
and uniform rate thereafter.
On June 2,1965, the Commission granted an application filed under
Section 6 (c) of the Investment Company Act by Investors Diversified
Services, Inc. ("IDS"), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Investors
Accumulation Plan, Inc. ("Plan Company"}."
Plan Company proposed to offer periodic payment plan certificates for accumulation of
shares of Investors Stock Fund, Inc., a registered open-end diversified
management investment company. IDS acts as investment adviser
and underwriter fur Investors Stock Fund, Inc., and will act as underwriter for the securities offered by the Plan Company. The Commission's order permits the deduction of sales loads on periodic payment
plan certificates at the rate of 20 percent of payments during the 1st
year, 18 percent during the 2nd and 3rd years, 7 percent during the 4th
year and 4.2 percent thereafter.
Over the course of the plan the sales
load would be 8 percent of aggregate payments. The total cumulative
deductions for sales load will be less at any point of time over the life
of such contracts than the maximum cumulative deductions permitted
by Section 27(a).
During the fiscal year, Amoskeag Oompany ("Amoskeag"), a registered closed-end, nondiversified investment company organized as a
trust, submitted to the Commission a plan of reorganization and requested, pursuant to Section 25(b) of the ,Act, that the Commission
render an advisory report in respect to the fairness of the plan and its
8

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

effect upon the two classes of security holders of Amoskeag. The plan
called for the transfer of the assets of the trust to a newly created corporation, in exchange for all of the debentures and common stock to
be issued by the new corporation; the transfer of the debentures of the
new corporation or cash to the preferred shareholders of the trust; the
transfer of the common stock of the new corporation to the common
shareholders of the trust; and the liquidation of the trust. It was
proposed for the following stated reasons: (1) the new corporation
would have perpetual existence in contrast to the limited term of the
trust; (2) the trust form of :organization deprived management and
counsel of the relative legal certainty and flexibility of operation available to corporations; (3) dividends on preferred shares were not deductible by the trust for Federal income tax purposes (in the opinion
of counsel, interest paid on the proposed debentures would be deductible) ; and (4) holders of preferred shares would have the election
of receiving in cash the full liquidation preference of $100 per share
plus accrued dividends for their holdings, which would be in excess of
the over-the-counter market bid quotations for the shares ranging from
82 to 95 during the 5 years 1960 to 1964, inclusive.
In its advisory report issued May 20, 1965,9 the Commission concluded that, on the basis of a comparison of the rights and financial attributes of the preferred and common shares of the trust with those of
the debentures and common stock of the new corporation, the terms of
the plan were within such limits of fairness as would justify its submission to the security holders of Amoskeag for their consideration.
The Commission pointed out, however, that it had no statutory power
to approve or disapprove the plan, and that in no sense was the report
to be deemed a recommendation, endorsement or approval of the plan.
REVISION

OF RULES, REGULATIONS

AND FORMS

During the fiscal year Rules 3c-3 and 17g-1 were amended and Rule
12d-1 was adopted. The amendments and adoption, respectively, of
these rules were noted, and their provisions discussed, in the 30th
Annual Report of the Commission."
The proposed amendment of
Rule 20a-2 relating to certain financial and other information to be
disclosed in proxy statements of registered investment companies was
also discussed in the 30th Annual Report where it was noted that the
amendment was pending.v

Adoption of Rule 2a-4

During the fiscal year the Commission adopted Rule 2a-4, which
defines the term "current net asset value" as used in the A.ct with
reference to redeemable securities issued by a registered investment
company." Under the rule, portfolio securities for which market
quotations are readily available are to be valued at current market
value, and other securities and assets are to be valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by the board of directors of the registered
company. The rule also provides that changes in holdings of portfolio
securities or in the number of outstanding shares of the registered
company shall be reflected no later than the first calculation on the
first business day following the trade date or date of change. Under
the rule, expenses, including 'any investment advisory fees, are to be
included to the date of calculation; dividends receivable are to be
included to date of calculation either at ex-dividend dates or record
dates, as appropriate; and interest income and other income are to be
included to date of calculation. The rule also provides for interim
determinations of current net asset value between calculations made
as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the preceding
business day and the current business day so as to reflect any change.

PART IX
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT
OF 1940
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 established a pattern of
regulation of investment advisers similar to that contained in the
Securities Exchange Act with respect to the conduct of broker-dealers.
W"ith certain specific exceptions, the Act requires persons engaged for
compensation in the business of advising others with respect to securities to register with the Commission and to conform to statutory
standards designed to protect the public interest. The Act prohibits
fraudulent conduct, and authorizes the Commission to define, and
prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent fraudulent, deceptive
or manipulative acts or practices. Pursuant to such authority, Rule
206 (4) -1 proscribes, among other things, the use of testimonials, circumscribes permissible references to past recommendations and the
use of graphs and charts, and prohibits the use of false or misleading
statements. Under Rule 206(4)-2, an investment adviser who has
custody or possession of the funds or securities of clients must segregate
them, maintain them in the manner provided in the rule and comply
with certain other conditions.
The Act prohibits an investment adviser from basing his compensation upon a share of the capital gains or appreciation of his
client's funds, and prohibits the assignment of investment advisory
contracts without the client's consent. Advisers are also required to
make, keep and preserve books and records in accordance with the
Commission's rules and the Commission is empowered to conduct
inspections of such books and records.
Investment advisers who violate any of the provisions of the Act
or of the rules thereunder are subject to appropriate administrative,
civil or criminal sanctions. The Act provides, in Section 203(d) ,
that the Commission shall deny, revoke, or suspend for not more than
12 months, the registration of an investment adviser if it finds thac
such action is in the public interest and that the investment adviser
or any partner, officer, director or controlling or controlled person
of the investment adviser is subject to a specified disqualification.
These disqualifications include wilful misstatements in an application
or report filed with the Commission, the existence of a conviction or
injunction based on or related to specified types of misconduct, wilful
violation of any provision of the Securities Act, Securities Exchange
118

Act or Investment Advisers Act or any rule or regulation thereunder,
and aiding and abetting any other person's violation of such provisions,
rules or regulations. In addition, the Commission may seek injunctions to restrain violations of the Act and may recommend criminal
prosecution by the Department of Justice for fraudulent misconduct
or wilful violation of the Act or the Commission's rules thereunder.

Among the decisions rendered during the fiscal year was one in
which the Commission discussed at some length the obligations of investment advisers with respect to advertising material. In view of
mitigating factors, the Commission, in Spear &: Staff, Incorporatedr
accepted an offer of settlement consenting to findings that the registrant, aided and abetted by its president, wilfully violated the antifraud provisions of the Act and providing for an order directing
registrant to refrain for 90 days from advertising for new subscribers
to its publications and to undertake during that period to establish
controls for the purpose of preventing future violations.
In its Findings and Opinion," the Commission analyzed registrant's
advertising for its market letters, and found that such advertising
was couched in enthusiastic and dramatic language, insistently implying that registrant possessed the ability to select stocks that were certain to appreciate in price substantially and rapidly and that "a certain
road to riches was at hand for those who availed themselves of registrant's guidance." A frequently used advertisement inquired of prospective subscribers whether they desired to double their money in
perhaps 12 or 24 months and urged that if they were so interested, they

should learn about special situation investing from registrant. Another technique was to recount outstanding success stories and attribute
the success of the selected individuals to investments in special situations, thereby furthering the impression that registrant was able to
uncover for its subscribers opportunities for outstanding profits comparable to those which the described individuals had realized.
The Commission concluded that registrant's advertisements were
deceptive and misleading in their over-all effect, particularly on unsophisticated investors, even though arguably no single statement was
literally false. It stated that the advertisements obscured the numerous uncertainties and imponderables inherent in any attempt to forecast security prices. The Commission stated that in accepting
respondents' offer of settlement, despite the seriousness with which it
viewed the violation, it took into account that this was one of the first
administrative proceedings in which it had dealt with the question
of improper investment advisory advertising material, and various
other mitigating factors. It emphasized, however, that the relative
leniency of the sanction imposed should not be misconstrued since in
light of the admonitions of its opinion it would be disposed to deal
more severely with any future instances of false and misleading
advertising by investment advisers.

PART X
OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION
CIVIL LITIGATION

The several statutes administered by the Commission authorize the
Commission to seek injunctions against continuing or threatened violations of such statutes. Such violations may involve a wide range of
illegal practices, including the purchase or sale of securities by fraud,
and the sale of securities without compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Commission also participates
in various other types of proceedings, including appearances as amicus
curiae in litigation between private parties where it is important that
its views regarding the interpretation of the statutory provisions
involved be furnished to the court, corporate reorganization proceedings under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, and various types of
civil appellate proceedings.
Tables 11 and 12 in the appendix to this report contain statistics
with respect to the various types of civil proceedings in which the Commission participated prior to and during the fiscal year. A summary
of injunction proceedings instituted by the Commission since 1934
may be found in Table 15. This section describes a few of the more
noteworthy cases which were pending during the .fiscal year, not including, however, cases arising under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act or Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act; such cases are
discussed in the sections of this report dealing with those statutes.
During the year, the Commission was involved in significant litigation, both as a party and in an amicus curiae capacity, based upon Rule
10b-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In Securities and
Exchange Oommiesion. v. Texas Gulf Sulphur 00.,1 an action instituted
in April 1965, the Commission alleges that the rule was violated when
certain officials of the defendant company purchased shares of its
stock, as well as calls on such stock, between November 12, 1963 and
April 16, 1964, without disclosing to the sellers material facts of which
the officials were aware concerning the company's mining activities
near Timmins, Ontario, Canada. The complaint alleges that on November 12, 1963, the company had completed a drill hole which has
been characterized as the "most impressive ... in modern times." It is
alleged that additional violations of the rule occurred when certain
1

122

TEITRTY-FLRST~AL

REPORT

123

Texas Gulf officials advised other persons to engage in similar purchases, when certain of them received stock options from the company
without disclosing the material facts about the ore strike to the board
of directors and when the company itself, on April 13, 1964, issued a
false and misleading press release concerning its activities in Timmins
3 days prior to its issuance of a second release which for the first time
confirmed the existence of a rich copper and zinc ore body in the
Timmins area. In addition to injunctive relief against a repetition of
the allegedly unlawful activities, the Commission seeks an order directing rescission of the allegedly unlawful purchases of stock and calls
by the defendants, directing cancellation of the stock options in
question and directing those defendants who advised others to purchase
to make restitution to the sellers.
In a subsequent action, Securities and Eechanqe Oomanissiom v.
Golconda Mining 00. and Harry F. Magnuson,2 it is alleged that
Golconda and Magnuson, a substantial stockholder and controlling
person of Golconda, violated the rule by purchasing stock of Hecla
Mining Co. and selling stock of Lucky Friday Silver-Lead Mines Co.,
without disclosing to the respective sellers and purchasers a proposed
merger between the two companies, known to Magnuson by virtue of
his position as a director of each, at an exchange ratio different from
the ratio of the market prices of the two stocks prevailing during the
period of the alleged purchases and sales. The Commission seeks
both an injunction against future violations and an order directing
the defendants to make restitution to each person from whom they
purchased Hecla stock and to whom they sold Lucky Friday stock
during the period covered by the complaint.
During the fiscal year the Commission also agreed to a settlement
of the case of Securities and Etcohamqe Uommiseion. v. Aldred Investment T'l'U8t, et al.,3 which was instituted under Rule 1Ob-5 in 1961.
In this case the Commission alleged that Richard L. Rosenthal, president and majority stockholder of Aldred Investment Trust, an investment company having less than 100 shareholders, had purchased
through Birnbaum & Co., a registered broker-dealer, minority shares
of Aldred stock at $16 per share without disclosing to the sellers the
identity of the purchaser, the purchaser's relationship to Aldred, the
details of Aldred's investment portfolio or the fact that the net asset
value of the stock had risen :from $27 to $90 per share during the
period in which the purchases took place. Birnbaum & Co. consented
to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations and
the action was dismissed as against Rosenthal, after he offered rescission of their transactions to each of the persons from whom he

purchased, and as against Aldred, after it had been recapitalized to
eliminate all minority holdings.
Two private suits under the rule in which the Commission participated amicue curiae were 0 'Neill v, M aytag, et Â«1.4 and List v, Fashion
Park, Inc., et al.5 In O'Neill the plaintiff, suing derivatively on
behalf of National Airlines, Inc., alleged that National was defrauded
within the meaning of the rule when its controlling directors caused
it to acquire a large block of its own stock at an excessive price for
the purpose of removing the threat to the directors' control represented by such stock. The district court dismissed plaintiff's complaint and the court of appeals affirmed, holding that while plaintiff
did allege a breach of fiduciary duty by the directors, he did not allege
a violation of Rule 10b--5because the complaint failed to allege facts
amounting to "deception" on the part of the defendants. The court
pointed out, however, that "deception" might not be required under
the rule where the fiduciary duty allegedly breached is one that was
created "with particular reference to the purchase or sale of securities,"
as in the case of a broker-dealer or investment adviser. The Commission's brief, urging reversal, had argued that it was clear from
a reading of the entire complaint that plaintiff was claiming, although
implicitly, that the directors did not fully disclose the conflicting
interest which motivated the securities transactions to those entitled to
such disclosure.
In the List case, a director of Fashion Park, Inc. and his broker
had purchased from the plaintiff 5,100 shares bf Fashion Park stock
at $18.50 per share without disclosing to him (1) that one of the
purchasers was a director or (2) that the board of directors had 1
week earlier resolved to seek to sell or merge the company. The
court of appeals affirmed the district court's dismissal of the complaint
following trial, holding that although a securities purchaser may violate Rule lOb--5while maintaining complete silence, the district court
was not clearly in error in concluding that the plaintiff would have
sold his stock even if he had known that a director was the purchaser,
i.e, there was no "reliance" upon this nondisclosure, or in concluding
that the corporate resolution was too remote to have influenced the
conduct of a reasonable investor, i.e., the adoption of the resolution
was not a "material" fact. While the Commission did not participate
in this case at the trial or appellate levels, the Solicitor General,
subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, submitted to the Supreme
Court, at the Court's invitation, a memorandum amicus curiae expressing the Commission's views upon the question of whether the plaintiff's
pending petition for a writ of certiorari should be granted. The

â€¢ 340 F.2d 457 (C.A. 2,1965).

position taken in this memorandum is that the court of appeals
correctly determined that the rule may be violated by maintaining
complete silence, but that the court's test of reliance is confusing and
inappropriate in cases of complete nondisclosure and that the court
erred in failing to evaluate the combined and cumulative impact of
the two elements of nondisclosure. It is urged, however, that review
by the Supreme Court is not warranted in view of the fact that the
case involves primarily factual determinations and the petition does
not appear to raise the questions which trouble the Commission.
The Commission's action against James J. Ling, Royce B. McKinley, and Joseph F. McKinney, former officers or directors, and Paul
E. Broderick, the present treasurer of Electro-Science Investors, Inc.,6
a registered investment company, was concluded on August 3, 1965,
when the court entered final judgment based on stipulation and consent of all the parties.
The complaint alleged, among other things, that Ling, with the
assistance of other defendants, took personal advantage of a corporate
opportunity of the company to purchase and resell a large block of
common stock of Tamar Electronics Industry, Inc., in which the company also had an interest, thus violating Section 17 of the 1940 Act,
and that he realized substantial personal benefits from the transaction
which rightfully belonged to the company. The complaint sought
an accounting for and return of such profits of the company and an
injunction pursuant to Section 36 of that Act preventing any of the
defendants from serving as officersor directors of a registered investment company.
All defendants filed undertakings not to serve as officersor directors
of any registered investment company (except that Mr. Broderick
may continue as treasurer of the company). The court also approved
a monetary settlement under which defendant Ling is to pay $225,000
to the company in compromise of any claim the company may have
against him.
In Hoover v. Allen/ a derivative action by shareholders of
American-Hawaiian Steamship Co., plaintiffs alleged that Daniel K.
Ludwig, the principal shareholder of the company, had made false and
misleading statements which were designed to depress the value of
American-Hawaiian's stock and to induce other stockholders to sell
their stock to the company, in order to enable Ludwig to obtain complete control of the company. Plaintiffs further alleged that Ludwig,
after gaining such control, had committed acts of corporate waste.

(4) (registration provisions), 20(a) (proxy provisions), 34(b) (reporting provisions) and 36 (gross abuse of trust) of the 1940 Act.
The court dismissed all claims (except those involving Section 36)
on the ground that the company suffered no injury directly connected
with the purchase or sale of securities, noting that the company in fact
benefited from its purchases since they were made at an allegedly depressed price. The court found that the acts of waste complained of
were not so connected with the alleged fraud that they were cognizable
under Section 10(b) and that no injury was so connected with allegedly
misleading proxy material as to state a cause of action under the proxy
provisions of either Act.
The Commission's participation as amicus curiae, which was at the
request of the court, was limited to the issues (1) whether a dormant
nonoperating water carrier which held an IOC certificate was excluded from regulation under the 1940 Act under Section 3(c) (9)
thereof as a company "subject to regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act ... " and (2) whether substantive violations of the 1940
Act were chargeable to a nonregistered company which should have
been registered, under sections of the Act which in terms apply to a
"registered investment company."
The court held that the Section 3(c) (9) exemption was unavailable
to water carriers, whether active or dormant. Further, by refusing to
dismiss the Section 36 claims, the court also recognized that an action
may be brought for substantive violations of the 1940 Act occurring
during a period when an entity was illegally unregistered.
The Commission's action under the Investment Company Act
against Oontinental Growth Fund, Inc.,s a registered investment company, and certain of its officers and directors, seeking to enjoin the
individual defendants from continuing to act as officers and directors
on the ground that they had been guilty of gross misconduct and gross
abuse of trust, was terminated during the fiscal year with the settlement of the action against J. Dudley Devine, the only remaining
defendant, on the basis of a stipulation which recites that Mr. Devine
has entered into an undertaking with the Commission.
In August 1963, on the Commission's application, the court had
appointed a receiver for the fund's assets and in November 1963,it had
entered an order permanently enjoining Richard G. Jacobs, a promoter
of the fund and its former president, from further violations of the
Investment Company Act. On June 24, 1964, the action was settled
and discontinued by order of the court as against the other defendants
on the basis of a stipulation which recited, among other things, that
certain of the defendants and others had paid to the fund's receiver

$220,300 in settlement of losses resulting from the activities charged
in the Commission's complaint, and had entered into undertakings
similar to the above undertaking by defendant Devine.
In Securities and Ewohange (Iomandssion. v. United Benefit Life Insurance Oompany,9 the Commission sought to enjoin the defendant
company from offering and selling, in violation of the registration
provisions of the Securities Act, a contract described by the company
as an Annual Premium Flexible Fund Retirement Annuity.
The
Commission contended that the contract, representing a participation
in a fund of securities, was a security within the meaning of that Act
and also that the fund of securities constituted an investment company
required to be registered under the Investment Company Act. At the
close of the presentation of the Commission's evidence the district
court dismissed the complaint, holding that the contract was an exempt
"insurance product" and not a security. An appeal has been taken by
the Commission to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit where the matter is now pending.
In a number of cases in which petitions for review were filed during
or shortly prior to the fiscal year, various courts of appeals have
affirmed Commission orders revoking the registrations of brokerdealers and in their decisions have expressed holdings of considerable
significance. In Boruski v, S.E.O.I0 the court, in rejecting the contention that the Commission's regulations requiring certified reports
of financial condition were unreasonable, remarked that "it is difficult
to see how the Commission could carryon its task of protection of the
public investor without financial information such as it sought here."
In response to Boruski's further contention that the Commission
should have appointed counsel to represent him in the administrative
proceeding, the court stated: "We know of no requirement that counsel
be appointed in these administrative proceedings.
The orders, although serious in their effect, are not criminal judgments."
In a companion case, Financial (Iounsellors, Inc. v, S.E.OY the revocation of the broker-dealer registration of Financial Counsellors,
Inc. was based upon its failure to disclose in its registration application that Boruski controlled it. The Act expressly requires disclosure
of the identity of any person controlling the applicant and the court
concluded that "the registration requirement provisions are ~f vital
importance to the statutory scheme of securities regulations" and that
revocation was "fully warranted."

COMMISSION

A similar holding was made in the case of Oapital Funde, [no. v.
S.E.O./2 decided shortly after the end of the fiscal year, where the
court ruled that a misstatement in an application for broker-dealer
registration as to the identity of the owners of the business is not a
"minor" point. The decision also held that the offer or sale of any
part of an issue of securities to a nonresident is sufficient to deprive
the entire issue of the benefit of the intrastate exemption from registration; that an industrial loan company, though organized under a
Banking Statute and subject to supervision by a State Banking
Commissioner, is not a banking institution within the meaning of the
Securities Act; that the failure of the Commission to take action as
to an earlier violation does not mean that it passed upon or approved
any transaction; and that the Commission and its agents may not
"waive" violations of Federal law, nor may estoppel be raised against
the Commission.
In Gearhart &: Otis, Inc. v. S.E.O.,la the court held that objections
which were not raised before the Commission could not be raised upon
review, even though the objections in question could only have been
raised by a petition for rehearing.
However, the court added, with
respect to one of the objections, that a Commissioner could participate
in a decision even though he was appointed and took office subsequent
to oral argument before the Commission.
In Tager v, S.E.O.,l4. the court refused to modify the sanctions imposed by the Commission, stating that courts should not "substitute
their untutored views as to what sanctions will best accord with the
regulatory powers of the Commission."
In disposing of the petitioner's argument that his manipulation caused little harm to investors,
the court observed: "The injury inflicted on the public, the market
price inflation accomplished through the rigging, and the amount of
profit realized by the broker are not immutable guides to an appropriate sanction as these factors are largely dependent upon market
conditions and chance."
In this ,case as well as in the Gearhart and Oapital Funde cases the
courts reaffirmed their consistent holdings that willfulness, within the
meaning of Section 15 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act, means
merely that a person intentionally commits the act which constitutes
the violation and does not mean that he must know he is breaking the
law.

The court rejected an attack
on the make-up of the Association's tribunals because of their possible
lack of disinterestedness, pointing out that disciplinary action taken
by the Association is subject to full review IOfthe Commission. The
court also ruled that while it was "puzzled by the imposition of a
$1,000 forfeiture, the maximum fine in the NASD arsenal of remedies,
for a breach of contract involving a sum less than one-third as large,"
it could not say that the Commision exceeded its discretion in upholding the Association's assessment.
In BlasÂ» v, Maw Factor & 00.,16 the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit held that an exchange of Max Factor common stock for
Class A stock did not constitute a "purchase" of the Class A stock
within the meaning of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. The
common was exchangeable for Class A at any time, and the only
difference between the two classes was that the board of directors had
the power to declare lesser dividends on the common than on the
Class A. In holding that there was no purchase, the court distinguished Park &1 Tilford, 1M. v. 8ahulte,17 where a conversion of convertible preferred into common was held to be a purchase. The court
noted that unlike the Max Factor exchange, the preferred and common
exchanged in Park &1 Tilford involved significantly different investment risks.
The plaintiff had challenged the validity of Rule 16b-9, under which
the transactions involved were exempt from the operation of Section
16 (b), including its retroactive application to the facts of this case,
and the Commisison had filed an amicus ouriae brief urging that the
rule be upheld. In view of its conclusion that there was no purchase,
the court found it unnecessary to determine the validity of the rule.
In accordance with a request from the Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit, the Commission participated amicus curiae in a reargument en bane in Heli-Ooil Corporation v. Webster.1s This is an appeal
from a district court decision holding appellant, a director of Hell-Coil
Corporation, liable under Section 16 (b) for profits allegedly realized
by him from short term dealings in the convertible debentures and
common stock of the company. The Commission took the position
that the court below correctly held that a voluntary conversion of
debentures into common stock constituted a sale of the debentures
and a purchase of the common stock within the meaning of Section
16 (b), that the stock acquired upon conversion was not exempt from
Section 16 (b) as a security "acquired in good faith in connection with
a debt previously contracted" and that a conversion was not exempt

from Section 16(b) as an arbitrage transaction. The Commission
urged, however, that since under the circumstances of this case no
profit was realized by appellant from the disposition of the debentures
upon conversion, the judgment against him should have been limited
to the profits realized from the sale of the common stock within 6
months of the conversion.
In Western Auto Supply 00. v. Gamble-Skogmo, Inc./9 the court,
as urged by the Commission in an amicus curiae brief filed during the
fiscal year, held (1) that the issuer's cause of action under Section
16(b), as a matter of Federal law, survived a subsequent merger by
the issuer with another corporation and assignment by the latter of
its interest in the issuer to a third corporation ; and (2) that shares of
stock are fungible so that the purchase of a particular block cannot
be matched against a transfer of most of that block to the purchaser's
employee pension trust at the purchase price and thus make it unavailable for matching against a subsequent sale of other shares at a higher
price within 6 months of the purchase of that block.
Particularly in view of the number of new companies that will be
required to file reports with the Commission, increased enforcement of
the filing requirements is being emphasized. In Securities and Exchamqe Oommission. v, S & P National Corporation; et al./o a mandatory injunction was obtained directing the corporation and two named
officersto file specified reports within 15 days of the date of the decree.
The court further enjoined the defendants from failing to file or cause
to be filed future reports which would become due. When the defendants failed to comply with the terms of the mandatory injunction the
Commission filed a Petition for Adjudication of Civil Contempt. Pursuant thereto and with defendants' consent, an order was entered providing that the corporation and the officers "shall be in civil contempt
of court" unless the required certified financial statements were filed
by a specified day.
In Securities and Eechanqe Commission: v. Higashi, 21 the United
States District Court for the District of Hawaii held, in a subpoena
enforcement action, that the sequestration provisions of Rule 7 (b) of
the Commission's Rules Relating to Investigations could not be applied
to prevent a director of a corporation which was the subject of the
Commission's investigation from being represented by the same counsel
as that for the corporation. The Commission has appealed to the

is now pending.

CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

The statutes administered by the Commission provide that the Commission may transmit evidence of violations of any provisions of these
statutes to the Attorney General, who in turn may institute criminal
proceedings. Where facts ascertained as a result of an investigation by
a regional officeof the Commission or at times its headquarters office
appear to warrant criminal prosecution, a detailed report is prepared.
After careful review by the General Counsel's Office,the recommendations of the regional office and the General Counsel's Office are considered by the Commission, and if the Commission believes criminal
prosecution is appropriate the case is referred to the Attorney General
and to the appropriate U.S. attorney. Commission employees familiar
with the case generally assist the U.S. attorney in the presentation of
the facts to the grand jury, the preparation of legal memoranda for
use in the trial, the conduct of the trial, and the preparation of briefs
on appeal.
During the past fiscal year 52 cases were referred to the Department
of Justice for prosecution." As a result of these and prior referrals,
34 indictments were returned against 208 defendants. The year also
saw 106 convictions in 35 cases and the affirmance of 9 cases. Appeals
were still pending in 12 other criminal cases at the close of the year.
Of 9 defendants involved in 6 criminal contempt cases handled during
the year, 1 was convicted, and 5 cases involving 8 defendants are still
pending. From 1934, when the Commission was established, until
June 30,1965,3,616 defendants have been indicted in the U.S. district
courts in 845 cases developed by the Commission and 1,880 convictions
have been obtained."
As in prior years, the majority of the criminal cases prosecuted
involved the offer and sale of securities by fraudulent representations,
and other fraudulent practices. It is obviously not feasible to describe
individually each of the many criminal matters pending during the
fiscal year; only a few of the more noteworthy ones can be singled
out for discussion.
The substantial sentences imposed in two criminal prosecutions involving violations of the registration provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933 are significant. On September 17, 1964, Joseph Abrams,
who had been found guilty by a jury of violating those provisions
by offering and selling the unregistered stock of Automatic 1Vasher
Company, was sentenced to a prison term of 5 years. On February 16, 1965, Sidney Albert, who had been convicted of the same
charges, was sentenced to 3 years in prison. Abrams and Albert have
appealed; these appeals are presently pending in the Court of ApThis figure includes three criminal contempt actions .

peals for the Second Circuit. Their convictions and the substantial
sentences imposed on them should serve as a warning to unscrupulous
promoters that they can not evade the registration requirements of
the Securities Act by spurious reliance on exemptions from those
requirements, and thereby deprive the investing public of full disclosure concerning the affairs of the issuer and its management.
The conviction of John C. Doyle of delivering unregistered securities of Canadian Javelin, Inc. to the public after sale is also significant. Doyle and three other defendants had been indicted in July
1962, for violating and conspiring to violate the registration and
anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act in connection with the offer
and sale of Canadian Javelin. The indictment was initially sealed
because two defendants were outside the United States and it was
feared that disclosure of the indictment would prevent their return.
In August 1962, Doyle represented to the Department of Justice that
he had a commitment from an agent of the Oommission that he would
not be prosecuted. The Department of Justice rejected the claim
and the indictment was made public in August 1963.
Thereafter all the defendants moved to dismiss the indictment,
claiming that the prosecution was barred by the 5-year statute of limitations and that they had been denied the right to a speedy trial
because of the delay in making the indictment public. The district
court dismissed the indictment as to the three other defendants because
of unnecessary post-indictment delay, but denied Doyle's motion because "the continued sealing was materially contributed to and caused
by [Doyle's] own efforts."
On February 3, 1965, in the midst of a hearing, Doyle abandoned
his commitment claim and pleaded guilty to a violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act. He was later sentenced to
3 years imprisonment, with execution suspended as to 33 months, and
was fined $5,000. In imposing sentence the district court referred
to a massive distribution of unregistered stock and said: "It is not
a question of 50 shares of stock alone the court has considered. The
lack of registration is the important and paramount factor."
Doyle appealed his sentence to the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit which affirmed the judgment and sentence saying: "Although
Doyle's trial counsel chose to call the failure to register a technical
violation, counsel can hardly be unaware of the close connection between a wilful failure to register securities and their fraudulent
sale.... " 2i The court emphasized that the prison sentence "must
be conceded to be modest compared with the 5 year maximum allowed
by 15 U.S.C. ~
77x." The court of appeals further ordered its mandate to issue in 5 days because "sentence has already been too long

delayed." On July 12, 1965, Justice Harlan denied Doyle's application for bail pending his petition for certiorari.
On July 15, 1965,
Doyle fled to Canada to avoid serving the prison sentence.
In April 1965, Paul R. Oasavina and Horace J. Parisi were convicted in the United States District Court for New Jersey of violating Sections 5 and 17 of the Securities Act and the Mail Fraud Statute.
Casavina was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment and Parisi received
a suspended sentence and was placed on probation for 2 years. Evidence adduced during the trial showed that in excess of 600,000 shares
of stock of Casavan Industries, Iric., a corporation controlled by
Oasavina, were sold by or through him by means of false and fraudulent representations.
To justify the issuance of stock to Casavina and
also to increase Casavan's purported assets from $100,000 to approximately $5 million, Casavina caused the corporation to acquire assets
of little or no value from a number of other corporations.
In this
manner over 1.5 million shares of Casavan stock were issued, Casavina
receiving more than 1 million of these shares, for which he paid no
consideration.
During the fiscal year, 17 convictions were affirmed by appellate
courts in 9 cases. In United States v, McDaniel,25 the conviction of
Paul E. McDaniel was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit. McDaniel was convicted in 1963 for violating and 'conspiring to violate the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act in connection with the offer and sale of the stock of Ambrosia
Minerals, Inc. Together with George A. Mellon (presently a fugitive), he had arranged to have the stock of Ambrosia listed on the
San Francisco Mining Exchange and had caused large blocks to be
issued in the names of nominees. McDaniel and Mellon had manipulated the price of the stock on the exchange so that it rose from $1
to over $6 per share and had then proceeded to distribute approximately $1 million worth of stock in the over-the-counter market
during 1956 and 1957. They had not only issued false and misleading
information to the public and :filed false and misleading materials
with the exchange and the Commission, but had also caused Ambrosia
to pay two dividends in late 1956 and early 1957, although it never
had any earnings. McDaniel was sentenced to serve 18 months in
prison and to pay a :fine of $14,100.
On appeal McDaniel contended that he was not shown to have used
the mails and thac the mails were not used until after the sales had
been made. In passing on this contention the court said:

"It may not have been clearly shown that appellant knew that
the confirmations and stock certificates were to be mailed. but
the mailings were such an integral part of the transactions that
.. 343 F. 2d 785 (a.A. 5, 1965).

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the use of the mails for the delivery should have been foreseen
and contemplated. The evil at which the Securities Act is directed is the fraud in the sale of securities. . .. In other words, a
scheme to defraud in relation to a sale of securities and the use
of the mails in consummation thereof is the gist of the crime.
The use of the mails need not be central to the scheme to defraud."
The court further stated that:
"[i]t matters not whether McDaniel himself did the mailing; the
use of the mails by his broker must have been fully contemplated
by him and attributed to him."
On October 27,1964, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
affirmed the convictions of Walter E. Herr and William Gillentine for
violating the Securities Act and the Mail Fraud Statute.26 The defendants made fraudulent sales of "inactive" distributorships to some
72 investors from March 1960, through February 1961. American
Sales Training Research Association, Inc., of which the defendants
were the promoters, was allegedly in the business of selling sales training material such as phonograph records, projectors and film. The
defendants represented to investors that they could become "inactive"
distributors by purchasing sales training material which, in turn,
would be disposed of by a sales force maintained by the corporation.
After a deduction for expenses, the "inactive" distributors were to
receive the remaining profits, which the defendants represented to
be as high as 6 percent a month.
On appeal the defendants contended that the distributorships were
not "securities" within the meaning of the 1933 Act, and that only
sales of merchandise were involved. In rejecting this contention,
the court said:
"we construe it to be an investment contract. . .. [T]he facts
here show that it was not the intention of either the defendants
or the investors that the latter, themselves, were to actually
resell the merchandise. . .. They [the investors] were led to
believe that they could expect profits solely from the efforts of
others."
Shortly after the close of the fiscal year the Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit affirmed the convictions of Roy B. Kelly and
Cecil Y. Hagen for violating and conspiring to violate the anti-fraud
and registration provisions of the Securities Act and the Mail Fraud
Statute in connection with the offer and sale to the public of Gulf
Coast Leaseholds, Inc. stock, as well as conspiring to commit fraud
upon the Commission in its function of protecting the investing

public." Kelly and Hagen had each been sentenced to 3 years in
prison. The court, however, reversed the conviction of Milton J.
Shuck. At the outset of its opinion the court noted:

"It is a sad commentary upon the morals of our stock market
places in general, and the over-the-counter market in particular,
that at this late date in the history of federal securities regulation
we are called upon once again to 'memorialize the rapacity of the
perpetrators and gullibility, and perhaps also the cupidity of
the victims'."
In a lengthy statement of facts the court noted that the Commission's insistence on full and accurate disclosure prevented Gulf Coast
Leaseholds from obtaining a listing on the American Stock Exchange
after the Board of Governors of that Exchange had approved the
listing and certified such action to the Commission. Noting the impact on the market of the false information about the company
disseminated by the conspirators, the court said:
"But not even this stream of false information could budge the
SEC into approving Gulf Coast's application for listing on the
American Stock Exchange."
The court also complimented the prosecution team, which included
Commission personnel, for its handling of the case.
COMPLAINTS

AND INVESTIGATIONS

Each of the Acts administered by the Commission specifically
authorizes investigations to determine whether violations of the Federal securities laws have occurred.
The nine regional officesof the Commission, with the assistance of
their respective branch offices,are chiefly responsible for the conduct
of investigations. In addition, the Office of Enforcement of the Division of Trading and Markets of the Commission's headquarters
office conducts investigations dealing with matters of particular
interest or urgency, either independently or assisting the regional
offices. The Office of Enforcement also exercises general supervision
over and coordinates the investigative activities of the regional offices
and recommends appropriate action to the Commission.
There are availa:ble to the Commission several sources of information concerning possible violations of the provisions of the Federal
securities laws. The primary source of information is complaints by
members of the general public concerning the activities of certain
persons in securities transactions,
The Division of Trading and
1I1 United States
v. Kelly, et at; 349 F.2d 720 (1965). See the 30th Annual
Report, pp. 133--134,for further details regarding the violations involved and
the mammoth nature of the case.

136

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Markets and the regional offices give careful consideration to such
complaints and, if it appears that violations of the Federal securities
laws may have occurred, an investigation is commenced. Other
sources of information which are of assistance to the Commission in
carrying out its enforcement responsibilities are the national securities
exchanges, the N ational Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
brokerage firms, state and Canadian securities authorities, better
business bureaus, and various law enforcement agencies.
It is the Commission's general policy to conduct its investigations on
a confidential basis. Such a policy is necessary to effective law enforcement and to protect persons against whom unfounded or unconfirmed charges might be made. The Commission investigates many
complaints where no violation is ultimately found to have occurred.
To conduct such investigations publicly would ordinarily result in
hardship or embarrassment to many interested persons and might
affect the market for the securities in question, resulting in injury to
investors with no countervailing public benefits. Moreover, members
of the public would tend to be reluctant to furnish information concerning violations if they thought their personal affairs would be made
public. Another advantage of confidential investigations is that persons suspected of violations are not made aware that their activities are
under surveillance, since such awareness might result in frustration or
obstruction of the investigation.
Accordingly, the Commission does
not generally divulge the result of a non-public investigation unless it
is made a matter of public record in proceedings brought before the
Commission or in the courts.
When it appears that a serious violation of the Federal securities
laws has occurred or is occurring, a "case" is opened and a full investigation is conducted. Under certain circumstances it becomes necessary for the Commission to issue a formal order of investigation which
appoints members of its staff as officers to issue subpoenas, to take
testimony under oath and to require the production of documents.
Usually this procedure is resorted to only when the subjects of the investigation and others involved are uncooperative and it becomes
necessary to invoke the subpoena power to complete the investigation.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1965, the following formal
orders were issued by the Commission upon recommendation of the
staff divisions indicated:

When an investigation has reached the stage at which enforcement
action appears appropriate, the Commission may proceed in one of
several ways, although the use of one procedure may not necessarily
preclude the use of another. The Commission may: (1) refer the case

to the Department of Justice or appropriate local enforcement authorities for criminal prosecution, (2) institute through its own staff, in the
appropriate U.S. district court, civil proceedings for injunctive relief
to halt further violations of law, and, (3) institute administrative proceedings if the case is one where it has the power to do so.

activities of the Commission during fiscal 1965:

ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS WITH RESPECf TO FOREIGN
SECURITIES

The unlawful offer and sale of Canadian securities in the United
States remained at a fairly low level in fiscal 1965. The cooperation of
Canadian officials and segments of the Canadian securities industry
with the Commission has been very good. The Commission assisted
the Ontario Royal Commission on Windfall Oils and Mines Limited
in its exhaustive investigation into the wild gyrations of Windfall
shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
The most serious foreign securities problem confronting the Commission continues to 'be the increase in fraudulent promotions from
countries other than Canada, particularly the Bahamas. In dealing
with many of these promotions, the Commission is experiencing considerable success with the new, simplified procedures for obtaining
foreign postal fraud orders, with the continuing cooperation of the
Post Office Department. In addition to obtaining injunctive relief
against a Bahamian bank, the Commission issued a public warning
release in June of 1965, concerning the public offering of unregistered
time deposit certificates and other securities by various organizations
holding bank charters in the Bahamas. Although the named organizations designate themselves as "banks", they do not carry on normal
banking operations. In its warning release, the Commission pointed
out that these so-called "banks" should not be confused with the recognized banks and .financial institutions conducting business in the
Bahamas."

securities the Commission had reason to believe were being, or recently
had been, distributed in the United States in violation of the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Seven supplements
to the list were issued. In line with the trend of the past few years,
it was necessary to add only 4 names to the list during the year, compared with 2 in fiscal 1964,7 in fiscal 1963, 9 in fiscal 1962,47 in fiscal
1961 and 82 in fiscal 1960. A total of 36 names was deleted following
compliance with established procedures. As of June 30, 1965, 107
companies were on the list, the smallest number since the list was
established in 1951.
Following the end of the fiscal year, the Commission announced the
issuance of a revised list, to be known as the "Foreign Restricted List,"
replacing the Canadian Restricted List. 29 The new list will include
the names not only of Canadian issuers but also those of other
countries whose securities may be the subject of unlawful distributions
in this country. As before, the current list and supplements thereto
will be issued to and published by the press, and copies will be mailed
to all registered broker-dealers and be made available to the public.
As a practical matter, most United States broker-dealers refuse to
execute transactions in securities on the restricted list.
As of September 23, 1965,the list contained the names of 56 Canadian
companies (representing the addition of 1 company and the deletion of
52 others) and 13 Bahamian organizations, as follows:

SECTION OF SECURITIES VIOLATIONS

A Section of Securities Violations is maintained by the Commission
as a part of its enforcement program to provide a further means of
detecting and preventing fraud in securities transactions. The Section maintains files which provide a clearinghouse for other enforcement agencies for information concerning persons who have been
charged with or found in violation of various Federal and state securities statutes. Considerable information is also available concerning
violators resident in the Provinces of Canada. The specialized information in these files is kept current through the cooperation of various
governmental and non-governmental agencies. At the end of the fiscal
year, the files contained information concerning 71,488 persons and
firms. Included in the data processed by the Section during the year
was information received from several states, Canada and Puerto Rico
respecting 134 criminal actions, 55 injunctive actions, 238 cease and
desist type orders and 68 other administrative orders, such as denials,
suspensions and revocations.
Altogether during the fiscal year, the Section received and disposed
of 4,206 "securities violations" letters and dispatched 835 communications to cooperating agencies. It added to the Commission's files information respecting 6,853 persons or firms, including information on
2,632 persons or firms not previously identified, and deleted the
names of 2,884 persons or firms as to whom information was believed
to be obsolete,

COMMISSION

FOR NONDISCLOSURE

OF INFORMATION

The Commission is authorized under the various Acts administered
by it to grant requests for nondisclosure of certain types of information which would otherwise be disclosed to the public in applications,
reports or other documents filed pursuant to these statutes. Thus,
under paragraph (30) of Schedule A of the Securities Act of 1933,
disclosure of any portion of a material contract is not required if the
Commission determines that such disclosure would impair the value of
the contract and is not necessary for the protection of investors. Under
Section 24 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trade secrets or
processes need not be disclosed in any material filed with the Commission. Under Section 24(b) of that Act, written objection to public
disclosure of information contained in any material filed with the
Commission may be made to the Commission which is then authorized
to make public disclosure of such information only if in its judgment
such disclosure is in the public interest. Similar provisions are contained in Section 22 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 and in Section 45 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. These
statutory provisions have been implemented by rules specifying the
procedure to be followed by applicants for a determination that public
disclosure is not necessary in a particular case.
The number of applications granted, denied or otherwise acted upon
during the year are set forth in the following table:

AND AUDITING

The several Acts administered by the Commission recognize the
importance of dependable informative financial statements which disclose the financial status and earnings history of a corporation or other
commercial entity. These statements, whether filed in compliance with
the requirements under those statutes or included in other material
available to stockholders or prospective investors, are indispensable to
investors as a basis for investment decisions. The Congress, cognizant
of the fact that such statements lend themselves readily to misleading
inferences or even deception, whether or not intended, included express
provisions in the various Acts with respect to financial information

THIRTY-FIRST

required to be disclosed. Thus, for example, the Securities Act requires the inclusion in the prospectus of balance sheets and profit and
loss statements "in such form as the Commission shall prescribe" 80and
authorizes the Commission to prescribe the "items or details to be
shown in the balance sheet and earnings statement, and the methods
" 81 Similar auto be followed in the preparation of accounts ....
thority is contained in the Securities Exchange Act,82 and even more
comprehensive power is embodied in the Investment Company Act 88
and the Public Utility Holding Company Act.84
Pursuant to the broad rulemaking power thus conferred with respect
to the preparation and presentation of financial statements, the Commission has prescribed uniform systems of accounts for companies
subject to the Holding Company Act; 85has adopted rules under the
Securities Exchange Act governing accounting for and auditing of
securities brokers and dealers; 86and has promulgated rules contained
in a single comprehensive regulation, identified as Regulation S-X,81
which governs the form and content of financial statements filed in
compliance with the several Acts. This regulation is supplemented
by the Commission's Accounting Series Releases, of which 101 have
so far been issued." These releases were inaugurated in 1937 and
were designed as a program for making public from time to time opinions on accounting principles for the purpose of contributing to the
development of uniform standards and practice in major accounting
questions. The rules and regulations thus established, except for the
uniform systems of accounts which are regulatory reports, prescribe
accounting principles to be followed only in certain limited areas. In
the large area of financial reporting not covered by such rules, the

ment is by requiring a certificate of an independent public accountant,
based on an audit performed in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards, which expresses an opinion as to whether the financial statements are presented fairly in conformity with accounting
principles and practices which are recognized as sound and which have
attained general acceptance.
The Securities Act provides that the financial statements required
to be made available to the public through filing with the Commission
shall be certified by "an independent public or certified accountant." 89
The other three statutes permit the Commission to require that such
statements be accompanied by a certificate of an independent public
accountant," and the Commission's rules require, with minor exceptions, that they be so certified. The value of certification by qualified
accountants has been conceded for many years, but the requirement as
to independence, long recognized and adhered to by some individual
accountants, was for the first time authoritatively and explicitly introduced into law in 1933. Under the Commission's rules, an accountant
who is qualified to practice in his own state is qualified to practice before the Commission unless he has entered into disqualifying relationships with a particular client, such as becoming a promoter,
underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer, employee, Or stockholder; 41 has demonstrated incompetence or subservience to management; or has engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct."
The Commission endeavors to encourage and foster the independence
of the accountant in his relationships with his client so that he may
better be able to perform the service to the public contemplated by the
Congress in the various Acts administered by the Commission. Because of his special status and responsibility, the accountant has a
unique opportunity to be a leader in raising standards of investor protection. The financial statements provide the key information both
in the distribution and trading of securities. The work of the accountant in their preparation and publication is vital. Independent
accountants lend authority to management's representations by their
opinions as experts, and they operate as a check on management in
assuring that the financial data are fairly presented in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.
The Commission is vigilant in its efforts to assure itself that the
audits which it requires are performed by independent accountants;
that the information contained in the financial reports represents full

and fair disclosure; and that appropriate auditing and accounting
practices and standards have been followed in their preparation. In
addition, it recognizes that changes and new developments in financial
and economic conditions affect the operations and financial status of
the several thousand commercial and industrial companies required
to file statements with the Commission and that accounting and auditing procedures cannot remain static and continue to serve well a dynamic economy. The Commission's accounting staff, therefore, studies
the changes and new developments for the purpose of establishing and
maintaining appropriate accounting and auditing policies, procedures
and practices for the protection of investors. The primary responsibility for this program rests with the Chief Accountant of the Commission, who has general supervision with respect to accounting and
auditing policies and their application.
Progress in these activities requires continuing contact and consultation between the staff and accountants both individually and through
such representative groups as, among others, the American Accounting
Association, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
the American Petroleum Institute, the Financial Analysts Federation,
the Financial Executives Institute, and the National Association of
Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, as well as many Government
agencies. Recognizing the importance of cooperation in the formulation of accounting principles and practices, adequate disclosure and
auditing procedures which will best serve the interests of investors, the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Analysts Federation, and the Financial Executives Institute appoint
committees which maintain liaison with the Commission's staff.
The Commission on its part authorized its Chief Accountant to continue to serve during the year as a member of an advisory committee to
the Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. This committee served as adviser to the
Institute's Director of Research while he was engaged in making an
inventory of generally accepted accounting principles and practices
recognized by the accounting profession and currently in use. The
results or this work, which will be useful to laymen as well as to
accountants, can be found in an accounting research study published
by the Institute entitled "Inventory of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles for Business Enterprises," by Paul Grady.
In addition to this formal participation the Chief Accountant's
Officehas furnished suggestions to the Institute's Director of Research
and to the Accounting Principles Board who are now revising and
bringing up to date prior pronouncements made by the Institute's
Committee on Accounting Procedure and preparing for publication
opinions of the Accounting Principles Board. These opinions are

144

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

based on studies made by the research staff of the Institute and by other
persons selected to make the required studies.
The many daily decisions to be made which require the attention of
members of the Chief Accountant's staff include questions raised by the
operating divisions of the Commission, the regional offices, and the
Commission itself. As a result of this day-to-day activity and the need
to keep abreast of current accounting problems, the Chief Accountant's
staff continually reexamines accounting and auditing principles and
practices. From time to time members of the staff are called upon to
assist in field investigations, to participate in hearings and to review
Commission opinions insofar as they pertain to accounting matters.
Prefiling and other conferences with officials of corporations, practicing accountants and others are also an important part of the work
of the staff. Resolution of questions and problems in this manner saves
registrants and their representatives both time and expense. The 1964
amendments to the securities acts bring into contact with the Commission many heretofore "unregulated" companies. In many cases, the
independent accountant has been a primary bridge between the issuer
and the Commission. Registrants falling into this category and the
accountants who will certify the financial statements for them have
been assisted by members of the Commission and its staff who have
lectured and participated in institutes and symposiums sponsored by
various groups in different parts of the country, where the provisions
of the 1964 amendments were explained.
Many specific accounting and auditing problems are found in the
examination of financial statements required to be filed with the Commission. Where examination reveals that the rules and regulations of
the Commission have not been complied with or that applicable generally accepted accounting principles have not been adhered to, the
examining division usually notifies the registrant by an informal
letter of comment. These letters of comment and the correspondence
or conferences that follow continue to be a most convenient and satisfactory method of effecting corrections and improvements in financial
statements, both to registrants and to the Commission's staff. Where
particularly difficult or novel questions arise which cannot be settled
by the accounting staff of the divisions and by the Chief Accountant,
they are referred to the Commission for consideration and decision.
The staff of the Chief Accountant's Office and the staff of the Office
of Policy Research conferred several times during fiscal 1965 with
representatives of the New York Stock Exchange and its accounting
consultants, Price Waterhouse & Co., for the purpose of implementing
the recommendation set forth in the Special Study with respect to obtaining the necessary information for a clearer understanding of the
Stock Exchange's commission rate structure and level and the odd-lot
differentials.
As a result of these conferences the income and expense

THIRTY-FIRST

145

report developed by the Exchange for the annual reporting of member firms doing a public commission business was modified and expanded, thus becoming a more useful source of information for
additional studies which will be made by the Commission and the Exchange. A financial reporting form comparable to the Exchange's income and expense report was developed for use by the major New
York Stock Exchange odd-lot member firms when filing their annual
reports.
The proposed revision of Form X-17A-5, the annual report of financial condition required to be filed by certain brokers and dealers
pursuant to Section 17 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, mentioned in last year's annual report of the Commission," is progressing through the required rulemaking process. This form and the related minimum audit requirements are being revised to meet changing
conditions and practices in the securities industry.v
The Chief Accountant and his staff cooperated with the staff of the
Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the preparation of rules and regulations under the Securities
Acts Amendments of 1964 which now govern the reports banks are required to file with the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUcrION AND DEVEWPMENT

Section 15 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, as amended, exempts from registration under both the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 securities issued, or guaranteed as
to both principal and interest, by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Bank is required to file with the
Commission such annual and other reports with respect to such
securities as the Commission determines to be appropriate in view of
the special character of the Bank and its operations, and necessary in
the public interest or for the protection of investors. The Commission has, pursuant to the above authority, adopted rules requiring the
Bank to file quarterly reports and also to file copies of each annual report of the Bank to its board of governors. The Bank is also required
to file reports with the Commission in advance of any distribution in
the United States of its primary obligations. The Commission, acting
in consultation with the National Advisory Council on International
Monetary and Financial Problems, is authorized to suspend the exemption at any time as to any or all securities issued or guaranteed
by the Bank during the period of such suspension.

COMMISSION

The Bank reported a net income of $136.9million for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1965. This compared with net income of $97.5 million in the fiscal year 1964. The difference between the two figures results mainly from the fact that since July 1, 1964, the Bank has discontinued treating a portion of loan receipts as commission to be
credited to the Special Reserve and, with a few minor exceptions, all
income Â£rom loans is considered as regular income.
On July 29, 1965, the Executive Directors allocated $61.9 million
from the year's net income to the Supplemental Reserve against
losses on loans and guarantees, increasing it to $667.5 million. This
increased the Bank's total reserves, including the Special Reserve, to
$956.5 million. The Executive Directors recommended to the Board
of Governors that the remaining $75 million of the year's net income
be transferred to the Bank's affiliate, the International Development
Association.
During the year, the Bank made 38 loans totaling $1,023.3million,
compared with a total of $809.9 million last year. The loans were
made in Brazil (2 loans) , Chile, the Republic of China (2 loans) , Finland (2 loans), Gabon, Honduras, India (3 loans), Iran (2 loans),
Italy, Jamaica, Japan (3 loans), Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria,
Paraguay, Peru (2 loans), Philippines (2 loans), Portugal, Rhodesia
and Zambia, Sierra Leone, Spain, Thailand (2 loans), Uruguay,
Venezuela (2 loans) and Yugoslavia. This brought the total number
of loans to 424 in 77 countries and territories and raised the gross total
of commitments to $8,954.6million. By June 30, as a result of cancellations, exchange adjustments, repayments and sales of loans, the
portion of loans signed still retained by the Bank had been reduced to
$5,966.8million.
During the year the Bank sold or agreed to sell $106.2million principal amounts of loans, compared with sales of $173.3 million last
year. On June 30, the total of such sales was $1,884.7 million, of
which all except $69 million had been made without the Bank's
guarantee.
On June 30, the outstanding funded debt of the Bank was $2.724
million, reflecting a net increase of $232.2 million in the past year.
During the year the funded debt was increased through the private
placement of bonds and notes totaling $198 million and DM 400
million (equivalent US$100 million) and the public sale of bonds
as follows: Can$25 million (US$23.1 million), DM 250 million
(US$62.5 million), Sw F 60 million (US$14 million), and US$200
million, of which $17.9 million were sold under delayed delivery arrangements. The debt was decreased through the retirement of bonds
and notes totaling US$248 million, Sw F 33 million (US$7.8 million),
DM 200 million (US$50 million), Can$11.5 million (US$10.6 mil-

to $31.1 million.
During the year eight countries increased their capital subscriptions
to the Bank: the Dominican Republic by $5.3 million, the United
Arab Republic by $35.5 million, Honduras by $2 million, Costa Rica
by $2.'7million, Italy by $306 million, Malaysia by $83.3 million, Panama by $8.6 million and Sudan by $40 million. Thus on June 30,
1965,the subscribed capital of the Bank amounted to $21,669.4million.
INTER-AMERICAN

DEVELOPMENT

BANK

The Inter-American Development Bank Act, which authorizes the
United States to participate in the Inter-American Development Bank,
provides an exemption for certain securities which may be issued by
the Bank similar to that provided for securities of the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Acting pursuant to this
authority, the Commission adopted Regulation lA, which requires the
Bank to file with the Commission substantially the same information,
documents and reports as are required from the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development. The Bank is also required
to file a report with the Commission prior to the sale of any of its
primary obligations to the public in the United States.
During the year ended June 30,1965, the Bank made 26 loans total.
ing the equivalent of $182,806,242from its ordinary capital resources,
bringing the gross total of loan commitments outstanding at June 30,
to 115, aggregating $583,695,165. During the year, the Bank sold or
agreed to sell $4,702,476 in participations in the aforesaid loans, all
of such participations being without the guarantee of the Bank. The
loans from the Bank's ordinary capital resources were made in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.
During the year the Bank also made 1'7loans totaling the equivalent of $65,832,689from its Fund for Special Operations, bringing the
gross total of loan commitments outstanding at June 30, to 56, aggregating $192,354,268. In addition, the Bank made 31 loans aggregating $99,587,000 from the Social Progress Trust Fund, which
it administers under an Agreement with the United States, bringing
the gross total of loan commitments outstanding at June 30, to 112,
aggregating $482,433,534.
On June 30,1965, the outstanding funded debt of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank was the equivalent of $285,093,548, reflecting an increase during the year of the equivalent of $135,900,000.
This increase consisted of two public bond issues, including a $100
million U.S. dollar issue and a German mark issue in the amount of
DM 60 million ($15 million) ; the private placement of an issue in the
United Kingdom in the amount of Â£ 3 million ($8.4 million), and the

borrowing of $12.5 million from an agency of the Government of
Spain.
The subscribed ordinary capital of the Bank on June 30, 1965, was
the equivalent of $1,284,985,000, of which $903,405,000 represented
callable capital.
.
STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES

The work and personnel of the Office of Statistical Studies were
transferred during the past fiscal year, in part to the Officeof Policy
Research and in part to the Officeof Regulation, Division of Trading
and Markets. The regular statistical activities of the Commission and
the overall Government statistical program under the direction of
the Office of Statistical Standards, Bureau of the Budget, have been
continued in these Offices. The statistical series described below are
published in the Commission's monthly Statistical Bulletin. In addition, current figures and analyses of the data are published quarterly
on new securities offerings, individuals' savings, financial position of
corporations, and plant and equipment expenditures.
Issues registered under the Securities Act of 1933

Monthly statistics are compiled on the number and volume of registered securities, classified by industry of issuer, type of security,
and use of proceeds. Summary statistics for the years 1935-65 are
given in Appendix Table 1 and detailed statistics for the fiscal year
1965appear in Appendix Table 2.
New Securities Offerings

Monthly and quarterly data are compiled covering all new corporate
and non-corporate issues offered for cash sale in the United States.
The series includes not only issues publicly offered but also issues privately placed, as well as other issues exempt from registration under
the Securities Act such as intrastate offerings and offerings of railroad securities. The offerings series includes only securities actually
offered for cash sale, and only issues offered for account of issuers.
Estimates of the net cash flow through securities transactions are
prepared quarterly and are derived by deducting from the amount
of estimated gross proceeds received by corporations through the
sale of securities the amount of estimated gross payments by corporations to investors for securities retired. Data on gross issues, retirements and net change in securities outstanding are presented for all
corporations and for the principal industry groups.
Individuals'

Savings

The Commission compiles quarterly estimates of the volume and
composition of individuals' savings in the United States. The series
represents net increases in individuals' financial assets less net increases
in debt. The study shows the aggregate amount of savings and the

THIRTY-FIRST

149

form in which they occurred, such as investment in securities, expansion of bank deposits, increases in insurance and pension reserves, etc. A reconciliation of the Commission's estimates with the
personal savings estimates of the Department of Commerce, derived
in connection with its national income series, is published annually
by the Department of Oommerce as well as in the Securities and
Exchange Commission Statistical Bulletin.
Private Pension Funds

An annual survey is published of private pension plans other than
those administered by insurance companies, showing the flow of money
into these funds, the types of assets in which the funds are invested
and the principal items of income and expenditures. Data on stock
transactions of pension funds and property and casualty insurance
companies are also collected quarterly and it is anticipated that these
will be published in the near future.
Financial Position of Corporations

The series on the working capital position of all United States
corporations, excluding banks, insurance companies and savings and
loan associations, shows the principal components of current assets
and liabilities, and also contains an abbreviated analysis of the sources
and uses of corporate funds.
The Commission, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission, compiles a quarterly financial report of all United States manufacturing
concerns. This report gives complete balance sheet data and an
abbreviated income account, data being classified by industry and size
of company.
Plant and Equipment Expenditures

The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce, conducts quarterly and annual surveys of actual and anticipated plant
and equipment expenditures of all United States business, exclusive
of agriculture. After the close of each quarter, data are released
on actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated expenditures for the next two quarters. In addition, a survey is made at the
beginning of each year of the plans for business expansion during
that year.
Directory of Registered Companies

The Commission annually publishes a listing of companies required
to file annual reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In
addition to an alphabetical listing, there is a listing of companies by

The Commission regularly compiles statistics on the market value
and volume of sales on registered and exempted securities exchanges,

150

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COM:MlSSION

round-lot stock transactions on the New York exchanges for account
of members and non-members, odd-lot stock transactions on the New
York exchanges and block distributions of exchange stocks. Publication of odd-lot transactions in 75 selected stocks on the New York
Stock Exchange was begun in the fall of 1964. Since January 1965,
the Commission has also been compiling statistics on volume of overthe-counter trading in common stocks listed on national securities
exchanges based on reports filed under Rule 17a-9 of the Securities
Exchange Act dealing with the "third market."
Data on round-lot and odd-lot trading on the New York exchanges
are released weekly. The other stock market data mentioned above,
as well as these weekly series, are published regularly in the Commission's Statistical Bulletin.
OPINIONS OF THE COMMISSION

Formal administrative proceedings under the statutes administered
by the Commission generally culminate in the issuance of an opinion
and order. Under a procedure adopted during the 1964 fiscal year,
applicable to proceedings initiated on or after August 1, 1964, a hearing officer makes an initial decision following a hearing at which he
has presided, unless such decision is waived by the parties. If Commission review is not sought, and if the case is not called up for review
on the Commission's own initiative, the initial decision becomes final
and an order pursuant to it is issued by the Commission.
In those instances where it prepares its own decision, upon review
or waiver of an initial decision or where the record has been stipulated
by the parties, the Commission, or the individual Commissioner to
whom a case may be assigned for the preparation of an opinion, is
generally assisted by the Office of Opinions and Review. This Office
is directly responsible to the Commission and is completely independent of the operating divisions of the Commission, consistent with the
principle of separation of functions embodied in the Administrative
Procedure Act. Where the parties to a proceeding waive their right
to such separation, the operating division which participated in the
proceeding may assist in the drafting of the Commission's decision.
The Commission's opinions are publicly released and are distributed
to the press and to persons on the Commission's mailing list. In addition, they are printed and published periodically by the Government
Printing Office in bound volumes entitled "Securities and Exchange
Commission Decisions and Reports."
DISSEMINATION

OF INFORMATION

As the discussion in prior sections of this Report has shown, most
large corporations in which there is a substantial investor interest
now have registration applications or statements on file with the Commission and are required to file annual and other periodic reports with

THIRTY-FIRST

ANNUAL REPORT

151

it. Much of the vital financial and other information included in these
documents receives widespread dissemination through the medium
of securities manuals and other financial publications and thus becomes
available to public investors, broker-dealer and investment adviser
firms, trust departments and other financial institutions.
Various activities of the Commission serve to facilitate public dissemination of corporate and other information. .Among these is the
publication of a daily "News Digest" which contains a resume of each
proposal for the public offering of securities for which a registration
statement is filed. The News Digest also lists new registrations by
companies as well as filings of interim reports reflecting significant corporate developments. In addition, it includes an informative discussion of all important orders of the Commission and of each decision
issued or rule adopted by the Commission, as well as a brief report on
court actions which are part of the Commission's law enforcement
program. Thus, over 1,200 registration statements, 875 orders, decisions and rules, and 288 court enforcement actions were reported in
the News Digest during the year.
The News Digest is made immediately available to the press, and it
is also reprinted and distributed by the Government Printing Office,
on a subscription basis, to some 2,500 investors, securities firms, practicing lawyers and others. In addition, the Commission maintains
mailing lists for the distribution of the full text of its orders, decisions,
rules and rule proposals.
During the year, individual members of the Commission and numerous staff officers addressed various professional, business and other
groups and participated in panel discussions of the laws administered
by the Commission, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the policies, procedures and practices of the Commission. These speeches and
discussions are helpful in promoting a better understanding of the
functions and activities of the Commission and thus facilitating compliance with the laws and rules. In addition, they stimulate public
discussion of ways and means of improving the administrative process.
Infonnation

Available {or Public Inspection

The many thousands of registration statements, applications, declarations and annual and other periodic reports filed with the Commission each year are available for public inspection at the Commission's
principal office in Washington, D.C. In addition, copies of recent
reports filed by companies having securities listed on exchanges other
than the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock
Exchange, and copies of current reports of many non-listed companies
which have registered securities for public offering under the Securities Act, may be examined in the Commission's New York Regional
Office. Recent reports filed by companies whose securities are listed

152

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

on the New York and American Stock Exchanges may be examined
in the Commission's Chicago Regional Office. Moreover, there are
available for examination in all regional offices copies of prospectuses
relating to recent public offerings of securities registered under the
Securities Act; and all regional offices have copies of broker-dealer
annual financial reports and Regulation A letters of notification filed
in their respective regions.
Reports of companies whose securities are listed on the various
exchanges may be seen at the respective exchange offices. In addition,
the registration statements filed pursuant to the new Section 12(g)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available for public
inspection in the principal office in Washington, D.C., the New York,
Chicago and San Francisco Regional Offices, and the regional office
nearest the home address of the registrant.
In order to facilitate wider dissemination of financial and other
information contained in corporate reports filed with the Commission
under the Federal securities laws (an objective strongly urged by
the Special Study Report), the Commission has arranged to take
standing orders, on an experimental basis, for photocopies of annual
reports filed on Form 10-K. This service may be extended later to
other reports, depending upon public reception and the experience
gained in supplying copies of annual reports.
Under the existing contract with a printing company for the reproduction of material in the Commission's public files in response to
requests of members of the public, photocopies may be obtained at
a cost of 7.6 cents per page for pages not exceeding 8~" x 14" in size.
The detailed per page prices are given in Release No. 34-7640, which
may be obtained from the Publications Unit of the Commission.
The charge for each certification of any document by the Commission
is $2.
In order to make corporate reports more readily available for
examination by interested members of the public, the Commission
has also made arrangements for the Form 10-K annual reports and
Form 10 registration statements to be placed on open shelves in the
public area of its Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C., thus
making these reports available for immediate inspection. There are
presently four coin-operated photocopiers in the Public Reference
Room to enable visitors to make immediate reproductions of reports
at a cost of 25 cents per page. (The New York Regional Officehas
a similar machine.)
Each year many thousands of requests for photocopies of and information from the public files of the Commission are received in the
Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. During the year 5,472

TEITRTY-TIRST ANNUAL

REPORT

153

persons examined material on file in the Washington, D.C. office, and
several thousand others examined files in the New York and Chicago
regional offices. More than 15,900 searches were made for individuals
requesting information and approximately 2,134 letters were written
with respect to information required.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

ORGANIZATION

During the fiscal year certain organizational changes were effected
in accordance with the Commission's policy of continuing review of its
organization and functional alignments:
Reference has already been made to the reallocation of certain
functions relating to investment companies from the Division of Corporation Finance to the Division of Corporate Regulation.
The
change was designed to concentrate responsibility in the latter division
for administration of the securities laws as they apply to investment
companies, and to ena:ble the Division of Corporation Finance better to
assume and discharge its increased responsibilities under the Securities Acts Amendments of 1964. In related action, two new branches
and an Assistant Director were added to the Division of Corporate
Regulation to assist in handling the increased duties resulting from
the assumption of its additional functions and from the increased
responsibilities in recent years in administering the regulatory provisions of the Investment Company Act.
In addition, several new branches were created in the Division of
Trading and Markets, and certain statistical activities were transferred from that Division to the Office of Policy Research.
PERSONNEL AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

An important development in the Commission's personnel management program in fiscal 1965 was the adoption of a Management Intern
Program under a formal training agreement approved by the Civil
Service Commission. The main objective of this program is to recruit
and train persons of proven ability and high potential for top level
supervisory and administrative positions.
Candidates are selected from lists of eligibles established by the
Civil Service Commission as a result of the written and oral Management Intern Examination.
The academic training and backgrounds
of persons chosen vary according to the long-range needs of the Commission and include law, finance and other disciplines in addition to
public administration.
The first intern under this new program was appointed on Ap:ril12,
1965. Following 12 to 15 months of specialized management training, he will be assigned to one of the operating divisions of the
Commission.
During fiscal 1965, within-grade salary increases in recognition of
high quality performance were granted to 92 employees. These
awards are authorized by Section 702 of the Classification Act of 1949,
as amended by the Salary Reform Act of 1962. Also during fiscal
1965, cash awards totaling $960 were made to 18 employees for adopted
suggestions, and cash awards for superior performance amounting
to $4,000 were presented to 24 employees.

NEW BUILDING AND ELECTRONIC DATA.PROCESSING EQUIPMENT

In the Commission's budget for fiscal 1966 the Congress appropriated funds for relocation of officesin Washington, D.C. Shortly after
the end of the 1965 fiscal year, the General Services Administration
signed a lease for a new eight story officebuilding on North Capitol
Street, a location near Union Station and easily accessible to the public. This building will house all of the Commission's Washington
activities, including the Washington Regional Office.
After the relocation of offices,a computer system and related equipment will be installed in the new building. This electronic dataprocessing equipment will initially be used for record keeping and
agency administrative functions. Later, it will also be employed in
the Commission's regulatory work, including economic studies and
surveillance of the markets.

I The flures gIven for each year reflect actions
taken and the status of cases as of the end of the most recent fiscal year with respect to cases referred to the Department
of Justice during the year specified.
For
example, convictions obtained in fiscal 1005 with respect to cases referred durmg fiscal 1964 are included
under fiscal 1964. While the table shows only 3 convtcnons under 1965, the total number of convictions
for cases referred during that year and prior years was 106, as noted in tne text of this report â€¢
â€¢ The number of defendants in a case is sometimes increased by the Department
of Justice over the number
against whom prosecution was recommended
by the Commission.
Also more than one indictment
may
result from a single reference .
â€¢ See Table 10 for breakdown of pending cases .
â€¢ Thirty-five
of these references mvolving 116 proposed defendants,
and 18 prior references involving 89
proposed defendants, were still being processed by the Department
of Justice as of the close ofthe fiscal year.
6779 of these cases have been completed as to 1 or more defendants.
Convictions
have been obtained in
629 or 81 percent of such cases. Only 150 or 19 percent of such cases have resulted in acquittals or dlsnussals
as to all defendants; this includes numerous cases in which indtctments were diSIIllSSCd without trial because
of the death of defendants or for other adtnlulstrative
reasous.
See note 5, Infra.
'Includes 80 defendants who dted after mdictment.
