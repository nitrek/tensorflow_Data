In the Matter of
EDGAR R. PAGE and
PAGEONE FINANCIAL INC.

ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
On May 27, 2016, we issued an opinion and order revoking PageOne Financial Inc.’s
(“PageOne’s”) registration; imposing an industry bar on Edgar R. Page, with the right to reapply
in five years; and ordering Page and PageOne (“Respondents”) to pay $2,751,345 in
disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, jointly and severally.1
On June 7, 2016, Respondents moved for a stay of the sanctions and for reconsideration.
We denied the motion for a stay because the pending request for reconsideration rendered our
opinion nonfinal.2 We deny the motion for reconsideration because it reiterates arguments that
Respondents raised—or could have raised—in their briefing on the merits.

Edgar R. Page, Advisers Act Release No. 4400, 2016 WL 3030845 (May 27, 2016).
This sanctions determination was made following the Commission’s finding in a settled order
that PageOne and Page had willfully violated Advisers Act Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207, and
that Page had willfully aided and abetted and caused PageOne’s violations, when they failed to
disclose to their advisory clients a conflict of interest with the manager of funds they had
recommended. Edgar R. Page, Advisers Act Release No. 4044, 2015 WL 1022503 (Mar. 10,
2015). As part of the settlement, the Commission ordered Respondents to cease and desist from
committing or causing violations of those provisions of the Advisers Act; censured them; and
ordered additional proceedings to determine what sanctions were in the public interest. Id.

Reconsideration is an “extraordinary” remedy,3 and such motions are granted only in
exceptional cases.4 It is “designed to correct manifest errors of law or fact or permit the
presentation of newly discovered evidence.”5 A party “may not use a motion for reconsideration
to reiterate arguments previously made or to cite authority previously available, nor may they
advance arguments that they could have made previously but chose not to make.”6
Respondents contend that (1) in revoking PageOne’s registration, we acted inconsistently
with the sanctions imposed in four cases Respondents had previously cited; (2) we
misinterpreted Page’s testimony about the “dangers” of disclosing the conflict of interest, which
he says related to his purported liability under a non-disclosure agreement rather than a
motivation to recruit additional investors; (3) we placed “undue reliance” on Page’s “unrelated”
disciplinary history; (4) we did not take into account the leveraged nature of Page’s luxury
spending in rejecting his claimed inability to pay disgorgement; and (5) we misinterpreted their
argument that payments from the fund manager were meant to “compensat[e] the Respondents
for their lost management fees.”
Respondents raised variants of each of these five arguments in their briefing and at oral
argument.7 We considered each argument, addressed them in our opinion, and will not readdress
them here. Respondents have identified no manifest errors of law or fact in our decision.

For example, PageOne argued that we should not revoke its registration in view of four
cases in which we imposed lesser sanctions. See Opening Br. 4-7; Reply Br. 3-7. We rejected
that argument in our opinion because three of the cases were not precedential and the fourth
involved a smaller amount of ill-gotten gains. See Page, 2016 WL 3030845, at *10. PageOne
contends in the motion for reconsideration that we did not “adequately consider” the cases and
that our reasoning was “fatally flawed.” See Reconsideration Motion 5-7. Neither contention is
an appropriate basis for reconsideration. See FCS Securities, 2011 WL 4448864, at *1 (party
may not use motion for reconsideration to “reiterate arguments previously made”).
In addition, in the briefs on appeal, Page offered two interpretations of his testimony
about the “danger” of disclosing the conflict of interest. He emphasized one in his opening brief,
and the other in his reply brief. See Opening Br. 10; Reply Br. 8. He now reiterates the latter of

Respondents make two additional requests in their motion. First, Respondents ask that
they be permitted to submit “updated financial disclosure forms” that they say would show a
“material worsening of their financial condition and inability to pay” since they filed their
original forms with the law judge in March 2015. A motion for reconsideration is an appropriate
vehicle for submission of new evidence only where “the movant could not have known about or
adduced [the evidence] before entry of the order subject to the motion for reconsideration.”8
Respondents have not made such a showing, or even attempted to explain why they did not
submit these forms earlier;9 we therefore reject Respondents’ request for leave to submit them.
Second, Respondents ask that the effective date of any future Commission orders be
delayed for at least thirty days after issuance to ensure “orderly business operations.” But the
Commission issued its opinion in this matter on May 27, 2016. Respondents have also been
aware since June 8, 2016—when we denied a stay pending reconsideration10—that an order on
their motion would be forthcoming, and that we might deny the motion. This period has been
more than sufficient for Respondents to prepare to wind down PageOne’s business operations.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Edgar R. Page and PageOne Financial Inc.’s motion
for reconsideration is denied.

these. See Reconsideration Motion 7-8. Our opinion’s contrary interpretation of this testimony,
however, rejected both of the interpretations that Page previously offered. See Page, 2016 WL
3030845, at *5 & 13 n.75; cf. Bhatnagar v. Surrendra Overseas Ltd., 52 F.3d 1220, 1231 (3d
Cir. 1995) (party may not use motion for reconsideration to “simply change[] theories and [try]
again,” thus offering a “second bite at the apple”).

Respondents understood the significance and necessity of bringing new evidence to our
attention. On March 14, 2016, they filed a “Notice of Supplemental Developments” consisting
of certain state court pleadings. We took official notice of the pleadings even though
Respondents did not specifically ask us for leave to adduce them as additional evidence under
our Rule of Practice 452. 17 C.F.R. § 201.452; see Page, 2016 WL 3030845, at *12 n.70.
