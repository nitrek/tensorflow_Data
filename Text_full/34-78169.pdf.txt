Issuers are advised that our determination of substantial similarity with respect to each of
these four regimes may be subject to reconsideration if there should be any significant
modifications to those regimes.
The Commission also hereby finds that this determination is in the public interest and
consistent with the protection of investors. Accordingly, it is hereby ordered pursuant to Section
36(a) of the Exchange Act that a resource extraction issuer, as defined in Item 2.01(d) of Form
SD, that files a report complying with the reporting requirements of either the EU Accounting
Directive or the EU Transparency Directive, in each case as implemented in a European Union
or European Economic Area member country, ESTMA, or the USEITI, in accordance with the
requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of Item 2.01(c) of Form SD and the conditions specified
below, will satisfy its disclosure obligations under Rule 13q-1.
Conditions
1. 	 USEITI reports only satisfy a resource extraction issuer’s disclosure obligations under
Item 2.01(a) of Form SD for payments made to the Federal Government.
2. 	 A resource extraction issuer may not follow the USEITI submission deadline to the
extent it differs from the 150 day deadline in General Instruction B.2 of Form SD and
must provide the required payment information on a fiscal year basis.
By the Commission.

Secretary.
