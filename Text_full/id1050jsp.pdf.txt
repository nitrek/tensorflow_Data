In the Matter of
GREAT BASIN GOLD LIMITED

INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
August 23, 2016

APPEARANCE:

David S. Frye for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Jason S. Patil, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registration of Respondent’s registered securities due to
its failure to timely file required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On July 19, 2016, the Commission initiated this proceeding with an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OIP
alleges that Respondent has securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g) and has repeatedly failed to file timely periodic reports with the Commission, in
violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1. Respondent was served with the OIP
on July 25 and its answer was due August 8, 2016. Great Basin Gold Ltd., Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 4045, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2698 (ALJ Aug. 5, 2016). When Respondent failed to file
an answer, I ordered it to show cause by August 19, 2016, why the registration of its securities
should not be revoked by default due to its failure to file an answer or otherwise defend the
proceeding. Great Basin Gold Ltd., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4051, 2016 SEC LEXIS
2735 (ALJ Aug. 9, 2016). To date, Respondent has not filed an answer, responded to the show
cause order, or otherwise defended this proceeding.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Respondent is in default for failing to file an answer or otherwise defend the proceeding.
See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, I find the following allegations
in the OIP to be true. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a).

Great Basin Gold Limited, Central Index Key No. 865492, is a British Columbia
corporation located in Sandton, South Africa, with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 40-F for
the period ended December 31, 2011, which reported a net loss of $17,737,000 Canadian under
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles for the prior year. As of July 14, 2016, the
company’s common shares were traded on the over-the-counter markets.
In addition to its repeated failure to file timely periodic reports, Respondent failed to heed
a delinquency letter sent to it by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance requesting
compliance with its periodic filing obligations.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require issuers of
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current
and accurate information in periodic reports. Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file
annual reports. See 17 C.F.R. § 240.13a-1. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory
and may not be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons.
denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is
not required to establish violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1. See SEC v.
McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C.
1978). Respondent failed to file timely periodic reports and as a result violated Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1.
SANCTION
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
the registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect
investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s
violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved,
the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and
the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Respondent’s failure to file required periodic reports is serious because the failure
constitutes a violation of a central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic
reporting is “to supply investors with current and accurate financial information about an issuer
so that they may make sound [investment] decisions.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., 2006 SEC
LEXIS 1288, at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that Congress fashioned
for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the
sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977). Respondent’s
2

violation is also recurrent in that it repeatedly failed to file periodic reports. See Nature’s
Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21,
2009); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26
(May 23, 2008). Respondent is also culpable because it failed to heed a delinquency letter sent
to it by the Division of Corporation Finance, and was therefore on notice, even before the OIP
issued, of its obligation to file periodic reports. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that revocation may
be warranted even without proof that a respondent was aware of its reporting obligations).
Finally, Respondent has not answered the OIP, responded to the show cause order, or otherwise
participated in the proceeding to address whether it has made any efforts to remedy its past
violations. It has also made no assurances against further violations.
For these reasons, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke
the registration of each class of Respondent’s registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registration of each class of registered securities of Respondent Great Basin Gold Limited is
REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Commission Rule of Practice 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, a
party may file a petition for review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of
the initial decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten
days of the initial decision, pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct
a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a
petition for review from the date of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a
manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion
to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become
final as to that party.
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
