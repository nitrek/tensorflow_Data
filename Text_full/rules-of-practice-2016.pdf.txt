(i) Not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others; or

conduct” under Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) means:
(A) Intentional or knowing conduct, including reckless conduct, that results in a
violation of applicable professional standards; or
(B) Either of the following two types of negligent conduct:

applicable professional standards in circumstances in which an accountant knows, or
should know, that heightened scrutiny is warranted.
(2) Repeated instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a violation of
applicable professional standards, that indicate a lack of competence to practice
before the Commission.
(2) Certain professionals and convicted persons. Any attorney who has been suspended or disbarred
by a court of the United States or of any State; or any person whose license to practice as an
accountant, engineer, or other professional or expert has been revoked or suspended in any
State; or any person who has been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor involving moral
11

turpitude shall be forthwith suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission. A
disbarment, suspension, revocation or conviction within the meaning of this rule shall be
deemed to have occurred when the disbarring, suspending, revoking or convicting agency or
tribunal enters its judgment or order, including a judgment or order on a plea of nolo
contendere, regardless of whether an appeal of such judgment or order is pending or could be
taken.
(3) Temporary suspensions. An order of temporary suspension shall become effective upon
service on the respondent. No order of temporary suspension shall be entered by the
Commission pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this rule more than 90 days after the date on
which the final judgment or order entered in a judicial or administrative proceeding described in
paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) or (e)(3)(i)(B) of this rule has become effective, whether upon completion
of review or appeal procedures or because further review or appeal procedures are no longer
available.
(i) The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary
hearing, may, by order, temporarily suspend from appearing or practicing before it any
attorney, accountant, engineer, or other professional or expert who has been by name:
(A) Permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or
her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and
abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and
regulations thereunder; or
(B) Found by any court of competent jurisdiction in an action brought by the
Commission to which he or she is a party or found by the Commission in any
administrative proceeding to which he or she is a party to have violated (unless the
violation was found not to have been willful) or aided and abetted the violation of any
provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder.
(ii) Any person temporarily suspended from appearing and practicing before the
Commission in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this rule may, within 30 days after
service upon him or her of the order of temporary suspension, petition the Commission to
12

lift the temporary suspension. If no petition has been received by the Commission within 30
days after service of the order, the suspension shall become permanent.
(iii) Within 30 days after the filing of a petition in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of
this rule, the Commission shall either lift the temporary suspension, or set the matter down
for hearing at a time and place designated by the Commission, or both, and, after
opportunity for hearing, may censure the petitioner or disqualify the petitioner from
appearing or practicing before the Commission for a period of time or permanently. In every
case in which the temporary suspension has not been lifted, every hearing held and other
action taken pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3) shall be expedited in accordance with Rule
500. If the hearing is held before a hearing officer, the time limits set forth in Rule 540 will
govern review of the hearing officer's initial decision.
(iv) In any hearing held on a petition filed in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this
rule, the staff of the Commission shall show either that the petitioner has been enjoined as
described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this rule or that the petitioner has been found to have
committed or aided and abetted violations as described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B) of this rule
and that showing, without more, may be the basis for censure or disqualification. Once that
showing has been made, the burden shall be upon the petitioner to show cause why he or
she should not be censured or temporarily or permanently disqualified from appearing and
practicing before the Commission. In any such hearing, the petitioner may not contest any
finding made against him or her or fact admitted by him or her in the judicial or
administrative proceeding upon which the proceeding under this paragraph (e)(3) is
predicated. A person who has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction as described
in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this rule without admitting the facts set forth in the complaint
shall be presumed for all purposes under this paragraph (e)(3) to have been enjoined by
reason of the misconduct alleged in the complaint.
(4) Filing of prior orders. Any person appearing or practicing before the Commission who has
been the subject of an order, judgment, decree, or finding as set forth in paragraph (e)(3) of this
rule shall promptly file with the Secretary a copy thereof (together with any related opinion or
statement of the agency or tribunal involved). Failure to file any such paper, order, judgment,
decree or finding shall not impair the operation of any other provision of this rule.
13

(5) Reinstatement.
(i) An application for reinstatement of a person permanently suspended or disqualified
under paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(3) of this rule may be made at any time, and the applicant may,
in the Commission's discretion, be afforded a hearing; however, the suspension or
disqualification shall continue unless and until the applicant has been reinstated by the
Commission for good cause shown.
(ii) Any person suspended under paragraph (e)(2) of this rule shall be reinstated by the
Commission, upon appropriate application, if all the grounds for application of the
provisions of that paragraph are subsequently removed by a reversal of the conviction or
termination of the suspension, disbarment, or revocation. An application for reinstatement
on any other grounds by any person suspended under paragraph (e)(2) of this rule may be
filed at any time and the applicant shall be accorded an opportunity for a hearing in the
matter; however, such suspension shall continue unless and until the applicant has been
reinstated by order of the Commission for good cause shown.
(6) Other proceedings not precluded. A proceeding brought under paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2) or (e)(3)
of this rule shall not preclude another proceeding brought under these same paragraphs.
(7) Public hearings. All hearings held under this paragraph (e) shall be public unless otherwise
ordered by the Commission on its own motion or after considering the motion of a party.
(f) Practice defined. For the purposes of these Rules of Practice, practicing before the Commission
shall include, but shall not be limited to:
(1) Transacting any business with the Commission; and
(2) The preparation of any statement, opinion or other paper by any attorney, accountant,
engineer or other professional or expert, filed with the Commission in any registration
statement, notification, application, report or other document with the consent of such attorney,
accountant, engineer or other professional or expert.

14

Rule 103. Construction of rules.
(a) The Rules of Practice shall be construed and administered to secure the just, speedy, and
inexpensive determination of every proceeding.
(b) In any particular proceeding, to the extent that there is a conflict between these rules and a
procedural requirement contained in any statute, or any rule or form adopted thereunder, the latter
shall control.
(c) For purposes of these rules:
(1) Any term in the singular includes the plural, and any term in the plural includes the
singular, if such use would be appropriate;
(2) Any use of a masculine, feminine, or neuter gender encompasses such other genders as
would be appropriate; and
(3) Unless the context requires otherwise, counsel for a party may take any action required or
permitted to be taken by such party.
Rule 104. Business hours.
The Headquarters office of the Commission, at 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, is
open each day, except Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays, from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.,

Rule 110. Presiding officer.
All proceedings shall be presided over by the Commission or, if the Commission so orders, by a
hearing officer. When the Commission designates that the hearing officer shall be an administrative
law judge, the Chief Administrative Law Judge shall select, pursuant to 17 CFR 200.30-10, the
administrative law judge to preside.
15

Rule 111. Hearing officer: Authority.
The hearing officer shall have the authority to do all things necessary and appropriate to
discharge his or her duties. No provision of these Rules of Practice shall be construed to limit the
powers of the hearing officer provided by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 556, 557. The
powers of the hearing officer include, but are not limited to, the following:
(a) Administering oaths and affirmations;
(b) Issuing subpoenas authorized by law and revoking, quashing, or modifying any such
subpoena;
(c) Receiving relevant evidence and ruling upon the admission of evidence and offers of proof;
(d) Regulating the course of a proceeding and the conduct of the parties and their counsel;
(e) Holding prehearing and other conferences as set forth in Rule 221 and requiring the
attendance at any such conference of at least one representative of each party who has authority to
negotiate concerning the resolution of issues in controversy;
(f) Recusing himself or herself upon motion made by a party or upon his or her own motion;
(g) Ordering, in his or her discretion, in a proceeding involving more than one respondent, that
the interested division indicate, on the record, at least one day prior to the presentation of any
evidence, each respondent against whom that evidence will be offered;
(h) Subject to any limitations set forth elsewhere in these Rules of Practice, considering and
ruling upon all procedural and other motions, including a motion to correct a manifest error of fact
in the initial decision. A motion to correct is properly filed under this Rule only if the basis for the
motion is a patent misstatement of fact in the initial decision. Any motion to correct must be filed
within ten days of the initial decision. A brief in opposition may be filed within five days of a motion
to correct. The hearing officer shall have 20 days from the date of filing of any brief in opposition
filed to rule on a motion to correct;
(i) Preparing an initial decision as provided in Rule 360;

16

(j) Upon notice to all parties, reopening any hearing prior to the filing of an initial decision
therein, or, if no initial decision is to be filed, prior to the time fixed for the filing of final briefs with
the Commission; and
(k) Informing the parties as to the availability of one or more alternative means of dispute
resolution, and encouraging the use of such methods.
Rule 112. Hearing officer: Disqualification and withdrawal.
(a) Notice of disqualification. At any time a hearing officer believes himself or herself to be
disqualified from considering a matter, the hearing officer shall issue a notice stating that he or she is
withdrawing from the matter and setting forth the reasons therefor.
(b) Motion for withdrawal. Any party who has a reasonable, good faith basis to believe that a
hearing officer has a personal bias, or is otherwise disqualified from hearing a case, may make a
motion to the hearing officer that the hearing officer withdraw. The motion shall be accompanied by
an affidavit setting forth in detail the facts alleged to constitute grounds for disqualification. If the
hearing officer finds himself or herself not disqualified, he or she shall so rule and shall continue to
preside over the proceeding.
Rule 120. Ex parte communications.
(a) Except to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte matters as authorized by law, the
person presiding over an evidentiary hearing may not:
(1) Consult a person or party on a fact in issue, unless on notice and opportunity for all
parties to participate; or
(2) Be responsible to or subject to the supervision or direction of an employee or agent
engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for the Commission.
(b) The Commission's code of behavior regarding ex parte communications between persons
outside the Commission and decisional employees, 17 CFR 200.110 through 200.114, governs other
prohibited communications during a proceeding conducted under the Rules of Practice.

17

Rule 121. Separation of functions.
Any Commission officer, employee or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or
prosecutorial functions for the Commission in a proceeding as defined in Rule 101(a) may not, in
that proceeding or one that is factually related, participate or advise in the decision, or in
Commission review of the decision pursuant to Section 557 of the Administrative Procedure Act,
5 U.S.C. 557, except as a witness or counsel in the proceeding.

or any other person duly authorized by the Commission.
(b) Availability for inspection. Each order and decision shall be available for inspection by the public
from the date of entry, unless the order or decision is nonpublic. A nonpublic order or decision shall
be available for inspection by any person entitled to inspect it from the date of entry.
(c) Date of entry of orders. The date of entry of a Commission order shall be the date the order is
signed. Such date shall be reflected in the caption of the order, or if there is no caption, in the order
itself.
Rule 141. Orders and decisions: Service of orders instituting proceedings and other orders
and decisions.
(a) Service of an order instituting proceedings.
(1) By whom made. The Secretary, or another duly authorized officer of the Commission, shall
serve a copy of an order instituting proceedings on each person named in the order as a party.
The Secretary may direct an interested division to assist in making service.
(2) How made.
(i) To individuals. Notice of a proceeding shall be made to an individual by delivering a
copy of the order instituting proceedings to the individual or to an agent authorized by
appointment or by law to receive such notice. Delivery means—handing a copy of the order
to the individual; or leaving a copy at the individual's office with a clerk or other person in
charge thereof; or leaving a copy at the individual's dwelling house or usual place of abode
18

with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein; or sending a copy of
the order addressed to the individual by U.S. Postal Service certified, registered or Express
Mail and obtaining a confirmation of receipt; or giving confirmed telegraphic notice.
(ii) To corporations or entities. Notice of a proceeding shall be made to a person other than a
natural person by delivering a copy of the order instituting proceedings to an officer,
managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or law to receive
such notice, by any method specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this rule, or, in the case of an
issuer of a class of securities registered with the Commission, by sending a copy of the order
addressed to the most recent address shown on the entity's most recent filing with the
Commission by U.S. Postal Service certified, registered, or Express Mail and obtaining a
confirmation of attempted delivery.
(iii) Upon persons registered with the Commission. In addition to any other method of service
specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this rule, notice may be made to a person currently registered
with the Commission as a broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, government securities
broker, government securities dealer, investment adviser, investment company or transfer
agent by sending a copy of the order addressed to the most recent business address shown
on the person's registration form by U.S. Postal Service certified, registered or Express Mail
and obtaining a confirmation of attempted delivery.
(iv) Upon persons in a foreign country. Notice of a proceeding to a person in a foreign country
may be made by any of the following methods:
(A) Any method specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this rule that is not prohibited by the
law of the foreign country; or
(B) By any internationally agreed means of service that is reasonably calculated to
give notice, such as those authorized by the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of
Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents; or
(C) Any method that is reasonably calculated to give notice:
(1) As prescribed by the foreign country's law for service in that country in an
action in its courts of general jurisdiction; or
19

(2) As the foreign authority directs in response to a letter rogatory or letter of
request; or
(3) Unless prohibited by the foreign country's law, by delivering a copy of the
order instituting proceedings to the individual personally, or using any form of mail
that the Secretary or the interested division addresses and sends to the individual and
that requires a signed receipt; or
(D) By any other means not prohibited by international agreement, as the
Commission or hearing officer orders.
(v) In stop order proceedings. Notwithstanding any other provision of paragraph (a)(2) of this
rule, in proceedings pursuant to Sections 8 or 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77h
or 77j, or Sections 305 or 307 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, 15 U.S.C. 77eee or 77ggg,
notice of the institution of proceedings shall be made by personal service or confirmed
telegraphic notice, or a waiver obtained pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this rule.
(vi) To persons registered with self-regulatory organizations. Notice of a proceeding shall be made
to a person registered with a self-regulatory organization by any method specified in
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this rule, or by sending a copy of the order addressed to the most
recent address for the person shown in the Central Registration Depository by U.S. Postal
Service certified, registered, or Express Mail and obtaining a confirmation of attempted
delivery.
(3) Record of service. The Secretary shall maintain a record of service on parties (in hard copy or
computerized format), identifying the party given notice, the method of service, the date of
service, the address to which service was made, and the person who made service. If a division
serves a copy of an order instituting proceedings, the division shall file with the Secretary either
an acknowledgement of service by the person served or proof of service consisting of a
statement by the person who made service certifying the date and manner of service; the names
of the persons served; and their mail or electronic addresses, facsimile numbers, or the addresses
of the places of delivery, as appropriate for the manner of service. If service is made in person,
the certificate of service shall state, if available, the name of the individual to whom the order
was given. If service is made by U.S. Postal Service certified or Express Mail, the Secretary shall
20

maintain the confirmation of receipt or of attempted delivery, and tracking number. If service is
made to an agent authorized by appointment to receive service, the certificate of service shall be
accompanied by evidence of the appointment.
(4) Waiver of service. In lieu of service as set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this rule, the party
may be provided a copy of the order instituting proceedings by first class mail or other reliable
means if a waiver of service is obtained from the party and placed in the record.
(b) Service of orders or decisions other than an order instituting proceedings. Written orders or decisions
issued by the Commission or by a hearing officer shall be served promptly on each party pursuant to
any method of service authorized under paragraph (a) of this rule or Rules 150(c)(1) - (3). Such
orders or decisions may also be served by facsimile transmission if the party to be served has agreed
to accept such service in a writing, signed by the party, and has provided the Commission with
information concerning the facsimile machine telephone number and hours of facsimile machine
operation. Service of orders or decisions by the Commission, including those entered pursuant to
delegated authority, shall be made by the Secretary or, as authorized by the Secretary, by a member
of an interested division. Service of orders or decisions issued by a hearing officer shall be made by
the Secretary or the hearing officer.
Rule 150. Service of papers by parties.
(a) When required. In every proceeding as defined in Rule 101(a), each paper, including each notice
of appearance, written motion, brief, or other written communication, shall be served upon each
party in the proceeding in accordance with the provisions of this rule; provided, however, that
absent an order to the contrary, no service shall be required for motions which may be heard ex
parte.
(b) Upon a person represented by counsel. Whenever service is required to be made upon a person
represented by counsel who has filed a notice of appearance pursuant to Rule 102, service shall be
made pursuant to paragraph (c) of this rule upon counsel, unless service upon the person
represented is ordered by the Commission or the hearing officer.
(c) How made. Service shall be made by delivering a copy of the filing. Delivery means:

21

(1) Personal service—handing a copy to the person required to be served; or leaving a copy
at the person's office with a clerk or other person in charge thereof, or, if there is no one in
charge, leaving it in a conspicuous place therein; or, if the office is closed or the person to be
served has no office, leaving it at the person's dwelling house or usual place of abode with some
person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein;
(2) Mailing the papers through the U.S. Postal Service by first class, registered, or certified
mail or Express Mail delivery addressed to the person;
(3) Sending the papers through a commercial courier service or express delivery service; or
(4) Transmitting the papers by facsimile transmission where the following conditions are
met:
(i) The persons so serving each other have provided the Commission and the parties
with notice of the facsimile machine telephone number to be used and the hours of facsimile
machine operation;
(ii) The transmission is made at such a time that it is received during the Commission's
business hours as defined in Rule 104; and
(iii) The sender of the transmission previously has not been served in accordance with
Rule 150 with a written notice from the recipient of the transmission declining service by
facsimile transmission.
(d) When service is complete. Personal service, service by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail or service
by a commercial courier or express delivery service is complete upon delivery. Service by mail is
complete upon mailing. Service by facsimile is complete upon confirmation of transmission by
delivery of a manually signed receipt.
Rule 151. Filing of papers with the Commission: Procedure.
(a) When to file. All papers required to be served by a party upon any person shall be filed
contemporaneously with the Commission. Papers required to be filed with the Commission must be
received within the time limit, if any, for such filing. Filing with the Commission may be made by
facsimile transmission if the party also contemporaneously transmits to the Commission a non22

facsimile original with a manual signature. However, any person filing with the Commission by
facsimile transmission will be responsible for assuring that the Commission receives a complete and
legible filing within the time limit set for such filing.
(b) Where to file. Filing of papers with the Commission shall be made by filing them with the
Secretary. When a proceeding is assigned to a hearing officer, a person making a filing with the
Secretary shall promptly provide to the hearing officer a copy of any such filing, provided, however,
that the hearing officer may direct or permit filings to be made with him or her, in which event the
hearing officer shall note thereon the filing date and promptly provide the Secretary with either the
original or a copy of any such filings.
(c) To whom to direct the filing. Unless otherwise provided, where the Commission has assigned a
case to a hearing officer, all motions, objections, applications or other filings made during a
proceeding prior to the filing of an initial decision therein, or, if no initial decision is to be filed,
prior to the time fixed for the filing of briefs with the Commission, shall be directed to and decided
by the hearing officer.
(d) Certificate of service. Papers filed with the Commission or a hearing officer shall be
accompanied by a certificate stating the name of the person or persons served, the date of service,
the method of service and the mailing address or facsimile telephone number to which service was
made, if not made in person. If the method of service to any party is different from the method of
service to any other party or the method for filing with the Commission, the certificate shall state
why a different means of service was used.
Rule 152. Filing of papers: Form.
(a) Specifications. Papers filed in connection with any proceeding as defined in Rule 101(a) shall:
(1) Be on one grade of unglazed white paper measuring 81⁄2 × 11 inches, except that, to the
extent that the reduction of larger documents would render them illegible, such documents may
be filed on larger paper;
(2) Be typewritten or printed in 12-point or larger typeface or otherwise reproduced by a
process that produces permanent and plainly legible copies;
23

(3) Include at the head of the paper, or on a title page, the name of the Commission, the title
of the proceeding, the names of the parties, the subject of the particular paper or pleading, and
the file number assigned to the proceeding;
(4) Be paginated with left hand margins at least 1 inch wide, and other margins of at least 1
inch;
(5) Be double-spaced, with single-spaced footnotes and single-spaced indented quotations;
and
(6) Be stapled, clipped or otherwise fastened in the upper left corner.
(b) Signature required. All papers must be dated and signed as provided in Rule 153.
(c) Suitability for recordkeeping. Documents which, in the opinion of the Commission, are not
suitable for computer scanning or microfilming may be rejected.
(d) Number of copies. An original and three copies of all papers shall be filed, unless filing is made
by facsimile in accordance with Rule 151. If filing is made by facsimile, the filer shall also transmit to
the Office of the Secretary one non-facsimile original with a manual signature, contemporaneously
with the facsimile transmission. The non-facsimile original must be accompanied by a statement of
the date on which, and the facsimile number to which, the party made transmission of the facsimile
filing.
(e) Form of briefs. All briefs containing more than 10 pages shall include a table of contents, an
alphabetized table of cases, a table of statutes, and a table of other authorities cited, with references
to the pages of the brief wherein they are cited.
(f) Scandalous or impertinent matter. Any scandalous or impertinent matter contained in any brief or
pleading or in connection with any oral presentation in a proceeding may be stricken on order of the
Commission or the hearing officer.
Rule 153. Filing of papers: Signature requirement and effect.
(a) General requirements. Following the issuance of an order instituting proceedings, every filing of
a party represented by counsel shall be signed by at least one counsel of record in his or her name
24

and shall state that counsel's business address and telephone number. A party who acts as his or her
own counsel shall sign his or her individual name and state his or her address and telephone number
on every filing.
(b) Effect of signature.
(1) The signature of a counsel or party shall constitute a certification that:
(i) The person signing the filing has read the filing;
(ii) To the best of his or her knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable
inquiry, the filing is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith
argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; and
(iii) The filing is not made for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause
unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of adjudication.
(2) If a filing is not signed, the hearing officer or the Commission shall strike the filing,
unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the person making the
filing.
Rule 154. Motions.
The requirements in this rule apply to motions and related filings except where another rule
expressly governs.
(a) Generally. Unless made during a hearing or conference, a motion shall be in writing, shall state
with particularity the grounds therefor, shall set forth the relief or order sought, and shall be
accompanied by a written brief of the points and authorities relied upon. All written motions shall
be served in accordance with Rule 150, be filed in accordance with Rule 151, meet the requirements
of Rule 152, and be signed in accordance with Rule 153. The Commission or the hearing officer may
order that an oral motion be submitted in writing. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission or
the hearing officer, if a motion is properly made to the Commission concerning a proceeding to
which a hearing officer is assigned, the proceeding before the hearing officer shall continue pending
the determination of the motion by the Commission. No oral argument shall be heard on any
motion unless the Commission or the hearing officer otherwise directs.
25

(b) Opposing and reply briefs. Briefs in opposition to a motion shall be filed within five days after
service of the motion. Reply briefs shall be filed within three days after service of the opposition.
(c) Length limitation. No motion (together with the brief in support of the motion), brief in
opposition to the motion, or reply brief shall exceed 7,000 words, exclusive of any table of contents
or table of authorities. The word limit shall not apply to any addendum that consists solely of copies
of applicable cases, pertinent legislative provisions or rules, or relevant exhibits. Requests for leave
to file motions and briefs in excess of 7,000 words are disfavored. A motion or brief, together with
any accompanying brief, that does not exceed 15 pages in length, exclusive of pages containing the
table of contents, table of authorities, and any addendum that consists solely of copies of applicable
cases, pertinent legislative provisions, or rules and exhibits, but inclusive of pleadings incorporated
by reference, is presumptively considered to contain no more than 7,000 words. Any motion or brief
that exceeds these page limits must include a certificate by the attorney, or an unrepresented party,
stating that the document complies with the length limitation set forth in this paragraph and stating
the number of words in the document. The person preparing the certificate may rely on the word
count of a word-processing program to prepare the document.
Rule 155. Default; motion to set aside default.
(a) A party to a proceeding may be deemed to be in default and the Commission or the hearing
officer may determine the proceeding against that party upon consideration of the record, including
the order instituting proceedings, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true, if that party
fails:
(1) To appear, in person or through a representative, at a hearing or conference of which
that party has been notified;
(2) To answer, to respond to a dispositive motion within the time provided, or otherwise to
defend the proceeding; or
(3) To cure a deficient filing within the time specified by the commission or the hearing
officer pursuant to Rule 180(b).
(b) A motion to set aside a default shall be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for
the failure to appear or defend, and specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. In
26

order to prevent injustice and on such conditions as may be appropriate, the hearing officer, at any
time prior to the filing of the initial decision, or the Commission, at any time, may for good cause
shown set aside a default.
Rule 160. Time computation.
(a) Computation. In computing any period of time prescribed in or allowed by these Rules of
Practice or by order of the Commission, the day of the act, event, or default from which the
designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so
computed shall be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal legal holiday (as defined in
Rule 104), in which event the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday,
Sunday, or Federal legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays shall be
excluded from the computation when the period of time prescribed or allowed is seven days or less,
not including any additional time allowed for service by mail in paragraph (b) of this rule. If on the
day a filing is to be made, weather or other conditions have caused the Secretary's office or other
designated filing location to close, the filing deadline shall be extended to the end of the next day
that is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a Federal legal holiday.
(b) Additional time for service by mail. If service is made by mail, three days shall be added to the
prescribed period for response unless an order of the Commission or the hearing officer specifies a
date certain for filing. In the event that an order of the Commission or the hearing officer specifies a
date certain for filing, no time shall be added for service by mail.
Rule 161. Extensions of time, postponements and adjournments.
(a) Availability. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Commission, at any time, or the hearing
officer, at any time prior to the filing of his or her initial decision or, if no initial decision is to be
filed, at any time prior to the closing of the record, may, for good cause shown, extend or shorten
any time limits prescribed by these Rules of Practice for the filing of any papers and may, consistent
with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this rule, postpone or adjourn any hearing.
(b) Considerations in determining whether to extend time limits or grant postponements, adjournments and
extensions.

27

(1) In considering all motions or requests pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this rule, the
Commission or the hearing officer should adhere to a policy of strongly disfavoring such
requests, except in circumstances where the requesting party makes a strong showing that the
denial of the request or motion would substantially prejudice their case. In determining whether
to grant any requests, the Commission or hearing officer shall consider, in addition to any other
relevant factors:
(i) The length of the proceeding to date;
(ii) The number of postponements, adjournments or extensions already granted;
(iii) The stage of the proceedings at the time of the request;
(iv) The impact of the request on the hearing officer's ability to complete the proceeding
in the time specified by the Commission; and
(v) Any other such matters as justice may require.
(2) To the extent that the Commission has chosen a timeline under which the hearing would
occur beyond the statutory 60-day deadline, this policy of strongly disfavoring requests for
postponement will not apply to a request by a respondent to postpone commencement of a
cease and desist proceeding hearing beyond the statutory 60-day period.
(c) (1) Time limit. Postponements, adjournments or extensions of time for filing papers shall not
exceed 21 days unless the Commission or the hearing officer states on the record or sets forth in a
written order the reasons why a longer period of time is necessary.
(2) Stay pending Commission consideration of offers of settlement.
(i) If the Commission staff and one or more respondents in the proceeding file a joint
motion notifying the hearing officer that they have agreed in principle to a settlement on all
major terms, then the hearing officer shall stay the proceeding as to the settling
respondent(s), or in the discretion of the hearing officer as to all respondents, pending
completion of Commission consideration of the settlement offer. Any such stay will be
contingent upon:
28

(A) The settling respondent(s) submitting to the Commission staff, within fifteen
business days of the stay, a signed offer of settlement in conformance with Rule 240; and
(B) Within twenty business days of receipt of the signed offer, the staff submitting
the settlement offer and accompanying recommendation to the Commission for
consideration.
(ii) If the parties fail to meet either of these deadlines or if the Commission rejects the
offer of settlement, the hearing officer must be promptly notified and, upon notification of
the hearing officer, the stay shall lapse and the proceeding will continue. In the circumstance
where:
(A) A hearing officer has granted a stay because the parties have “agreed in principle
to a settlement;”
(B) The agreement in principle does not materialize into a signed settlement offer
within 15 business days of the stay; and
(C) The stay lapses, the hearing officer will not be required to grant another stay
related to the settlement process until both parties have notified the hearing officer in
writing that a signed settlement offer has been prepared, received by the Commission's
staff, and will be submitted to the Commission.
(iii) The granting of any stay pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall stay the timeline
pursuant to Rule 360(a).
Rule 180. Sanctions.
(a) Contemptuous conduct.
(1) Subject to exclusion or suspension. Contemptuous conduct by any person before the
Commission or a hearing officer during any proceeding, including at or in connection with any
conference, deposition or hearing, shall be grounds for the Commission or the hearing officer
to:

29

(i) Exclude that person from such deposition, hearing or conference, or any portion
thereof; and/or
(ii) Summarily suspend that person from representing others in the proceeding in which
such conduct occurred for the duration, or any portion, of the proceeding.
(2) Review procedure. A person excluded from a deposition, hearing or conference, or a counsel
summarily suspended from practice for the duration or any portion of a proceeding, may seek
review of the exclusion or suspension by filing with the Commission, within three days of the
exclusion or suspension order, a motion to vacate the order. The Commission shall consider
such motion on an expedited basis as provided in Rule 500.
(3) Adjournment. Upon motion by a party represented by counsel subject to an order of
exclusion or suspension, an adjournment shall be granted to allow the retention of new counsel.
In determining the length of an adjournment, the Commission or hearing officer shall consider,
in addition to the factors set forth in Rule 161, the availability of co-counsel for the party or of
other members of a suspended counsel's firm.
(b) Deficient filings; leave to cure deficiencies. The Commission or the hearing officer may reject, in
whole or in part, any filing that fails to comply with any requirements of these Rules of Practice or
of any order issued in the proceeding in which the filing was made. Any such filings shall not be part
of the record. The Commission or the hearing officer may direct a party to cure any deficiencies and
to resubmit the filing within a fixed time period.
(c) Failure to make required filing or to cure deficient filing. The Commission or the hearing officer may
enter a default pursuant to Rule 155, dismiss one or more claims, decide the particular claim(s) at
issue against that person, or prohibit the introduction of evidence or exclude testimony concerning
that claim if a person fails:
(1) To make a filing required under these Rules of Practice; or
(2) To cure a deficient filing within the time specified by the Commission or the hearing
officer pursuant to paragraph (b) of this rule.

30

Rule 190. Confidential treatment of information in certain filings.
(a) Application. An application for confidential treatment pursuant to the provisions of Clause 30
of Schedule A of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77aa(30), and Rule 406 thereunder, 17 CFR
230.406; Section 24(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78x(b)(2), and Rule 24b2 thereunder, 17 CFR 240.24b-2; Section 45(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C.
80a-44(a), and Rule 45a-1 thereunder, 17 CFR 270.45a-1; or Section 210(a) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80b-10(a), shall be filed with the Secretary. The application shall be
accompanied by a sealed copy of the materials as to which confidential treatment is sought.
(b) Procedure for supplying additional information. The applicant may be required to furnish in writing
additional information with respect to the grounds for objection to public disclosure. Failure to
supply the information so requested within 14 days from the date of receipt by the applicant of a
notice of the information required shall be deemed a waiver of the objection to public disclosure of
that portion of the information to which the additional information relates, unless the Commission
or the hearing officer shall otherwise order for good cause shown at or before the expiration of such
14-day period.
(c) Confidentiality of materials pending final decision. Pending the determination of the application for
confidential treatment, transcripts, non-final orders including an initial decision, if any, and other
materials in connection with the application shall be placed under seal; shall be for the confidential
use only of the hearing officer, the Commission, the applicant, and any other parties and counsel;
and shall be made available to the public only in accordance with orders of the Commission.
(d) Public availability of orders. Any final order of the Commission denying or sustaining an
application for confidential treatment shall be made public. Any prior findings or opinions relating
to an application for confidential treatment under this rule shall be made public at such time as the
material as to which confidentiality was requested is made public.
Rule 191. Adjudications not required to be determined on the record after notice and
opportunity for hearing.
(a) Scope of the rule. This rule applies to every case of adjudication, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551,
pursuant to any statute which the Commission administers, where adjudication is not required to be
31

determined on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing and which the Commission has
not chosen to determine on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing.
(b) Procedure. In every case of adjudication under paragraph (a) of this rule, the Commission shall
give prompt notice of any adverse action or final disposition to any person who has requested the
Commission to make (or not to make) any such adjudication, and furnish to any such person a
written statement of reasons therefor. Additional procedures may be specified in rules relating to
specific types of such adjudications. Where any such rule provides for the publication of a
Commission order, notice of the action or disposition shall be deemed to be given by such
publication.
(c) Contents of the record. If the Commission provides notice and opportunity for the submission of
written comments by parties to the adjudication or, as the case may be, by other interested persons,
written comments received on or before the closing date for comments, unless accorded
confidential treatment pursuant to statute or rule of the Commission, become a part of the record of
the adjudication. The Commission, in its discretion, may accept and include in the record written
comments filed with the Commission after the closing date.
Rule 192. Rulemaking: Issuance, amendment and repeal of rules of general application.
(a) By petition. Any person desiring the issuance, amendment or repeal of a rule of general
application may file a petition therefor with the Secretary. Such petition shall include a statement
setting forth the text or the substance of any proposed rule or amendment desired or specifying the
rule the repeal of which is desired, and stating the nature of his or her interest and his or her reasons
for seeking the issuance, amendment or repeal of the rule. The Secretary shall acknowledge, in
writing, receipt of the petition and refer it to the appropriate division or office for consideration and
recommendation. Such recommendations shall be transmitted with the petition to the Commission
for such action as the Commission deems appropriate. The Secretary shall notify the petitioner of
the action taken by the Commission.
(b) Notice of proposed issuance, amendment or repeal of rules. Except where the Commission finds that
notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest,
whenever the Commission proposes to issue, amend, or repeal any rule or regulation of general
application other than an interpretive rule; general statement of policy; or rule of agency
32

organization, procedure, or practice; or any matter relating to agency management or personnel or to
public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts, there shall first be published in the Federal
Register a notice of the proposed action. Such notice shall include:
(1) A statement of the time, place, and nature of the rulemaking proceeding, with particular
reference to the manner in which interested persons shall be afforded the opportunity to
participate in such proceeding;
(2) Reference to the authority under which the rule is proposed; and
(3) The terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues
involved.
Rule 193. Applications by barred individuals for consent to associate.
Preliminary note
This rule governs applications to the Commission by certain persons, barred by Commission
order from association with brokers, dealers, municipal securities dealers, government securities
brokers, government securities dealers, investment advisers, investment companies or transfer
agents, for consent to become so associated. Applications made pursuant to this rule must show that
the proposed association would be consistent with the public interest. In addition to the information
specifically required by the rule, applications should be supplemented, where appropriate, by written
statements of individuals (other than the applicant) who are competent to attest to the applicant's
character, employment performance, and other relevant information. Intentional misstatements or
omissions of fact may constitute criminal violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001 et seq. and other provisions
of law.
The nature of the supervision that an applicant will receive or exercise as an associated person
with a registered entity is an important matter bearing upon the public interest. In meeting the
burden of showing that the proposed association is consistent with the public interest, the
application and supporting documentation must demonstrate that the proposed supervision,
procedures, or terms and conditions of employment are reasonably designed to prevent a recurrence
of the conduct that led to imposition of the bar. As an associated person, the applicant will be
33

limited to association in a specified capacity with a particular registered entity and may also be
subject to specific terms and conditions.
Normally, the applicant's burden of demonstrating that the proposed association is consistent
with the public interest will be difficult to meet where the applicant is to be supervised by, or is to
supervise, another barred individual. In addition, where an applicant wishes to become the sole
proprietor of a registered entity and thus is seeking Commission consent notwithstanding an
absence of supervision, the applicant's burden will be difficult to meet.
In addition to the factors set forth in paragraph (d) of this rule, the Commission will consider
the nature of the findings that resulted in the bar when making its determination as to whether the
proposed association is consistent with the public interest. In this regard, attention is directed to
Rule 5(e) of the Commission's Rules on Informal and Other Procedures, 17 CFR 202.5(e). Among
other things, Rule 5(e) sets forth the Commission's policy “not to permit a * * * respondent [in an
administrative proceeding] to consent to * * * [an] order that imposes a sanction while denying the
allegations in the * * * order for proceedings.” Consistent with the rationale underlying that policy,
and in order to avoid the appearance that an application made pursuant to this rule was granted on
the basis of such denial, the Commission will not consider any application that attempts to reargue
or collaterally attack the findings that resulted in the Commission's bar order.
(a) Scope of rule. Applications for Commission consent to associate, or to change the terms and
conditions of association, with a registered broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, government
securities broker, government securities dealer, investment adviser, investment company or transfer
agent may be made pursuant to this rule where a Commission order bars the individual from
association with a registered entity and:
(1) Such barred individual seeks to become associated with an entity that is not a member of
a self-regulatory organization; or
(2) The order contains a proviso that application may be made to the Commission after a
specified period of time.
(b) Form of application. Each application shall be supported by an affidavit, manually signed by the
applicant, that addresses the factors set forth in paragraph (d) of this rule. One original and three
34

copies of the application shall be filed pursuant to Rules 151, 152 and 153. Each application shall
include as exhibits:
(1) A copy of the Commission order imposing the bar;
(2) An undertaking by the applicant to notify immediately the Commission in writing if any
information submitted in support of the application becomes materially false or misleading while
the application is pending;
(3) The following forms, as appropriate:
(i) A copy of a completed Form U-4, where the applicant's proposed association is with a
broker-dealer or municipal securities dealer;
(ii) A copy of a completed Form MSD-4, where the applicant's proposed association is
with a bank municipal securities dealer;
(iii) The information required by Form ADV, 17 CFR 279.1, with respect to the
applicant, where the applicant's proposed association is with an investment adviser;
(iv) The information required by Form TA-1, 17 CFR 249b.100, with respect to the
applicant, where the applicant's proposed association is with a transfer agent; and
(4) A written statement by the proposed employer that describes:
(i) The terms and conditions of employment and supervision to be exercised over such
applicant and, where applicable, by such applicant;
(ii) The qualifications, experience, and disciplinary records of the proposed supervisor(s)
of the applicant;
(iii) The compliance and disciplinary history, during the two years preceding the filing of
the application, of the office in which the applicant will be employed; and
(iv) The names of any other associated persons in the same office who have previously
been barred by the Commission, and whether they are to be supervised by the applicant.

35

(c) Required showing. The applicant shall make a showing satisfactory to the Commission that the
proposed association would be consistent with the public interest.
(d) Factors to be addressed. The affidavit required by paragraph (b) of this rule shall address each of
the following:
(1) The time period since the imposition of the bar;
(2) Any restitution or similar action taken by the applicant to recompense any person injured
by the misconduct that resulted in the bar;
(3) The applicant's compliance with the order imposing the bar;
(4) The applicant's employment during the period subsequent to imposition of the bar;
(5) The capacity or position in which the applicant proposes to be associated;
(6) The manner and extent of supervision to be exercised over such applicant and, where
applicable, by such applicant;
(7) Any relevant courses, seminars, examinations or other actions completed by the applicant
subsequent to imposition of the bar to prepare for his or her return to the securities business;
and
(8) Any other information material to the application.
(e) Notification to applicant and written statement. In the event an adverse recommendation is
proposed by the staff with respect to an application made pursuant to this rule, the applicant shall be
so advised and provided with a written statement of the reasons for such recommendation. The
applicant shall then have 30 days to submit a written statement in response.
(f) Concurrent applications. The Commission will not consider any application submitted pursuant
to this rule if any other application for consent to associate concerning the same applicant is pending
before any self-regulatory organization.

36

INITIATION OF PROCEEDINGS AND PREHEARING RULES
Rule 200. Initiation of proceedings.
(a) Order instituting proceedings: Notice and opportunity for hearing.
(1) Generally. Whenever an order instituting proceedings is issued by the Commission,
appropriate notice thereof shall be given to each party to the proceeding by the Secretary or
another duly designated officer of the Commission. Each party shall be given notice of any
hearing within a time reasonable in light of the circumstances, in advance of the hearing;
provided, however, no prior notice need be given to a respondent if the Commission has
authorized the Division of Enforcement to seek a temporary sanction ex parte.
(2) Stop order proceedings: Additional persons entitled to notice. Any notice of a proceeding relating
to the issuance of a stop order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement pursuant
to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77h(d), shall be sent to or served on the
issuer; or, in the case of a foreign government or political subdivision thereof, sent to or served
on the underwriter; or, in the case of a foreign or territorial person, sent to or served on its duly
authorized representative in the United States named in the registration statement, properly
directed in the case of telegraphic notice to the address given in such statement. In addition, if
such proceeding is commenced within 90 days after the registration statement has become
effective, notice of the proceeding shall be given to the agent for service named on the facing
sheet of the registration statement and to each other person designated on the facing sheet of
the registration statement as a person to whom copies of communications to such agent are to
be sent.
(b) Content of order. The order instituting proceedings shall:
(1) State the nature of any hearing;
(2) State the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held;
(3) Contain a short and plain statement of the matters of fact and law to be considered and
determined, unless the order directs an answer pursuant to Rule 220 in which case the order

37

shall set forth the factual and legal basis alleged therefor in such detail as will permit a specific
response thereto; and
(4) State the nature of any relief or action sought or taken.
(c) Time and place of hearing. The time and place for any hearing shall be fixed with due regard for
the public interest and the convenience and necessity of the parties, other participants, or their
representatives.
(d) Amendment to order instituting proceedings.
(1) By the Commission. Upon motion by a party, the Commission may, at any time, amend an
order instituting proceedings to include new matters of fact or law.
(2) By the hearing officer. Upon motion by a party, the hearing officer may, at any time prior to
the filing of an initial decision or, if no initial decision is to be filed, prior to the time fixed for
the filing of final briefs with the Commission, amend an order instituting proceedings to include
new matters of fact or law that are within the scope of the original order instituting proceedings.
(e) Publication of notice of public hearings. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, notice of any
public hearing shall be given general circulation by release to the public, by publication in the SEC
News Digest and, where directed, by publication in the Federal Register.
Rule 201. Consolidation and severance of proceedings.
(a) Consolidation. By order of the Commission or a hearing officer, proceedings involving a
common question of law or fact may be consolidated for hearing of any or all the matters at issue in
such proceedings. The Commission or the hearing officer may make such orders concerning the
conduct of such proceedings as it deems appropriate to avoid unnecessary cost or delay.
Consolidation shall not prejudice any rights under these Rules of Practice and shall not affect the
right of any party to raise issues that could have been raised if consolidation had not occurred. For
purposes of this rule, no distinction is made between joinder and consolidation of proceedings.
(b) Severance. By order of the Commission, any proceeding may be severed with respect to one or
more parties. Any motion to sever must be made solely to the Commission and must include a
38

representation that a settlement offer is pending before the Commission or otherwise show good
cause.
Rule 202. Specification of procedures by parties in certain proceedings.
(a) Motion to specify procedures. In any proceeding other than an enforcement or disciplinary
proceeding, a proceeding to review a determination by a self-regulatory organization pursuant to
Rules 420 and 421, or a proceeding to review a determination of the Board pursuant to Rules 440
and 441, a party may, at any time up to 20 days prior to the start of a hearing, make a motion to
specify the procedures necessary or appropriate for the proceeding with particular reference to:
(1) Whether there should be an initial decision by a hearing officer;
(2) Whether any interested division of the Commission may assist in the preparation of the
Commission's decision; and
(3) Whether there should be a 30-day waiting period between the issuance of the
Commission's order and the date it is to become effective.
(b) Objections; effect of failure to object. Any other party may object to the procedures so specified,
and such party may specify such additional procedures as it considers necessary or appropriate. In
the absence of such objection or such specification of additional procedures, such other party may
be deemed to have waived objection to the specified procedures.
(c) Approval required. Any proposal pursuant to paragraph (a) of this rule, even if not objected to
by any party, shall be subject to the written approval of the hearing officer.
(d) Procedure upon agreement to waive an initial decision. If an initial decision is waived pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this rule, the hearing officer shall notify the Secretary and, unless the Commission
directs otherwise within 14 days, no initial decision shall be issued.
Rule 210. Parties, limited participants and amici curiae.
(a) Parties in an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding, a proceeding to review a self-regulatory organization
determination, or a proceeding to review a Board determination.

39

(1) Generally. No person shall be granted leave to become a party or a non-party participant
on a limited basis in an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding, a proceeding to review a
determination by a self-regulatory organization pursuant to Rules 420 and 421, or a proceeding
to review a determination by the Board pursuant to Rules 440 and 441, except as authorized by
paragraph (c) of this rule.
(2) Disgorgement proceedings. In an enforcement proceeding, a person may state his or her views
with respect to a proposed plan of disgorgement or file a proof of claim pursuant to Rule 1103.
(b) Intervention as a party.
(1) Generally. In any proceeding, other than an enforcement proceeding, a disciplinary
proceeding, a proceeding to review a self-regulatory determination, or a proceeding to review a
Board determination, any person may seek leave to intervene as a party by filing a motion setting
forth the person's interest in the proceeding. No person, however, shall be admitted as a party to
a proceeding by intervention unless it is determined that leave to participate pursuant to
paragraph (c) of this rule would be inadequate for the protection of the person's interests. In a
proceeding under the Investment Company Act of 1940, any representative of interested
security holders, or any other person whose participation in the proceeding may be in the public
interest or for the protection of investors, may be admitted as a party upon the filing of a written
motion setting forth the person's interest in the proceeding.
(2) Intervention as of right. In proceedings under the Investment Company Act of 1940, any
interested State or State agency shall be admitted as a party to any proceeding upon the filing of
a written motion requesting leave to be admitted.
(c) Leave to participate on a limited basis. In any proceeding, other than an enforcement proceeding,
a disciplinary proceeding, a proceeding to review a self-regulatory determination, or a proceeding to
review a Board determination, any person may seek leave to participate on a limited basis as a nonparty participant as to any matter affecting the person's interests:
(1) Procedure. Motions for leave to participate shall be in writing, shall set forth the nature and
extent of the movant's interest in the proceeding, and, except where good cause for late filing is
shown, shall be filed not later than 20 days prior to the date fixed for the commencement of the
40

hearing. Leave to participate pursuant to this paragraph (c) may include such rights of a party as
the hearing officer may deem appropriate. Persons granted leave to participate shall be served in
accordance with Rule 150; provided, however, that a party to the proceeding may move that the
extent of notice of filings or other papers to be provided to persons granted leave to participate
be limited, or may move that the persons granted leave to participate bear the cost of being
provided copies of any or all filings or other papers. Persons granted leave to participate shall be
bound, except as may be otherwise determined by the hearing officer, by any stipulation between
the parties to the proceeding with respect to procedure, including submission of evidence,
substitution of exhibits, corrections of the record, the time within which briefs or exceptions
may be filed or proposed findings and conclusions may be submitted, the filing of initial
decisions, the procedure to be followed in the preparation of decisions and the effective date of
the Commission's order in the case. Where the filing of briefs or exceptions or the submission of
proposed findings and conclusions are waived by the parties to the proceedings, a person
granted leave to participate pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall not be permitted to file a brief or
exceptions or submit proposed findings and conclusions except by leave of the Commission or
of the hearing officer.
(2) Certain persons entitled to leave to participate. The hearing officer is directed to grant leave to
participate under this paragraph (c) to any person to whom it is proposed to issue any security in
exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding securities, claims or property interests, or partly
in such exchange and partly for cash, where the Commission is authorized to approve the terms
and conditions of such issuance and exchange after a hearing upon the fairness of such terms
and conditions.
(3) Leave to participate in certain Commission proceedings by a representative of the United States
Department of Justice, a United States Attorney's Office, or a criminal prosecutorial authority of any State or
any other political subdivision of a State. The Commission or the hearing officer may grant leave to
participate on a limited basis to an authorized representative of the United States Department of
Justice, an authorized representative of a United States Attorney, or an authorized representative
of any criminal prosecutorial authority of any State or any other political subdivision of a State
for the purpose of requesting a stay during the pendency of a criminal investigation or
prosecution arising out of the same or similar facts that are at issue in the pending Commission
41

enforcement or disciplinary proceeding. Upon a showing that such a stay is in the public interest
or for the protection of investors, the motion for stay shall be favored. A stay granted under this
paragraph (c)(3) may be granted for such a period and upon such conditions as the Commission
or the hearing officer deems appropriate.
(d) Amicus participation.
(1) Availability. An amicus brief may be filed only if:
(i) A motion for leave to file the brief has been granted;
(ii) The brief is accompanied by written consent of all parties;
(iii) The brief is filed at the request of the Commission or the hearing officer; or
(iv) The brief is presented by the United States or an officer or agency thereof, or by a
State, Territory or Commonwealth.
(2) Procedure. An amicus brief may be filed conditionally with the motion for leave. The
motion for leave shall identify the interest of the movant and shall state the reasons why a brief
of an amicus curiae is desirable. Except as all parties otherwise consent, any amicus curiae shall
file its brief within the time allowed the party whose position the amicus will support, unless the
Commission or hearing officer, for cause shown, grants leave for a later filing. In the event that a
later filing is allowed, the order granting leave to file shall specify when an opposing party may
reply to the brief. A motion of an amicus curiae to participate in oral argument will be granted
only for extraordinary reasons.
(e) Permission to state views. Any person may make a motion seeking leave to file a memorandum or
make an oral statement of his or her views. Any such communication may be included in the record;
provided, however, that unless offered and admitted as evidence of the truth of the statements
therein made, any assertions of fact submitted pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (e) will
be considered only to the extent that the statements therein made are otherwise supported by the
record.
(f) Modification of participation provisions. The Commission or the hearing officer may, by order,
modify the provisions of this rule which would otherwise be applicable, and may impose such terms
42

and conditions on the participation of any person in any proceeding as it may deem necessary or
appropriate in the public interest.
Rule 220. Answer to allegations.
(a) When required. In its order instituting proceedings, the Commission may require any
respondent to file an answer to each of the allegations contained therein. Even if not so ordered, any
respondent in any proceeding may elect to file an answer. Any other person granted leave by the
Commission or the hearing officer to participate on a limited basis in such proceedings pursuant to
Rule 210(c) may be required to file an answer.
(b) When to file. Except where a different period is provided by rule or by order, a respondent
required to file an answer as provided in paragraph (a) of this rule shall do so within 20 days after
service upon the respondent of the order instituting proceedings. Persons granted leave to
participate on a limited basis in the proceeding pursuant to Rule 210(c) may file an answer within a
reasonable time, as determined by the Commission or the hearing officer. If the order instituting
proceedings is amended, the Commission or the hearing officer may require that an amended
answer be filed and, if such an answer is required, shall specify a date for the filing thereof.
(c) Contents; effect of failure to deny. Unless otherwise directed by the hearing officer or the
Commission, an answer shall specifically admit, deny, or state that the party does not have, and is
unable to obtain, sufficient information to admit or deny each allegation in the order instituting
proceedings. When a party intends in good faith to deny only a part of an allegation, the party shall
specify so much of it as is true and shall deny only the remainder. A statement of a lack of
information shall have the effect of a denial. Any allegation not denied shall be deemed admitted. A
respondent must affirmatively state in the answer any avoidance or affirmative defense, including
but not limited to res judicata and statute of limitations. In this regard, a respondent must state in
the answer whether the respondent relied on the advice of counsel, accountants, auditors, or other
professionals in connection with any claim, violation alleged or remedy sought. Failure to do so may
be deemed a waiver.
(d) Motion for more definite statement. A respondent may file with an answer a motion for a more
definite statement of specified matters of fact or law to be considered or determined. Such motion
shall state the respects in which, and the reasons why, each such matter of fact or law should be
43

required to be made more definite. If the motion is granted, the order granting such motion shall set
the periods for filing such a statement and any answer thereto.
(e) Amendments. A respondent may amend its answer at any time by written consent of each
adverse party or with leave of the Commission or the hearing officer. Leave shall be freely granted
when justice so requires.
(f) Failure to file answer: default. If a respondent fails to file an answer required by this rule within
the time provided, such respondent may be deemed in default pursuant to Rule 155(a). A party may
make a motion to set aside a default pursuant to Rule 155(b).
Rule 221. Prehearing conference.
(a) Purposes of conference. The purposes of a prehearing conference include, but are not limited to:
(1) Expediting the disposition of the proceeding;
(2) Establishing early and continuing control of the proceeding by the hearing officer; and
(3) Improving the quality of the hearing through more thorough preparation.
(b) Procedure. On his or her own motion or at the request of a party, the hearing officer may, in
his or her discretion, direct counsel or any party to meet for an initial, final or other prehearing
conference. Such conferences may be held with or without the hearing officer present as the hearing
officer deems appropriate. Where such a conference is held outside the presence of the hearing
officer, the hearing officer shall be advised promptly by the parties of any agreements reached. Such
conferences also may be held with one or more persons participating by telephone or other remote
means.
(c) Subjects to be discussed. At a prehearing conference consideration may be given and action taken
with respect to any and all of the following:
(1) Simplification and clarification of the issues;
(2) Exchange of witness and exhibit lists and copies of exhibits;
(3) Timing of expert witness disclosures and reports, if any;
44

(4) Stipulations, admissions of fact, and stipulations concerning the contents, authenticity, or
admissibility into evidence of documents;
(5) Matters of which official notice may be taken;
(6) The schedule for exchanging prehearing motions or briefs, if any;
(7) The method of service for papers other than Commission orders;
(8) The filing of any motion pursuant to Rule 250;
(9) Settlement of any or all issues;
(10) Determination of hearing dates;
(11) Amendments to the order instituting proceedings or answers thereto;
(12) Production, and timing for completion of the production, of documents as set forth in
Rule 230, and prehearing production of documents in response to subpoenas duces tecum as set
forth in Rule 232;
(13) Specification of procedures as set forth in Rule 202;
(14) Depositions to be conducted, if any, and date by which depositions shall be completed;
and
(15) Such other matters as may aid in the orderly and expeditious disposition of the
proceeding.
(d) Required prehearing conference. Except where the emergency nature of a proceeding would make
a prehearing conference clearly inappropriate, at least one prehearing conference should be held.
(e) Prehearing orders. At or following the conclusion of any conference held pursuant to this rule,
the hearing officer shall enter a ruling or order which recites the agreements reached and any
procedural determinations made by the hearing officer.
(f) Failure to appear: default. Any person who is named in an order instituting proceedings as a
person against whom findings may be made or sanctions imposed and who fails to appear, in person
45

or through a representative, at a prehearing conference of which he or she has been duly notified
may be deemed in default pursuant to Rule 155(a). A party may make a motion to set aside a default
pursuant to Rule 155(b).
Rule 222. Prehearing submissions and disclosures.
(a) Submissions generally. The hearing officer, on his or her own motion, or at the request of a party
or other participant, may order any party, including the interested division, to furnish such
information as deemed appropriate, including any or all of the following:
(1) An outline or narrative summary of its case or defense;
(2) The legal theories upon which it will rely;
(3) Copies and a list of documents that it intends to introduce at the hearing; and
(4) A list of witnesses who will testify on its behalf, including the witnesses' names,
occupations, addresses and a brief summary of their expected testimony.
(b) Expert witnesses.
(1) Information to be supplied; reports. Each party who intends to call an expert witness shall
submit, in addition to the information required by paragraph (a)(4) of this rule, a statement of
the expert's qualifications, a listing of other proceedings in which the expert has given expert
testimony during the previous four years, and a list of publications authored or co-authored by
the expert in the previous ten years. Additionally, if the witness is one retained or specially
employed to provide expert testimony in the case or one whose duties as the party's employee
regularly involve giving expert testimony, then the party must include in the disclosure a written
report—prepared and signed by the witness. The report must contain:
(i) A complete statement of all opinions the witness will express and the basis and
reasons for them;
(ii) The facts or data considered by the witness in forming them;
(iii) Any exhibits that will be used to summarize or support them; and
46

(iv) A statement of the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony in the case.
(2) Drafts and communications protected.
(i) Drafts of any report or other disclosure required under this rule need not be furnished
regardless of the form in which the draft is recorded.
(ii) Communications between a party's attorney and the party's expert witness who is
required to provide a report under this rule need not be furnished regardless of the form of
the communications, except if the communications relate to compensation for the expert's
study or testimony, identify facts or data that the party's attorney provided and that the
expert considered in forming the opinions to be expressed, or identify assumptions that the
party's attorney provided and that the expert relied on in forming the opinions to be
expressed.
Rule 230. Enforcement and disciplinary proceedings: Availability of documents for
inspection and copying.
For purposes of this rule, the term documents shall include writings, drawings, graphs, charts,
photographs, recordings and other data compilations, including data stored by computer, from
which information can be obtained.
(a) Documents to be available for inspection and copying.
(1) Unless otherwise provided by this rule, or by order of the Commission or the hearing
officer, the Division of Enforcement shall make available for inspection and copying by any
party documents obtained by the Division prior to the institution of proceedings, in connection
with the investigation leading to the Division's recommendation to institute proceedings. Such
documents shall include:
(i) Each subpoena issued;
(ii) Every other written request to persons not employed by the Commission to provide
documents or to be interviewed;
(iii) The documents turned over in response to any such subpoenas or other written
requests;
47

(iv) All transcripts and transcript exhibits;
(v) Any other documents obtained from persons not employed by the Commission; and
(vi) Any final examination or inspection reports prepared by the Office of Compliance
Inspections and Examinations, the Division of Trading and Markets, or the Division of
Investment Management, if the Division of Enforcement intends either to introduce any
such report into evidence or to use any such report to refresh the recollection of any witness.
(2) Nothing in this paragraph (a) shall limit the right of the Division to make available any
other document, or shall limit the right of a respondent to seek access to or production pursuant
to subpoena of any other document, or shall limit the authority of the hearing officer to order
the production of any document pursuant to subpoena.
(b) Documents that may be withheld or redacted.
(1) The Division of Enforcement may withhold a document if:
(i) The document is privileged;
(ii) The document is an internal memorandum, note or writing prepared by a
Commission employee, other than an examination or inspection report as specified in
paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this rule, or is otherwise attorney work product and will not be
offered in evidence;
(iii) The document would disclose the identity of a confidential source;
(iv) The document reflects only settlement negotiations between the Division of
Enforcement and a person or entity who is not a respondent in the proceeding; or
(v) The hearing officer grants leave to withhold a document or category of documents as
not relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding or otherwise, for good cause shown.
(2) Unless the hearing officer orders otherwise upon motion, the Division of Enforcement
may redact information from a document if:

48

(i) The information is among the categories set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (v)
of this rule; or
(ii) The information consists of the following with regard to a person other than the
respondent to whom the information is being produced:
(A) An individual's social-security number;
(B) An individual’s birth date;
(C) The name of an individual known to be a minor; or
(D) A financial account number, taxpayer-identification number, credit card or debit
card number, passport number, driver's license number, or state-issued identification
number other than the last four digits of the number.
(3) Nothing in this paragraph (b) authorizes the Division of Enforcement in connection with
an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding to withhold, contrary to the doctrine of Brady v.
Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963), documents that contain material exculpatory evidence.
(c) Withheld document list. The hearing officer may require the Division of Enforcement to submit
for review a list of documents or categories of documents withheld pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1)(i)
through (b)(1)(v) of this rule or to submit any document withheld, and may determine whether any
such document should be made available for inspection and copying. When similar documents are
withheld pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(v) of this rule, those documents may be
identified by category instead of by individual document. The hearing officer retains discretion to
determine when an identification by category is insufficient.
(d) Timing of inspection and copying. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission or the hearing
officer, the Division of Enforcement shall commence making documents available to a respondent
for inspection and copying pursuant to this rule no later than 7 days after service of the order
instituting proceedings. In a proceeding in which a temporary cease-and-desist order is sought
pursuant to Rule 510 or a temporary suspension of registration is sought pursuant to Rule 520,
documents shall be made available no later than the day after service of the decision as to whether to
issue a temporary cease-and-desist order or temporary suspension order.
49

(e) Place of inspection and copying. Documents subject to inspection and copying pursuant to this
rule shall be made available to the respondent for inspection and copying at the Commission office
where they are ordinarily maintained, or at such other place as the parties, in writing, may agree. A
respondent shall not be given custody of the documents or leave to remove the documents from the
Commission's offices pursuant to the requirements of this rule other than by written agreement of
the Division of Enforcement. Such agreement shall specify the documents subject to the agreement,
the date they shall be returned and such other terms or conditions as are appropriate to provide for
the safekeeping of the documents.
(f) Copying costs and procedures. The respondent may obtain a photocopy of any documents made
available for inspection. The respondent shall be responsible for the cost of photocopying. Unless
otherwise ordered, charges for copies made by the Division of Enforcement at the request of the
respondent will be at the rate charged pursuant to the fee schedule at 17 CFR 200.80e for copies.
The respondent shall be given access to the documents at the Commission's offices or such other
place as the parties may agree during normal business hours for copying of documents at the
respondent's expense.
(g) Issuance of investigatory subpoenas after institution of proceedings. The Division of Enforcement shall
promptly inform the hearing officer and each party if investigatory subpoenas are issued under the
same investigation file number or pursuant to the same order directing private investigation (“formal
order”) under which the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings was conducted. The
hearing officer shall order such steps as necessary and appropriate to assure that the issuance of
investigatory subpoenas after the institution of proceedings is not for the purpose of obtaining
evidence relevant to the proceedings and that any relevant documents that may be obtained through
the use of investigatory subpoenas in a continuing investigation are made available to each
respondent for inspection and copying on a timely basis.
(h) Failure to make documents available—harmless error. In the event that a document required to be
made available to a respondent pursuant to this rule is not made available by the Division of
Enforcement, no rehearing or redecision of a proceeding already heard or decided shall be required,
unless the respondent shall establish that the failure to make the document available was not
harmless error.
50

Rule 231. Enforcement and disciplinary proceedings: Production of witness statements.
(a) Availability. Any respondent in an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding may move that the
Division of Enforcement produce for inspection and copying any statement of any person called or
to be called as a witness by the Division of Enforcement that pertains, or is expected to pertain, to
his or her direct testimony and that would be required to be produced pursuant to the Jencks Act,
18 U.S.C. 3500. For purposes of this rule, statement shall have the meaning set forth in 18 U.S.C.
3500(e). Such production shall be made at a time and place fixed by the hearing officer and shall be
made available to any party, provided, however, that the production shall be made under conditions
intended to preserve the items to be inspected or copied.
(b) Failure to produce—harmless error. In the event that a statement required to be made available
for inspection and copying by a respondent is not turned over by the Division of Enforcement, no
rehearing or redecision of a proceeding already heard or decided shall be required unless the
respondent establishes that the failure to turn over the statement was not harmless error.
Rule 232. Subpoenas.
(a) Availability; procedure. In connection with any hearing ordered by the Commission or any
deposition permitted under Rule 233, a party may request the issuance of subpoenas requiring the
attendance and testimony of witnesses at such depositions or at the designated time and place of
hearing, and subpoenas requiring the production of documentary or other tangible evidence
returnable at any designated time or place. Unless made on the record at a hearing, requests for
issuance of a subpoena shall be made in writing and served on each party pursuant to Rule 150. A
person whose request for a subpoena has been denied or modified may not request that any other
person issue the subpoena.
(1) Unavailability of hearing officer. In the event that the hearing officer assigned to a proceeding
is unavailable, the party seeking issuance of the subpoena may seek its issuance from the first
available of the following persons: The Chief Administrative Law Judge, the law judge most
senior in service as a law judge, the duty officer, any other member of the Commission, or any
other person designated by the Commission to issue subpoenas. Requests for issuance of a
subpoena made to the Commission, or any member thereof, must be submitted to the Secretary,
not to an individual Commissioner.
51

(2) Signing may be delegated. A hearing officer may authorize issuance of a subpoena, and may
delegate the manual signing of the subpoena to any other person authorized to issue subpoenas.
(b) Standards for issuance. Where it appears to the person asked to issue the subpoena that the
subpoena sought may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or
she may, in his or her discretion, as a condition precedent to the issuance of the subpoena, require
the person seeking the subpoena to show the general relevance and reasonable scope of the
testimony or other evidence sought. If after consideration of all the circumstances, the person
requested to issue the subpoena determines that the subpoena or any of its terms is unreasonable,
oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may refuse to issue the subpoena,
or issue it only upon such conditions as fairness requires. In making the foregoing determination,
the person issuing the subpoena may inquire of the other participants whether they will stipulate to
the facts sought to be proved.
(c) Service. Service shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Rule 150(b) through (d). The
provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply to the issuance of subpoenas for purposes of
investigations, as required by 17 CFR 203.8, as well as depositions and hearings.
(d) Tender of fees required. When a subpoena ordering the attendance of a person at a hearing or
deposition is issued at the instance of anyone other than an officer or agency of the United States,
service is valid only if the subpoena is accompanied by a tender to the subpoenaed person of the
fees for one day's attendance and mileage specified by paragraph (f) of this rule.
(e) Application to quash or modify.
(1) Procedure. Any person to whom a subpoena or notice of deposition is directed, or who is
an owner, creator or the subject of the documents that are to be produced pursuant to a
subpoena, or any party may, prior to the time specified therein for compliance, but in no event
more than 15 days after the date of service of such subpoena or notice, request that the
subpoena or notice be quashed or modified. Such request shall be made by application filed with
the Secretary and served on all parties pursuant to Rule 150. The party on whose behalf the
subpoena or notice was issued may, within five days of service of the application, file an
opposition to the application. If a hearing officer has been assigned to the proceeding, the
52

application to quash shall be directed to that hearing officer for consideration, even if the
subpoena or notice was issued by another person.
(2) Standards governing application to quash or modify. If compliance with the subpoena or notice
of deposition would be unreasonable, oppressive, unduly burdensome or would unduly delay the
hearing, the hearing officer or the Commission shall quash or modify the subpoena or notice, or
may order a response to the subpoena, or appearance at a deposition, only upon specified
conditions. These conditions may include but are not limited to a requirement that the party on
whose behalf the subpoena was issued shall make reasonable compensation to the person to
whom the subpoena was addressed for the cost of copying or transporting evidence to the place
for return of the subpoena.
(3) Additional standards governing application to quash deposition notices or subpoenas filed pursuant to
Rule 233(a). The hearing officer or the Commission shall quash or modify a deposition notice or
subpoena filed or issued pursuant to Rule 233(a) unless the requesting party demonstrates that
the deposition notice or subpoena satisfies the requirements of Rule 233(a), and:
(i) The proposed deponent was a witness of or participant in any event, transaction,
occurrence, act, or omission that forms the basis for any claim asserted by the Division of
Enforcement, any defense, or anything else required to be included in an answer pursuant to
Rule 220(c) by any respondent in the proceeding (this excludes a proposed deponent whose
only knowledge of these matters arises from the Division of Enforcement's investigation or
the proceeding);
(ii) The proposed deponent is a designated as an "expert witness" under Rule 222(b);
provided, however, that the deposition of an expert who is required to submit a written
report under Rule 222(b) may only occur after such report is served; or
(iii) The proposed deponent has custody of documents or electronic data relevant to the
claims or defenses of any party (this excludes Division of Enforcement or other
Commission officers or personnel who have custody of documents or data that was
produced by the Division to the respondent).

53

(f) Witness fees and mileage. Witnesses summoned before the Commission shall be paid the same
fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States, and witnesses whose
depositions are taken and the persons taking the same shall severally be entitled to the same fees as
are paid for like services in the courts of the United States. Witness fees and mileage shall be paid by
the party at whose instance the witnesses appear. Except for such witness fees and mileage, each
party is responsible for paying any fees and expenses of the expert witnesses whom that party
designates under Rule 222(b), for appearance at any deposition or hearing.
Rule 233. Depositions upon oral examination.
(a) Depositions upon written notice. In any proceeding under the 120-day timeframe designated
pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2), depositions upon written notice may be taken as set forth in this
paragraph. No other depositions shall be permitted except as provided in paragraph (b) of this rule.
(1) If the proceeding involves a single respondent, the respondent may file written notices to
depose no more than three persons, and the Division of Enforcement may file written notices to
depose no more than three persons.
(2) If the proceeding involves multiple respondents, the respondents collectively may file
joint written notices to depose no more than five persons, and the Division of Enforcement may
file written notices to depose no more than five persons. The depositions taken under this
paragraph (a)(2) shall not exceed a total of five depositions for the Division of Enforcement, and
five depositions for all respondents collectively.
(3) Additional depositions upon motion. Any side may file a motion with the hearing officer
seeking leave to notice up to two additional depositions beyond those permitted pursuant to
paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this rule.
(i) Procedure.
(A) A motion for additional depositions must be filed no later than 90 days prior to
the hearing date. Any party opposing the motion may submit an opposition within five
days after service of the motion. No reply shall be permitted. The motion and any
oppositions each shall not exceed seven pages in length. These limitations exclusively
govern motions under this rule; notwithstanding Rule 154(a), any points and authorities
54

shall be included in the motion or opposition, with no separate statement of points and
authorities permitted, and none of the requirements in Rule 154(b) or (c) shall apply.
(B) Upon consideration of the motion and any opposing papers, the hearing officer
will issue an order either granting or denying the motion. The hearing officer shall
consider the motion on an expedited basis.
(C) The proceeding shall not automatically be stayed pending the determination of
the motion.
(ii) Grounds and standards for motion. A motion under this paragraph (a)(3) shall not be
granted unless the additional depositions satisfy Rule 232(e) and the moving side
demonstrates a compelling need for the additional depositions by:
(A) Identifying each of the witnesses whom the moving side plans to depose
pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this rule as well as the additional witnesses
whom the side seeks to depose;
(B) Describing the role of each witness and proposed additional witness;
(C) Describing the matters concerning which each witness and proposed additional
witness is expected to be questioned, and why the deposition of each witness and
proposed additional witness is necessary for the moving side’s arguments, claims, or
defenses; and
(D) Showing that the additional deposition(s) requested will not be unreasonably
cumulative or duplicative.
(iii) If the moving side proposes to take and submit the additional deposition(s) on
written questions, as provided in Rule 234, the motion shall so state. The motion for
additional depositions shall constitute a motion under Rule 234(a), and the moving party is
required to submit its questions with its motion under this rule. The procedures for such a
deposition shall be governed by Rule 234.
(4) A deponent’s attendance may be ordered by subpoena issued pursuant to the procedures
in Rule 232; and
55

(5) The Commission or hearing officer may rule on a motion that a deposition noticed under
paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this rule shall not be taken upon a determination under Rule 232(e).
The fact that a witness testified during an investigation does not preclude the deposition of that
witness.
(b) Depositions when witness is unavailable. In addition to depositions permitted under paragraph (a)
of this rule, the Commission or the hearing officer may grant a party's request to file a written notice
of deposition if the requesting party shows that the prospective witness will likely give testimony
material to the proceeding; that it is likely the prospective witness, who is then within the United
States, will be unable to attend or testify at the hearing because of age, sickness, infirmity,
imprisonment, other disability, or absence from the United States, unless it appears that the absence
of the witness was procured by the party requesting the deposition; and that the taking of a
deposition will serve the interests of justice.
(c) Service and contents of notice. Notice of any deposition pursuant to this rule shall be made in
writing and served on each party pursuant to Rule 150. A notice of deposition shall designate by
name a deposition officer. The deposition officer may be any person authorized to administer oaths
by the laws of the United States or of the place where the deposition is to be held. A notice of
deposition also shall state:
(1) The name and address of the witness whose deposition is to be taken;
(2) The time and place of the deposition; provided that a subpoena for a deposition may
command a person to attend a deposition only as follows:
(i) Within 100 miles of where the person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts
business in person;
(ii) Within the state where the person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business
in person, if the person is a party or a party's officer;
(iii) At such other location that the parties and proposed deponent stipulate; or
(iv) At such other location that the hearing officer or the Commission determines is
appropriate; and
56

(3) The manner of recording and preserving the deposition.
(d) Producing documents. In connection with any deposition pursuant to this rule, a party may
request the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum under Rule 232. The party conducting the
deposition shall serve upon the deponent any subpoena duces tecum so issued. The materials
designated for production, as set out in the subpoena, must be listed in the notice of deposition.
(e) Method of recording.
(1) Method stated in the notice. The party who notices the deposition must state in the notice the
method for recording the testimony. Unless the hearing officer or Commission orders otherwise,
testimony may be recorded by audio, audiovisual, or stenographic means. The noticing party
bears the recording costs. Any party may arrange to transcribe a deposition, at that party's
expense. Each party shall bear its own costs for obtaining copies of any transcripts or audio or
audiovisual recordings.
(2) Additional method. With prior notice to the deponent and other parties, any party may
designate another method for recording the testimony in addition to that specified in the original
notice. That party bears the expense of the additional record or transcript unless the hearing
officer or the Commission orders otherwise.
(f) By remote means. The parties may stipulate—or the hearing officer or Commission may on
motion order—that a deposition be taken by telephone or other remote means. For the purpose of
this rule, the deposition takes place where the deponent answers the questions.
(g) Deposition officer’s duties.
(1) Before the deposition. The deposition officer designated pursuant to paragraph (c) of this rule
must begin the deposition with an on-the-record statement that includes:
(i) The deposition officer's name and business address;
(ii) The date, time, and place of the deposition;
(iii) The deponent's name;

57

(iv) The deposition officer's administration of the oath or affirmation to the deponent;
and
(v) The identity of all persons present.
(2) Conducting the deposition; avoiding distortion. If the deposition is recorded nonstenographically, the deposition officer must repeat the items in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (iii)
of this rule at the beginning of each unit of the recording medium. The deponent's and
attorneys' appearance or demeanor must not be distorted through recording techniques.
(3) After the deposition. At the end of a deposition, the deposition officer must state on the
record that the deposition is complete and must set out any stipulations made by the attorneys
about custody of the transcript or recording and of the exhibits, or about any other pertinent
matters.
(h) Order and record of the examination.
(1) Order of examination. The examination and cross-examination of a deponent shall proceed
as they would at the hearing. After putting the deponent under oath or affirmation, the
deposition officer must record the testimony by the method designated under paragraph (e) of
this rule. The testimony must be recorded by the deposition officer personally or by a person
acting in the presence and under the direction of the deposition officer. The witness being
deposed may have counsel present during the deposition.
(2) Form of objections stated during the deposition. An objection at the time of the examination—
whether to evidence, to a party’s conduct, to the deposition officer’s qualifications, to the
manner of taking the deposition, or to any other aspect of the deposition—must be noted on
the record, but the examination shall still proceed and the testimony shall be taken subject to any
objection. An objection must be stated concisely in a nonargumentative and nonsuggestive
manner. A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a
privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the hearing officer or the Commission, or to present
a motion to the hearing officer or the Commission for a limitation on the questioning in the
deposition.

58

(i) Waiver of objections.
(1) To the notice. An objection to an error or irregularity in a deposition notice is waived unless
promptly served in writing on the party giving the notice.
(2) To the deposition officer's qualification. An objection based on disqualification of the
deposition officer before whom a deposition is to be taken is waived if not made:
(i) Before the deposition begins; or
(ii) Promptly after the basis for disqualification becomes known or, with reasonable
diligence, could have been known.
(3) To the taking of the deposition.
(i) Objection to competence, relevance, or materiality. An objection to a deponent's
competence—or to the competence, relevance, or materiality of testimony—is not waived
by a failure to make the objection before or during the deposition, unless the ground for it
might have been corrected at that time.
(ii) Objection to an error or irregularity. An objection to an error or irregularity at an oral
examination is waived if:
(A) It relates to the manner of taking the deposition, the form of a question or
answer, the oath or affirmation, a party's conduct, or other matters that might have been
corrected at that time; and
(B) It is not timely made during the deposition.
(4) To completing and returning the deposition. An objection to how the deposition officer
transcribed the testimony—or prepared, signed, certified, sealed, endorsed, sent, or otherwise
dealt with the deposition—is waived unless a motion to suppress is made promptly after the
error or irregularity becomes known or, with reasonable diligence, could have been known.

59

(j) Duration; cross-examination; motion to terminate or limit.
(1) Duration. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the hearing officer or the
Commission, a deposition is limited to one day of seven hours, including cross-examination as
provided in this subsection. In a deposition conducted by or for a respondent, the Division of
Enforcement shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time for cross-examination of the
deponent. In a deposition conducted by the Division, the respondents collectively shall be
allowed a reasonable amount of time for cross-examination of the deponent. The hearing officer
or the Commission may allow additional time if needed to fairly examine the deponent or if the
deponent, another person, or any other circumstance impedes or delays the examination.
(2) Motion to terminate or limit.
(i) Grounds. At any time during a deposition, the deponent or a party may move to
terminate or limit it on the ground that it is being conducted in bad faith or in a manner that
unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party. If the objecting
deponent or party so demands, the deposition must be suspended for the time necessary to
present the motion to the hearing officer or the Commission.
(ii) Order. Upon a motion under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this rule, the hearing officer or the
Commission may order that the deposition be terminated or may limit its scope. If
terminated, the deposition may be resumed only by order of the hearing officer or the
Commission.
(k) Review by the witness; changes.
(1) Review; statement of changes. On request by the deponent or a party before the deposition is
completed, and unless otherwise ordered by the hearing officer or the Commission, the
deponent must be allowed 14 days after being notified by the deposition officer that the
transcript or recording is available, unless a longer time is agreed to by the parties or permitted
by the hearing officer, in which:
(i) To review the transcript or recording; and

60

(ii) If there are changes in form or substance, to sign a statement listing the changes and
the reasons for making them.
(2) Changes indicated in the deposition officer’s certificate. The deposition officer must note in the
certificate prescribed by paragraph (l)(1) of this rule whether a review was requested and, if so,
must attach any changes the deponent makes during the 14-day period.
(l) Certification and delivery; exhibits; copies of the transcript or recording.
(1) Certification and delivery. The deposition officer must certify in writing that the witness was
duly sworn and that the deposition accurately records the witness’s testimony. The certificate
must accompany the record of the deposition. Unless the hearing officer orders otherwise, the
deposition officer must seal the deposition in an envelope or package bearing the title of the
action and marked “Deposition of [witness’s name]” and must promptly send it to the attorney
or party who arranged for the transcript or recording. The attorney or party must store it under
conditions that will protect it against loss, destruction, tampering, or deterioration.
(2) Documents and tangible things.
(i) Originals and copies. Documents and tangible things produced for inspection during a
deposition must, on a party’s request, be marked for identification and attached to the
deposition. Any party may inspect and copy them. But if the person who produced them
wants to keep the originals, the person may:
(A) Offer copies to be marked, attached to the deposition, and then used as
originals—after giving all parties a fair opportunity to verify the copies by comparing
them with the originals; or
(B) Give all parties a fair opportunity to inspect and copy the originals after they are
marked—in which event the originals may be used as if attached to the deposition.
(ii) Order regarding the originals. Any party may move for an order that the originals be
attached to the deposition pending final disposition of the case.
(3) Copies of the transcript or recording. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the hearing
officer or Commission, the deposition officer must retain the stenographic notes of a deposition
61

taken stenographically or a copy of the recording of a deposition taken by another method.
When paid reasonable charges, the deposition officer must furnish a copy of the transcript or
recording to any party or the deponent, as directed by the party or person paying such charges.
(m) Presentation of objections or disputes. Any party seeking relief with respect to disputes over the
conduct of a deposition may file a motion with the hearing officer to obtain relief as permitted by
the Rules of Practice.
Rule 234. Depositions upon written questions.
(a) Availability. Any deposition permitted under Rule 233 may be taken and submitted on written
questions upon motion of any party, for good cause shown, or as stipulated by the parties.
(b) Procedure. Written questions shall be filed with the motion. Within 10 days after service of the
motion and written questions, any party may file objections to such written questions and any party
may file cross-questions. When a deposition is taken pursuant to this rule no persons other than the
witness, counsel to the witness, the deposition officer, and, if the deposition officer does not act as
reporter, a reporter, shall be present at the examination of the witness. No party shall be present or
represented unless otherwise permitted by order. The deposition officer shall propound the
questions and cross-questions to the witness in the order submitted.
(c) Additional requirements. The order for deposition, filing of the deposition, form of the
deposition and use of the deposition in the record shall be governed by paragraphs (c) through (l) of
Rule 233, except that no cross-examination shall be made.
Rule 235. Introducing prior sworn statements or declarations.
(a) At a hearing, any person wishing to introduce a prior, sworn deposition taken pursuant to
Rule 233 or Rule 234, investigative testimony, or other sworn statement or a declaration pursuant to
28 U.S.C. 1746, of a witness, not a party, otherwise admissible in the proceeding, may make a
motion setting forth the reasons therefor. If only part of a statement or declaration is offered in
evidence, the hearing officer may require that all relevant portions of the statement or declaration be
introduced. If all of a statement or declaration is offered in evidence, the hearing officer may require
that portions not relevant to the proceeding be excluded. A motion to introduce a prior sworn
statement or declaration may be granted if:
62

(1) The witness is dead;
(2) The witness is out of the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness
was procured by the party offering the prior sworn statement or declaration;
(3) The witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity,
imprisonment or other disability;
(4) The party offering the prior sworn statement or declaration has been unable to procure
the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or
(5) In the discretion of the Commission or the hearing officer, it would be desirable, in the
interests of justice, to allow the prior sworn statement or declaration to be used. In making this
determination, due regard shall be given to the presumption that witnesses will testify orally in
an open hearing. If the parties have stipulated to accept a prior sworn statement or declaration in
lieu of live testimony, consideration shall also be given to the convenience of the parties in
avoiding unnecessary expense.
(b) Sworn statement or declaration of party or agent. An adverse party may use for any purpose a
deposition taken pursuant to Rule 233 or Rule 234, investigative testimony, or other sworn
statement or a declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, of a party or anyone who, when giving the
sworn statement or declaration, was the party's officer, director, or managing agent.
Rule 240. Settlement.
(a) Availability. Any person who is notified that a proceeding may or will be instituted against him
or her, or any party to a proceeding already instituted, may, at any time, propose in writing an offer
of settlement.
(b) Procedure. An offer of settlement shall state that it is made pursuant to this rule; shall recite or
incorporate as a part of the offer the provisions of paragraphs (c) (4) and (5) of this rule; shall be
signed by the person making the offer, not by counsel; and shall be submitted to the interested
division.

63

(c) Consideration of offers of settlement.
(1) Offers of settlement shall be considered by the interested division when time, the nature
of the proceedings, and the public interest permit.
(2) Where a hearing officer is assigned to a proceeding, the interested division and the party
submitting the offer may request that the hearing officer express his or her views regarding the
appropriateness of the offer of settlement. A request for the hearing officer to express his or her
views on an offer of settlement or otherwise to participate in a settlement conference constitutes
a waiver by the persons making the request of any right to claim bias or prejudgment by the
hearing officer based on the views expressed.
(3) The interested division shall present the offer of settlement to the Commission with its
recommendation, except that, if the division's recommendation is unfavorable, the offer shall
not be presented to the Commission unless the person making the offer so requests.
(4) By submitting an offer of settlement, the person making the offer waives, subject to
acceptance of the offer:
(i) All hearings pursuant to the statutory provisions under which the proceeding is to be
or has been instituted;
(ii) The filing of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law;
(iii) Proceedings before, and an initial decision by, a hearing officer;
(iv) All post-hearing procedures; and
(v) Judicial review by any court.
(5) By submitting an offer of settlement the person further waives:
(i) Such provisions of the Rules of Practice or other requirements of law as may be
construed to prevent any member of the Commission's staff from participating in the
preparation of, or advising the Commission as to, any order, opinion, finding of fact, or
conclusion of law to be entered pursuant to the offer; and
64

(ii) Any right to claim bias or prejudgment by the Commission based on the
consideration of or discussions concerning settlement of all or any part of the proceeding.
(6) If the Commission rejects the offer of settlement, the person making the offer shall be
notified of the Commission's action and the offer of settlement shall be deemed withdrawn. The
rejected offer shall not constitute a part of the record in any proceeding against the person
making the offer, provided, however, that rejection of an offer of settlement does not affect the
continued validity of waivers pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this rule with respect to any
discussions concerning the rejected offer of settlement.
(7) Final acceptance of any offer of settlement will occur only upon the issuance of findings
and an order by the Commission.
Rule 250. Dispositive motions.
(a) Motion for a ruling on the pleadings. No later than 14 days after a respondent’s answer has been
filed, any party may move for a ruling on the pleadings on one or more claims or defenses, asserting
that, even accepting all of the non-movant’s factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable
inferences in the non-movant’s favor, the movant is entitled to a ruling as a matter of law. The
hearing officer shall promptly grant or deny the motion.
(b) Motion for summary disposition in 30- and 75-day proceedings. In any proceeding under the 30- or
75-day timeframe designated pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2), after a respondent’s answer has been filed
and documents have been made available to that respondent for inspection and copying pursuant to
Rule 230, any party may make a motion for summary disposition on one or more claims or defenses,
asserting that the undisputed pleaded facts, declarations, affidavits, documentary evidence or facts
officially noted pursuant to Rule 323 show that there is no genuine issue with regard to any material
fact and that the movant is entitled to summary disposition as a matter of law. The hearing officer
shall promptly grant or deny the motion for summary disposition or shall defer decision on the
motion. If it appears that a party, for good cause shown, cannot present prior to the hearing facts
essential to justify opposition to the motion, the hearing officer shall deny or defer the motion.
(c) Motion for summary disposition in 120-day proceedings. In any proceeding under the 120-day
timeframe designated pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2), after a respondent’s answer has been filed and
65

documents have been made available to that respondent for inspection and copying pursuant to
Rule 230, a party may make a motion for summary disposition on one or more claims or defenses,
asserting that the undisputed pleaded facts, declarations, affidavits, deposition transcripts,
documentary evidence or facts officially noted pursuant to Rule 323 show that there is no genuine
issue with regard to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to summary disposition as a
matter of law. A motion for summary disposition shall be made only with leave of the hearing
officer. Leave shall be granted only for good cause shown and if consideration of the motion will
not delay the scheduled start of the hearing. The hearing officer shall promptly grant or deny the
motion for summary disposition or shall defer decision on the motion. If it appears that a party, for
good cause shown, cannot present prior to the hearing facts essential to justify opposition to the
motion, the hearing officer shall deny or defer the motion.
(d) Motion for a ruling as a matter of law following completion of case in chief. Following the interested
division’s presentation of its case in chief, any party may make a motion, asserting that the movant is
entitled to a ruling as a matter of law on one or more claims or defenses.
(e) Length limitation for dispositive motions. Dispositive motions, together with any supporting
memorandum of points and authorities (exclusive of any declarations, affidavits, deposition
transcripts or other attachments), shall not exceed 9,800 words. Requests for leave to file motions
and accompanying documents in excess of 9,800 words are disfavored. A double-spaced motion that
does not, together with any accompanying memorandum of points and authorities, exceed 35 pages
in length, inclusive of pleadings incorporated by reference (but excluding any declarations, affidavits,
deposition transcripts or attachments) in the dispositive motion, is presumptively considered to
contain no more than 9,800 words. Any motion that exceeds this page limit must include a
certificate by the attorney, or an unrepresented party, stating that the brief complies with the word
limit set forth in this paragraph and stating the number of words in the motion. The person
preparing the certificate may rely on the word count of a word-processing program to prepare the
document.
(f) Opposition and reply length limitations and response time. A non-moving party may file an opposition
to a dispositive motion and the moving party may thereafter file a reply.

66

(1) Length limitations. Any opposition must comply with the length limitations applicable to
the movant’s motion as set forth in paragraph (e) of this rule. Any reply must comply with the
length limitations set forth in Rule 154(c).
(2) Response time.
(i) For motions under paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of this rule, the response times set
forth in Rule 154(b) apply to any opposition and reply briefs.
(ii) For motions under paragraph (c) of this rule, any opposition must be filed within 21
days after service of such a motion, and any reply must be filed within seven days after
service of any opposition.
RULES REGARDING HEARINGS
Rule 300. Hearings.
Hearings for the purpose of taking evidence shall be held only upon order of the Commission.
All hearings shall be conducted in a fair, impartial, expeditious and orderly manner.
Rule 301. Hearings to be public.
All hearings, except hearings on applications for confidential treatment filed pursuant to Rule
190, hearings held to consider a motion for a protective order pursuant to Rule 322, and hearings on
ex parte application for a temporary cease-and-desist order, shall be public unless otherwise ordered
by the Commission on its own motion or the motion of a party. No hearing shall be nonpublic
where all respondents request that the hearing be made public.
Rule 302. Record of hearings.
(a) Recordation. Unless ordered otherwise by the hearing officer or the Commission, all hearings
shall be recorded and a written transcript thereof shall be prepared.
(b) Availability of a transcript. Transcripts of public hearings shall be available for purchase at
prescribed rates. Transcripts of nonpublic proceedings, and transcripts subject to a protective order
pursuant to Rule 322, shall be available for purchase only by parties; provided, however, that any
67

person compelled to submit data or evidence in a hearing may purchase a copy of his or her own
testimony.
(c) Transcript correction. Prior to the filing of post-hearing briefs or proposed findings and
conclusions, or within such earlier time as directed by the Commission or the hearing officer, a party
or witness may make a motion to correct the transcript. Proposed corrections of the transcript may
be submitted to the hearing officer by stipulation pursuant to Rule 324, or by motion. Upon notice
to all parties to the proceeding, the hearing officer may, by order, specify corrections to the
transcript.
Rule 310. Failure to appear at hearings: Default.
Any person named in an order instituting proceedings as a person against whom findings may be
made or sanctions imposed who fails to appear at a hearing of which he or she has been duly
notified may be deemed to be in default pursuant to Rule 155(a). A party may make a motion to set
aside a default pursuant to Rule 155(b).
Rule 320. Evidence: Admissibility.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this rule, the Commission or the hearing officer may receive
relevant evidence and shall exclude all evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial, unduly repetitious, or
unreliable.
(b) Subject to Rule 235, evidence that constitutes hearsay may be admitted if it is relevant,
material, and bears satisfactory indicia of reliability so that its use is fair.
Rule 321. Evidence: Objections and offers of proof.
(a) Objections. Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence must be made on the record
and shall be in short form, stating the grounds relied upon. Exceptions to any ruling thereon by the
hearing officer need not be noted at the time of the ruling. Such exceptions will be deemed waived
on appeal to the Commission, however, unless raised:
(1) Pursuant to interlocutory review in accordance with Rule 400;
(2) In a proposed finding or conclusion filed pursuant to Rule 340; or
68

(3) In a petition for Commission review of an initial decision filed in accordance with Rule
410.
(b) Offers of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, the party offering such
evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the record. Excluded material
shall be retained pursuant to Rule 350(b).
Rule 322. Evidence: Confidential information, protective orders.
(a) Procedure. In any proceeding as defined in Rule 101(a), a party, any person who is the owner,
subject or creator of a document subject to subpoena or which may be introduced as evidence, or
any witness who testifies at a hearing may file a motion requesting a protective order to limit from
disclosure to other parties or to the public documents or testimony that contain confidential
information. The motion should include a general summary or extract of the documents without
revealing confidential details. If the movant seeks a protective order against disclosure to other
parties as well as the public, copies of the documents shall not be served on other parties. Unless the
documents are unavailable, the movant shall file for in camera inspection a sealed copy of the
documents as to which the order is sought.
(b) Basis for issuance. Documents and testimony introduced in a public hearing are presumed to be
public. A motion for a protective order shall be granted only upon a finding that the harm resulting
from disclosure would outweigh the benefits of disclosure.
(c) Requests for additional information supporting confidentiality. A movant under paragraph (a) of this
rule may be required to furnish in writing additional information with respect to the grounds for
confidentiality. Failure to supply the information so requested within five days from the date of
receipt by the movant of a notice of the information required shall be deemed a waiver of the
objection to public disclosure of that portion of the documents to which the additional information
relates, unless the Commission or the hearing officer shall otherwise order for good cause shown at
or before the expiration of such five-day period.
(d) Confidentiality of documents pending decision. Pending a determination of a motion under this rule,
the documents as to which confidential treatment is sought and any other documents that would
reveal the confidential information in those documents shall be maintained under seal and shall be
69

disclosed only in accordance with orders of the Commission or the hearing officer. Any order issued
in connection with a motion under this rule shall be public unless the order would disclose
information as to which a protective order has been granted, in which case that portion of the order
that would reveal the protected information shall be nonpublic.
Rule 323. Evidence: Official notice.
Official notice may be taken of any material fact which might be judicially noticed by a district
court of the United States, any matter in the public official records of the Commission, or any
matter which is peculiarly within the knowledge of the Commission as an expert body. If official
notice is requested or taken of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, the parties,
upon timely request, shall be afforded an opportunity to establish the contrary.
Rule 324. Evidence: Stipulations.
The parties may, by stipulation, at any stage of the proceeding agree upon any pertinent facts in
the proceeding. A stipulation may be received in evidence and, when received, shall be binding on
the parties to the stipulation.
Rule 325. Evidence: Presentation under oath or affirmation.
A witness at a hearing for the purpose of taking evidence shall testify under oath or affirmation.
Rule 326. Evidence: Presentation, rebuttal and cross-examination.
In any proceeding in which a hearing is required to be conducted on the record after
opportunity for hearing in accord with 5 U.S.C. 556(a), a party is entitled to present its case or
defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such crossexamination as, in the discretion of the Commission or the hearing officer, may be required for a full
and true disclosure of the facts. The scope and form of evidence, rebuttal evidence, if any, and
cross-examination, if any, in any other proceeding shall be determined by the Commission or the
hearing officer in each proceeding.

70

Rule 340. Proposed findings, conclusions and supporting briefs.
(a) Opportunity to file. Before an initial decision is issued, each party shall have an opportunity,
reasonable in light of all the circumstances, to file in writing proposed findings and conclusions
together with, or as a part of, its brief.
(b) Procedure. Proposed findings of fact must be supported by citations to specific portions of the
record. If successive filings are directed, the proposed findings and conclusions of the party assigned
to file first shall be set forth in serially numbered paragraphs, and any counter statement of proposed
findings and conclusions must, in addition to any other matter, indicate those paragraphs of the
proposals already filed as to which there is no dispute. A reply brief may be filed by the party
assigned to file first, or, where simultaneous filings are directed, reply briefs may be filed by each
party, within the period prescribed therefor by the hearing officer. No further briefs may be filed
except with leave of the hearing officer.
(c) Time for filing. In any proceeding in which an initial decision is to be issued:
(1) At the end of each hearing, the hearing officer shall, by order, after consultation with the
parties, prescribe the period within which proposed findings and conclusions and supporting
briefs are to be filed. The party or parties directed to file first shall make its or their initial filing
within 30 days of the end of the hearing unless the hearing officer, for good cause shown,
permits a different period and sets forth in the order the reasons why the different period is
necessary.
(2) The total period within which all such proposed findings and conclusions and supporting
briefs and any counter statements of proposed findings and conclusions and reply briefs are to
be filed shall be no longer than 90 days after the close of the hearing unless the hearing officer,
for good cause shown, permits a different period and sets forth in an order the reasons why the
different period is necessary.
Rule 350. Record in proceedings before hearing officer; retention of documents; copies.
(a) Contents of the record. The record shall consist of:
(1) The order instituting proceedings, each notice of hearing and any amendments;
71

(2) Each application, motion, submission or other paper, and any amendments, motions,
objections, and exceptions to or regarding them;
(3) Each stipulation, transcript of testimony and document or other item admitted into
evidence;
(4) Each written communication accepted by the hearing officer pursuant to Rule 210;
(5) With respect to a request to disqualify a hearing officer or to allow the hearing officer's
withdrawal under Rule 112, each affidavit or transcript of testimony taken and the decision made
in connection with the request;
(6) All motions, briefs and other papers filed on interlocutory appeal;
(7) All proposed findings and conclusions;
(8) Each written order issued by the hearing officer or Commission; and
(9) Any other document or item accepted into the record by the hearing officer.
(b) Retention of documents not admitted. Any document offered into evidence but excluded shall not
be considered a part of the record. The Secretary shall retain any such document until the later of
the date upon which a Commission order ending the proceeding becomes final, or the conclusion of
any judicial review of the Commission's order.
(c) Substitution of copies. A true copy of a document may be substituted for any document in the
record or any document retained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this rule.
Rule 351. Transmittal of documents to Secretary; record index; certification.
(a) Transmittal from hearing officer to Secretary of partial record index. The hearing officer may, at any
time, transmit to the Secretary motions, exhibits or any other original documents filed with or
accepted into evidence by the hearing officer, together with a list of such documents.
(b) Preparation, certification of record index. Promptly after the close of the hearing, the hearing
officer shall transmit to the Secretary an index of the originals of any motions, exhibits or any other
documents filed with or accepted into evidence by the hearing officer that have not been previously
72

transmitted to the Secretary, and the Secretary shall prepare a record index. Prior to issuance of an
initial decision, or if no initial decision is to be prepared, within 30 days of the close of the hearing,
the Secretary shall transmit the record index to the hearing officer and serve a copy of the record
index on each party. Any person may file proposed corrections to the record index with the hearing
officer within 15 days of service of the record index. The hearing officer shall, by order, direct
whether any corrections to the record index shall be made. The Secretary shall make such
corrections, if any, and issue a revised record index. If an initial decision is to be issued, the initial
decision shall include a certification that the record consists of the items set forth in the record index
or revised record index issued by the Secretary.
(c) Final transmittal of record items to the Secretary. After the close of the hearing, the hearing officer
shall transmit to the Secretary originals of any motions, exhibits or any other documents filed with,
or accepted into evidence by, the hearing officer, or any other portions of the record that have not
already been transmitted to the Secretary. Prior to service of the initial decision by the Secretary, or
if no initial decision is to be issued, within 60 days of the close of the hearing, the Secretary shall
inform the hearing officer if any portions of the record are not in the Secretary's custody.
Rule 360. Initial decision of hearing officer and timing of hearing.
(a) (1) When required. Unless the Commission directs otherwise, the hearing officer shall prepare
an initial decision in any proceeding in which the Commission directs a hearing officer to
preside at a hearing, provided, however, that an initial decision may be waived by the parties
with the consent of the hearing officer pursuant to Rule 202.
(2) Time period for filing initial decision and for hearing.
(i) Initial decision. In the order instituting proceedings, the Commission will specify a time
period in which the hearing officer's initial decision must be filed with the Secretary. In the
Commission's discretion, after consideration of the nature, complexity, and urgency of the
subject matter, and with due regard for the public interest and the protection of investors,
this time period will be either 30, 75, or 120 days. The time period will run from the
occurrence of the following events:

73

(A) The completion of post-hearing briefing in a proceeding where the hearing has
been completed; or
(B) The completion of briefing on a Rule 250 motion in the event the hearing officer
has determined that no hearing is necessary; or
(C) The determination by the hearing officer that, pursuant to Rule 155, a party is
deemed to be in default and no hearing is necessary.
(ii) Hearing. Under the 120-day timeline, the hearing officer shall issue an order
scheduling the hearing to begin approximately four months (but no more than ten months)
from the date of service of the order instituting the proceeding. Under the 75-day timeline,
the hearing officer shall issue an order scheduling the hearing to begin approximately 2-1⁄2
months (but no more than six months) from the date of service of the order instituting the
proceeding. Under the 30-day timeline, the hearing officer shall issue an order scheduling the
hearing to begin approximately one month (but no more than four months) from the date of
service of the order instituting the proceeding. These deadlines confer no substantive rights
on respondents. If a stay is granted pursuant to Rule 161(c)(2)(i) or Rule 210(c)(3), the time
period specified in the order instituting proceedings in which the hearing officer's initial
decision must be filed with the Secretary, as well as any other time limits established in
orders issued by the hearing officer in the proceeding, shall be automatically tolled during
the period while the stay is in effect.
(3) Certification of extension; motion for extension.
(i) In the event that the hearing officer presiding over the proceeding determines that it
will not be possible to file the initial decision within the specified period of time, the hearing
officer may certify to the Commission in writing the need to extend the initial decision
deadline by up to 30 days for case management purposes. The certification must be issued
no later than 30 days prior to the expiration of the time specified for the issuance of an initial
decision and be served on the Commission and all parties in the proceeding. If the
Commission has not issued an order to the contrary within 14 days after receiving the
certification, the extension set forth in the hearing officer's certification shall take effect.
74

(ii) Either in addition to a certification of extension, or instead of a certification of
extension, the Chief Administrative Law Judge may submit a motion to the Commission
requesting an extension of the time period for filing the initial decision. First, the hearing
officer presiding over the proceeding must consult with the Chief Administrative Law Judge.
Following such consultation, the Chief Administrative Law Judge may determine, in his or
her discretion, to submit a motion to the Commission requesting an extension of the time
period for filing the initial decision. This motion may request an extension of any length but
must be filed no later than 15 days prior to the expiration of the time specified in the
certification of extension, or if there is no certification of extension, 30 days prior to the
expiration of the time specified in the order instituting proceedings. The motion will be
served upon all parties in the proceeding, who may file with the Commission statements in
support of or in opposition to the motion. If the Commission determines that additional
time is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, the Commission shall issue an order
extending the time period for filing the initial decision.
(iii) The provisions of this paragraph (a)(3) confer no rights on respondents.
(b) Content. An initial decision shall include findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis
therefor, as to all the material issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record and the
appropriate order, sanction, relief, or denial thereof. The initial decision shall also state the time
period, not to exceed 21 days after service of the decision, except for good cause shown, within
which a petition for review of the initial decision may be filed. The reasons for any extension of time
shall be stated in the initial decision. The initial decision shall also include a statement that, as
provided in paragraph (d) of this rule:
(1) The Commission will enter an order of finality as to each party unless a party or an
aggrieved person entitled to review timely files a petition for review of the initial decision or a
motion to correct a manifest error of fact in the initial decision with the hearing officer, or the
Commission determines on its own initiative to review the initial decision; and
(2) If a party or an aggrieved person entitled to review timely files a petition for review or a
motion to correct a manifest error of fact in the initial decision with the hearing officer, or if the

75

Commission takes action to review as to a party or an aggrieved person entitled to review, the
initial decision shall not become final as to that party or person.
(c) Filing, service and publication. The Secretary shall promptly serve the initial decision upon the
parties and shall promptly publish notice of the filing thereof on the SEC Website. Thereafter, the
Secretary shall publish the initial decision in the SEC Docket; provided, however, that in nonpublic
proceedings no notice shall be published unless the Commission otherwise directs.
(d) Finality.
(1) If a party or an aggrieved person entitled to review timely files a petition for review or a
motion to correct a manifest error of fact in the initial decision, or if the Commission on its own
initiative orders review of a decision with respect to a party or a person aggrieved who would be
entitled to review, the initial decision shall not become final as to that party or person.
(2) If a party or aggrieved person entitled to review fails to file timely a petition for review or
a motion to correct a manifest error of fact in the initial decision, and if the Commission does
not order review of a decision on its own initiative, the Commission will issue an order that the
decision has become final as to that party. The decision becomes final upon issuance of the
order. The order of finality shall state the date on which sanctions, if any, take effect. Notice of
the order shall be published in the SEC Docket and on the SEC Web site.
APPEAL TO THE COMMISSION AND COMMISSION REVIEW
Rule 400. Interlocutory review.
(a) Availability. The Commission may, at any time, on its own motion, direct that any matter be
submitted to it for review. Petitions by parties for interlocutory review are disfavored, and the
Commission ordinarily will grant a petition to review a hearing officer ruling prior to its
consideration of an initial decision only in extraordinary circumstances. The Commission may
decline to consider a ruling certified by a hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (c) of this rule or the
petition of a party who has been denied certification if it determines that interlocutory review is not
warranted or appropriate under the circumstances. This rule is the exclusive remedy for review of a
hearing officer's ruling prior to Commission consideration of the entire proceeding and is the sole
76

mechanism for appeal of actions delegated pursuant to 17 CFR 200.30-9 and 200.30-10 of this
chapter.
(b) Expedited consideration. Interlocutory review of a hearing officer's ruling shall be expedited in
every way, consistent with the Commission's other responsibilities.
(c) Certification process. A ruling submitted to the Commission for interlocutory review must be
certified in writing by the hearing officer and shall specify the material relevant to the ruling
involved. The hearing officer shall not certify a ruling unless:
(1) His or her ruling would compel testimony of Commission members, officers or
employees or the production of documentary evidence in their custody; or
(2) Upon application by a party, within five days of the hearing officer's ruling, the hearing
officer is of the opinion that:
(i) The ruling involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial
ground for difference of opinion; and
(ii) An immediate review of the order may materially advance the completion of the
proceeding.
(d) Proceedings not stayed. The filing of an application for review or the grant of review shall not
stay proceedings before the hearing officer unless he or she, or the Commission, shall so order. The
Commission will not consider the motion for a stay unless the motion shall have first been made to
the hearing officer.
Rule 401. Consideration of stays.
(a) Procedure. A request for a stay shall be made by written motion, filed pursuant to Rule 154,
and served on all parties pursuant to Rule 150. The motion shall state the reasons for the relief
requested and the facts relied upon, and, if the facts are subject to dispute, the motion shall be
supported by affidavits or other sworn statements or copies thereof. Portions of the record relevant
to the relief sought, if available to the movant, shall be filed with the motion. The Commission may
issue a stay based on such motion or on its own motion.
77

(b) Scope of relief. The Commission may grant a stay in whole or in part, and may condition relief
under this rule upon such terms, or upon the implementation of such procedures, as it deems
appropriate.
(c) Stay of a Commission order. A motion for a stay of a Commission order may be made by any
person aggrieved thereby who would be entitled to review in a federal court of appeals. A motion
seeking to stay the effectiveness of a Commission order pending judicial review may be made to the
Commission at any time during which the Commission retains jurisdiction over the proceeding.
(d) Stay of an action by a self-regulatory organization.
(1) Availability. A motion for a stay of an action by a self-regulatory organization for which
the Commission is the appropriate regulatory agency, for which action review may be sought
pursuant to Rule 420, may be made by any person aggrieved thereby at the time an application
for review is filed in accordance with Rule 420 or thereafter.
(2) Summary entry. A stay may be entered summarily, without notice and opportunity for
hearing.
(3) Expedited consideration. Where the action complained of has already taken effect and the
motion for stay is filed within 10 days of the effectiveness of the action, or where the action
complained of, will, by its terms, take effect within five days of the filing of the motion for stay,
the consideration of and decision on the motion for a stay shall be expedited in every way,
consistent with the Commission's other responsibilities. Where consideration will be expedited,
persons opposing the motion for a stay may file a statement in opposition within two days of
service of the motion unless the Commission, by written order, shall specify a different period.
(e) Lifting of stay of action by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
(1) Availability. Any person aggrieved by a stay of action by the Board entered in accordance
with 15 U.S.C. 7215(e) for which review has been sought pursuant to Rule 440 or which the
Commission has taken up on its motion pursuant to Rule 441 may make a motion to lift the
stay. The Commission may, at any time, on its own motion determine whether to lift the
automatic stay.
78

(2) Summary action. The Commission may lift a stay summarily, without notice and
opportunity for hearing.
(3) Expedited consideration. The Commission may expedite consideration of a motion to lift a
stay of Board action, consistent with the Commission's other responsibilities. Where
consideration is expedited, persons opposing the lifting of the stay may file a statement in
opposition within two days of service of the motion requesting lifting of the stay unless the
Commission, by written order, shall specify a different period.
Rule 410. Appeal of initial decisions by hearing officers.
(a) Petition for review; when available. In any proceeding in which an initial decision is made by a
hearing officer, any party, and any other person who would have been entitled to judicial review of
the decision entered therein if the Commission itself had made the decision, may file a petition for
review of the decision with the Commission.
(b) Procedure. The petition for review of an initial decision shall be filed with the Commission
within such time after service of the initial decision as prescribed by the hearing officer pursuant to
Rule 360(b) unless a party has filed a motion to correct an initial decision with the hearing officer. If
such correction has been sought, a party shall have 21 days from the date of the hearing officer's
order resolving the motion to correct to file a petition for review. The petition shall set forth a
statement of the issues presented for review under Rule 411(b). In the event a petition for review is
filed, any other party to the proceeding may file a cross-petition for review within the original time
allowed for seeking review or within ten days from the date that the petition for review was filed,
whichever is later.
(c) Length limitation. Except with leave of the Commission, the petition for review shall not
exceed three pages in length. Incorporation of pleadings or filings by reference into the petition is
not permitted. Motions to file petitions in excess of those limitations are disfavored.
(d) Financial disclosure statement requirement. Any person who files a petition for review of an initial
decision that asserts that person's inability to pay either disgorgement, interest or a penalty shall file
with the opening brief a sworn financial disclosure statement containing the information specified in
Rule 630(b).
79

(e) Prerequisite to judicial review. Pursuant to Section 704 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5
U.S.C. 704, a petition to the Commission for review of an initial decision is a prerequisite to the
seeking of judicial review of a final order entered pursuant to such decision.
Rule 411. Commission consideration of initial decisions by hearing officers.
(a) Scope of review. The Commission may affirm, reverse, modify, set aside or remand for further
proceedings, in whole or in part, an initial decision by a hearing officer and may make any findings
or conclusions that in its judgment are proper and on the basis of the record.
(b) Standards for granting review pursuant to a petition for review.
(1) Mandatory review. After a petition for review has been filed, the Commission shall review
any initial decision that:
(i) Denies any request for action pursuant to Section 8(a) or Section 8(c) of the Securities
Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77h(a), (c), or the first sentence of Section 12(d) of the Exchange Act,
15 U.S.C. 78l(d);
(ii) Suspends trading in a security pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Exchange Act,
15 U.S.C. 78l(k); or
(iii) Is in a case of adjudication (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551) not required to be
determined on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing (except to the extent there
is involved a matter described in 5 U.S.C. 554(a)(1) through (6)).
(2) Discretionary review. The Commission may decline to review any other decision. In determining
whether to grant review, the Commission shall consider whether the petition for review makes a
reasonable showing that:
(i) A prejudicial error was committed in the conduct of the proceeding; or
(ii) The decision embodies:
(A) A finding or conclusion of material fact that is clearly erroneous; or
(B) A conclusion of law that is erroneous; or
80

(C) An exercise of discretion or decision of law or policy that is important and that the
Commission should review.
(c) Commission review other than pursuant to a petition for review. The Commission may, on its own
initiative, order review of any initial decision, or any portion of any initial decision, within 21 days
after the end of the period established for filing a petition for review pursuant to Rule 410(b). A
party who does not intend to file a petition for review, and who desires the Commission's
determination whether to order review on its own initiative to be made in a shorter time, may make
a motion for an expedited decision, accompanied by a written statement that the party waives its
right to file a petition for review. The vote of one member of the Commission, conveyed to the
Secretary, shall be sufficient to bring a matter before the Commission for review.
(d) Limitations on matters reviewed. Review by the Commission of an initial decision shall be limited
to the issues specified in an opening brief that complies with Rule 450(b), or the issues, if any,
specified in the briefing schedule order issued pursuant to Rule 450(a). Any exception to an initial
decision not supported in an opening brief that complies with Rule 450(b) may, at the discretion of
the Commission, be deemed to have been waived by the petitioner. On notice to all parties,
however, the Commission may, at any time prior to issuance of its decision, raise and determine any
other matters that it deems material, with opportunity for oral or written argument thereon by the
parties.
(e) Summary affirmance.
(1) At any time within 21 days after the filing of a petition for review pursuant to Rule
410(b), any party may file a motion in accordance with Rule 154 asking that the Commission
summarily affirm an initial decision. Any party may file an opposition and reply to such motion
in accordance with Rule 154. Pending determination of the motion for summary affirmance, the
Commission, in its discretion, may delay issuance of a briefing schedule order pursuant to Rule
450.
(2) Upon consideration of the motion and any opposition or upon its own initiative, the
Commission may summarily affirm an initial decision. The Commission may grant summary
affirmance if it finds that no issue raised in the initial decision warrants consideration by the
Commission of further oral or written argument. The Commission will decline to grant summary
81

affirmance upon a reasonable showing that a prejudicial error was committed in the conduct of
the proceeding or that the decision embodies an exercise of discretion or decision of law or
policy that is important and that the Commission should review.
(f) Failure to obtain a majority. In the event a majority of participating Commissioners do not agree
to a disposition on the merits, the initial decision shall be of no effect, and an order will be issued in
accordance with this result.
Rule 420. Appeal of determinations by self-regulatory organizations.
(a) Application for review; when available. An application for review by the Commission may be filed
by any person who is aggrieved by a determination of a self-regulatory organization with respect to
any:
(1) Final disciplinary sanction;
(2) Denial or conditioning of membership or participation;
(3) Prohibition or limitation in respect to access to services offered by that self-regulatory
organization or a member thereof; or
(4) Bar from association as to which a notice is required to be filed with the Commission
pursuant to Section 19(d)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78s(d)(1).
(b) Procedure. As required by section 19(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.
78s(d)(1), an applicant must file an application for review with the Commission within 30 days after
the notice of the determination is filed with the Commission and received by the aggrieved person
applying for review. The Commission will not extend this 30-day period, absent a showing of
extraordinary circumstances. This rule is the exclusive remedy for seeking an extension of the 30-day
period.
(c) Application. The application shall be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 151. The
applicant shall serve the application on the self-regulatory organization. The application shall identify
the determination complained of and set forth in summary form a brief statement of the alleged
errors in the determination and supporting reasons therefor. The application shall state an address
where the applicant can be served. The application should not exceed two pages in length. If the
82

applicant will be represented by a representative, the application shall be accompanied by the notice
of appearance required by Rule 102(d). Any exception to a determination not supported in an
opening brief that complies with Rule 450(b) may, at the discretion of the Commission, be deemed
to have been waived by the applicant.
(d) Determination not stayed. Filing an application for review with the Commission pursuant to
paragraph (b) of this rule shall not operate as a stay of the complained of determination made by the
self-regulatory organization unless the Commission otherwise orders either pursuant to a motion
filed in accordance with Rule 401 or on its own motion.
(e) Certification of the record; service of the index. Fourteen days after receipt of an application for
review or a Commission order for review, the self-regulatory organization shall certify and file with
the Commission one copy of the record upon which the action complained of was taken, and shall
file with the Commission three copies of an index to such record, and shall serve upon each party
one copy of the index.
Rule 421. Commission consideration of determinations by self-regulatory organizations.
(a) Commission review other than pursuant to a petition for review. The Commission may, on its own
initiative, order review of any determination by a self-regulatory organization that could be subject to
an application for review pursuant to Rule 420(a) within 40 days after notice thereof was filed with
the Commission pursuant to Section 19(d)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78s(d)(1).
(b) Supplemental briefing. The Commission may at any time prior to issuance of its decision raise or
consider any matter that it deems material, whether or not raised by the parties. Notice to the parties
and an opportunity for supplemental briefing with respect to issues not briefed by the parties shall
be given where the Commission believes that such briefing would significantly aid the decisional
process.
Rule 430. Appeal of actions made pursuant to delegated authority.
(a) Scope of rule. Any person aggrieved by an action made by authority delegated in 17 CFR
200.30-1 through 200.30-8 or 17 CFR 200.30-11 through 200.30-18 may seek review of the action
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this rule.
83

(b) Procedure.
(1) Notice of intention to petition for review. A party to an action made pursuant to delegated
authority, or a person aggrieved by such action, may seek Commission review of the action by
filing a written notice of intention to petition for review within five days after actual notice of
the action to that party or aggrieved person, or 15 days after publication of the notice of action
in the Federal Register, or five days after service of notice of the action on that party or
aggrieved person pursuant to Rule 141(b), whichever is the earliest.
(2) Petition for review. Within five days after the filing of a notice of intention to petition for
review pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this rule, the person seeking review shall file a petition for
review containing a clear and concise statement of the issues to be reviewed and the reasons why
review is appropriate. The petition shall include exceptions to any findings of fact or conclusions
of law made, together with supporting reasons for such exceptions based on appropriate
citations to such record as may exist. These reasons may be stated in summary form.
(c) Prerequisite to judicial review. Pursuant to Section 704 of the Administrative Procedure Act,
5 U.S.C. 704, a petition to the Commission for review of an action made by authority delegated in
17 CFR 200.30-1 through 200.30-18 of this chapter is a prerequisite to the seeking of judicial review
of a final order entered pursuant to such an action. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 7214(h)(2), any decision by
the Commission pursuant to 200.30-11 shall not be reviewable under 15 U.S.C. 78y and shall not be
deemed 'final agency action' for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 704.
Rule 431. Commission consideration of actions made pursuant to delegated authority.
(a) Scope of review. The Commission may affirm, reverse, modify, set aside or remand for further
proceedings, in whole or in part, any action made pursuant to authority delegated in 17 CFR 200.30-1
through 200.30-18.
(b) Standards for granting review pursuant to a petition for review.
(1) Mandatory review. After a petition for review has been filed, the Commission shall review
any action that it would be required to review pursuant to Rule 411(b)(1) if the action was made
as the initial decision of a hearing officer.
84

(2) Discretionary review. The Commission may decline to review any other action. In
determining whether to grant review, the Commission shall consider the factors set forth in Rule
411(b)(2).
(c) Commission review other than pursuant to a petition for review. The Commission may, on its own
initiative, order review of any action made pursuant to delegated authority at any time, provided,
however, that where there are one or more parties to the matter, such review shall not be ordered
more than ten days after the action. The vote of one member of the Commission, conveyed to the
Secretary, shall be sufficient to bring a matter before the Commission for review.
(d) Required items in an order for review. In an order granting a petition for review or directing review
on the Commission's own initiative, the Commission shall set forth the time within which any party
or other person may file a statement in support of or in opposition to the action made by delegated
authority and shall state whether a stay shall be granted, if none is in effect, or shall be continued, if
in effect pursuant to paragraph (e) of this rule.
(e) Automatic stay of delegated action. An action made pursuant to delegated authority shall have
immediate effect and be deemed the action of the Commission. Upon filing with the Commission of
a notice of intention to petition for review, or upon notice to the Secretary of the vote of a
Commissioner that a matter be reviewed, an action made pursuant to delegated authority shall be
stayed until the Commission orders otherwise, provided, however, there shall be no automatic stay
of an action:
(1) To grant a stay of action by the Commission or a self-regulatory organization as
authorized by 17 CFR 200.30-14(g)(5) and (6); or
(2) To commence a subpoena enforcement proceeding as authorized by 17 CFR 200.304(a)(10).
(f) Effectiveness of stay or of Commission decision to modify or reverse a delegated action. As against any
person who shall have acted in reliance upon any action at a delegated level, any stay or any
modification or reversal by the Commission of such action shall be effective only from the time
such person receives actual notice of such stay, modification or reversal.

85

Rule 440. Appeal of determinations by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
(a) Application for review; when available. Any person who is aggrieved by a determination of the
Board with respect to any final disciplinary sanction, including disapproval of a completed
application for registration of a public accounting firm, may file an application for review.
(b) Procedure. An aggrieved person may file an application for review with the Commission
pursuant to Rule 151 within 30 days after the notice filed by the Board of its determination with the
Commission pursuant to 17 CFR 240.19d-4 is received by the aggrieved person applying for review.
The applicant shall serve the application on the Board at the same time. The application shall
identify the determination complained of, set forth in summary form a brief statement of alleged
errors in the determination and supporting reasons therefor, and state an address where the
applicant can be served. The application should not exceed two pages in length. The notice of
appearance required by Rule 102(d) shall accompany the application. Any exception to a
determination not supported in an opening brief that complies with Rule 450(b) may, at the
discretion of the Commission, be deemed to have been waived by the applicant.
(c) Stay of determination. Filing an application for review with the Commission pursuant to
paragraph (b) of this rule operates as a stay of the Board's determination unless the Commission
otherwise orders either pursuant to a motion filed in accordance with Rule 401(e) or upon its own
motion.
(d) Certification of the record; service of the index. Within fourteen days after receipt of an application
for review, the Board shall certify and file with the Commission one copy of the record upon which
it took the complained-of action. The Board shall file with the Commission three copies of an index
of such record, and shall serve one copy of the index on each party.
Rule 441. Commission consideration of Board determinations.
(a) Commission review other than pursuant to an application for review. The Commission may, on its own
initiative, order review of any final disciplinary sanction, including disapproval of a completed
application for registration of a public accounting firm, imposed by the Board that could be subject
to an application for review pursuant to Rule 440(a) within 40 days after the Board filed notice
thereof pursuant to 17 CFR 240.19d-4.
86

(b) Supplemental briefing. The Commission may at any time prior to the issuance of its decision
raise or consider any matter that it deems material, whether or not raised by the parties. The
Commission will give notice to the parties and an opportunity for supplemental briefing with respect
to issues not briefed by the parties where the Commission believes that such briefing could
significantly aid the decisional process.
Rule 450. Briefs filed with the Commission.
(a) Briefing schedule order. Other than review ordered pursuant to Rule 431, if review of a
determination is mandated by statute, rule, or judicial order or the Commission determines to grant
review as a matter of discretion, the Commission shall issue a briefing schedule order directing the
party or parties to file opening briefs and specifying particular issues, if any, as to which briefing
should be limited or directed. Unless otherwise provided, opening briefs shall be filed within 30 days
of the date of the briefing schedule order. Opposition briefs shall be filed within 30 days after the
date opening briefs are due. Reply briefs shall be filed within 14 days after the date opposition briefs
are due. No briefs in addition to those specified in the briefing schedule order may be filed except
with leave of the Commission. The briefing schedule order shall be issued:
(1) At the time the Commission orders review on its own initiative pursuant to Rules 411 or
421, or orders interlocutory review on its own motion pursuant to Rule 400(a); or
(2) Within 21 days, or such longer time as provided by the Commission, after:
(i) The last day permitted for filing a petition for review pursuant to Rule 410(b) or a
brief in opposition to a petition for review pursuant to Rule 410(d);
(ii) Receipt by the Commission of an index to the record of a determination of a selfregulatory organization filed pursuant to Rule 420(d);
(iii) Receipt by the Commission of an index to the record of a determination by the
Board filed pursuant to Rule 440(d);
(iv) Receipt by the Commission of the mandate of a court of appeals with respect to a
judicial remand; or
(v) Certification of a ruling for interlocutory review pursuant to Rule 400(c).
87

(b) Contents of briefs. Briefs shall be confined to the particular matters at issue. Each exception to
the findings or conclusions being reviewed shall be stated succinctly. Exceptions shall be supported
by citation to the relevant portions of the record, including references to the specific pages relied
upon, and by concise argument including citation of such statutes, decisions and other authorities as
may be relevant. If the exception relates to the admission or exclusion of evidence, the substance of
the evidence admitted or excluded shall be set forth in the brief, or by citation to the record. Reply
briefs shall be confined to matters in opposition briefs of other parties; except as otherwise
determined by the Commission in its discretion, any argument raised for the first time in a reply
brief shall be deemed to have been waived.
(c) Length limitation. Except with leave of the Commission, opening and opposition briefs shall
not exceed 14,000 words and reply briefs shall not exceed 7,000 words, exclusive of pages
containing the table of contents, table of authorities, and any addendum that consists solely of
copies of applicable cases, pertinent legislative provisions or rules, and exhibits. Incorporation of
pleadings or filings by reference into briefs submitted to the Commission is not permitted. Motions
to file briefs in excess of these limitations are disfavored.
(d) Certificate of compliance. An opening or opposition brief that does not exceed 30 pages in
length, exclusive of pages containing the table of contents, table of authorities, and any addendum
that consists solely of copies of applicable cases, pertinent legislative provisions, or rules and
exhibits, is presumptively considered to contain no more than 14,000 words. A reply brief that does
not exceed 15 pages in length, exclusive of pages containing the table of contents, table of
authorities, and any addendum that consists solely of copies of applicable cases, pertinent legislative
provisions, or rules and exhibits is presumptively considered to contain no more than 7,000 words.
Any brief that exceeds these page limits must include a certificate by the party's representative, or an
unrepresented party, stating that the brief complies with the requirements set forth in paragraph (c)
of this rule and stating the number of words in the brief. The person preparing the certificate may
rely on the word count of the word-processing system used to prepare the brief.
Rule 451. Oral argument before the Commission.
(a) Availability. The Commission, on its own motion or the motion of a party or any other
aggrieved person entitled to Commission review, may order oral argument with respect to any
88

matter. Motions for oral argument with respect to whether to affirm all or part of an initial decision
by a hearing officer shall be granted unless exceptional circumstances make oral argument
impractical or inadvisable. The Commission will consider appeals, motions and other matters
properly before it on the basis of the papers filed by the parties without oral argument unless the
Commission determines that the presentation of facts and legal arguments in the briefs and record
and the decisional process would be significantly aided by oral argument.
(b) Procedure. Requests for oral argument shall be made by separate motion accompanying the
initial brief on the merits. The Commission shall issue an order as to whether oral argument is to be
heard, and if so, the time and place therefor. If oral argument is granted, the time fixed for oral
argument shall be changed only by written order of the Commission, for good cause shown. The
order shall state at whose request the change is made and the reasons for any such changes. No
visual aids may be used at oral argument unless copies have been provided to the Commission and
all parties at least five business days before the argument is to be held.
(c) Time allowed. Unless the Commission orders otherwise, not more than one half-hour per side
will be allowed for oral argument. The Commission may, in its discretion, determine that several
persons have a common interest, and that the interests represented will be considered a single side
for purposes of allotting time for oral argument. Time will be divided equally among persons on a
single side, provided, however, that by mutual agreement they may reallocate their time among
themselves. A request for additional time must be made by motion filed reasonably in advance of
the date fixed for argument.
(d) Participation of Commissioners. A member of the Commission who was not present at the oral
argument may participate in the decision of the proceeding, provided that the member has reviewed
the transcript of such argument prior to such participation. The decision shall state whether the
required review was made.
Rule 452. Additional evidence.
Upon its own motion or the motion of a party, the Commission may allow the submission of
additional evidence. A party may file a motion for leave to adduce additional evidence at any time
prior to issuance of a decision by the Commission. Such motion shall show with particularity that
such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce
89

such evidence previously. The Commission may accept or hear additional evidence, may remand the
proceeding to a self-regulatory organization, or may remand or refer the proceeding to a hearing
officer for the taking of additional evidence, as appropriate.
Rule 460. Record before the Commission.
The Commission shall determine each matter on the basis of the record.
(a) Contents of the record.
(1) In proceedings for final decision before the Commission other than those reviewing a
determination by a self-regulatory organization, the record shall consist of:
(i) All items part of the record below in accordance with Rule 350;
(ii) Any petitions for review, cross-petitions or oppositions; and
(iii) All briefs, motions, submissions and other papers filed on appeal or review.
(2) In a proceeding for final decision before the Commission reviewing a determination by a
self-regulatory organization, the record shall consist of:
(i) The record certified pursuant to Rule 420(d) by the self-regulatory organization;
(ii) Any application for review; and
(iii) Any submissions, moving papers, and briefs filed on appeal or review.
(3) In a proceeding for final decision before the Commission reviewing a determination of
the Board, the record shall consist of:
(i) The record certified pursuant to Rule 440(d) by the Board;
(ii) Any application for review; and
(iii) Any submissions, moving papers, and briefs filed on appeal or review.
(b) Transmittal of record to Commission. Within 14 days after the last date set for filing briefs or such
later date as the Commission directs, the Secretary shall transmit the record to the Commission.
90

(c) Review of documents not admitted. Any document offered in evidence but excluded by the hearing
officer or the Commission and any document marked for identification but not offered as an exhibit
shall not be considered a part of the record before the Commission on appeal but shall be
transmitted to the Commission by the Secretary if so requested by the Commission. In the event
that the Commission does not request the document, the Secretary shall retain the document not
admitted into the record until the later of:
(1) The date upon which the Commission's order becomes final, or
(2) The conclusion of any judicial review of that order.
Rule 470. Reconsideration.
(a) Scope of rule. A party or any person aggrieved by a determination in a proceeding may file a
motion for reconsideration of a final order issued by the Commission.
(b) Procedure. A motion for reconsideration shall be filed within 10 days after service of the order
complained of, or within such time as the Commission may prescribe upon motion for extension of
time filed by the person seeking reconsideration, if the motion is made within the foregoing 10-day
period. The motion for reconsideration shall briefly and specifically state the matters of record
alleged to have been erroneously decided, the grounds relied upon, and the relief sought. A motion
for reconsideration shall conform to the requirements, including the limitation on the numbers of
words, provided in Rule 154. No response to a motion for reconsideration shall be filed unless
requested by the Commission. Any response so requested shall comply with Rule 154.
Rule 490. Receipt of petitions for judicial review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2112(a)(1).
The Commission officer and office designated pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2112(a)(1) to receive copies
of petitions for review of Commission orders from the persons instituting review in a court of
appeals, are the Secretary and the Office of the Secretary at the Commission's Headquarters. Ten
copies of each petition shall be submitted. Each copy shall state on its face that it is being submitted
to the Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2112 by the person or persons who filed the petition in
the court of appeals.

91

RULES RELATING TO TEMPORARY ORDERS AND SUSPENSIONS
Rule 500. Expedited consideration of proceedings.
Consistent with the Commission's or the hearing officer's other responsibilities, every hearing
shall be held and every decision shall be rendered at the earliest possible time in connection with:
(a) An application for a temporary sanction, as defined in Rule 101(a), or a proceeding to
determine whether a temporary sanction should be made permanent;
(b) A motion or application to review an order suspending temporarily the effectiveness of an
exemption from registration pursuant to Regulations A, B, E or F under the Securities Act, 17 CFR
230.258, 230.336, 230.610 or 230.656; or,
(c) A motion to or petition to review an order suspending temporarily the privilege of appearing
before the Commission under Rule 102(e)(3), or a sanction under Rule 180(a)(1).
Rule 510. Temporary cease-and-desist orders: Application process.
(a) Procedure. A request for entry of a temporary cease-and-desist order shall be made by
application filed by the Division of Enforcement. The application shall set forth the statutory
provision or rule that each respondent is alleged to have violated; the temporary relief sought against
each respondent, including whether the respondent would be required to take action to prevent the
dissipation or conversion of assets; and whether the relief is sought ex parte.
(b) Accompanying documents. The application shall be accompanied by a declaration of facts signed
by a person with knowledge of the facts contained therein, a memorandum of points and
authorities, a proposed order imposing the temporary relief sought, and, unless relief is sought ex
parte, a proposed notice of hearing and order to show cause whether the temporary relief should be
imposed. If a proceeding for a permanent cease-and-desist order has not already been commenced, a
proposed order instituting proceedings to determine whether a permanent cease-and-desist order
should be imposed shall also be filed with the application.
(c) With whom filed. The application shall be filed with the Secretary or, if the Secretary is
unavailable, with the duty officer. In no event shall an application be filed with an administrative law
judge.
92

(d) Record of proceedings. Hearings, including ex parte presentations made by the Division of
Enforcement pursuant to Rule 513, shall be recorded or transcribed pursuant to Rule 302.
Rule 511. Temporary cease-and-desist orders: Notice; procedures for hearing.
(a) Notice: how given. Notice of an application for a temporary cease-and-desist order shall be
made by serving a notice of hearing and order to show cause pursuant to Rule 141(b) or, where
timely service of a notice of hearing pursuant to Rule 141(b) is not practicable, by any other means
reasonably calculated to give actual notice that a hearing will be held, including telephonic
notification of the general subject matter, time, and place of the hearing. If an application is made ex
parte, pursuant to Rule 513, no notice to a respondent need be given prior to the Commission's
consideration of the application.
(b) Hearing before the Commission. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this rule, hearings on an
application for a temporary cease-and-desist order shall be held before the Commission.
(c) Presiding officer: designation. The Chairman shall preside or designate a Commissioner to preside
at the hearing. If the Chairman is absent or unavailable at the time of hearing and no other
Commissioner has been designated to preside, the duty officer on the day the hearing begins shall
preside or designate another Commissioner to preside.
(d) Procedure at hearing.
(1) The presiding officer shall have all those powers of a hearing officer set forth in Rule 111
and shall rule on the admissibility of evidence and other procedural matters, including, but not
limited to whether oral testimony will be heard; the time allowed each party for the submission
of evidence or argument; and whether post-hearing submission of briefs, proposed findings of
fact and conclusions of law will be permitted and if so, the procedures for submission; provided,
however, that the person presiding may consult with other Commissioners participating in the
hearing on these or any other question of procedure.
(2) Each Commissioner present at the hearing shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to
ask questions of witnesses, if any, or of counsel.
(3) A party or witness may participate by telephone. Alternative means of remote access,
including a video link, shall be permitted in the Commission's discretion. Factors the
93

Commission may consider in determining whether to permit alternative means of remote access
include, but are not limited to, whether allowing an alternative means of access will delay the
hearing, whether the alternative means is reliable, and whether the party proposing its use has
made arrangements to pay for its cost.
(4) After a hearing has begun, the Commission may, on its own motion, or the motion of a
party, assign a hearing officer to preside at the taking of oral testimony or other evidence and to
certify the record of such testimony or other evidence to the Commission within a fixed period
of time. No recommended or initial decision shall be made by such a hearing officer.
Rule 512. Temporary cease-and-desist orders: Issuance after notice and opportunity for
hearing.
(a) Basis for issuance. A temporary cease-and-desist order shall be issued only if the Commission
determines that the alleged violation or threatened violation specified in an order instituting
proceedings whether to enter a permanent cease-and-desist order pursuant to Securities Act Section
8A(a), 15 U.S.C. 77h-1(a), Exchange Act Section 21C(a), 15 U.S.C. 78u-3(a), Investment Company
Act Section 9(f)(1), 15 U.S.C. 80a-9(f)(1), or Investment Advisers Act Section 203(k)(1), 15 U.S.C.
80b-3(k)(1), or the continuation thereof, is likely to result in significant dissipation or conversion of
assets, significant harm to investors, or substantial harm to the public interest, including, but not
limited to, losses to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, prior to the completion of
proceedings on the permanent cease-and-desist order.
(b) Content, scope and form of order. Every temporary cease-and-desist order granted shall:
(1) Describe the basis for its issuance, including the alleged or threatened violations and the
harm that is likely to result without the issuance of an order;
(2) Describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the order instituting proceedings or
any other document, the act or acts the respondent is to take or refrain from taking; and
(3) Be indorsed with the date and hour of issuance.
(c) Effective upon service. A temporary cease-and-desist order is effective upon service upon the
respondent.
94

(d) Service: how made. Service of a temporary cease-and-desist order shall be made pursuant to
Rule 141(a). The person who serves the order shall promptly file a declaration of service identifying
the person served, the method of service, the date of service, the address to which service was made
and the person who made service; provided, however, failure to file such a declaration shall have no
effect on the validity of the service.
(e) Commission review. At any time after the respondent has been served with a temporary ceaseand-desist order, the respondent may apply to the Commission to have the order set aside, limited
or suspended. The application shall set forth with specificity the facts that support the request.
Rule 513. Temporary cease-and-desist orders: Issuance without prior notice and
opportunity for hearing.
In addition to the requirements for issuance of a temporary cease-and-desist order set forth in
Rule 512, the following requirements shall apply if a temporary cease-and-desist order is to be
entered without prior notice and opportunity for hearing:
(a) Basis for issuance without prior notice and opportunity for hearing. A temporary cease-and-desist order
may be issued without notice and opportunity for hearing only if the Commission determines, from
specific facts in the record of the proceeding, that notice and hearing prior to entry of an order
would be impracticable or contrary to the public interest.
(b) Content of the order. An ex parte temporary cease-and-desist order shall state specifically why
notice and hearing would have been impracticable or contrary to the public interest.
(c) Hearing before the Commission. If a respondent has been served with a temporary cease-anddesist order entered without a prior Commission hearing, the respondent may apply to the
Commission to have the order set aside, limited, or suspended, and if the application is made within
10 days after the date on which the order was served, may request a hearing on such application.
The Commission shall hold a hearing and render a decision on the respondent's application at the
earliest possible time. The hearing shall begin within two days of the filing of the application unless
the applicant consents to a longer period or the Commission, by order, for good cause shown, sets a
later date. The Commission shall render a decision on the application within five calendar days of its
filing, provided, however, that the Commission, by order, for good cause shown, may extend the
time within which a decision may be rendered for a single period of five calendar days, or such
95

longer time as consented to by the applicant. If the Commission does not render its decision within
10 days of the respondent's application or such longer time as consented to by the applicant, the
temporary order shall be suspended until a decision is rendered.
(d) Presiding officer, procedure at hearing. Procedures with respect to the selection of a presiding
officer and the conduct of the hearing shall be in accordance with Rule 511.
Rule 514. Temporary cease-and-desist orders: Judicial review; duration.
(a) Availability of judicial review. Judicial review of a temporary cease-and-desist order shall be
available as provided in Section 8A(d)(2) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77h-1(d)(2), Section
21C(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78u-3(d)(2), Section 9(f)(4)(B) of the Investment
Company Act, 15 U.S.C. 80a-9(f)(4)(B), or Section 203(k)(4)(B) of the Investment Advisers Act,
15 U.S.C. 80b-3(k)(4)(B).
(b) Duration. Unless set aside, limited, or suspended, either by order of the Commission, a court
of competent jurisdiction, or a hearing officer acting pursuant to Rule 531, or by operation of Rule
513, a temporary cease-and-desist order shall remain effective and enforceable until the earlier of:
(1) The completion of the proceedings whether a permanent order shall be entered; or
(2) 180 days, or such longer time as consented to by the respondent, after issuance of a
briefing schedule order pursuant to Rule 540(b), if an initial decision whether a permanent order
should be entered is appealed.
Rule 520. Suspension of registration of brokers, dealers, or other Exchange Act-registered
entities: Application.
(a) Procedure. A request for suspension of a registered broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer,
government securities broker, government securities dealer, or transfer agent pending a final
determination whether the registration shall be revoked shall be made by application filed by the
Division of Enforcement. The application shall set forth the statutory provision or rule that each
respondent is alleged to have violated and the temporary suspension sought as to each respondent.
(b) Accompanying documents. The application shall be accompanied by a declaration of facts signed
by a person with knowledge of the facts contained therein, a memorandum of points and
authorities, a proposed order imposing the temporary suspension of registration sought, and a
96

proposed notice of hearing and order to show cause whether the temporary suspension of
registration should be imposed. If a proceeding to determine whether to revoke the registration
permanently has not already been commenced, a proposed order instituting proceedings to
determine whether a permanent sanction should be imposed shall also be filed with the application.
(c) With whom filed. The application shall be filed with the Secretary or, if the Secretary is
unavailable, with the duty officer. In no event shall an application be filed with an administrative law
judge.
(d) Record of hearings. All hearings shall be recorded or transcribed pursuant to Rule 302.
Rule 521. Suspension of registration of brokers, dealers, or other Exchange Act-registered
entities: Notice and opportunity for hearing on application.
(a) How given. Notice of an application to suspend a registration pursuant to Rule 520 shall be
made by serving a notice of hearing and order to show cause pursuant to Rule 141(b) or, where
timely service of a notice of hearing pursuant to Rule 141(b) is not practicable, by any other means
reasonably calculated to give actual notice that a hearing will be held, including telephonic
notification of the general subject matter, time, and place of the hearing.
(b) Hearing: before whom held. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this rule, hearings on an
application to suspend a registration pursuant to Rule 520 shall be held before the Commission.
(c) Presiding officer: designation. The Chairman shall preside or designate a Commissioner to preside
at the hearing. If the Chairman is absent or unavailable at the time of hearing and no other
Commissioner has been designated to preside, the duty officer on the day the hearing begins shall
preside or designate another Commissioner to preside.
(d) Procedure at hearing.
(1) The presiding officer shall have all those powers of a hearing officer set forth in Rule 111
and shall rule on the admissibility of evidence and other procedural matters, including, but not
limited to whether oral testimony will be heard; the time allowed each party for the submission
of evidence or argument; and whether post-hearing submission of briefs, proposed findings of
fact and conclusions of law will be permitted and if so, the procedures for submission; provided,
97

however, that the person presiding may consult with other Commissioners participating in the
hearing on these or any other question of procedure.
(2) Each Commissioner present at the hearing shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to
ask questions of witnesses, if any, or counsel.
(3) A party or witness may participate by telephone. Alternative means of remote access,
including a video link, shall be permitted in the Commission's discretion. Factors the
Commission may consider in determining whether to permit alternative means of remote access
include, but are not limited to, whether allowing an alternative means of access will delay the
hearing, whether the alternative means is reliable, and whether the party proposing its use has
made arrangements to pay for its cost.
(4) After a hearing has begun, the Commission may, on its own motion or the motion of a
party, assign a hearing officer to preside at the taking of oral testimony or other evidence and to
certify the record of such testimony or other evidence to the Commission within a fixed period
of time. No recommended or initial decision shall be made.
Rule 522. Suspension of registration of brokers, dealers, or other Exchange Act-registered
entities: Issuance and review of order.
(a) Basis for issuance. An order suspending a registration, pending final determination as to
whether the registration shall be revoked shall be issued only if the Commission finds that the
suspension is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
(b) Content, scope and form of order. Each order suspending a registration shall:
(1) Describe the basis for its issuance, including the alleged or threatened violations and the
harm that is likely to result without the issuance of an order;
(2) Describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the order instituting proceedings or
any other document, the act or acts the respondent is to take or refrain from taking; and
(3) Be indorsed with the date and hour of issuance.
(c) Effective upon service. An order suspending a registration is effective upon service upon the
respondent.
98

(d) Service: how made. Service of an order suspending a registration shall be made pursuant to Rule
141(a). The person who serves the order shall promptly file a declaration of service identifying the
person served, the method of service, the date of service, the address to which service was made and
the person who made service; provided, however, failure to file such a declaration shall have no
effect on the validity of the service.
(e) Commission review. At any time after the respondent has been served with an order suspending
a registration, the respondent may apply to the Commission or the hearing officer to have the order
set aside, limited, or suspended. The application shall set forth with specificity the facts that support
the request.
Rule 524. Suspension of registrations: Duration.
Unless set aside, limited or suspended by order of the Commission, a court of competent
jurisdiction, or a hearing officer acting pursuant to Rule 531, an order suspending a registration shall
remain effective and enforceable until the earlier of:
(a) The completion of the proceedings whether the registration shall be permanently revoked; or
(b) 180 days, or such longer time as consented to by the respondent, after issuance of a briefing
schedule order pursuant to Rule 540(b), if an initial decision whether the registration shall be
permanently revoked is appealed.
Rule 530. Initial decision on permanent order: Timing for submitting proposed findings
and preparation of decision.
Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission or hearing officer, if a temporary cease-and-desist
order or suspension of registration order is in effect, the following time limits shall apply to
preparation of an initial decision as to whether such order should be made permanent:
(a) Proposed findings and conclusions and briefs in support thereof shall be filed 30 days after
the close of the hearing;
(b) The record in the proceedings shall be served by the Secretary upon the hearing officer three
days after the date for the filing of the last brief called for by the hearing officer; and

99

(c) The initial decision shall be filed with the Secretary at the earliest possible time, but in no
event more than 30 days after service of the record, unless the hearing officer, by order, shall extend
the time for good cause shown for a period not to exceed 30 days.
Rule 531. Initial decision on permanent order: Effect on temporary order.
(a) Specification of permanent sanction. If, at the time an initial decision is issued, a temporary sanction
is in effect as to any respondent, the initial decision shall specify:
(1) Which terms or conditions of a temporary cease-and-desist order, if any, shall become
permanent; and
(2) Whether a temporary suspension of a respondent's registration, if any, shall be made a
permanent revocation of registration.
(b) Modification of temporary order. If any temporary sanction shall not become permanent under the
terms of the initial decision, the hearing officer shall issue a separate order setting aside, limiting or
suspending the temporary sanction then in effect in accordance with the terms of the initial decision.
The hearing officer shall decline to suspend a term or condition of a temporary cease-and-desist
order if it is found that the continued effectiveness of such term or condition is necessary to
effectuate any term of the relief ordered in the initial decision, including the payment of
disgorgement, interest or penalties. An order modifying temporary sanctions shall be effective 14
days after service. Within one week of service of the order modifying temporary sanctions any party
may seek a stay or modification of the order from the Commission pursuant to Rule 401.
Rule 540. Appeal and Commission review of initial decision making a temporary order
permanent.
(a) Petition for review. Any person who seeks Commission review of an initial decision as to
whether a temporary sanction shall be made permanent shall file a petition for review pursuant to
Rule 410, provided, however, that the petition must be filed within 10 days after service of the initial
decision.
(b) Review procedure. If the Commission determines to grant or order review, it shall issue a
briefing schedule order pursuant to Rule 450. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission,
opening briefs shall be filed within 21 days of the order granting or ordering review, and opposition
100

briefs shall be filed within 14 days after opening briefs are filed. Reply briefs shall be filed within
seven days after opposition briefs are filed. Oral argument, if granted by the Commission, shall be
held within 90 days of the issuance of the briefing schedule order.
Rule 550. Summary suspensions pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(k)(1)(A).
(a) Petition for termination of suspension. Any person adversely affected by a suspension pursuant to
Section 12(k)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78l(k)(1)(A), who desires to show that such
suspension is not necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors may file a sworn
petition with the Secretary, requesting that the suspension be terminated. The petition shall set forth
the reasons why the petitioner believes that the suspension of trading should not continue and state
with particularity the facts upon which the petitioner relies.
(b) Commission consideration of a petition. The Commission, in its discretion, may schedule a hearing
on the matter, request additional written submissions, or decide the matter on the facts presented in
the petition and any other relevant facts known to the Commission. If the petitioner fails to
cooperate with, obstructs, or refuses to permit the making of an examination by the Commission,
such conduct shall be grounds to deny the petition.
RULES REGARDING DISGORGEMENT AND PENALTY PAYMENTS
Rule 600. Interest on sums disgorged.
(a) Interest required. Prejudgment interest shall be due on any sum required to be paid pursuant to
an order of disgorgement. The disgorgement order shall specify each violation that forms the basis
for the disgorgement ordered; the date which, for purposes of calculating disgorgement, each such
violation was deemed to have occurred; the amount to be disgorged for each such violation; and the
total sum to be disgorged. Prejudgment interest shall be due from the first day of the month
following each such violation through the last day of the month preceding the month in which
payment of disgorgement is made. The order shall state the amount of prejudgment interest owed as
of the date of the disgorgement order and that interest shall continue to accrue on all funds owed
until they are paid.
(b) Rate of interest. Interest on the sum to be disgorged shall be computed at the underpayment
rate of interest established under Section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.
101

6621(a)(2), and shall be compounded quarterly. The Commission or the hearing officer may, by
order, specify a lower rate of prejudgment interest as to any funds which the respondent has placed
in an escrow or otherwise guaranteed for payment of disgorgement upon a final determination of
the respondent's liability. Escrow and other guarantee arrangements must be approved by the
Commission or the hearing officer prior to entry of the disgorgement order.
Rule 601. Prompt payment of disgorgement, interest and penalties.
(a) Timing of payments. Unless otherwise provided, funds due pursuant to an order by the
Commission requiring the payment of disgorgement, interest, or penalties shall be paid no later than
21 days after service of the order, and funds due pursuant to an order by a hearing officer shall be
paid in accordance with the order of finality issued pursuant to Rule 360(d)(2).
(b) Stays. A stay of any order requiring the payment of disgorgement, interest or penalties may be
sought at any time pursuant to Rule 401.
(c) Method of making payment. Payment shall be made by United States postal money order, wire
transfer, certified check, bank cashier's check, or bank money order made payable to the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The payment shall be mailed or delivered to the office designated by
this Commission. Payment shall be accompanied by a letter that identifies the name and number of
the case and the name of the respondent making payment. A copy of the letter and the instrument
of payment shall be sent to counsel for the Division of Enforcement.
Rule 630. Inability to pay disgorgement, interest or penalties.
(a) Generally. In any proceeding in which an order requiring payment of disgorgement, interest or
penalties may be entered, a respondent may present evidence of an inability to pay disgorgement,
interest or a penalty. The Commission may, in its discretion, or the hearing officer may, in his or her
discretion, consider evidence concerning ability to pay in determining whether disgorgement,
interest or a penalty is in the public interest.
(b) Financial disclosure statement. Any respondent who asserts an inability to pay disgorgement,
interest or penalties may be required to file a sworn financial disclosure statement and to keep the
statement current. The financial statement shall show the respondent's assets, liabilities, income or
other funds received and expenses or other payments, from the date of the first violation alleged
102

against that respondent in the order instituting proceedings, or such later date as specified by the
Commission or a hearing officer, to the date of the order requiring the disclosure statement to be
filed. By order, the Commission or the hearing officer may prescribe the use of the Disclosure of
Assets and Financial Information Form (see Form D-A at § 209.1 of this chapter) or any other form,
may specify other time periods for which disclosure is required, and may require such other
information as deemed necessary to evaluate a claim of inability to pay.
(c) Confidentiality. Any respondent submitting financial information pursuant to this rule or Rule
410(c) may make a motion, pursuant to Rule 322, for the issuance of a protective order against
disclosure of the information submitted to the public or to any parties other than the Division of
Enforcement. Prior to a ruling on the motion, no party receiving information as to which a motion
for a protective order has been made may transfer or convey the information to any other person
without the prior permission of the Commission or the hearing officer.
(d) Service required. Notwithstanding any provision of Rule 322, a copy of the financial disclosure
statement shall be served on the Division of Enforcement.
(e) Failure to file required financial information: sanction. Any respondent who, after making a claim of
inability to pay either disgorgement, interest or a penalty, fails to file a financial disclosure statement
when such a filing has been ordered or is required by rule may, in the discretion of the Commission
or the hearing officer, be deemed to have waived the claim of inability to pay. No sanction pursuant
to Rule 155 or 180 shall be imposed for a failure to file such a statement.
FORM D-A
17 CFR 209.1 Form D-A: Disclosure of assets and financial information.
(a) Rules 410 and 630 of the Rules of Practice (17 CFR 201.410 and 201.630) provide that under
certain circumstances a respondent who asserts or intends to assert an inability to pay disgorgement,
interest or penalties may be required to disclose certain financial information. Unless otherwise
ordered, this form may be used by individuals required to supply such information.
(b) The respondent filing Form D-A is required promptly to notify the Commission of any
material change in the answer to any question on this form.
103

(c) Form D-A may not be withheld from the interested division. A respondent making financial
information disclosures on this form after the institution of proceedings may make a motion,
pursuant to Rule 322 of the Commission's Rules of Practice (17 CFR 201.322), for the issuance of a
protective order to limit disclosure to the public or parties other than the interested division of the
information submitted on Form D-A. A request for a protective order allows the requester an
opportunity to justify the need for confidentiality. The making of a motion for a protective order,
however, does not guarantee that disclosure will be limited.
(d) No party receiving information for which a motion for a protective order has been made
may transfer or convey the information to any other person prior to a ruling on the motion without
the prior permission of the Commission or a hearing officer.
(e) A person making financial information disclosures on Form D-A prior to the institution of
proceedings, in connection with an offer of settlement or otherwise, may request confidential
treatment of the information pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. See the Commission's
Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") regulations, 17 CFR 200.83. A request for confidential
treatment allows the requester an opportunity to substantiate the need for confidentiality. No
determination as to the validity of any request for confidential treatment will be made until a request
for disclosure of the information under FOIA is received.
Form D-A
Model Disclosure of Assets and Financial Information Form
Instructions: The Commission's Rules of Practice provide that under certain circumstances a
respondent who asserts or intends to assert an inability to pay disgorgement, interest or penalties
may be required to disclose certain financial information. See Rules 410 and 630. Unless otherwise
ordered, this form may be used by individuals required to supply such information. Partnerships,
corporations or other entities should submit a financial statement, including an income statement,
balance sheet and federal tax returns for each year from the year of the earliest violation alleged
against the entity in the order instituting proceedings to the present.
The respondent filing this form is required promptly to notify the Commission of any material
change in the answer to any question on this form.
A respondent making financial information disclosures on this form or in another manner pursuant
to the requirements of Rule 410 or Rule 630 may submit the form with a motion for a protective
order pursuant to Rule 322 of the Commission's Rules of Practice. Any other person submitting this
104

form may request that the Commission afford the information submitted confidential treatment
under the Freedom of Information Act under the Commission's Freedom of Information Act
("FOIA") regulations, see 17 CFR 200.83. A request for confidential treatment allows the requester
an opportunity to justify the need for confidentiality. A request for confidential treatment does not,
however, guarantee confidentiality.
Notwithstanding any request for a protective order or for confidential treatment, copies of the
financial disclosure statement shall be served on the interested division and will be included in
the record of the proceeding. See Rule 630(d). If confidential treatment is sought, notice that a
financial disclosure statement and request for confidential treatment have been filed shall be served
on all other parties.
No party receiving information for which confidential treatment has been requested may
transfer or convey the information to any person or entity not a party to the proceeding without the
prior permission of the Commission or a hearing officer.

Rule 900. Informal procedures and supplementary information concerning adjudicatory
proceedings.
(a) Guidelines for the timely completion of proceedings.
(1) Timely resolution of adjudicatory proceedings is one factor in assessing the effectiveness
of the adjudicatory program in protecting investors, promoting public confidence in the
securities markets and assuring respondents a fair hearing. Establishment of guidelines for the
timely completion of key phases of contested administrative proceedings provides a standard for
both the Commission and the public to gauge the Commission's adjudicatory program on this
criterion. The Commission has directed that:
(i) To the extent possible, a decision by the Commission on review of an interlocutory
matter should be completed within 45 days of the date set for filing the final brief on the
matter submitted for review.
(ii) To the extent possible, a decision by the Commission on a motion to stay a decision
that has already taken effect or that will take effect within five days of the filing of the
motion, should be issued within five days of the date set for filing of the opposition to the
motion for a stay. If the decision complained of has not taken effect, the Commission's
decision should be issued within 45 days of the date set for filing of the opposition to the
motion for a stay.
(iii) Ordinarily, a decision by the Commission with respect to an appeal from the initial
decision of a hearing officer, a review of a determination by a self-regulatory organization or
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or a remand of a prior Commission
decision by a court of appeals will be issued within eight months from the completion of
briefing on the petition for review, application for review, or remand order. If the
Commission determines that the complexity of the issues presented in a petition for review,
application for review, or remand order warrants additional time, the decision of the
Commission in that matter may be issued within ten months of the completion of briefing.
(iv) If the Commission determines that a decision by the Commission cannot be issued
within the period specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this rule, the Commission may extend

114

that period by orders as it deems appropriate in its discretion. The guidelines in this
paragraph (a) confer no rights or entitlements on parties or other persons.
(2) The guidelines in this paragraph (a) do not create a requirement that each portion of a
proceeding or the entire proceeding be completed within the periods described. Among other
reasons, Commission review may require additional time because a matter is unusually complex
or because the record is exceptionally long. In addition, fairness is enhanced if the Commission's
deliberative process is not constrained by an inflexible schedule. In some proceedings,
deliberation may be delayed by the need to consider more urgent matters, to permit the
preparation of dissenting opinions, or for other good cause. The guidelines will be used by the
Commission as one of several criteria in monitoring and evaluating its adjudicatory program.
The guidelines will be examined periodically, and, if necessary, readjusted in light of changes in
the pending caseload and the available level of staff resources.
(b) Reports to the Commission on pending cases. The administrative law judges, the Secretary and the
General Counsel have each been delegated authority to issue certain orders or adjudicate certain
proceedings. See 17 CFR 200.30-1 through 200.30-18. Proceedings are also assigned to the General
Counsel for the preparation of a proposed order or opinion which will then be recommended to the
Commission for consideration. In order to improve accountability by and to the Commission for
management of the docket, the Commission has directed that confidential status reports with
respect to all filed adjudicatory proceedings shall be made periodically to the Commission. These
reports will be made through the Secretary, with a minimum frequency established by the
Commission. In connection with these periodic reports, if a proceeding pending before the
Commission has not been concluded within 30 days of the guidelines established in paragraph (a) of
this rule, the General Counsel shall specifically apprise the Commission of that fact, and shall
describe the procedural posture of the case, project an estimated date for conclusion of the
proceeding, and provide such other information as is necessary to enable the Commission to make a
determination under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this rule or to determine whether additional steps are
necessary to reach a fair and timely resolution of the matter.
(c) Publication of information concerning the pending case docket. Ongoing disclosure of information
about the adjudication program caseload increases awareness of the importance of the program,
facilitates oversight of the program and promotes confidence in the efficiency and fairness of the
115

program by investors, securities industry participants, self-regulatory organizations and other
members of the public. The Commission has directed the Secretary to publish in the first and
seventh months of each fiscal year summary statistical information about the status of pending
adjudicatory proceedings and changes in the Commission's caseload over the prior six months. The
report will include the number of cases pending before the administrative law judges and the
Commission at the beginning and end of the six-month period. The report will also show increases
in the caseload arising from new cases being instituted, appealed or remanded to the Commission
and decreases in the caseload arising from the disposition of proceedings by issuance of initial
decisions, issuance of final decisions issued on appeal of initial decisions, other dispositions of
appeals of initial decisions, final decisions on review of self-regulatory organization determinations,
other dispositions on review of self-regulatory organization determinations, and decisions with
respect to stays or interlocutory motions. For each category of decision, the report shall also show
the median age of the cases at the time of the decision, the number of cases decided within the
guidelines for the timely completion of adjudicatory proceedings, and, with respect to appeals from
initial decisions, reviews of determinations by self-regulatory organizations or the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, and remands of prior Commission decisions, the median days from
the completion of briefing to the time of the Commission’s decision.
FAIR FUND AND DISGORGEMENT PLANS
Rule 1100. Creation of Fair Fund.
In any agency process initiated by an order instituting proceedings in which the Commission or
the hearing officer issues an order requiring the payment of disgorgement by a respondent and also
assessing a civil money penalty against that respondent, the Commission or the hearing officer may
order that the amount of disgorgement and of the civil penalty, together with any funds received
pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 7246(b), be used to create a fund for the benefit of investors who were
harmed by the violation.
Rule 1101. Submission of plan of distribution; contents of plan.
(a) Submission. The Commission or the hearing officer may, at any time, order any party to
submit a plan for the administration and distribution of funds in a Fair Fund or disgorgement fund.
Unless ordered otherwise, the Division of Enforcement shall submit a proposed plan no later than
116

60 days after the respondent has turned over the funds or other assets pursuant to the Commission's
order imposing disgorgement and, if applicable, a civil money penalty and any appeals of the
Commission's order have been waived or completed, or appeal is no longer available.
(b) Contents of plan. Unless otherwise ordered, a plan for the administration of a Fair Fund or a
disgorgement fund shall include the following elements:
(1) Procedures for the receipt of additional funds, including the specification of any account
where funds will be held, the instruments in which the funds may be invested; and, in the case of
a Fair Fund, the receipt of any funds pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 7246(b), if applicable;
(2) Specification of categories of persons potentially eligible to receive proceeds from the
fund;
(3) Procedures for providing notice to such persons of the existence of the fund and their
potential eligibility to receive proceeds of the fund;
(4) Procedures for making and approving claims, procedures for handling disputed claims,
and a cut-off date for the making of claims;
(5) A proposed date for the termination of the fund, including provision for the disposition
of any funds not otherwise distributed;
(6) Procedures for the administration of the fund, including selection, compensation, and, as
necessary, indemnification of a fund administrator to oversee the fund, process claims, prepare
accountings, file tax returns, and, subject to the approval of the Commission, make distributions
from the fund to investors who were harmed by the violation; and
(7) Such other provisions as the Commission or the hearing officer may require.
Rule 1102. Provisions for payment.
(a) Payment to registry of the court or court-appointed receiver. Subject to such conditions as the
Commission or the hearing officer shall deem appropriate, a plan for the administration of a Fair
Fund or a disgorgement fund may provide for payment of funds into a court registry or to a courtappointed receiver in any case pending in federal or state court against a respondent or any other
117

person based upon a complaint alleging violations arising from the same or substantially similar facts
as those alleged in the Commission's order instituting proceedings.
(b) Payment to the United States Treasury under certain circumstances. When, in the opinion of the
Commission or the hearing officer, the cost of administering a plan of disgorgement relative to the
value of the available disgorgement funds and the number of potential claimants would not justify
distribution of the disgorgement funds to injured investors, the plan may provide that the
disgorgement funds and any civil penalty shall be paid directly to the general fund of the United
States Treasury.
Rule 1103. Notice of proposed plan and opportunity for comment by non-parties.
Notice of a proposed plan of disgorgement or a proposed Fair Fund plan shall be published in
the SEC Docket, on the SEC website, and in such other publications as the Commission or the
hearing officer may require. The notice shall specify how copies of the proposed plan may be
obtained and shall state that persons desiring to comment on the proposed plan may submit their
views, in writing, to the Commission.
Rule 1104. Order approving, modifying, or disapproving proposed plan.
At any time after 30 days following publication of notice of a proposed plan of disgorgement or
of a proposed Fair Fund plan, the Commission shall, by order, approve, approve with modifications,
or disapprove the proposed plan. In the discretion of the Commission, a proposed plan that is
substantially modified prior to adoption may be republished for an additional comment period
pursuant to Rule 1103. The order approving or disapproving the plan should be entered within 30
days after the end of the final period allowed for comments on the proposed plan unless the
Commission or the hearing officer, by written order, allows a longer period for good cause shown.
Rule 1105. Administration of plan.
(a) Appointment and removal of administrator. The Commission or the hearing officer shall have
discretion to appoint any person, including a Commission employee, as administrator of a plan of
disgorgement or a Fair Fund plan and to delegate to that person responsibility for administering the
plan. An administrator may be removed at any time by order of the Commission or hearing officer.
118

(b) Assistance by respondent. A respondent may be required or permitted to administer or assist in
administering a plan of disgorgement subject to such terms and conditions as the Commission or
the hearing officer deems appropriate to ensure the proper distribution of the funds.
(c) Administrator to post bond. If the administrator is not a Commission employee, the
administrator shall be required to obtain a bond in the manner prescribed in 11 U.S.C. 322, in an
amount to be approved by the Commission. The cost of the bond may be paid for as a cost of
administration. The Commission may waive posting of a bond for good cause shown.
(d) Administrator's fees. If the administrator is a Commission employee, no fee shall be paid to the
administrator for his or her services. If the administrator is not a Commission employee, the
administrator may file an application for fees for completed services, and upon approval by the
Commission or a hearing officer, may be paid a reasonable fee for those services. Any objections
thereto shall be filed within 21 days of service of the application on the parties.
(e) Source of funds. Unless otherwise ordered, fees and other expenses of administering the plan
shall be paid first from the interest earned on the funds, and if the interest is not sufficient, then
from the corpus.
(f) Accountings. During the first 10 days of each calendar quarter, or as otherwise directed by the
Commission or the hearing officer, the administrator shall file an accounting of all monies earned or
received and all monies spent in connection with the administration of the plan of disgorgement. A
final accounting shall be submitted for approval of the Commission or hearing officer prior to
discharge of the administrator and cancellation of the administrator's bond, if any.
(g) Amendment. A plan may be amended upon motion by any party or by the plan administrator
or upon the Commission's or the hearing officer's own motion.
Rule 1106. Right to challenge.
Other than in connection with the opportunity to submit comments as provided in Rule 1103,
no person shall be granted leave to intervene or to participate or otherwise to appear in any agency
proceeding or otherwise to challenge an order of disgorgement or creation of a Fair Fund; or an
order approving, approving with modifications, or disapproving a plan of disgorgement or a Fair
Fund plan; or any determination relating to a plan based solely upon that person's eligibility or
119

potential eligibility to participate in a fund or based upon any private right of action such person may
have against any person who is also a respondent in the proceeding.
