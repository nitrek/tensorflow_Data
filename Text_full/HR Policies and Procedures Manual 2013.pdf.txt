Faculty Responsibilities and Expectations Policy
A. Purpose of the Policy
To declare PMU guidelines with regards to Faculty Responsibilities and Expectations and ensure
uniform interpretation and application of this policy.

B. Statement:
Expectations and Responsibilities Related to Teaching
Faculty members have the primary teaching responsibilities for the courses in their college or
program. These responsibilities include selecting texts, preparing course syllabi, planning in-class
activities, constructing student assessments, keeping grade records, supervising laboratory sessions,
and holding regular office hours.

In addition, in both their professional and personal behaviour, faculty members should demonstrate
and model for their students the knowledge, abilities, and qualities of conduct and demeanour that
the university strives to instill in all of its graduates. Chief among these are the six designated
learning outcomes:







Communication: the ability to declare effectively in both English and Arabic in professional
and social situations.
Technological Competence: the ability to use modern technologies to acquire information,
declares, solve problems, and produce intended results.
Critical Thinking and Problem Solving: the ability to reason logically and creatively to make
informed and responsible decisions and achieve intended goals.
Professional Competence: the ability to perform professional responsibilities effectively in
both local and international contexts.
Teamwork: the ability to work effectively with others to accomplish tasks and achieve group
goals.
Leadership: the ability to be informed, effective, and responsible leaders in family,
community, and the Kingdom.

Human Resources - March 2013

Page 28 o150

These six learning outcomes are intended to ensure that PMU students also will possess knowledge
and abilities associated with mastery of the theoretical structures and methodologies of academic
disciplines and professional competencies. This will further enhance their ability to function
effectively as a practitioner and scholar in a selected field.

In addition to modelling the six learning outcomes, the teacher should:















Strive to be accurate, objective, and effective.
In the classroom, address topics and present materials consistent with teaching assignments
as defined in approved course objectives.
Encourage students' learning by manifesting the best academic standards of one's discipline
or profession. The appropriate role for the teacher, both in and out of the classroom, should
be as intellectual guide, counselor, and mentor.
Establish a relationship of mutual respect and trust with students. If problems arise between
teacher and student, whether regarding instructional matters or interpersonal difficulties,
both parties should attempt to resolve them through informal, direct discussions before
seeking resolution elsewhere.
Demonstrate honest academic conduct and require the same from students. The PMU
expects all students to engage in all academic pursuits in a manner that is above reproach
and to maintain academic honesty and integrity in their academic experiences both in and
out of the classroom. The best way to ensure that students will adopt and maintain such
standards of academic integrity is for those standards to be modeled by their teachers.
Assure that the evaluation of a student's academic performance reflects the student's true
achievement, through the application of criteria appropriate to the field of study and the
course.
Assure that students are free to express their opinions openly and to exchange ideas without
fear of retaliation.
Never exploit students for private advantage of any type. All forms of discrimination or
harassment should be avoided, with the understanding that bias of any kind threatens the
integrity and effectiveness of the learning environment.
Observe department, college, and university policies regarding such matters as the
statement of course objectives, examinations, office hours, course evaluations, and any
other matters related to one's teaching duties and responsibilities.

Expectations and Responsibilities Related to Scholarly and Creative Activity
The university's mission includes advancing and sharing knowledge for the improvement of public
welfare. Accordingly, faculty members have a responsibility to engage in scholarly or creative
activity, including the conduct of research, in their area of expertise. While this is applicable to all
college faculties, this area is not a primary concern of Preparatory Year Faculty.

Human Resources - March 2013

Page 29 o150

The faculty scholar should employ critical self-discipline and judgment in advancing, sharing, and
using knowledge. The scholar should adhere to the highest standards of intellectual honesty in his or
her own work, and when overseeing and evaluating the work of students and subordinates.
Research and other scholarly and creative activity should be performed in a manner that is
consistent with accepted standards of one's discipline, and with legal, professional, and university
guidelines, policies, and regulations governing such work.

Expectations and Responsibilities Related to Service
Faculty members should contribute through service to the university, the local and wider
communities, and their professional disciplines. Examples of service activities in which the faculty
member might become involved include:






Membership on department, college, university, and ad hoc committees.
Teaching continuing education or other non-credit courses.
Serving in an official capacity in a professional organization.
Uncompensated consultation in one's area of expertise for public benefit.
Sponsorship of student, professional, or honorary organizations.

Expectations and Responsibilities Related to Membership in the University and Wider
Communities



The university community

As colleagues, faculty members have responsibilities that derive from common membership in an
academic community. These include the responsibility to:
o
o
o
o

Respect and defend the right to free inquiry and the expression of one's views.

The wider community

As a member of the wider community, the faculty member has the rights and responsibilities of any
citizen. In exercising these rights, the faculty member should make it clear that he or she is acting as
an individual, either as a scholar with a particular field of expertise, or as a private citizen.

Human Resources - March 2013

Page 30 o150

Faculty members should always remember that others may identify them as associated with the
university, and that the university may be judged by their actions. In most cases there is no conflict
between exercising one's rights as a citizen and one's responsibilities as a member of the university
community. But if one's activities as a citizen might interfere with faculty responsibilities, the faculty
member should request a leave of absence, resign from his or her appointment, or limit those
activities in order to avoid interfering with one's responsibilities as a member of the university
community.

Faculty Promotion Process


The faculty promotion process deals primarily with the candidate’s achievements in the
areas of teaching, scholarly and creative activity, and service. Also, a candidate’s
achievements in these three areas should be considered in light of the degree to which they
have demonstrated mastery of the six distinctive competencies (communication,
technological competence, critical thinking and problem solving, professional competence,
teamwork, and leadership) within those three areas. The materials and information to be
reviewed in making promotion recommendations and decisions are the materials and
information that are generated through the faculty evaluation process, including the
promotion candidate's professional portfolio, student course evaluations, the Chair's or
Associate Chair's annual performance evaluation letters, and the recommendations made at
each previous point in the promotion process.

The Chair or Associate Chair, Department Promotion Committee, Dean, University Promotion
Committee (The Scientific Council), Vice Rector, and Rector make recommendations concerning
candidates for promotion. If, at any point during the promotion process, a positive recommendation
is not forwarded to the next level, the candidate will be informed in writing, in a timely manner, by
the highest-level administrator who last reviewed the candidacy.

The Chairs and Associate Chairs, Deans, and the Vice Rector for Academic Affairs will work together
to develop a promotion review timetable, including deadlines for actions by candidates and for
recommendations by individuals and groups involved in the process. Final decisions should be made

normal duties. In addition, consulting with students and colleagues, occasional lectures to university
groups and assistance with certain professional activities are recognized as part of the normal
obligations of faculty and professional staff for which no additional compensation is required.

However, paid employment outside of one’s normal faculty duties that enhances the performance of
those duties is encouraged as furthering the interest of both the individual and the university.
Consulting, professional performance, and other appropriate outside employment or activities can
contribute to the effectiveness of the faculty member as a teacher and as a productive scholar, and
can also contribute to the individual's and the institution's obligation of public service. Appropriate
paid outside employment may include teaching on a temporary part-time basis at another
institution, establishing or joining a firm or private business, or engaging in the private practice of a
professional skill.

In no case should outside employment interfere or conflict with university responsibilities or bring
about harm to the university, its students, or employees. Accordingly, the faculty member must
agree to the following guidelines:

commitment averaging more than one day per calendar week.
These activities will be scheduled so as not to interfere with regularly scheduled classes or
other faculty duties.
The faculty member will preserve the best interests of the university by avoiding any conflict
of interest.
The faculty member may not use any materials or facilities of the university in the course of
outside employment unless such use is explicitly authorized, in writing, by the Rector
The faculty member will make a reasonable effort to assure that outside employment is not
identified with the university.

Before engaging in outside employment, the faculty member must submit a written request to the
Chair or Associate Chair. The review of such requests will include consideration of any real or
apparent conflict of interest and any potential benefit to the university. Requests for outside
employment must be approved by the Associate Chair (when appropriate), the Chair, the Dean of
the College, and the Vice Rector for Academic Affairs and the Rector.

Passports, Visas and Iqama Policy
A. Purpose of the Policy
To declare PMU guidelines with regards to Passports, Visas and Iqama and ensure uniform
interpretation and application of this policy.

B. Statement:
Under the laws of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, an individual who is not a citizen of Saudi Arabia is
required to have a valid passport and to obtain a visa to enter the Kingdom and/or to leave the
Kingdom. If planning to reside and work in Saudi Arabia, the individual is required to obtain an Iqama
(residency permit), maintain its validity during his/her residency, and be under the sponsorship of
either an employer or an individual who is legally residing in Saudi Arabia. Other countries to which
an individual might wish to visit may have similar visa requirements.

Work Visa / Iqama
When PMU employs an expatriate from outside the Kingdom; the new employee must obtain a work
visa to enter Saudi Arabia under the sponsorship of PMU. This work visa is obtained by PMU and is
provided to the employee at the university’s expense. Upon arrival at the PMU, the employee must
surrender his/her passport to the Government Relations Section of the Administration Affairs
Department. The Government Relations Section then will obtain the necessary Iqama for the
employee at the university’s expense. The Iqama identifies PMU as the employee's sponsor and
must be in the possession of the employee at all times while in the Kingdom.

Dependant Visa
When PMU employs an expatriate from outside the Kingdom, the eligible dependants of the new
employee must each obtain a dependant visa to enter Saudi Arabia under the sponsorship of the
new employee. Customarily, this is done after the new employee already has been issued his/her
Iqama and is a legally-recognized resident. These dependant visas are obtained by PMU and are

Human Resources - March 2013

Page 64 o150

provided to each eligible dependant at the university’s expense. Upon their arrival at PMU site, the
eligible dependants must surrender their passports to the Government Relations Section of the
Personnel Services Department. The Government Relations Section then will add these eligible
dependants to the employee's Iqama at the university’s expense. As with the employee, each
dependant must be in possession of a copy of this Iqama at all times while in the Kingdom.

Visit Visa
In order to visit Saudi Arabia, anyone not a citizen of the Kingdom must first obtain a visit visa. If the
individual is to be sponsored by an employee of PMU, the Government Relations Section of
Administration Affairs Department will assist the employee to obtain the visit visa. All costs
associated with obtaining the visit visa will be the responsibility of the employee. In such cases, the
employee must first request permission from PMU to bring someone to the Kingdom on a visit visa
and obtain approval in accordance with the applicable Administrative Policy and Procedure. If the
individual is visiting the Kingdom at the request of PMU, all costs associated with obtaining the visit
visa will be paid by the university.

Exit/Re-Entry Visa
If an expatriate employee, or eligible dependant, desires to leave and later return to Saudi Arabia in
connection with an approved annual ticket/leave, or other approved temporary absence, the
individual must obtain single exit/ re-entry visa. The Government Relations Section of the
Administration Affairs Department will obtain the required exit/re-entry visa only upon their receipt
of an approved Leave Application Form and any fees which the employee is responsible to pay to
obtain the visa. The cost of such exit/re-entry visas required in connection with an approved leave
where PMU is also is providing the ticket will be paid by the university. If PMU is not providing the
employee or eligible dependants with a paid ticket, the employee is responsible to pay the costs to
obtain the exit/re-entry visa. These amounts will be paid directly to the Government Relations
Section.

Exit Only Visa
When an expatriate employee separates from PMU, the employee and eligible dependants will
require exit only visas in order to leave the Kingdom and be repatriated back to their point of hire.
These visas will be obtained by the Government Relations Section of the Administration Affairs
Department and any costs associated with obtaining these visas will normally be paid by PMU.

Renewal of Passports and Iqamas
While residing in the Kingdom and working for PMU, each employee and eligible dependant must
maintain the validity of his/ her passport and Iqama. The responsibility clearly rests with the

Human Resources - March 2013

Page 65 o150

employee and eligible dependants to renew these documents prior to their expiration dates. The
Government Relations Section of the Administration Affairs Department will assist in doing this and
will attempt to remind each employee in advance of the pending expirations of these documents.
Costs associated with the renewals of passports are the responsibility of the employee or eligible
dependant to pay. If the employee requests the necessary renewals of Iqamas on a timely basis,
PMU will pay all associated costs. However, if the Saudi Arabian Government or the employee's
home country's Government imposes any penalties or additional charges for late or untimely
requests for renewal, such costs will be the responsibility of the employee to pay. The cost of the
renewal of Iqama will be deducted on a pro-rata basis if employee resigns.

Penalties
It is the responsibility of the employee and eligible dependants to cancel any request for a visa that a
change in circumstances dictates is no longer needed. Any penalties imposed by the Saudi Arabian
Government that are the result of non-use or late cancellation of an approved visa will be the
responsibility of the employee to pay, unless the cancellation was made by PMU. In such instances,
the university will pay any such penalties.

the use of business English. The PMU organizational design requires that the business language is
English. This training need will be ongoing and continuous.

Training Resources
Resources for training include instructors, facilities and training materials. PMU will set aside an
annual training budget to support training programs. Support by the employee’s department is
essential since it will require the accommodation of employee’s absence from the department to
attend training programs conducted during the normal hours of work. The instructors would be a

Human Resources - March 2013

Page 90 o150

combination of both internal to PMU and external to PMU. The appropriateness of an external
resource is directly related to the type of training. PMU will carefully assess the use of external
trainers since there is a need to be aware of the university organizational culture to conduct certain
types of training. Some types of training used by private sector trainers will not be appropriate for a
University environment.

Attitude and Responsibility (Self, Manager and Organization)
Training and development of employees has different facets. The employee himself or herself has
an inherent responsibility for their own professional development. Some employees do not see
themselves as having this responsibility while others make an effort to continue to learn and
develop. PMU will encourage self development as well as initiating PMU programs. PMU has a
responsibility to provide training and professional development opportunities both at the
department level as well as the organizational level. One of the most basic forms of department
level training is “on the job” training. The PMU departments have a responsibility to provide on the
job training for all their employees. This type of training is especially needed when a new employee
joins the department. However, on the job training is an ongoing requirement especially with the
rapidly changing technology in any work area. A fundamental precondition to implement “on the
job” training is the need to have current well written job descriptions for each employee in the
department.

Annual Performance Review Policy
A. Purpose of the Policy
To declare PMU guidelines with regards to PMU Employees Annual Performance Review and ensure
uniform interpretation and application of this policy.

B. Statement:
A key element in employee development is an annual performance review. The purpose of this
annual review is:






To provide an employee feedback on their job performance during the past year
To provide guidance to an employee on the areas in which they need to improve
performance;
To identify training and development needs;
To set goals and objectives for the forthcoming year;
To provide a documented record of an annual performance review for use in administrative
decisions, such as, contract renewal.

The performance evaluation process seeks to encourage and motivate employees to do their best
while striving for fair treatment for all employees. The annual review process is to be supplemented
by an ongoing and continuous informal process of feedback by the supervisor to the employee
during the course of the year.

Evaluation of Faculty
The primary purpose for evaluating faculty performance is to improve the quality of student
learning. A secondary, but also essential, purpose is to provide a sound basis for making decisions
about promotion, salary increases, and renewal of appointment. The faculty evaluation process
described herein shall occur on an annual basis starting in the second year of employment. The
process includes self-evaluation, student evaluations, and evaluation by the Chair or Associate Chair.

Human Resources - March 2013

Page 92 o150

A comprehensive faculty evaluation report will be prepared by the Chair or Associate Chair and
provided to the faculty member annually, and a copy will be kept on file by the Chair. This evaluation
report shall consist of (1) a summary of findings from the review of the professional portfolio
(portfolio and portfolio review process described below), (2) a summary of student evaluation
results, and (3) the chair’s or associate chair’s evaluation.

Criteria for Evaluation
The PMU is committed to educating the whole person, recognizing that success in the world
depends not only on knowledge of a specific academic discipline, but also on a broader set of skills
and abilities. Accordingly, part of the distinctive character of the PMU is its commitment to six basic
learning outcomes or competencies that all students must meet in order to graduate. While all of
the courses and programs of study at PMU are designed to instill and foster these competencies, it is
acknowledged that students are most likely to achieve them as the result of seeing them exemplified
in, and practiced by their teachers and mentors. For this reason, the focus of PMU’s faculty
evaluation plan, and the basis for measuring faculty achievement, shall be the extent to which the
faculty member has demonstrated mastery of the six basic competencies within the three areas of
faculty achievement – teaching, scholarly and creative activity, and service. It should be noted that
faculty in the Preparatory Program will focus on Teaching and on Service components.

Six Distinctive Competencies
The six designated PMU competencies address what PMU graduates will need to know, and what
they must be able to do, in order to be successful in their chosen fields and to contribute to the
development of their community and the Kingdom. These competencies, therefore, should be
exemplified in the behaviour of all faculty members. The six PMU learning outcomes are:







Communication: the ability to declare effectively in both English and Arabic in professional
and social situations.
Technological Competence: the ability to use modern technologies to acquire information,
declares, solve problems, and produce intended results.
Critical Thinking and Problem Solving: the ability to reason logically and creatively to make
informed and responsible decisions and achieve intended goals.
Professional Competence: the ability to perform professional responsibilities effectively in
both local and international contexts.
Teamwork: the ability to work effectively with others to accomplish tasks and achieve group
goals.
Leadership: the ability to be informed, effective, and responsible leaders in family,
community, and the Kingdom.

Human Resources - March 2013

Page 93 o150

Three Areas of Faculty Achievement
The primary areas of responsibility to which the PMU faculty member will devote his or her efforts
are:





Teaching: Including, but not limited to, instruction in the classroom, laboratory or other
university settings; performing tasks auxiliary to teaching; advising students (for those
faculty members who participate in the university’s Academic Advising Services) and
maintaining office hours in accordance with university guidelines.
Scholarly and Creative Activity: Including, but not limited to, exploring, discovering, and
creating new knowledge and possibilities for its application.
Service: Including, but not limited to, serving on department, college, university, and ad
hoc committees; performing administrative tasks when required or requested; using
professional expertise to contribute to the welfare of the local and wider communities;
and providing leadership and support within one’s academic and professional discipline.

It should be noted that faculty in the Preparatory Program should concentrate on teaching and on
service and will be evaluated in these areas. Those in the regular college programs must look at all
three areas. Though certain of the six distinctive competencies may be more easily or logically
demonstrated within certain of the three areas of achievement, the ideal toward which all faculty
members should strive, and which should serve as the hallmark for all components of the faculty
evaluation system, shall be demonstrating each of the competencies within each of the areas of
achievement, as suggested by the following matrix:

Areas of Achievement
Distinctive Competencies
Teaching

Scholarship and
Creative Activity

Service

Communication
Technological
Competence
Critical Thinking
and Problem Solving

Self-Evaluation
Faculty self-evaluation consists of two components – the annual self-evaluation report and the
professional portfolio.


Annual Self-Evaluation Report
Starting in the second year of employment and each year thereafter, by no later than the
midpoint of the first semester, the faculty member will submit a self-evaluation report to the
Chair or Associate Chair. . In this report the faculty member from the Preparatory Year will
describe his or her activities and accomplishments in the areas of teaching and service
during the preceding year. All other faculty members will describe activities and
accomplishments in the areas of teaching, scholarly and creative activity, and service during
the preceding year. All activities or accomplishments included in the report must be
documented upon request by the Chair or Associate Chair. Forms may be obtained from the
office of the department chair or the associate department chair. A copy of this is available
in Appendix A of this policy.



Professional Portfolio
Starting in the second year of employment and each year thereafter, by no later than the
midpoint of the first semester, the faculty member will make his or her professional
portfolio available to the Chair or Associate Chair and to fellow faculty members as
explained in the section below entitled Portfolio Review. Each faculty member should begin
creating a portfolio during the first semester of employment, and it should be continually
updated and maintained. The formal contents of the portfolio should include items that
document the faculty member’s professional development and achievement. The informal
contents of the portfolio include anything else that the faculty member believes to be
relevant and appropriate regarding his or her professional development. The contents of a
typical professional portfolio are described in Appendix B of this policy.



Portfolio Review
Starting in the second year of employment and each year thereafter, by no later than the
midpoint of the first semester, the faculty member will make his or her professional
portfolio available to the Chair or Associate Chair and to those fellow faculty members
within their department or program whose contracts have previously been renewed at least
once. Criteria for portfolio review and standardized formats for recording the results of
these reviews should be developed by the faculty within each department or program in
conjunction with staff from the Professional Development Center. Reports of portfolio
reviews by fellow faculty members will be forwarded to the Chair or Associate Chair.

Human Resources - March 2013

Page 95 o150



Student Course Evaluations
Student evaluations are end-of-semester assessments of course content and instructional
performance made by the students enrolled in the course. Student course evaluations will
be conducted for all classes at the end of each semester. A generic course evaluation form
has been developed by university faculty. When warranted, individual departments or
programs will develop program-specific items to be added to the generic instrument.

Course evaluation forms are to be filled out anonymously by students during a regular class
meeting near the end of the semester. The faculty member will not be present in the
classroom while students are filling out the course evaluation form. A student or another
faculty member will return completed course evaluation forms to the office of the Chair or
Associate Chair where they will be maintained.

The results of the course evaluations for a faculty member’s classes are released to the
faculty member after semester grades have been posted.



Classroom Visitations
Unscheduled classroom visits will be conducted from time to time by the department chair
or associate chair or one of their designees. The form that will be used is found in Appendix
D of this document. The primary purpose of these unscheduled visits will be to document
classroom performance and to provide feedback to instructors to aid with professional
growth. Reports of each visit will be held in the office of the department chair or the
associate department chair. While these classroom visits will apply primarily to the
preparatory year faculty, at the discretion of the department chair or the associate,
unscheduled visits may be made on all other faculty.



Evaluation by Chair or Associate Chair
Starting in the second year of employment and each year thereafter, by no later than the
end of the first semester, using information from faculty members' self-evaluation reports,
student evaluations, and personal observations, the Chair or Associate Chair will respond to
each faculty member's performance in the areas of teaching and service for the preparatory
year teachers for the previous year. For other faculty they will look at teaching, scholarly
and creative activity and service during the preceding year. The primary aim should be to
foster improvement, and activities should be suggested for improving performance in
specific areas where the need is indicated.

Human Resources - March 2013

Page 96 o150

At the appropriate time the Chair or Associate Chair will provide feedback to the faculty
member and schedule a meeting to discuss it. A faculty member who is dissatisfied with the
ratings assigned by the Chair or Associate Chair must meet with the Chair or Associate Chair.
Other faculty members may waive the right to this meeting if the Chair or Associate Chair
also agrees.

If a faculty member remains dissatisfied with the ratings assigned by the Chair or Associate
Chair after this meeting, he or she may request a review of his or her performance by a
committee of at least three faculty members in the department whose contracts have been
renewed at least once. If a department has an insufficient number of such faculty members,
then faculty members from other departments may serve. The faculty of each department
should elect the review committee before the evaluation process begins. This committee
reviews the faculty member's performance and evaluation and makes its recommendation
to the Dean separate from the Chair's or Associate Chair's recommendation. A faculty
member dissatisfied with the Dean's resolution of the issue may undertake formal grievance
procedures.

Responsibilities
Each Vice Rector, Dean or Director is responsible for the annual performance review of the
employees in their area of responsibility. The Human Resources Department is responsible for
forwarding a performance evaluation form to the appropriate administrator prior to a staff
employee’s annual performance review date. The annual review of all faculty employees is initiated
by the Dean concerned.

Discussions with Employee
Following completion of the evaluation form, the Vice Rector, Dean or Director will discuss the
evaluation with the employee. In the event the employee disagrees with any part or wishes to
comment, the evaluated employee will note his comments on the evaluation form. Assistance will
be available from the Human Resources Department to discuss the areas of agreement and
disagreement to see if the differences might be resolved. If not, the matter will be referred to a
senior level administrator to resolve.

Records
Signed copies of the evaluations will be forwarded to the Human Resources Department for
inclusion in the employee's personnel file. The employee will receive a copy of the evaluation from
his/her Department Director before submission to the Human Resources Department.

Faculty Development Policy
A. Purpose of the Policy
To declare PMU guidelines with regards to PMU Faculty Development and ensure uniform
interpretation and application of this policy.

B. Statement:
The university’s professional development program for faculty is designed to enhance the teaching
effectiveness and scholarly growth of faculty.

Professional Development Center
PMU planned methodologies of teaching and processes of assessing student achievement are new
to the region. The emphasis will be on what students learn, rather than what teachers teach. A set of
six competencies and learning outcomes will address what PMU graduates will need to know, and
what they must be able to do, in order to be successful in their chosen fields, and to contribute to
the development of their community and the Kingdom.

It is expected that all faculty will require introduction and ongoing support in implementing the
university’s unique learning culture. Faculty will be expected and when necessary required, making
full use of the resources available to them through the PMU Professional Development Center.
Among the programs in which faculty should participate are:







Workshops and seminars
Online modules
Consultations (individual)
Consultations (department or other groups)
Colloquia
Review and guided revision of teaching materials

Human Resources - March 2013

Page 99 o150



Certificate programs to attest to faculty and staff mastery of specific competencies
(especially in assessment)

These resources will be essential for faculty of the Preparation Year Program and the Assessment
Capstone Series but they also will be important in assisting all faculties in achieving the student
centered, outcomes based pedagogy that will be characteristic of PMU.

Professional Conferences
The university will provide funding for faculty members to attend conferences each year. There will
be a limit on the number of faculty members that can attend each year. Applications are to be
submitted on the form for this purpose well in advance of the dates of the conference.

Professional Portfolio
Each faculty member should begin creating a professional portfolio during the first semester of
employment and should thereafter continually update and maintain it.

Human Resources - March 2013

Professional Development Leave Policy
A. Purpose of the Policy
To declare PMU guidelines with regards to Professional Development Leave and ensure uniform
interpretation and application of this policy.

B. Statement:
Leave Application
An employee wishing to attend a seminar, workshop or conference for the purposes of their
professional development is to submit a Professional Development Leave form to their immediate
supervisor.

Documentation
The employee is to attach all supporting documents to the application form including a description
of the nature of the activity, location, dates, copy of program, travel itinerary, and any other relevant

Faculty Conference Attendance Policy
A. Purpose of the Policy
As per PMU policies and procedures, faculties (assistant, associate and full professors) are entitled to
attend two International conferences and one regional (Middle East) conference per academic
year*. Hence, the following is the policy describing the criteria procedures and entitlements.
Criteria:
1- Faculty is eligible to apply for conference attendance after spending one calendar year at
PMU.
2- Work or part of the work to be presented must be done at PMU.
3- Author affiliation to PMU must be clearly stated on the paper.
4- Paper resulting from Research Projects funded by PMU must indicate on the footnote (first
page) the support of PMU.

Procedures:
After the paper is accepted to be presented in the conference, faculty must follow the following
procedure:
1. Submit the pre-final draft (in PDF format) of your paper to the Web Centre to be uploaded
on the PMU website. In addition, a softcopy to the Power Point presentation is highly
desirable.
2. Fill in the attached “Faculty Conference Attendance Request” form (also found on the
Intranet).
3. Submit the form to the Chair/Associate Chair who will ass his/her recommendations and
forward it to the Dean.
4. The Dean will add his recommendation and forward it to the PMU “Conference Committee”.

Human Resources - March 2013

Page 103 o150

5. The PMU “Conference Committee” will review the conference attendance request and make
its recommendation as per Conference Attendance Policy and forward it to the Rector for
Final Approval.
6. After uploading the materials mentioned in point (1) above, the approval of the Rector will
be sent to the concerned departments for implementation. (Human Resources and Budget
and Accounting Departments).

Entitlements:
1. Conference Registration Fees
2. Two-way economy class tickets to and from the conference location.
3. A maximum 5-day per Diem as per PMU policy. (PMU will not be involved or responsible for

Summer Compensation Policy
A. Purpose of the Policy
Summer compensation is paid on the Monthly pay cycle and is included with the faculty member's
regular salary
B. Statement:
1. The duties and responsibilities of faculty members during summer is the same as regular
semesters, which includes but not limited to holding office hours, participating in
committees, completing tasks assigned by the Director of Summer School, his/her designate
and PMU administration. The responsibilities will also include research and community
service.
2. The faculty will also be teaching and should adhere to PMU’s strict policy on quality teaching
with all associated responsibilities.
3. During summer, Faculty members report directly to the Director of the Summer School or
his/her designate.
4. Evening Prorated hours do not apply in summer.
5. Teaching a minimum of 6 credit hours during summer entitles the faculty member to a
minimum of two month basic salary for the duration of the summer semester irrelevant of
the duration ( 8 , 6, etc. ). So a faculty member will get the higher number either according
to the per credit hour compensation in the table above or the two month basic salary
irrelevant of the duration of summer semester. Faculty teaching lower than 6 credit hours
can benefit from this same rule but on a prorated value of their basic salary i.e. if 6 credits is
equivalent to 100% of the basic salary, then 5 credit hours is 83.3% of the basic salary. But
again the faculty member is entitled to the higher of the two numbers either from per credit
hour compensation in the table or through the minimum of basic salary equation.

B. Statement:
APPROPRIATE ADMINISTRATOR
Within one (1) week of receiving the grievance from the Director, Human Resources, the appropriate

clarification of the matter. The griever may request that they be accompanied to the meeting by
another PMU employee. A representative of the Human Resources Department will also be present

The Progressive Disciplinary Model Policy
A. Purpose of the Policy
To declare PMU guidelines with regards to The Progressive Disciplinary Model Policy and ensure
uniform interpretation and application of this policy.

B. Statement:
DEFINITION
A “progressive discipline” model as set out in this policy is a process where the objective is to the
correct the problem at an early stage through informal means. Should it not be resolved at this
informal stage then PMU will move to a formal stage, which would consist of a formal written
warning, suspension and dismissal. The progression is to a higher level of sanction by PMU giving
the employee every opportunity to correct the problem. It should be noted that not all four stages
need be followed in each case. The process will depend on the nature of the problem and the
response by the employee.

INFORMAL STAGE
Whenever there is a behavioural conduct problem and/or a job performance problem, it is
incumbent upon the employee’s immediate supervisor to meet with the employee and discuss the
problem(s). The supervisor must define the issues and also set out the remedy sought to correct the
problem or issues. This discussion is between the employee and supervisor only. There is no written
record submitted to the Human Resources Department; therefore, the process remains informal.
This stage may be repeated more than once for the same problem or similar problems.

Human Resources - March 2013

Page 141 o150

FORMAL STAGE
Should the problem(s) continue following an unsuccessful resolution at the informal stage then the
supervisor is to meet with employee and provide them a written warning setting out the problem(s)
and/or issue(s) and the remedies sought by the supervisor. This meeting will be attended by a
representative of the Human Resources Department. The written warning will be placed on the
PMU personnel file for that employee in the Human Resources Department.

It should be noted that it is not necessary to go through an informal stage to initiate the formal
stage. The supervisor is to consult with the Human Resources Department before initiating this
stage directly. The formal stage may be repeated.

Human Resources - March 2013

Page 142 o150

Suspension Policy
A. Purpose of the Policy
To declare PMU guidelines with regards to the Suspension Policy and ensure uniform interpretation
and application of this policy.

B. Statement:
Should the problem(s) that have been addressed in the informal and formal stages (or directly at the
formal stage) not be resolved then the supervisor may recommend to the appropriate Vice Rector or
Director (Human Resources Department will advise as to the appropriate administrator) that the
employee be suspended without pay for a specific period of time. This stage in the disciplinary
process is a serious stage where the employee is being advised that they are one step away from
dismissal.

Human Resources - March 2013

Page 143 o150

Dismissal Policy
A. Purpose of the Policy
To declare PMU guidelines with regards to the Dismissal Policy and ensure uniform interpretation
and application of this policy.

B. Statement:
There are two (2) types of dismissal: one is a dismissal for cause and the second is dismissal without
cause. A dismissal for cause will mean that the employee’s Employment Contract is terminated with
immediate effect and this action will attract penalty provisions that are set out in employee’s
Contract. A dismissal without cause will attract a pay in lieu of notice requirement as per the
Contract provisions. In either case, a dismissal will require a recommendation from the
Dean/Director to the Vice Rector to the Rector. Only the Rector may approve the dismissal of any
employee. The actual dismissal will be by the Dean or Director of the area concerned.

PMU reserves the right to move directly to the dismissal stage in any case that is deemed by PMU to
warrant an immediate dismissal.

technology, scientific or technological development, computer software, or other form of expression
that is in a tangible form, regardless of whether subject to protection by patent, trademark or
copyright laws, or as a trade secret related to “know how” in applying technology.

The university encourages participation by faculty in scholarly and creative and research activities,
particularly those activities that enhance the fulfilment of their faculty responsibilities and serve the
public welfare. While research conducted by university faculty members is aimed primarily at
discovery and dissemination of knowledge rather than gains from commercial application, it is
recognized that questions regarding IP rights may arise from such activities.

It is the intent of this and other policies related to IP to balance the interests of the university and
the inventor, author, or creator of IP arising from scholarly and creative and research activities
conducted by faculty members of the university. The university further seeks to ensure that
inventions, discoveries and creative works are used and controlled in an efficient and prudent
manner that will result in maximum benefit to the university and the inventor, author, or creator.

In collaboration with the university’s research committee, the university administration will
continually review and revise this and other policies related to IP. Among others, the issues
addressed by these policies include:

scope of employment; created on university time with the use of university facilities or
financial support; commissioned by the university pursuant to a signed contract; a result of
research supported by third party sponsorship.
Responsibility for costs of patenting and licensing of IP normally assumed by the university
but repaid from licensing and technology transfer activities.
