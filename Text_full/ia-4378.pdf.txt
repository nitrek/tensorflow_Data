CORRECTED ORDER INSTITUTING
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS
PURSUANT TO SECTION 203(e) OF THE
INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940,
MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING
REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

Respondent.
I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in
the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant
to Section 203(e) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) against Professional
Investment Management, Inc. (“PIM” or “Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (“Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of
these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as
to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these proceedings and the
findings contained in Section III.2, below, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of
this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 203(e) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth
below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:
1.
PIM is an Ohio corporation with its principal place of business in Columbus,
Ohio. PIM was registered with the Commission as an investment adviser from July 1, 1978 until
September 30, 2013 and from June 24, 2014 until the present.
2.
On April 15, 2016, a final judgment was entered against PIM, permanently
restraining and enjoining it from violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections
203(a), 204(a), 206(1), (2), and (4), and 207 of the Advisers Act, and Rules 204-2, 206(4)-2, and
206(4)-7 thereunder, in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Douglas
E. Cowgill, et al., Case No. 2:14-CV-396, in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Ohio.
3.
The Commission’s First Amended Complaint alleged, among other things,
that, since at least December 31, 2010, PIM reported in account statements sent to clients that its
clients held a total of approximately $7.7 million in a money market fund when, in fact, its
clients held a total of approximately $6.9 million in the fund. The Commission further alleged
that PIM attempted to disguise this shortfall by providing falsified reports to Commission staff.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest
to impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent PIM’s Offer.
Accordingly, pursuant to Section 203(e) of the Advisers Act, it is hereby ORDERED that
Respondent PIM’s registration as an investment adviser be, and hereby is, revoked.
By the Commission.
