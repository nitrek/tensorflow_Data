ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS
PURSUANT TO RULE 102(e) OF THE
COMMISSION’S RULES OF PRACTICE,
MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING
REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

In the Matter of
JULIANNE M. CHANDLER,
Respondent.
I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Julianne
M. Chandler (“Respondent”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.1
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over her and the subject matter of these
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3 below, which are admitted, Respondent
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e)
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
(“Order”), as set forth below.
1

Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that:

The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, may, by
order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has been by name
. . . [p]ermanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in
an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the violation of any provision
of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:
1.
Respondent Chandler is a resident of North Carolina. She joined Lime Energy Co.
(“Lime”) in May 2009, where she held positions as Senior Accounting Manager and Business Unit
Controller before becoming Corporate Controller in August 2011, the position she held until her
termination from the company in November 2012.
2.
Lime is a Delaware corporation that, during the relevant time period, was in the
business of planning and delivering clean energy solutions to assist clients in achieving their
energy efficiency and renewable energy goals. Its headquarters are in Newark, New Jersey.
During the relevant time period, Lime’s common stock was registered with the Commission
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and traded
on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol “LIME.” Its stock is now quoted on
OTC Link (previously “Pink Sheets”) operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc.
3.
On October 18, 2016, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York entered a Final Judgment by consent against Chandler, permanently enjoining her from
violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the
Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and aiding and abetting violations of
Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
SEC v. Lime Energy Co. et al., 1:16-CV-08088-ALC (S.D.N.Y.). Chandler was ordered to pay a
civil penalty of $25,000 and barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a
period of five years from entry of the Final Judgment.
4.
Among other things, the Commission’s Complaint alleges that Chandler
circumvented Lime’s internal accounting controls and falsified or caused to be falsified the
company’s books and records by facilitating the improper early recognition of revenue by
employees in Lime’s Utilities Division. The Complaint also alleges that Chandler participated in
the improper recognition of material amounts of revenue by Lime employees in its Public Sector
and Utilities Divisions. The Complaint further alleges that Chandler knew at the time that Lime
was trying to meet certain revenue targets and that the revenue was being recognized by Lime
employees in order to achieve those revenue goals.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent Chandler’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:
A.

Chandler is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission
as an accountant.

2

B.
After five years from the date of this order, Respondent may request that the
Commission consider her reinstatement by submitting an application (Attention: Office of
the Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as an
accountant.
By the Commission.
