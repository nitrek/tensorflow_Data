Disclosure Update and Simplification
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: We are proposing amendments to certain of our disclosure requirements that may
have become redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded, in light of other
Commission disclosure requirements, U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S.
GAAP”), International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), or changes in the information
environment. We are also soliciting comment on certain Commission disclosure requirements
that overlap with, but require information incremental to, U.S. GAAP to determine whether to
retain, modify, eliminate, or refer them to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. The proposed amendments are intended to facilitate
the disclosure of information to investors, while simplifying compliance efforts, without
significantly altering the total mix of information provided to investors. These proposals are part
of an initiative by the Division of Corporation Finance to review disclosure requirements
applicable to issuers to consider ways to improve the requirements for the benefit of investors
and issuers. We are also issuing these proposals as part of our efforts to implement title LXXII,
section 72002(2) of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act.

Introduction
A. Objective
We are proposing amendments to certain of our disclosure requirements that may have

become redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded, in light of other
Commission disclosure requirements, U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or changes in the information
environment. As discussed further below, the proposed amendments are a result of the Division
of Corporation Finance’s Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative and part of our efforts to implement
title LXXII, section 72002(2) of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act 1 (the “FAST
Act”). We are also soliciting comment on certain Commission disclosure requirements that
overlap with, but require information incremental to, U.S. GAAP 2 to determine whether to
retain, modify, eliminate, or refer them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S.
GAAP. 3 The proposals are intended to facilitate the disclosure of information to investors, while
simplifying compliance efforts, without significantly altering the total mix of information
provided to investors. 4
This release is part of a comprehensive evaluation of the Commission’s disclosure
requirements recommended in the staff’s Report on Review of Disclosure Requirements in

1

Pub. L. 114-94.

2

In this release, we refer to such requirements as “incremental” Commission disclosure requirements.

3

We refer to the proposed amendments and this additional comment solicitation collectively as “proposals.”

4

The Supreme Court in TSC v. Northway held that a fact is material if there is “a substantial likelihood that the
disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered
the ‘total mix’ of information made available.” See TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438
(1976).

9

Regulation S-K (“S-K Study”), 5 which was mandated by section 108 of the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act. 6 Based on the S-K Study’s recommendation and at the request of the
Commission Chair, the Commission staff initiated a comprehensive evaluation of the type of
information our rules require issuers to disclose, how this information is presented, where and
how this information is disclosed, and how we can better leverage technology as part of these
efforts (“Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative”). The overall objective of the Disclosure
Effectiveness Initiative is to improve our disclosure regime for both investors and issuers. This
initiative may result in the addition, 7 revision, 8 or elimination 9 of certain disclosure requirements
and seeks input on how potential changes might affect investors, issuers, efficiency, competition,
and capital formation.
In connection with the Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative, the Commission staff
requested public input. 10 In a separate concept release, 11 we are seeking public comment on

5

Report on Review of Disclosure Requirements in Regulation S-K (Dec. 2013), available at
http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2013/reg-sk-disclosure-requirements-review.pdf. Comment letters are
available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/jobs-title-i/reviewreg-sk/reviewreg-sk.shtml.

6

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, Pub. L. No. 112-106, 126 Stat. 306 (2012).

7

For example, in this release, we propose to require disclosure of changes in stockholders’ equity and dividends
per share for each class of shares, rather than only for common stock in interim periods (please refer to sections
III.C.16 and V.B.5), an issuer’s website address (please refer to section IV.B.3), and the ticker symbol of their
common equity that is publicly traded (please refer to section IV.B.4). We also propose to change the threshold
at which disclosures on dividend restrictions are provided in the audited financial statements, which may result
in additional disclosures subject to audit, internal control over financial reporting, and XBRL tagging (please
refer to section III.D.2).

8

For example, in this release, please refer to our proposals in section III.D. on overlapping requirements
proposed for integration, section IV on outdated requirements, and section V on superseded requirements.

9

For example, in this release, please refer to our proposals in section II on redundant or duplicative requirements,
section III.C on overlapping requirements proposed for deletion, section IV on outdated requirements, and
section V on superseded requirements.

modernizing certain business and financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. We have
also separately requested comment 12 on the financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-X
for certain entities other than the issuer. In addition, we have requested comment on the
proposed rules to modernize the disclosure requirements for mining properties. 13
We are also issuing this release as part of our effort to implement title LXXII, section
72002(2) of the FAST Act, which, among other things, requires the Commission to eliminate
provisions of Regulation S-K that are duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or unnecessary.
B. Scope of Proposals
The proposals, if adopted, would affect a variety of entities we regulate in different ways,
as discussed below. For ease of discussion, throughout this release, we refer to the affected
entities as issuers. The requirements under discussion may apply to entities other than issuers or
to subsets of issuers and, thus, should be referenced for their specific scope. Entities other than
issuers include significant acquirees for which financial statements are required under Rule 3-05
of Regulation S-X, 14 significant equity method investments for which financial statements are
required under Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, 15 broker-dealers, and nationally recognized
statistical rating organizations (“NRSROs”).

1. Issuers with Offerings Registered Under the Securities Act and Securities
Registered Under the Exchange Act
Because the proposals affect issuers filing forms prescribed under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act differently, our discussion is tailored accordingly. Our references to domestic
issuers encompass large accelerated filers, 16 accelerated filers, 17 and non-accelerated filers, 18 as
well as emerging growth companies 19 (“EGCs”) and smaller reporting companies 20 (“SRCs”).
In this release, we have highlighted the Commission disclosure requirements that affect SRCs

16

Under Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 [17 CFR 240.12b-2], a large accelerated filer is an issuer with an aggregate
worldwide market value of voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates of $700 million or
more, as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter. In addition, the issuer
needs to have been subject to reporting requirements for at least twelve calendar months, have filed at least one
annual report, and not be eligible to use the requirements for smaller reporting companies for its annual and
quarterly reports.

17

Under Exchange Act Rule 12b-2, an accelerated filer is an issuer with an aggregate worldwide market value of
voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates of $75 million or more, but less than $700
million, as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter. In addition, the issuer
needs to have been subject to reporting requirements for at least twelve calendar months, have filed at least one
annual report, and not be eligible to use the requirements for smaller reporting companies for its annual and
quarterly reports.

18

Although the term “non-accelerated filer” is not defined in Commission rules, we use it throughout this release
to refer to a reporting company that does not meet the definition of either an “accelerated filer” or a “large
accelerated filer” under Exchange Act Rule 12b-2.

19

An EGC is defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C.77b(a)(19)] and section 3(a)(80) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(80)] to mean an issuer with less than $1 billion in total annual gross revenues
during its most recently completed fiscal year. If an issuer qualifies as an EGC on the first day of its fiscal year,
it maintains that status until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it has
total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (2) the last day of its fiscal year following the fifth
anniversary of the first sale of its common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement; (3)
the date on which the issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt; or (4) the date on which the issuer is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” (as defined in
Exchange Act Rule 12b-2).

20

SRC is defined to mean an issuer that had a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its
most recently completed second fiscal quarter or had annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most
recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available. See Rule 405 of Regulation
C [17 CFR 230.405], Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and Item 10(f) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.10(f)].
The Commission has proposed to amend this definition. Under the proposed amendments, the $75 million
public float threshold would be increased to $250 million and the $50 million revenue threshold would be
increased to $100 million. See Amendments to Smaller Reporting Company Definition, Release No. 33-10107
(Jun. 27, 2016) [81 FR 43130].

12

differently from non-SRCs. Our references to foreign private issuers 21 encompass large
accelerated filers, accelerated filers, and non-accelerated filers, as well as EGCs. 22 More
specifically:
•

Proposals involving Regulation S-K relate only to domestic issuers 23 and foreign private
issuers that elect to file on forms used by domestic issuers.

•

Proposals involving Regulation S-X generally relate only to domestic issuers and foreign
private issuers that report under U.S. GAAP or a comprehensive body of accounting
principles other than U.S. GAAP or IFRS as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (“IASB”) 24 with a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. 25

•

Proposals involving Commission forms relate to either domestic issuers or foreign private
issuers, depending on the form under discussion. For example, proposed amendments to
the “F” series of forms 26 only affect foreign private issuers. Because foreign private
issuers may report under U.S. GAAP, Another Comprehensive Body of Accounting

21

See Rule 405 of Regulation C and Exchange Act Rule 3b-4(c) [17 CFR 240.3b-4(c)]. A foreign private issuer
is any foreign issuer other than a foreign government, except for an issuer that has more than 50 percent of its
outstanding voting securities held of record by U.S. residents and any of the following: a majority of its officers
or directors are citizens or residents of the United States; more than 50 percent of its assets are located in the
United States; or its business is principally administered in the United States.

22

Foreign private issuers may only use the scaled rules available to SRCs if they file on domestic forms under
U.S. GAAP. See Rule 8-01 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.8-01]. The proposals affect these SRCs in the
same ways as domestic SRC issuers.

23

Domestic issuers include foreign issuers that do not meet the definition of foreign private issuer.

24

Throughout this release, we refer to a comprehensive body of accounting principles other than U.S. GAAP or
IFRS as “Another Comprehensive Body of Accounting Principles.”

25

Foreign private issuers that report under IFRS must comply with the IFRS requirements for the form and
content of financial statements, rather than with the specific presentation and disclosure provisions in Articles
3A, 4, 5, 6, 6A, 7, 8, 9, 10, and certain parts of Article 3 of Regulation S-X. Where a proposal on Regulation SX also affects foreign private issuers that report under IFRS, we discuss both U.S. GAAP and IFRS.

26

For example, these forms include Forms F-1[17 CFR 239.31], F-3 [17 CFR 239.33], F-4[17 CFR 239.34], and
20-F [17 CFR 249.220f].

13

Principles with a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, or IFRS, discussion of proposals
involving F-forms includes consideration of both U.S. GAAP and IFRS, where
applicable.
Some of the proposals also affect asset-backed issuers. 27
2. Issuers Offering Securities under Regulation A
Some of our proposals affect Regulation A issuers, as follows: 28

Proposals involving the remaining rules in Article 8 of Regulation S-X would affect only
Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP. No other
proposals involving Regulation S-X would affect Regulation A issuers.
•

Proposals involving Regulation A forms may affect issuers that report under U.S. GAAP
or Canadian issuers that report under IFRS. 37 For this reason, discussion of proposals
affecting these forms includes consideration of both U.S. GAAP and IFRS, where
applicable.
In this release, we have highlighted the Commission disclosure requirements that affect

Regulation A issuers. 38
We are also soliciting comment on certain Commission disclosure requirements that
overlap with, but require information incremental to, U.S. GAAP. As discussed in section III.E,
we are not proposing amendments to this category of disclosure requirements in this release.
Rather, the comments received in response to this release may inform both potential future
Commission rulemaking and FASB standard-setting activities. One potential outcome of this
feedback is a referral of these incremental requirements to the FASB for potential incorporation
into U.S. GAAP. 39 A referral alone would have no effect on issuers. Any changes to U.S. GAAP
37

Only U.S. and Canadian issuers may rely on Regulation A and use Form 1-A. See Rule 251(b)(1) of Regulation
A [17 CFR 230.251(b)(1)]. U.S. issuers must report under U.S. GAAP. Canadian issuers may report under
U.S. GAAP or IFRS. See paragraph (a)(2) of Part F/S of Form 1-A [17 CFR 239.90], Item 7(b) of Form 1-K
[17 CFR 239.91], and Item 3 of Form 1-SA [17 CFR 239.92].

38

Statements about the effect of a proposal on Regulation A issuers throughout this release reflect that the form
and content requirements in Regulation S-X do not apply to Canadian Regulation A issuers that report under
IFRS. Please refer to section V.B.17.

39

The IASB, which is subject to oversight by the IFRS Foundation, is responsible for IFRS and establishes its
own standard-setting agenda. For further information, see http://www.ifrs.org/About-us/Pages/IFRSFoundation-and-IASB.aspx.

that may result from such a referral would be subject to FASB’s standard-setting process, as
discussed below, and would potentially affect all entities that report under U.S. GAAP, including
crowdfunding issuers and those outside the scope of our regulatory authority.
3. Issuers Regulated under the Investment Company Act
Certain proposals affect requirements applicable to issuers regulated under the
Investment Company Act, as follows:
•

Proposals involving Regulation S-K would affect business development companies to
which the regulation applies.

•

Proposals involving Regulation S-X would affect investment companies to which the
regulation applies.

•

Proposals involving Investment Company Act forms may affect investment companies,
depending on the form in question.
4. Other Entities
Certain proposals also affect requirements applicable to registered broker-dealers,

investment advisors, and NRSROs.
C. FASB-Related Considerations
1. Role of the FASB
The federal securities laws set forth the Commission’s broad authority and responsibility
to prescribe the methods to be followed in the preparation of accounts and the form and content
of financial statements to be filed under those laws, 40 as well as its responsibility to ensure that

40

See, e.g., sections 7[15 U.S.C. 77g], 19(a) [15 U.S.C. 77s(a)] and Schedule A, Items (25) and (26) of the
Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77aa(25) and (26)]; sections 3(b) [15 U.S.C. 78c(b)], 12(b) [17 CFR 78l(b)] and

16

investors are furnished with other information necessary for investment decisions. 41 To assist it
in meeting this responsibility, the Commission historically has looked to private-sector standardsetting bodies designated by the accounting profession to develop accounting principles and
standards. 42 At the time of the FASB’s formation in 1973, the Commission reexamined its
policy and formally recognized pronouncements of the FASB that establish and amend
accounting principles and standards as “authoritative” in the absence of any contrary
determination by the Commission. 43 The Commission concluded at that time that the expertise
and resources that the private sector could offer to the process of setting accounting standards
would be beneficial to investors.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 44 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) established criteria that must
be met in order for the work product of an accounting standard-setting body to be recognized as
“generally accepted.” 45 In accordance with these criteria, the Commission has designated the
FASB as the private-sector accounting standard setter for U.S. financial reporting purposes. 46 As
required under the securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Commission monitors
13(b) [17 CFR 78m(b)] of the Exchange Act; and sections 8 [15 U.S.C. 80a-8], 30(e) [15 U.S.C. 80a-29(e)],
31[15 U.S.C. 80a-30], and 38(a) [15 U.S.C. 80a-37(a)] of the Investment Company Act.

Section 108 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act amended section 19 of the Securities Act to provide that the
Commission “may recognize, as ‘generally accepted’ for purposes of the securities laws, any accounting
principles established by a standard setting body that met certain criteria.” The Commission has determined
that the FASB satisfies the criteria in section 19 and, accordingly, the FASB’s financial accounting and
reporting standards are recognized as “generally accepted” for purposes of the federal securities laws. See 2003
FASB Policy Statement.

the FASB’s ongoing compliance with the expectations and views expressed in the 2003 FASB
Policy Statement.
As the designated private-sector accounting standard setter in the United States, the
FASB seeks to undertake a transparent, public standard-setting process. 47
2. Interaction of Commission Disclosure Requirements and U.S. GAAP
Although the FASB functions as the designated private-sector accounting standard setter
in the United States, some Commission rules contain accounting and disclosure requirements. In
some cases, these Commission requirements mandate disclosures which the FASB later added to
U.S. GAAP. 48 Other Commission disclosure requirements include concepts that have been
superseded by U.S. GAAP. 49 From time to time, the Commission has reviewed and amended its
disclosure requirements to eliminate rules that became redundant, duplicative, or overlapping as
the FASB updated U.S. GAAP. 50 In keeping with this historical practice, many of the proposed
amendments revise or eliminate Commission disclosure requirements related to information that
is addressed by more recently updated U.S. GAAP requirements.
In addition, a number of Commission disclosure requirements are related, but require
information that is incremental, to U.S. GAAP. In this release, we solicit comment on certain of

those incremental Commission disclosure requirements to determine whether to retain, modify,
eliminate, or refer them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. 51 The
comments received in response to this release may inform both potential future Commission
rulemaking and FASB standard-setting activities. Future amendments to these Commission
disclosure requirements may depend on the outcome of any FASB’s standard-setting activities to
address the disclosure requirements. Our staff has discussed these requirements with the FASB
staff.
3. Current FASB Projects Concerning the Application of U.S. GAAP
The FASB maintains U.S. GAAP by updating it from time to time through its standardsetting projects. Among a number of projects on the FASB’s agenda, there are two current
standard-setting projects that we invite commenters to consider when evaluating the proposals
and providing feedback. 52 In one project, 53 the FASB has proposed amendments, which, among
other things, 54 would clarify that with respect to disclosures in the notes to the financial
statements an omission of immaterial information is not an accounting error. 55

51

The incorporation of incremental Commission disclosure requirements into U.S. GAAP may streamline
disclosures for investors and simplify requirements for issuers.

52

The FASB also has other standard-setting projects underway that may affect specific topics within this release.
Those projects are identified in the discussion of the specific topics they affect.

53

FASB Exposure Draft, Notes to Financial Statements (Topic 235): Assessing Whether Disclosures Are Material
(Sept. 24, 2015), available at:
http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage?cid=1176166402325&acceptedDisclaimer=true.

54

Among the other proposed amendments is an amendment related to the legal concept of materiality.
Commenters have expressed a range of views on the proposed amendments and their potential impact on the
volume of financial disclosures. The comment letters are available at:
http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/CommentLetter_C/CommentLetterPage&cid=1218220137090&project_id=201
5-310.

55

In 2014, the IASB amended IFRS to clarify that an entity does not have to disclose information required by
IFRS if that information would not be material. See Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 1).

19

In the other project, the FASB is addressing disclosures in interim reports. The FASB
has reached a tentative decision that disclosures about matters required to be provided in annual
financial statements should be updated in the interim report if there is a substantial likelihood
that the updated information would be viewed by a reasonable investor as significantly altering
the total mix of information available to the investor. 56
Both projects are subject to further stakeholder comment and FASB deliberation. If we
ultimately decide to eliminate or revise certain of our disclosure requirements on the basis that
U.S. GAAP requires the same or similar disclosure, these projects, if finalized, may impact
certain disclosures currently provided under Commission disclosure requirements that we
propose to eliminate or amend. In particular, for information currently provided under
Commission rules that do not contain a specified disclosure threshold, investors may receive less
information if such information is only required by U.S. GAAP and the issuer determines that
the information is not material. Throughout this release, we identify those Commission
disclosure requirements that contemplate a disclosure threshold in some manner, for example,
through the use of terms such as “material” or “significant” or through the use of bright line
disclosure thresholds.
Request for Comment
1.

Would the FASB’s projects discussed above affect our: (1) proposed amendments to
eliminate certain Commission disclosure requirements due to a U.S. GAAP requirement

56

See Minutes from FASB Board Meeting (May 29, 2014), available at:

or (2) potential referrals to the FASB of certain Commission disclosure requirements? If
so, how?
2.

Would the information provided to investors in the notes to the financial statements
change if the source of the disclosure requirement (i.e., Commission rule or U.S. GAAP)
changed? If so, how and why?

3.

Do the other proposed amendments within the FASB Exposure Draft related to notes to
the financial statements 57 impact the proposals made in this release? If so, how?

II.

Redundant or Duplicative Requirements
A. Background
In reviewing our disclosure requirements, we have preliminarily identified a number of

requirements that require substantially the same disclosures as U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or other
Commission disclosure requirements. We propose to eliminate these redundant or duplicative
Commission disclosure requirements to simplify issuer compliance efforts while providing
substantially the same information to investors. 58
The table in section II.B below describes each redundant or duplicative requirement that
we propose to eliminate and identifies the corresponding U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or Commission
disclosure requirement that requires substantially the same information.

57

See supra note 53 and 54.

Some proposed amendments, however, may be affected by certain FASB projects, as discussed in section I.C.3.

Overlapping Requirements
A. Background
We also have preliminarily identified Commission disclosure requirements that are

related to, but not the same as, U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or other Commission disclosure requirements,
which we refer to in this release as overlapping requirements. In this section, we:
•

Propose to delete Commission disclosure requirements that, as discussed further in
section III.C below, we believe: (1) require disclosures that convey reasonably similar
information to or are encompassed by the disclosures that result from compliance with
the overlapping U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or Commission disclosure requirements or (2) require
disclosures incremental to the overlapping U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or Commission disclosure
requirements and may no longer be useful to investors.

•

Propose to integrate Commission disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require
information incremental to, other Commission disclosure requirements, as discussed
further in section III.D below, or

•

Solicit comment on certain Commission disclosure requirements that overlap with, but
require information incremental to, U.S. GAAP to determine whether to retain, modify,
eliminate, or refer them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP, as
discussed further in section III.E below. 110

110

One commenter to the Regulation S-X Request for Comment recommended that we “[c]oordinate with and
encourage the FASB to complete a disclosure project that would eliminate the need for SEC-specific footnote
disclosure requirements (e.g., S-X 4-08 and 5-02) and financial statement schedules and incorporate them

29

B. Broad Considerations
Our objective with these proposals is to streamline disclosures for investors and simplify
requirements for issuers. In some cases, the proposed streamlining of overlapping disclosure
requirements would give rise to the considerations discussed below. 111
1. Disclosure Location Considerations
In some cases, the streamlining of disclosure requirements would result in the relocation
of disclosures within a filing, 112 with the following consequences:
•

Prominence Considerations – the current location of some disclosures may provide a
certain level of prominence and/or context to other disclosures located with them. The
relocation of these disclosures may affect investors by changing the prominence and/or
context of both the relocated disclosures and the remaining disclosures. Throughout this
release, we collectively refer to these consequences as “Disclosure Location –
Prominence Considerations.”

•

Financial Statement Considerations – the proposals related to some topics would result in
the relocation of disclosures from outside to inside the financial statements, subjecting
this information to annual audit and/or interim review, internal control over financial

within the US GAAP required disclosures if necessary. This commenter also noted that “US GAAP and SEC
disclosure requirements often overlap. Slight differences in requirements cause confusion about whether there
are different disclosure objectives and often result in redundancies.” See letter from Ernst & Young LLP (Nov.
20, 2015).
111

Some proposals may also be affected by certain FASB projects, as discussed in section I.C.3.

112

For example, as discussed in section III.C.1, our proposed amendments would result in the elimination of
disclosures about an issuer’s status as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) in the audited notes to the financial
statements, in reliance on disclosures within the same filing, but outside the audited financial statements. As
another example, as discussed in section III.D.2, our proposed amendments would result in the relocation of
disclosures about material restrictions on the payment of dividends in a filing from outside to within the audited
notes to the financial statements. For equity compensation plans, the proposed amendments would result in the
need to reference a different filing, as discussed in section III.C.17.

30

reporting, and XBRL tagging requirements, as applicable. The safe harbor under the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”) would not be available for
such disclosures. 113 Conversely, relocation of disclosures from inside to outside the
financial statements would have the opposite effect – namely, this information would not
be subject to annual audit and/or interim review, internal control over financial reporting,
and XBRL tagging requirements, as applicable, while the safe harbor under the PSLRA
would be available. These topics would also be subject to Disclosure Location –
Prominence Considerations. Throughout this release, we collectively refer to these
consequences as “Disclosure Location – Financial Statement Considerations.”
We refer to the foregoing considerations collectively as “Disclosure Location
Considerations.”
Request for Comment
6.

For each of the disclosures subject to Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations
discussed below:
a. Do investors benefit from the prominence of this information in its current location or
from the context these disclosures provide to other disclosures located with them?
b. Would the proposed changes to the disclosure location either benefit or adversely
affect investors or issuers? If so, how? Please be specific.
c. Should we mandate a cross-reference in the prior location of the disclosures to assist
investors in navigating the issuer’s disclosures and help maintain the prominence
and/or context of the disclosures?

113

Pub. L. 104-67, 109 Stat. 737 (1995).

31

d. Do electronic data analysis tools affect the importance of the disclosure location?
7.

For disclosures subject to Disclosure Location – Financial Statement Considerations, in
addition to the above questions about prominence, what are the benefits and costs of the
inclusion/exclusion of these disclosures in the financial statements for investors and
issuers? How important are these benefits and costs to investors and issuers? Please
quantify the benefits and costs, to the extent practicable.
2. Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations
Some overlapping requirements, while similar, are not redundant or duplicative because

one set of requirements includes a bright line disclosure threshold, while the other set of
requirements does not. 114 Where a requirement contains a bright line disclosure threshold,
matters involving amounts below that threshold are not required to be disclosed. With the
exception of disclosure requirements about major customers, as discussed in section III.E.14, the
Commission disclosure requirements we discuss contain bright line disclosure thresholds, while
the corresponding requirement does not. For these topics, the elimination of the bright line
threshold would potentially change the disclosure provided to investors. Throughout this release,
we refer to these considerations as “Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations.”

114

For example, Regulation S-K requires, as discussed in section III.E.13, disclosure of the amount of revenue
from products and services which account for 10 percent or more of consolidated revenue and, as discussed in
section III.E.15, disclosure of legal proceedings involving environmental matters that exceed 10 percent of the
issuer’s consolidated current assets. The corresponding U.S. GAAP requirements do not contain such bright
line thresholds above which disclosures would be required.

32

Request for Comment
8.

For each of the disclosures subject to Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations
discussed below, should there continue to be a bright line below which the disclosures
would not be required? Should the Commission modify the threshold? Why or why not?
a. Are there any aspects to these disclosures that warrant bright line disclosure
thresholds, as compared to other disclosures?
b. Does the bright line disclosure threshold help to ensure disclosure at an appropriate
level of detail for investors? Alternatively, does the bright line disclosure threshold
result in too much or too little detail for investors? Why or why not?
c. Are there alternative disclosure thresholds, in lieu of bright lines, that we should
consider? Would the alternative disclosure threshold change the level of information
provided to investors and the burdens and costs associated with the preparation of
these disclosures for issuers?
C. Overlapping Requirements - Proposed Deletions
This section discusses Commission disclosure requirements that we believe: (1) require

disclosures that convey reasonably similar information to or are encompassed by the disclosures
that result from compliance with the overlapping U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or Commission disclosure
requirements or (2) require disclosures incremental to the overlapping U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or
Commission disclosure requirements and may no longer be useful to investors. In these cases,
we propose to delete the specified Commission disclosure requirement.

33

1. REIT Disclosures 115
a. Undistributed Gains or Losses on the Sale of Properties
Regulation S-X 116 and U.S. GAAP 117 both set forth requirements for the presentation of
components of stockholders’ equity on the face of the financial statements. Regulation S-X
incrementally requires REITs to present undistributed gains or losses on the sale of properties
separately from other distributable earnings on their balance sheet. 118 This amount is presented
on a book basis, 119 which we do not believe is useful to investors because of the unique tax status
of REITs, as discussed below.
Specifically, REITs are not subject to entity-level taxation on the amounts distributed to
their investors. Rather, their investors are liable for taxes on these distributions, depending on
the character of the dividends (i.e., ordinary income, capital gains, or return of capital) the REIT
distributes to them. Because the amount of undistributed gains or losses required by Rule 315(a)(2) of Regulation S-X is not presented on a tax basis, this disclosure does not provide
investors with insight into the tax implications of the REIT’s distributions. Instead, the
disclosures required by Rule 3-15(c) of Regulation S-X of the tax status of distributions provide
this insight. 120

115

Please refer to the related discussions in sections III.E.1 and V.B.3.

116

See, e.g., Rule 3-15(a)(2) [17 CFR 210.3-15(a)(2)] and Rule 5-02.30 [17 CFR 210.5-02.30] of Regulation S-X.

117

See, e.g., ASC 505-10-45.

118

See Rule 3-15(a)(2) of Regulation S-X.

119

Amounts presented on a “book” basis refer to amounts determined in accordance with accounting for financial
reporting purposes (e.g., U.S. GAAP or IFRS), rather than amounts determined in accordance with federal
statutory tax law.

120

17 CFR 210.3-15(c).

34

In addition, the Commission staff has observed that, in practice, because REITs are
required to distribute 90 percent of their taxable income in order to maintain their REIT status
and often distribute more, REITs generally do not have undistributed amounts to disclose under
this requirement.
Based on the foregoing, we propose to delete Rule 3-15(a)(2).
Request for Comment
9.

Has the requirement to provide incremental disclosure about undistributed gains or
losses on the sale of properties on a book basis resulted in the disclosure of useful
information? What would the impact to investors and issuers be of a deletion of this
requirement?
b. Status as a REIT
Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X both require certain disclosures about an issuer’s

status as a REIT. Regulation S-K requires disclosure of the issuer’s form of organization, 121
significant risk factors 122 and a description of known uncertainties that are reasonably expected
to have a material effect on income. 123 Regulation S-X similarly requires disclosure in the notes
to the financial statements of the issuer’s status as a REIT. 124
Regulation S-X also requires REITs to disclose in the notes to the financial statements
their assumptions in making or not making federal income tax provisions. 125 As stated above,

121

Item 101(a)(1) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.101(a)(1)].

Rule 3-15(b) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.3-15(b)].

125

Rule 3-15(b) of Regulation S-X.

35

REITs are not subject to entity-level taxation on the amounts distributed to their investors, so
long as they maintain their REIT status. As such, for REITs, the primary assumption in making
or not making federal income tax provisions is the issuer’s continued REIT status and its
consideration of the risks affecting its continued REIT status. We believe that the disclosure
provided in response to the requirement in Regulation S-X to disclose assumptions in making or
not making federal income tax provisions is encompassed by the disclosures provided to comply
with Regulation S-K’s requirement to disclose significant risk factors and a description of known
uncertainties that are reasonably expected to have a material effect on income. In fact, because
of the overlap, issuers often repeat or expand on the note disclosures in their risk factor
disclosures, by discussing matters such as the applicable tax regulations and the consequence of
a loss in REIT status.
Based on the foregoing, we propose to delete Rule 3-15(b) of Regulation S-X. We note
that because disclosures under Regulation S-K, unlike those required by Regulation S-X, may be
provided outside of the audited financial statements, the proposed amendments give rise to
Disclosure Location – Financial Statement Considerations.
Request for Comment
10.

Does Rule 3-15(b) require disclosures that are encompassed by disclosures that result
from compliance with the overlapping provisions, as discussed above? Why or why not?

11.

Would deletion of Rule 3-15(b) as described above affect, in any material respect, the
usefulness of information that investors receive? If so, how?

36

2. Consolidation 126
a. Difference in Fiscal Periods
Regulation S-X 127 and U.S. GAAP 128 both set forth requirements about the presentation
of consolidated financial statements when the issuer and its subsidiaries have different fiscal
periods. Regulation S-X incrementally requires disclosure of the subsidiary’s fiscal year closing
date and an explanation of the necessity for using different closing dates. However, when there
is a difference in the fiscal periods of the issuer and its subsidiaries, U.S. GAAP also requires, as
stated in section II.B.2, recognition by disclosure or otherwise of the effect of intervening events
that materially affect the financial position or results of operations. 129 Because this U.S. GAAP
requirement effectively eliminates the effect of differences in the fiscal periods of the issuer and
its subsidiaries, we believe that disclosure of the subsidiary’s fiscal year closing date and an
explanation of the necessity for using different closing dates is no longer useful for investors.
We, therefore, propose to delete Rule 3A-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X.
Request for Comment
12.

Do disclosures of the subsidiary’s fiscal year closing date and the explanation of the
necessity for using different closing dates provide useful information to investors? What
would the impact to investors and issuers be of a deletion of this requirement?

126

Please refer to the related discussions in sections II.B.2, III.E.2, and V.B.4.

37

b. Changes in Fiscal Periods
Regulation S-X requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of: (1) material
changes in the fiscal periods of an issuer’s subsidiaries and (2) the manner in which the material
changes are reflected in the financial statements. 130 The corresponding requirements in U.S.
GAAP are narrower than Regulation S-X in three respects.
First, U.S. GAAP limits changes in the difference between an issuer and its subsidiary’s
fiscal periods to situations where the change is preferable. 131 Second, U.S. GAAP only sets forth
requirements related to a change or elimination of a previously existing difference in fiscal
periods, for example, when an issuer is able to obtain financial information of a subsidiary with
fiscal periods that are more consistent with, or the same as, that of the issuer. 132 Regulation S-X
is broader than U.S. GAAP in that it refers to all changes in fiscal periods, rather than only
changes to pre-existing differences in fiscal periods. Third, U.S. GAAP, unlike Regulation S-X,
specifies the manner of treatment of a change in fiscal period by requiring that the change be
reflected in the financial statements on a retrospective basis, if practicable. 133 We believe that
U.S. GAAP, in limiting potential changes, provides for more consistency in issuer financial
statements and results in better financial reporting. Thus, we propose to delete the last sentence
of Rule 3A-03(b) of Regulation S-X.

130

See Rule 3A-03(b) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.3A-03(b)].

131

ASC 810-10-45-13 states that a change in a difference in fiscal periods is a change in accounting policy, which
requires that the issuer and its auditor assert that the new accounting policy is preferable to the old one. See
ASC 250-10-45-12, Rule 8-03(b)(5) of Regulation S-X for SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering
that report under U.S. GAAP, Rule 10-01(b)(6) of Regulation S-X for non-SRCs, and Item 601(b)(16) of
Regulation S-K.

13.

Do issuers rely on the broader language in Rule 3A-03(b) as a basis to change their
subsidiaries’ fiscal periods where differences did not previously exist? Are issuers and
their auditors able to assert preferability of these changes?

14.

Does the broader language in Rule 3A-03(b) affect, in any material respect, the
usefulness of information that investors receive? If so, how?
3. Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements 134
The requirements in Regulation S-X governing repurchase and reverse repurchase

agreements were adopted in 1986, following developments at that time in the government
securities market. 135 Their primary objective was to require disclosure about the nature and
extent of registrants’ repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and the degree of risk
involved in these transactions. 136 The FASB has more recently considered requirements in this
area in response to constituent concerns in the wake of the global financial crisis. Most recently,
in 2014, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting and disclosures for repurchase
agreements and similar transactions. 137 These revisions to U.S. GAAP have resulted in
overlapping disclosure requirements, as discussed further below.

134

Please refer to the related discussion in section III.E.9.

39

a. Balance Sheet Presentation
Regulation S-X 138 and U.S. GAAP 139 both require separate presentation of repurchase
liabilities associated with repurchase agreements on the face of the balance sheet. 140 However,
because Regulation S-X, unlike U.S. GAAP, sets forth a 10 percent threshold for separate
presentation, 141 the proposed amendments give rise to Bright Line Disclosure Threshold
Considerations. We propose to delete the requirement for separate presentation in Rule 408(m)(1)(i) and the related 10 percent threshold. We would retain the requirement to include
accrued interest payables in the separately presented liability amounts. 142
b. Disaggregated Disclosures
While Regulation S-X 143 and U.S. GAAP 144 both require disaggregated disclosures about
repurchase agreements, they differ in the form and content of the disaggregated disclosures.
First, Regulation S-X and U.S. GAAP both require disaggregated disclosures of repurchase
liabilities by class of collateral and maturity interval. Regulation S-X provides a few illustrative
examples of classes, where U.S. GAAP requires an entity to determine the appropriate level of
disaggregation and classes to be presented on the basis of the nature, characteristics, and risks of
138

See Rule 4-08(m)(1)(i) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.4-08(m)(1)(i)].

139

See ASC 860-30-45-2.

140

Regulation S-X requires separate presentation of repurchase liabilities incurred pursuant to repurchase
agreements. U.S. GAAP is broader in that it includes other transactions with similar characteristics –
specifically, “transactions in which cash is obtained in exchange for financial assets with an obligation for an
opposite exchange later,” such as dollar rolls and securities lending transactions. See ASC 860-30-15-3.

141

Specifically, Regulation S-X requires separate presentation if the carrying amount (or market value, if higher
than the carrying amount or if there is no carrying amount) of the securities or other assets sold under
repurchase agreements, in the aggregate, exceeds 10 percent of total assets.

142

Please refer to the additional discussion of this requirement to include accrued interest payables in the
separately presented liability in section III.E.9 below.

143

See Rule 4-08(m)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.4-08(m)(1)(ii)].

144

See ASC 860-30-50-7.

40

the collateral pledged. Regulation S-X also specifies maturity intervals (e.g., overnight, up to 30
days), whereas U.S. GAAP permits judgment to determine an appropriate range of maturity
intervals. Further, Regulation S-X requires the disaggregated disclosure by class of collateral
and maturity interval to be combined in the form of a single table. Although U.S. GAAP is silent
about the form of disclosure, the sole example it includes of an approach to comply with its
requirements is in the form of a table that includes both classes of collateral as well as maturity
intervals similar to those required by Regulation S-X. 145
Second, Regulation S-X specifies tabular disclosure of the carrying amount of associated
assets sold under repurchase agreements disaggregated by class of asset sold and maturity
interval (e.g., overnight, up to 30 days) of the repurchase agreement. 146 Instead of a tabular
format, U.S. GAAP requires separate presentation on the transferor’s balance sheet of the
carrying amount of assets that the transferee has the right to sell or repledge. 147 U.S. GAAP also
requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of the carrying amount and balance
sheet classification of both assets pledged as collateral that the transferee does not have the right
to sell or repledge and the associated liabilities along with quantitative information about the
relationship(s) between them. 148
Despite some differences in form and content, we believe that disclosures required by
Regulation S-X convey reasonably similar information as the disclosures that result from

145

See ASC 860-30-55-4.

146

See Rules 4-08(m)(1)(ii)(A)(i) [17 CFR 210.4-08(m)(1)(ii)(A)(i)] and 4-08(m)(1)(ii)(B) [17 CFR 210.408(m)(1)(ii)(B)] of Regulation S-X.

41

compliance with the U.S. GAAP provisions discussed above, along with their accompanying
disclosure objectives and aggregation principles. 149
Third, Regulation S-X requires disaggregated disclosures of the market value of assets
sold under repurchase agreements for which unrealized changes in market value are reported in
income. 150 Although the FASB deliberated adding a requirement to disclose the market value of
these assets to U.S. GAAP, it ultimately decided against doing so due to operability concerns. 151
Based on the foregoing, we propose to delete Rule 4-08(m)(1)(ii), with the exception of
the requirement in Rule 4-08(m)(1)(ii)(A)(ii) to disclose the interest rate on repurchase liabilities,
which we would retain. We note that, because Regulation S-X, unlike U.S. GAAP, sets forth a
10 percent threshold for the disaggregated disclosures, 152 the proposed amendments give rise to
Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations.

149

U.S. GAAP requires that its minimum disclosure requirements about transactions such as repurchase
agreements be supplemented as necessary to meet certain disclosures objectives (e.g., providing investors with
an understanding of how transfers of financial assets affect an issuer’s financial statements) and aggregation
principles (e.g., presentation in a manner that clearly and fully explains the transferor’s risk exposure related to
the transferred financial assets and any restrictions on the assets of the entity). See ASC 860-10-50.

150

See Rules 4-08(m)(1)(ii)(A)(i) and 4-08(m)(1)(ii)(B) of Regulation S-X. These rules, however, do not require
disclosure of the carrying amount and market value of securities and other assets for which unrealized changes
in market value are reported in current income or which have been obtained under reverse repurchase
agreements. This scope is narrower than that for the U.S. GAAP requirement to separately present carrying
amounts, which applies to all assets sold under repurchase agreements.

Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Repurchase-to-Maturity
Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures.

152

Specifically, Regulation S-X requires the tabular disclosures if the carrying amount (or market value, if higher
than the carrying amount) of the securities or other assets sold under repurchase agreements, other than
securities or other assets for which for which unrealized changes in market value are reported in current income
or have been obtained under reverse repurchase agreements, in the aggregate, exceeds 10 percent of total assets.

differ in certain respects from Rule 4-08(m). Should we refer any of the disclosure
requirements in Rule 4-08(m) to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP?
If so, which ones and why?

17.

Would revision of Rule 4-08(m) as described above affect, in any material respect, the
usefulness of information that investors receive? If so, how?
c. Collateral Policy
Regulation S-X 153 requires disclosure of the issuer’s policy with regard to taking

possession of assets purchased under reverse repurchase agreements. U.S. GAAP requires
disclosure of the issuer’s policy for requiring collateral or other security. 154 Although U.S.
GAAP is not as specific as Regulation S-X about taking possession of collateral, we believe
Regulation S-X requires disclosures that are encompassed by the disclosures that result from
compliance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, we propose to delete this requirement in Rule 408(m)(2)(i)(B)(1).

Regulation S-X, unlike U.S. GAAP, requires these disclosures when the aggregate
carrying amount of reverse repurchase agreements exceeds 10 percent of total assets. As such,
these differences also give rise to Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations.

possession of collateral. Would elimination of Rule 4-08(m)(2)(i)(B)(1) affect, in any
material respect, the usefulness of information that investors receive? If so, how?
4. Derivative Accounting Policies
Regulation S-X 155 and U.S. GAAP 156 both require disclosure in the notes to the financial

statements of accounting policies for certain derivative instruments. Regulation S-X applies to:
(1) derivative financial instruments, as defined under U.S. GAAP, and (2) derivative commodity
instruments such as commodity futures, swaps, and options that are permitted to be settled in
cash or with another financial instrument, to the extent such instruments are not within the
definition of derivative financial instruments. For both types of instruments, Regulation S-X
requires, where material, disclosure of the accounting policies; the criteria required to be met for
each accounting method used; the accounting method used if those criteria are not met; the

155

See Rule 4-08(n) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.4-08(n)] and Note 2(b) to Rule 8-01 of Regulation S-X [17
CFR 210.8-01]. Rule 4-08(n) applies to non-SRCs and Note 2(b) to Rule 8-01 applies to SRCs and Regulation
A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP.

method used to account for terminations of derivatives designated as hedges or derivatives used
to affect the terms, fair values, or cash flows of a designated item; the method used to account for
derivatives when the designated item matures, is sold, is extinguished, or is terminated; and how
the derivative instruments are reported in the financial statements.
U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of accounting principles and methods that materially
affect the financial statements, including those involving a selection from existing acceptable
alternatives, and important judgments about the appropriateness of the principles. 157 We believe
that these U.S. GAAP principles call for reasonably similar information as the corresponding
requirements in Regulation S-X, as they require disclosure of the accounting method applied to
each aspect of a material derivative transaction from inception to termination.
In addition, for derivative financial instruments, as defined under U.S. GAAP, U.S.
GAAP requires disclosure of how and why the issuer uses derivative instruments, how the
derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and how they affect the
financial statements. 158 Although Regulation S-X is more detailed than U.S. GAAP, the
specificity in Regulation S-X stemmed, in part, from the absence of a comprehensive accounting
model for derivatives when the Commission adopted these disclosure requirements. 159 Since

No. 33-7386, Financial Reporting Release No. 48, (Jan. 31, 1997).
In this adopting release, the Commission stated that in the absence of comprehensive accounting literature,
registrants have developed accounting practices for options and complex derivatives by analogy to the limited
amount of literature that does exist. The Commission also noted that those analogies are complicated because
under existing accounting literature, there are at least three distinctively different methods of accounting for
derivatives (e.g. fair value accounting, deferral accounting and accrual accounting). The Commission further

that time, the FASB has adopted an accounting model for derivative financial instruments, as
defined under U.S. GAAP. 160 Because U.S. GAAP limits the options for accounting for
derivatives, we believe that the additional specific disclosure requirements in Rule 4-08(n) are no
longer applicable.
Based on the foregoing, we propose to delete Rule 4-08(n) and Note 2(b) to Rule 8-01.

5. Distributable Earnings for Registered Investment Companies
Regulation S-X 161 and U.S. GAAP 162 both require registered investment companies to
present certain components of capital on their balance sheet. Regulation S-X incrementally
specifies that, as part of this presentation, three components of distributable earnings must be
separately presented on the balance sheet: (1) net investment income, (2) net realized gains
(losses) on investment transactions, and (3) net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in value of
investments. 163 Regulation S-X requires these amounts to be presented on a book basis, which
we do not believe is useful to investors of registered investment companies. Similar to REITs, as
discussed in section III.C.1, registered investment companies are generally structured such that
they are not subject to entity-level taxation on the amounts distributed to their investors. As
such, the book basis amounts required to be presented under Regulation S-X do not provide
investors with insight into the tax implications of registered investment company distributions.
Rather, the requirement in U.S. GAAP to disclose the components of distributable earnings on a
tax basis in the notes to the financial statements 164 provides this insight.
Based on the foregoing, we propose to amend Rule 6-04.17 to require presentation of the
total, rather than the components, of distributable earnings on the balance sheet. We also
propose to delete the requirement in Rule 6-09.7 for parenthetical disclosure of undistributed net

6. Insurance Companies 166
a. Liability Assumptions
Regulation S-X 167 and U.S. GAAP 168 both require disclosure in the notes to the financial

statements of assumptions for insurance liabilities stated at present value. Regulation S-X,
unlike U.S. GAAP, specifically identifies three assumptions (interest rates, mortality, and
withdrawals) for disclosure about the liability for future policy benefits. U.S. GAAP, however,

Would deletion of the requirement in Rule 7-03(a)(13)(b) for disclosures of the above
three assumptions affect, in any material respect, the usefulness of information that
investors receive? If so, how?
b. Reinsurance Transactions
Regulation S-X 170 and U.S. GAAP 171 both require disclosures in the notes to the financial

statements about the nature of reinsurance contracts. Regulation S-X specifically requires
disclosure of the nature and effect of material nonrecurring reinsurance transactions. 172 We
believe this provision requires disclosures that are encompassed by the disclosures that result
from compliance U.S. GAAP and Regulation S-K. Specifically, although U.S. GAAP does not
explicitly refer to nonrecurring reinsurance transactions, it requires disclosure of all reinsurance
transactions, meaning that nonrecurring and recurring transactions would be included in the
disclosures. In addition, Item 303(a)(3)(i) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of any unusual
or infrequent events or changes, which may include the nature and effect of material
nonrecurring reinsurance transactions.
Based on the foregoing, we propose to delete Rule 7-03(a)(13)(c). We note that because
disclosures required by Item 303(a)(3)(i), unlike those required by Regulation S-X, may be

transactions. Should we refer disclosure requirements specifically about the nature and

U.S. GAAP?
7. Interim Financial Statements – Material Events Subsequent to the End of the
Most Recent Fiscal Year
Regulation S-X requires disclosure, in interim financial statements, of material events

subsequent to the end of the most recent fiscal year. 173 As discussed below, we believe that
these provisions require disclosures that are encompassed by the disclosures that result from
compliance with U.S. GAAP and Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K (or Item 9 of Form 1-A and
Item 1 of Form 1-SA for Regulation A issuers), in combination.
Specifically, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of a number of items occurring in the
interim periods after the end of the most recent fiscal periods, including changes in accounting
173

See Rule 8-03(b)(2) [17 CFR 210.8-03(b)(2)] and Rule 10-01(a)(5) [17 CFR 210.10-01(a)(5)] of Regulation SX. Rule 8-03(b)(2) applies to SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP
and Rule 10-01(a)(5) applies to non-SRCs.

50

principles, changes in estimates, disposals, business combinations, and disclosures about
segments, fair value, and pensions. 174 Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K (or Item 9 of Form 1-A
and Item 1 of Form 1-SA for Regulation A issuers) require disclosure of: (1) material changes in
the issuer’s financial condition and results of operations, (2) unusual or infrequent events that
materially affect income and any other significant components of revenues or expenses that, in
the issuer’s judgment, should be described in order to understand its interim results of operations,
and (3) known trends that are reasonably expected to have a material effect on the financial
statements. 175
Rule 10-01(a)(5) incrementally requires disclosure of the status of long-term contracts
and changes in capitalization, including significant new borrowings or modification of existing
financing arrangements. Although Regulation S-K does not specify these two items, they would
be required under Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K (or Item 9 of Form 1-A and Item 1 of Form 1SA for Regulation A issuers), if material, as discussed above.
Based on the foregoing, we propose to delete the requirements to disclose material events
subsequent to the end of the most recent fiscal year in Rule 8-03(b)(2) and Rule 10-01(a)(5). We
note that because disclosures required by Item 303(b) (or Item 9 of Form 1-A and Item 1 of Form
1-SA for Regulation A issuers), unlike those required by Regulation S-X, may be provided
outside of the interim financial statements, the proposed amendments give rise to Disclosure

8. Interim Financial Statements – Changes in Accounting Principles 176
Regulation S-X requires disclosure in the notes to the interim financial statements of the

date of any material accounting change. 177 We believe this information is unnecessary because
U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the accounting change in the period of the change. 178 We,
therefore, propose to delete these requirements in Rule 8-03(b)(5) and Rule 10-01(b)(6).

9. Interim Financial Statements – Pro Forma Business Combination
Information 179
Regulation S-X 180 and U.S. GAAP 181 both require supplemental pro forma information
about business combinations in the notes to interim financial statements. These disclosure
requirements differ in two ways: (1) scope and (2) the line items required to be disclosed.
Notwithstanding these differences, we believe that U.S. GAAP and Item 9.01 of Form 8-K result
in reasonably similar disclosures as the corresponding requirements in Regulation S-X.
First, with respect to scope, Regulation S-X requires disclosure of pro forma
information for significant business combinations for SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2
offering that report under U.S. GAAP and material business combinations for non-SRCs. U.S.
GAAP, on the other hand, does not qualify the size of the business combinations to which pro
forma information requirements apply. Accordingly, the requirements in U.S. GAAP would
apply to the same or a greater number of business combinations and, thus, subsume the scope of
the corresponding requirements in Regulation S-X.
Second, with respect to the line items required to be disclosed, Regulation S-X requires
disclosure of pro forma revenue, net income, net income attributable to the issuer, and net
income per share. Regulation S-X also requires SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2
offering that report under U.S. GAAP to disclose pro forma income from continuing operations.

179

Please refer to the related discussion in section V.B.6.

180

See Rule 8-03(b)(4) [17 CFR 210.8-03(b)(4)] and Rule 10-01(b)(4) [17 CFR 210.10-01(b)(4)] of Regulation SX. Rule 8-03(b)(4) specifically applies to SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under
U.S. GAAP, while 10-01(b)(4) applies to non-SRCs.

181

See ASC 270-10-50-7, which refers to ASC 805-10-50-2h.3 for purposes of interim disclosures.

53

U.S. GAAP only requires disclosure of pro forma revenue and earnings. This difference resulted
from changes to U.S. GAAP for which Regulation S-X was not conformed, as discussed below.
The Commission originally adopted Rule 8-03(b)(4) and Rule 10-01(b)(4) to require in
interim financial statements the same pro forma business combination disclosures provided in
annual financial statements under Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 16,
Business Combinations. 182 In 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141, Business Combinations (“SFAS No. 141”), which required these
pro forma disclosures in interim financial statements and superseded APB Opinion No. 16;
however, Regulation S-X was not updated at that time to eliminate the duplication with U.S.
GAAP. In 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R (revised 2007), Business Combinations
(“SFAS No. 141R”), which required fewer pro forma line items – namely, only revenue and
earnings – than previously required under SFAS No. 141, in part to converge with IFRS. 183
As a result of these changes, issuers are required to disclose more pro forma information
about business combinations in interim periods than in annual periods, 184 even though
Regulation S-X generally imposes fewer obligations with regard to interim financial
statements. 185 Moreover, Rule 8-03(b)(4) requires SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2
182

In the proposing release, the Commission noted that the proposed rule would require disclosure of pro forma
data in connection with business combinations accounted for on a purchase basis similar to that required in
annual statements by APB No. 16. See Interim Financial Data Proposals to Increase Disclosure, Release No.
33-5549 (Dec. 19, 1974) [40 FR 1079].

183

SFAS No. 141R, paragraph B426.

184

See ASC 805-10-50-2h.3.

185

For example, Article 8 and Article 10 of Regulation S-X permit the presentation of condensed financial
statements, do not require audits of interim financial statements, allow issuers to assume that a user has read the
preceding year’s audited financial statements, permit omission of details of accounts that have not changed
significantly since the audited balance sheet date, and permit omission of the disclosures required by Rule 4-08
of Regulation S-X.

offering that report under U.S. GAAP to present more line items than the corresponding
requirement in Rule 10-01(b)(4) for non-SRCs, even though Commission disclosure
requirements, as a general matter, provide certain accommodations for SRCs 186 and Regulation
A issuers.
In addition, we believe Item 9.01 of Form 8-K mitigates at least in part the absence of a
U.S. GAAP requirement to present pro forma earnings per share, as it requires SRCs and nonSRCs to file, within approximately 75 days after the transaction, pro forma financial information
for significant acquisitions, including earnings per share, through the issuer’s most recently filed
balance sheet. We note, however, this pro forma financial information would not cover the same
periods as the pro forma information required under Rule 8-03(b)(4) and Rule 10-01(b)(4). 187
Based on the foregoing, we propose to delete the requirements for pro forma financial
information in interim filings for business combinations in Rule 8-03(b)(4) and Rule 10-01(b)(4).
Request for Comment
35.

Would elimination of the specific requirements discussed above to disclose the line items
pro forma income from continuing operations, net income attributable to the issuer, and
net income per share affect, in any material respect, the usefulness of information that
investors receive? If so, how? Do the pro forma disclosures in Form 8-K sufficiently

186

For example, SRCs are required to present only two, rather than three, years of financial statements and are not
required to present selected financial data in accordance with Item 301 of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.301].

187

For example, for a significant acquisition that occurs on September 1, 2015, the Form 8-K would contain pro
forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the six months ended June 30, 2015 and
2014. Under Rule 8-03(b)(4) and Rule 10-01(b)(4), however, the Form 10-Q for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 would be required to include pro forma disclosures for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 and 2014.

55

substitute for the loss of these specific line items, despite the differences in timing
discussed above?
10. Interim Financial Statements – Dispositions 188
For significant dispositions, Regulation S-X requires SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a
Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP to disclose in the notes to the financial statements
pro forma revenue, income from continuing operations, net income, net income attributable to
the issuer, and net income per share for all interim periods presented, as though the disposition
occurred at the beginning of the periods. 189 There are two types of dispositions: (1) those that
meet the definition of discontinued operations and (2) all others (hereafter referred to as “other
dispositions”).
U.S. GAAP requires that the effects of discontinued operations be isolated and separately
presented on the income statement on a retrospective basis, 190 thereby obviating the need for pro
forma information for discontinued operations in the notes to the financial statements.
For other dispositions, we believe that the disclosures required by U.S. GAAP and Item
9.01 of Form 8-K results in reasonably similar disclosures as the pro forma disclosures mandated
by Rule 8-03(b)(4). Specifically, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of pre-tax profit and pre-tax
profit attributable to the parent for individually significant dispositions for all interim periods
presented. 191 However, U.S. GAAP does not contain an equivalent to the requirement in Rule 8-

188

Please refer to the related discussion in section II.B.14.

189

See Rule 8-03(b)(4) of Regulation S-X.

190

See ASC 205-20-45.

191

See ASC 270-10-50-7, which refers to ASC 360-10-50-3A for purposes of interim disclosures. ASC 360-1050-3A is effective for public business entities on a prospective basis to: (1) all disposals (or classifications as
held for sale) of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15,

56

03(b)(4) to disclose pro forma revenues as if the other disposal occurred at the beginning of the
periods presented.
We believe Item 9.01 of Form 8-K provides some mitigation, as it requires SRCs to file
within four business days after a significant disposition, pro forma financial information,
including revenue, income from continuing operations, and income per share, through the most
recently filed balance sheet date. We note, however, this pro forma financial information would
not cover the same periods as the separate results required under Rule 8-03(b)(4). 192
In addition, Rule 8-03(b)(4) requires SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering
that report under U.S. GAAP to disclose more information about dispositions in interim periods
than in annual periods, 193 even though Regulation S-X, as noted above, generally imposes fewer
obligations with regard to interim financial statements. Moreover, Rule 8-03(b)(4) requires
SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP to disclose
more extensive information about other dispositions than is required of non-SRCs, 194 even
though Commission disclosure requirements, as a general matter, provide certain scaled
disclosure accommodations for SRCs. 195

2014, and interim periods within those years and (2) all businesses that, on acquisition, are classified as held for
sale that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those
years. Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been
reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance.
192

193

For example, for a significant disposal that occurs on August 3, 2015, the Form 8-K filed by August 7, 2015,
would contain pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the three months
ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, as if the disposal had occurred on January 1, 2014. In contrast, Rule 803(b)(4) would require pro forma disclosures in the September 30, 2015 interim financial statements, filed on
Form 10-Q by November 16, 2015, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, as if the disposal
had occurred at the beginning of each period presented.

Would elimination of the specific requirement discussed above to disclose pro forma
revenue affect, in any material respect, the usefulness of information that investors
receive? If so, how? Do the pro forma disclosures in Form 8-K sufficiently substitute for
this specific line item, despite the differences in timing discussed above?
11. Segments
Item 101(b) of Regulation S-K 196 requires disclosure of segment financial information,

restatement of prior periods when reportable segments change, and discussion of interim
segment performance that may not be indicative of current or future operations. U.S. GAAP 197
and Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K 198 require similar disclosures. In fact, Item 101(b) explicitly
permits issuers to cross-reference between the notes to the financial statements and the
description of business to avoid duplicative disclosures about segments. We, therefore, propose
to delete Item 101(b). We note that because these disclosures (or the cross-reference to the notes
to the financial statements) are located in the business section of the filing, while the

198

17 CFR 229.303(b). Specifically, Instruction 4 of Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K, which addresses interim
periods, requires that the registrant’s discussion of material changes in results of operations shall identify any
significant elements of the registrant’s income or loss from continuing operations which do not arise from or are
not necessarily representative of the registrant’s ongoing business. The introduction paragraph to Item 303(b)
also states that the interim discussion and analysis shall include a discussion of material changes in those items
specifically listed in paragraph (a) of the Item. Since paragraph (a) indicates that where in a registrant’s
judgment a discussion of segment information or of other subdivisions of the registrant’s business would be
appropriate to an understanding of such business, the discussion shall focus on each relevant, reportable
segment or other subdivision of the business and on the registrant as a whole, the requirement in Item 101(b)(2)
of Regulation S-K is duplicative of Item 303 requirements.

to Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations.
Regulation A issuers are similarly required to cross-reference to their segment disclosures
under U.S. GAAP or IFRS. 199 We also propose to delete Item 7(b) of Form 1-A. We note that
because the cross-reference to the notes to the financial statements is located in the business
section of the filing, while the corresponding disclosures are in the notes to the financial
statements, its elimination also gives rise to Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations.
12. Geographic Areas 200
a. Financial Information
Regulation S-K 201 requires disclosure of financial information by geographic area. U.S.
GAAP requires similar disclosures. 202 In fact, Item 101(d)(2) explicitly permits issuers to crossreference between the notes to the financial statements and the description of business to avoid
duplicative disclosures about geographic areas. We, therefore, propose to delete Item 101(d)(1)
and Item 101(d)(2). 203 We note that because these disclosures (or the cross-reference to the
notes to the financial statements) are located in the business section of the filing, while the
corresponding disclosures are in the notes to the financial statements, their elimination gives rise
to Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations.

Two commenters on the Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative recommended that Item 101(d)(1) and Item
101(d)(2) be deleted given the overlap with ASC 280. See letters from the Disclosure Effectiveness Working
Group of the Federal Regulation of Securities Committee and the Law & Accounting Committee of the
American Bar Association (“ABA”) (Mar. 6, 2015) and Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, U.S.
Chamber of Commerce (“CCMC”) (July 29, 2014).

b. Risks and Dependence
Item 101(d)(3) of Regulation S-K requires disclosures of any risks associated with an
issuer’s foreign operations and any segment’s dependence on foreign operations. We believe
that Item 101(d)(3) requires disclosures that are largely encompassed by the disclosures that
result from compliance with other parts of Regulation S-K. Specifically, Item 503(c) of
Regulation S-K requires disclosure of significant risk factors. Although Item 101(d)(3) is more
expansive than Item 503(c) in its requirement to disclose “any” risk, rather than “significant” risk
factors, we believe that disclosure of “significant” risk factors provides appropriate disclosure to
investors and disclosure of “any” risk is not necessary.
In addition, Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of trends and uncertainties
by segment, if appropriate to an understanding of the issuer as a whole, which would include
disclosure of a segment’s dependence on foreign operations. 204 We, therefore, propose to delete
Item 101(d)(3). 205 We note that because these disclosures are located in the business section of
the filing, while the corresponding disclosures are in the risk factors and management’s
discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) sections, their elimination gives rise to Disclosure Location
– Prominence Considerations.

Would deletion of the requirements in Item 101(d)(3) affect, in any material respect, the
usefulness of information that investors receive? If so, how?

204

The proposed amendment to add a reference to “geographic areas” to Item 303(a), as discussed in section
III.D.3, would also help ensure disclosure of a segment’s dependence on foreign operations.

205

One commenter on the Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative observed that material disclosures about geographic
areas would already be provided under Item 303 of Regulation S-K. See letter from CCMC (July 29, 2014).

13. Seasonality
Regulation S-K 206 and U.S. GAAP 207 both require disclosures about seasonality. As
discussed below, we believe that these provisions in Instruction 5 to Item 303(b) (“Instruction
5”) and Item 101(c)(1)(v) require disclosures that convey reasonably similar information as the
disclosures that result from compliance with U.S. GAAP and other parts of Regulation S-K, in
combination.
a. Interim Disclosures
Instruction 5 and U.S. GAAP both require disclosures about seasonality in interim
periods. Accordingly, we propose to delete Instruction 5. We note that because U.S. GAAP
requires seasonality disclosures in the financial statements, whereas Instruction 5 requires
disclosure in MD&A, its elimination gives rise to Disclosure Location – Prominence
Considerations. With the proposed amendments, issuers may also be less willing to voluntarily
supplement the required disclosures in the notes to the financial statements with forward-looking
information because note disclosures are not subject to safe harbor protections under the PSLRA.
Request for Comment
38.

Would the unavailability of the PSLRA safe harbor in this instance affect issuers or
investors? If so, how? What disclosures, if any, are currently provided to voluntarily
supplement the required disclosures above? Would issuers cease to provide these
voluntary disclosures if we delete Instruction 5? If so, would such a change affect the
information available to investors?

206

See Instruction 5 to Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K. This disclosure is required where the effect is material.
See also Item 101(c)(1)(v) [17 CFR 229.101(c)(1)(v)] of Regulation S-K.

207

See ASC 270-10-45-11.

61

b. Annual Disclosures
Item 101(c)(1)(v) requires annual seasonality disclosure. Seasonality, by definition,
relates to variations within annual periods, so the effects of seasonality are not evident in annual
financial statements. We, therefore, believe that interim seasonality disclosures required under
U.S. GAAP, as discussed above, are more useful to investors than annual seasonality disclosures.
Item 101(c)(1)(v), unlike U.S. GAAP, incrementally requires seasonality disclosure at the
segment level, to the extent material to an understanding of the business as a whole. However,
Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of results of operations, liquidity, and capital
resources in interim periods at the segment level, when appropriate to an understanding of the
business. 208 Accordingly, we believe Item 303(b), in conjunction with U.S. GAAP, would result
in reasonably similar disclosures as Item 101(c)(1)(v) about the effects of seasonality on an
issuer’s financial statements at the segment level, if material and appropriate to an understanding
of the business.
Based on the foregoing, we propose to delete Item 101(c)(1)(v). We note that because
these disclosures are located in the business section and MD&A, while the corresponding
disclosures are in MD&A and the notes to the financial statements, their elimination gives rise to
Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations. With the proposed amendments, issuers may
also be less willing to voluntarily supplement the required disclosures in the notes to the
financial statements with forward-looking information because note disclosures are not subject to
safe harbor protections under the PSLRA.

208

Specifically, Item 303(b) requires discussion of material changes in the items listed in Item 303(a). Item 303(a)
requires discussion at the reportable segment level where appropriate to an understanding of the business.

the information available to investors?
14. Research and Development Activities
a. Domestic Issuers
Regulation S-K requires disclosures, if material, of the amount spent on research and

development activities for all years presented. 209 Although Regulation S-K uses terms that differ
from U.S. GAAP, 210 we believe U.S. GAAP results in reasonably similar disclosures as this
requirement.
First, Regulation S-K refers to the “amount spent,” while U.S. GAAP refers to “costs
charged to expense” or “costs incurred.” We note, however, that the Regulation S-K adopting
release used the term “expense” when discussing this requirement. 211
Regulation S-K also uses the term “company-sponsored,” but U.S. GAAP does not.
However, the Regulation S-K adopting release specified that the amount of company-sponsored
209

See Item 101(c)(1)(xi) of Regulation S-K for non-SRCs and Item 101(h)(4)(x) of Regulation S-K for SRCs.
Item 101(c)(1)(xi) only requires this disclosure by non-SRCs if material.

210

See ASC 730-10-50-1 and ASC 730-20-50-1.

211

See Adoption of Disclosure Regulation and Amendments of Disclosure Forms and Rules, Release No. 33-5893
(Dec. 23, 1977) [42 FR 65554].

63

research and development expenses to be disclosed should be determined in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, suggesting no difference in scope was intended. 212
In addition, Regulation S-K refers to “customer-sponsored” research and development
activities, while U.S. GAAP refers to “research and development performed on behalf of others.”
Because U.S. GAAP is broader in its reference to all other parties, rather than only customers,
the disclosures required by U.S. GAAP would encompass those required by Regulation S-K.
Further, Item 101(c)(1)(xi) only refers to customer-sponsored “research activities” rather
than research and development activities. However, we do not believe this difference is
substantive because Item 101(h)(4)(x) refers to “research and development activities” and it was
intended to “parallel” Item 101(c)(1)(xi). 213
Based on the foregoing, we propose to delete Item 101(c)(1)(xi) of Regulation S-K and
Item 101(h)(4)(x) of Regulation S-K. We note that because the Item 101(c)(1)(xi) disclosures
are located in the business section of the filing, while the corresponding disclosures are in the
notes to the financial statements, their elimination gives rise to Disclosure Location –
Prominence Considerations. With the proposed amendments, issuers may also be less willing to
voluntarily supplement the required disclosures in the notes to the financial statements with
forward-looking information because note disclosures are not subject to safe harbor protections
under the PSLRA.

b. Foreign Private Issuers
Item 5.C of Form 20-F requires foreign private issuers to describe their research and

development policies, where significant, and disclose the amount spent on company-sponsored
research and development activities. We propose to delete the requirement to disclose the
amount spent, as foreign private issuers are already required to disclose the amount of research
and development expenses in the notes to the financial statements. 214 We note that, in certain
circumstances, IFRS requires amounts spent on development be capitalized as an intangible
asset, instead of expensed. 215 However, although Commission disclosure requirements use terms
different from IFRS, for the same reasons discussed above about differences between
Commission disclosure requirements and U.S. GAAP terminology, we believe IFRS results in
reasonably similar disclosures as this requirement. We also note that because the Item 5.C
214

Paragraph 126 of IAS 38, Intangible Assets, requires foreign private issuers that report under IFRS to disclose
the aggregate amount of research and development expenses in the notes to their financial statements. Foreign
private issuers that report under U.S. GAAP or Another Comprehensive Body of Accounting Principles with a
reconciliation to U.S. GAAP are also required to disclose the amount of research and development expenses in
the notes to their financial statements, as discussed above.

215

See paragraph 57 of IAS 38, Intangible Assets.

65

disclosures are located in the operating and financial review and prospects section of Form 20-F,
while the corresponding disclosures are in the notes to the financial statements, their elimination
gives rise to Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations. With the proposed amendments,
issuers may also be less willing to voluntarily supplement the required disclosures in the notes to
the financial statements with forward-looking information because note disclosures are not
subject to safe harbor protections under the PSLRA.

so, would such a change affect, in any material respect, the usefulness of the information

c. Regulation A Issuers
Form 1-A requires Regulation A issuers to disclose, if material, the amount spent on

research and development activities for all years presented. 216 This requirement is based on the
216

Item 7(a)(1)(iii) of Form 1-A.

requirement in Regulation S-K. Accordingly, Regulation A issuers that report under either U.S.
GAAP or IFRS will provide substantially the same information in the notes to their financial
statements, as described above. We, therefore, propose to delete Item 7(a)(1)(iii) of Form 1-A.
We note that because the Item 7(a)(1)(iii) disclosures are located in the business section of Form
1-A, while the corresponding disclosures are in the notes to the financial statements, their
elimination gives rise to Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations. With the proposed
amendments, issuers may also be less willing to voluntarily supplement the required disclosures
in the notes to the financial statements with forward-looking information because note
disclosures are not subject to safe harbor protections under the PSLRA.

15. Warrants, Rights, and Convertible Instruments 217
Regulation S-K requires disclosure on Form S-1 or Form 10 of the amount of common

equity subject to outstanding options, warrants, or convertible securities, when the class of

common equity has no established United States public trading market. 218 U.S. GAAP more
broadly requires disclosure of the terms of significant contracts to issue additional shares, the
number of shares authorized for certain equity awards, 219 and, in the calculation of diluted
earnings per share, the weighted-average incremental shares that would be issued from the
assumed exercise or conversion of options, warrants, and convertible securities. 220 As such, we
propose to delete Item 201(a)(2)(i) of Regulation S-K. We note that because Item 201(a)(2)(i)
disclosures are located with related information about the potential dilution of equity for which
there is no established United States public trading market, such as the amount of common
equity that is being publicly offered which could have a material effect on the market price of the
issuer’s common equity, while the corresponding disclosures are in the notes to the financial
statements, the proposed amendments give rise to Disclosure Location – Prominence
Considerations.

ASC 260-10-50. U.S. GAAP also requires disclosure of amounts not included in the calculation of diluted
earnings per share because exercise or conversion of the securities would have had an antidilutive effect in the
period. In aggregate, these amounts may be similar to, but not the same as, those required by Item 201(a)(2)(i)
of Regulation S-K, as U.S. GAAP determines the incremental shares as a weighted average based on the period
outstanding during the year and assumes that cash received from the assumed exercise or conversion is used to
repurchase outstanding shares.

16. Dividends
Item 201(c)(1) of Regulation S-K 221 requires disclosure of the frequency and amount of
cash dividends declared for the two most recent fiscal years and any subsequent interim period.
Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X requires annual disclosure of the amount of dividends per share and
in the aggregate for each class of shares and changes in stockholders’ equity for each period for
which an income statement is required to be filed, but does not apply to interim periods. We
propose to add requirements to Rule 8-03 and Rule 10-01 to mandate that Rule 3-04 be applied
to interim periods. These proposed amendments would provide disclosure of the amount of
dividends in interim periods, similar to Item 201(c)(1). In addition, the frequency of dividends
would be evident from this disclosure. 222
Based on the foregoing, we propose to delete the requirement in Item 201(c)(1) to
disclose the frequency and amount of cash dividends declared. We also propose to delete the
reference to dividends in Instruction 2 to Item 201 to conform to the deletion of Item
201(c)(1). 223
Extending Rule 3-04 disclosures to interim periods may create some additional burden
for issuers. However, we expect this burden would be minimal, as the required information is

These proposed amendments also address certain inconsistencies between Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X [17

currently required in Part III of Form 10-K, 226 Item 11 of Form S-1, Item 9 of Form 10, and Item
10 of Schedule 14A. 227 In 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based
Payment (“SFAS No. 123R”), which resulted in disclosures that overlap with Item 201(d). 228
Regulation S-K incrementally requires: (1) for options, warrants, or rights assumed in a
business combination, disclosure of the number of securities to be issued upon exercise and the
weighted-average exercise price 229 and (2) disclosure of any formula for calculating the number
of securities available for issuance under the plan. 230 Item 201(d) further provides instructions
about the aggregation of equity compensation plan disclosures. Although these requirements and
instruments are not explicitly contained in U.S. GAAP, we believe that the U.S. GAAP
requirement to provide disclosures to enable investors to understand the nature and terms of
equity compensation arrangements and the potential effects of those arrangements on
shareholders 231 would results in reasonably similar disclosures.
Regulation S-K also incrementally requires disaggregation of information between equity
compensation plans approved by security holders and those not approved by security holders.
226

There was previously uncertainty regarding whether this disclosure should appear both in Part II, Item 5 and
Part III, Item 12 of Form 10-K. The staff of the Division Corporation Finance has provided guidance to clarify
that the general reference to Item 201 of Regulation S-K in Part II, Item 5 does not include Item 201(d). Issuers
therefore provide the Item 201(d) disclosure in response to Part III, Item 12, which specifically references Item
201(d). See Division of Corporation Finance CD&I 106.01 available at
http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/regs-kinterp.htm. As with any staff guidance referenced in this

The Commission adopted these requirements in 2001 232 before the major national securities
exchanges required listed issuers to have, with limited exceptions, shareholder approved plans. 233
Because the major exchanges 234 now have such requirements, we believe disaggregation of the
disclosures about the plans in this manner is no longer useful to investors. 235
Based on the foregoing, we propose to delete Item 201(d) and the references to it in Part
III of Form 10-K and Item 10(c) of Schedule 14A. 236 These proposed amendments would not
affect the disclosures related to new plans or modifications of existing plans subject to
shareholder action. 237 We note that because disclosures required by Item 201(d) are located with
related information about the issuer’s common equity and related stockholder matters, while the
corresponding disclosures are in the notes to the financial statements, the proposed amendments
give rise to Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations. In particular, as a result of the

investors? If so, how? What disclosures, if any, are currently provided to voluntarily
supplement the required disclosures above? Would issuers cease to provide these
voluntary disclosures if we delete Item 201(d)? If so, would such a change affect the
information available to investors?

53.

Non-listed issuers and, in limited circumstances, listed issuers, 239 are not required to have
shareholder approved plans. Should we retain the requirements in Item 201(d) for these
situations? Why or why not?

238

The proposal to delete the Item 201(d) requirements from Schedule 14A would also result in such information
being omitted from information statements filed on Schedule 14C disclosing adoption of an equity
compensation plan when shareholder consents are not being solicited.

239

See, e.g., supra note 233.

18. Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges
Regulation S-K requires issuers that register debt securities to disclose the historical and
pro forma ratios of earnings to fixed charges. 240 Regulation S-K also requires issuers that
register preference equity securities to disclose the historical and pro forma ratio of combined
fixed charges and preference dividends to earnings (collectively, “ratio of earnings to fixed
charges”). 241 Regulation S-K further requires the filing of an exhibit setting forth the
computation of any ratio of earnings to fixed charges. 242 These requirements only apply to nonSRCs.243 In addition, Instruction 7 to “Instructions as to Exhibits” of Form 20-F requires foreign
private issuers to disclose how any ratio of earnings to fixed charges presented in the filing was
calculated. As discussed further below, U.S. GAAP and IFRS require disclosure of many of the
components of this ratio, as well as information from which other ratios that convey reasonably
similar information about an issuer’s ability to meet its financial obligations may be computed.
The Commission first adopted the requirement to present a ratio of earnings to fixed
charges in 1954 in connection with the adoption of Form S-9, a short-form registration statement
for registration of non-convertible, fixed-interest debt. 244 An issuer was required to have a
minimum coverage ratio before it was permitted to use Form S-9. To demonstrate eligibility, the
issuer was required to disclose the ratio in its filing. The Commission rescinded Form S-9 in

240

74

1976. However, the Commission added a requirement to disclose the ratio in certain other
forms, although use of those forms was not contingent upon a minimum coverage ratio. 245
In 1980, the Commission issued a concept release that requested comment on whether the
requirements for the presentation of historical and pro forma ratios should be retained or
deleted. 246 Responses from commenters were mixed with a substantial number of commenters
supporting retention of the requirement. Although they did not discuss specific reasons for their
support, commenters “pointed out the disclosure as an analytical tool and a method for showing
trends.” 247
However, today, there are a variety of analytical tools available to investors that may
accomplish a similar objective as the ratio of earnings to fixed charges. 248 This ratio measures
the issuer’s ability to service fixed financing expenses – specifically, interest expense, including
management’s approximation of the portion of rent expense that represents interest expense, and
preference dividend requirements – from earnings. Other ratios that accomplish similar
objectives include other variations of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, 249 the interest
coverage ratio, 250 and the debt-service coverage ratio, 251 which can be calculated based on
information readily available in the financial statements.

248

See letter from Ernst & Young (Sept. 11, 2012) on the S-K Study, which states that the ratio of earnings to fixed
charges “appears an anachronism in the age of sophisticated financial modeling and analysis, facilitated by the
wealth of data available from issuer financial statements.” See also letter from CCMC (July 29, 2014).

249

Other variations of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges include alternative earnings measures such as earnings
before interest and taxes and alternative fixed charges measures such as total lease payments and one-third of
lease payments (to approximate the interest component in lease payments).

250

The interest coverage ratio is often calculated as earnings before interest and taxes divided by interest payments.

75

Further, the requirement to disclose the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, as opposed to
the various components (e.g., income, interest expense, lease expense) of this ratio that investors
may use as desired, may place undue emphasis on this particular measure. Commenters to the
1980 concept release observed shortcomings in the measure, such as the lack of uniformity of
computation and the failure of the ratio to give effect to principal payments on debt and lease
obligations. 252 Unlike other ratios, however, certain components of the ratio of earnings to fixed
charges, such as the portion of rent expense that represents interest 253 and the amortization of
capitalized interest, are not readily available elsewhere.
Moreover, while debt agreements may contain fixed charge coverage covenants, 254 debt
investors often negotiate contractual agreements with issuers to obtain financial information to
meet their needs, 255 which may be more relevant and useful than a prescribed disclosure of a
251

The debt-service coverage ratio is often calculated as operating income divided by total debt service.

252

See Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges, supra note 247.

253

In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16, Leases, which is effective on January 1, 2019, with early application
permitted in certain circumstances. Under IFRS 16, interest expense will be recognized for all leases with a
term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. In February 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU No. 2016-02”), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, with early application permitted. Under ASU No. 2016-02, leases with a term of more
than 12 months will be classified into one of two types, with one type requiring recognition of an interest
expense component (a finance lease) and the other type requiring recognition of lease expense without separate
recognition of interest expense (an operating lease). Like IFRS 16, interest expense will not be recognized on
leases with a term less than 12 months. Interested parties may still need to estimate the portion of lease expense
that is viewed to represent interest for operating leases in order to determine the components of the ratio of
earnings to fixed charges, which will be facilitated by disclosure of the weighted-average discount rate for
operating leases required by ASU No. 2016-02.

Request for Comment
54.

As stated above, certain components of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, such as the
portion of rent expense that represents interest and the amortization of capitalized
interest, are not readily available elsewhere.
a. Are there any other components to the ratio of earnings to fixed charges that are not
readily available in the notes to the financial statements?
b. For the components of the ratio that are not readily available in the notes to the
financial statements, could they be estimated using information in the notes to the
financial statements? If so, would estimation be burdensome for investors? How

defined in the issuers’ debt instruments. For investors in such instruments, a metric that is tied to a contractually
defined covenant test is more useful than the SEC-mandated disclosure. Importantly, our experience is that
market participants in unregistered debt offerings – initial purchasers as well as institutional investors – do not
generally request or require that the SEC-prescribed ratio of earnings to fixed charges be included in the
offering document; instead, issuers disclose one or more interest coverage ratios or similar financial metrics that
are calculated with reference to the instruments governing the securities being offered.

consistent would these methods and estimates be compared to the methods used and
amounts estimated by issuers?
19. Invitations for Competitive Bids
Item 601(b)(26) 257 and Item 512(d) 258 of Regulation S-K both set forth disclosure
requirements for competitive bids. However, Item 601(b)(26) differs from Item 512(d) in that it
requires disclosure about the invitation of the competitive bid, whereas Item 512(d) requires
issuers to undertake to distribute prior to opening bids a reasonable number of prospectuses and
to amend the registration statement to reflect the results of the competitive bidding and the terms
of the reoffering. We do not believe that the Item 601(b)(26) disclosure provides additional
value to investors because those participating in the competitive bid would directly receive the
invitation and all other investors would have access to the registration statement covering the
securities offered at competitive bidding, as well as the results of the competitive bidding and the
terms of reoffering. Based on the foregoing, we propose to delete Item 601(b)(26) and its
accompanying reference in the Exhibit Table within Item 601.
20. Request for Comment
55.

We solicit comment on the foregoing proposed amendments to eliminate overlapping
requirements. Should any proposed amendments not be adopted? Should any proposed
amendments be modified? If so, which ones and why? Please be as specific as possible
for each of the proposals on which you provide comments.

257

17 CFR 229.601(b)(26). Item 601(b)(26) requires that where a registration statement covers securities to be
offered at competitive bidding, any communication that is an invitation for competitive bid shall be filed as an
exhibit.

258

17 CFR 229.512(d). Item 512(d) requires an undertaking by issuers to provide disclosure not later than the first
use of a prospectus relating to the securities offered at competitive bidding, unless no further public offering and
no reoffering of such securities is proposed to be made.

78

56.

Are there other overlapping Commission disclosure requirements that: (1) require
disclosures that convey reasonably similar information to or are encompassed by the
disclosures that result from compliance with the overlapping, U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or
Commission disclosure requirements or (2) require disclosures incremental to other U.S.
GAAP or Commission disclosure requirements and may no longer be useful to investors?
If so, what requirements do they overlap with and what action, if any, should we take to
address the overlap?
D. Overlapping Requirements – Proposed Integrations
This section discusses Commission disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require

information incremental to, other Commission disclosure requirements. In these cases, we
propose to integrate the overlapping Commission disclosure requirements.
1. Foreign Currency Restrictions
If consolidation of foreign subsidiaries is deemed appropriate in the presence of foreign
currency exchange restrictions, Rule 3A-02(d) of Regulation S-X requires disclosure of the
effect of foreign subsidiaries’ currency exchange restrictions upon the consolidated financial
position and operating results of the issuer and its subsidiaries. To streamline Commission
disclosure requirements, we propose to relocate this requirement to Rule 3-20(b) of Regulation
S-X, 259 which addresses other currency considerations.
Rule 3-20(b), however, applies only to foreign private issuers, whereas Rule 3A-02(d)
applies to all issuers. To prevent any loss of disclosure from the relocation of Rule 3A-02(d) to
Rule 3-20(b), we propose to delete the reference to foreign private issuers in the title of Rule 3259

17 CFR 210.3-20(b).

79

20, which would broaden the scope of Rule 3-20(b) and Rule 3-20(e) to all issuers. 260 We do not
believe that this expansion of the scope would create additional burdens for domestic issuers.
Rule 3-20(b) requires disclosure of easily-accessible information, such as the issuer’s reporting
currency and the currency in which the issuer declares dividends. Rule 3-20(e) requires use of
the same reporting currency for all periods presented. Even though Rule 3-20(e) currently
applies only to foreign private issuers, Commission staff has historically requested issuers to use
the same reporting currency for all periods presented. 261
Rule 3-20(b) also sets forth requirements for foreign private issuers if their reporting
currency is not the U.S. dollar. Despite the proposed expansion of the scope of Rule 3-20(b)
discussed above, we do not intend to expand the instances in which a reporting currency other
than the U.S. dollar would be permitted. We are therefore proposing amendments to Rule 320(a) to require that a non-foreign private issuer present its financial statements in U.S. dollars.
Request for Comment
57.

Would disclosure of the reporting currency and the currency in which the issuer declares
dividends result in significant burdens or costs for issuers? How would the requirement
to use the same reporting currency for all periods presented affect the burdens and costs
for issuers?

58.

Foreign issuers that do not meet the definition of “foreign private issuer” would be
required to report in U.S. dollars. Should such foreign issuers be permitted to report in a
foreign currency?

260

The remaining paragraphs in Rule 3-20 specify the rule’s scope, so broadening the title to Rule 3-20 would have
no effect on the application of these paragraphs.

2. Restrictions on Dividends and Related Items
a. Domestic Issuers
Commission requirements mandate disclosure about restrictions on the payment of
dividends and related items in a number of locations:
•

Item 201(c)(1) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of restrictions (including
restrictions on the ability of issuer’s subsidiaries to transfer funds to it in the form
of cash dividends, loans or advances) that currently or are likely to materially
limit the issuer’s ability to pay dividends on its common equity. 262

•

Rule 4-08(d)(2) of Regulation S-X requires disclosure of any restriction upon
retained earnings that arises from the fact that upon involuntary liquidation the
aggregate preferences of the preferred shares exceed the par or stated value of
such shares. 263

•

Rule 4-08(e) of Regulation S-X requires disclosure related to the most significant
restrictions of the issuer’s payment of dividends. 264 Rule 4-08(e)(3) also requires,
where restricted net assets, as defined by the rule, exceed 25 percent of
consolidated net assets, a description of: (1) the restrictions on the ability of
subsidiaries to transfer funds to the issuer, and (2) the amount of restricted net
assets. 265

262

In lieu of disclosures, Item 201(c)(1) permits a cross-reference to this information in the disclosures required by
Item 303 of Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X.

263

17 CFR 210.4-08(d).

264

17 CFR 210.4-08(e).

265

17 CFR 210.4-08(e)(3).

81

We propose to streamline these disclosure requirements into a single requirement
for the disclosure of material restrictions on dividends and related items to which an
issuer and its subsidiaries are subject. To that end, we propose to: (1) delete the
requirements in Item 201(c)(1) and Rule 4-08(d)(2) to disclose restrictions, and (2) revise
Rule 4-08(e)(3) to require the dividend restrictions and related disclosures in
subparagraphs (i) and (ii) when material, rather than when restricted net assets exceed the
25 percent threshold. Doing so would give rise to Bright Line Disclosure Threshold
Considerations. In addition, we note that because disclosures required by Regulation SK, unlike those required by Regulation S-X, may be provided outside of the audited
financial statements, the proposed amendments give rise to Disclosure Location –
Financial Statement Considerations.
Rule 5-04, 266 Rule 7-05, 267 and Rule 9-06 268 of Regulation S-X also refer to the
definition of restricted net assets in Rule 4-08(e)(3) in determining when condensed
financial information of the issuer (“parent only financial information”) is required to be
disclosed. We are not changing the requirements in Rules 5-04, 7-05, and 9-06 of
Regulation S-X for parent only financial information at this time. As such, we propose to
move the definition of restricted net assets in Rule 4-08(e)(3) to a new Rule 1-02(dd) of
Regulation S-X and make corresponding changes to the cross references in Rules 5-04, 705, and 9-06.

b. Foreign Private Issuers
Form 20-F requires disclosure of dividend restrictions, as follows:
•

Item 10.F requires disclosure of any dividend restrictions.

•

Instruction to Item 14.B requires disclosure of any limitations on the payment of
dividends.
Foreign private issuers are already required to disclose dividend restrictions in the notes

to the financial statements. Specifically, foreign private issuers that report under U.S. GAAP or
Another Comprehensive Body of Accounting Principles with a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP
must comply with Rule 4-08(e), as discussed above. Foreign private issuers that report under
IFRS must comply with paragraph 79(a)(v) of IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements,
which requires disclosure of restrictions on the distribution of dividends and the repayment of
capital for each class of share capital. Item 5.B.1.(b) of Form 20-F also requires disclosure of an
evaluation of the sources and amounts of cash flows, including the nature and extent of any
restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the parent and the impact of such
restrictions.
Based on the foregoing, we propose to delete the dividend restriction disclosure
requirements in Item 10.F and the Instruction to Item 14.B of Form 20-F. 269 We note that

269

Item 5.B.1(b) of Form 20-F requires disclosure of restrictions on a subsidiary’s ability to transfer funds to the
parent in the form of dividends, loans, or advances. Although this requirement is similar to Rule 4-08(e), which
creates duplication for foreign private issuers that report under U.S. GAAP or Another Comprehensive Body of
Accounting Principles with a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, we do not propose its deletion because IFRS does
not contain an equivalent requirement for foreign private issuers that report under IFRS.
Item 10.D.2 of Form 20-F requires disclosure of governmental laws, decrees, regulations, or other legislation
which may affect the remittance of dividends, interest, or other payments to nonresident securityholders.
Although this requirement covers dividend restrictions, we also do not propose amendments to it because,

83

because these disclosures, unlike those required by IFRS, may be provided outside the audited
financial statements with related information such as the rights of security holders, the proposed
amendments give rise to Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations.
3. Geographic Areas 270
Item 101(d)(4) of Regulation S-K requires, when interim financial statements are
presented, a discussion of the facts that indicate the three-year financial data for geographic
performance may not be indicative of current or future operations. This requirement is similar to
requirements in Instruction 3 to Item 303(a) and Instruction 4 to Item 303(b) to identify elements
of income which are not necessarily indicative of the issuer’s ongoing business, except that there
is no explicit reference to “geographic areas” in either item requirement. To streamline the
requirements in Regulation S-K, we propose to revise Item 303 to add an explicit reference to
“geographic areas” and delete Item 101(d)(4). 271 We note that because these disclosures are
located in the business section of the filing, while the corresponding disclosures are in MD&A,
their proposed elimination gives rise to Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations.
4. Request for Comment
59.

We solicit comment on the foregoing proposed amendments to integrate overlapping
Commission disclosure requirements. For each topic in this section:
a. Do investors use the disclosures required by the Commission disclosure requirement?
If so, in what way?
through its reference to interest and other payments to nonresident securityholders, its scope is broader than the
requirements for the notes to the financial statements.

270

Please refer to the related discussion in section III.C.12.

271

One commenter on the Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative observed that material disclosures about geographic
areas would already be provided under Item 303 of Regulation S-K. See letter from CCMC (July 29, 2014).

84

b. Should any proposed amendments not be made? Should any proposed amendments
be modified? If so, which ones and why? Please be as specific as possible for each
of the proposed amendments on which you provide comments.
60.

Are there additional Commission disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require
information incremental to, other Commission disclosure requirements? If so, what
requirements do they overlap with and what action, if any, should we take to address the
overlap?
E. Overlapping Requirements – Potential Modifications, Eliminations, or FASB
Referrals
This section discusses Commission disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require

information incremental to, U.S. GAAP for which we solicit comment to determine whether to
retain, modify, eliminate, or refer them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.
The comments received in response to this release may inform both potential future Commission
rulemaking and FASB standard-setting activities. Future amendments to these Commission
disclosure requirements may depend on the outcome of any FASB standard-setting activities to
address the Commission disclosure requirements. Our staff has discussed these overlapping
requirements with the FASB staff.
Incorporating these overlapping Commission disclosure requirements into U.S. GAAP
could alleviate any inconsistencies that currently arise when the corresponding Commission
disclosure requirements are not simultaneously amended to conform to U.S. GAAP updates, as
discussed in section V.A.
Because U.S. GAAP does not scale disclosure requirements by issuer status,
incorporation into U.S. GAAP would result in the application of some of these requirements to
85

SRCs, as identified below. Incorporation into U.S. GAAP would also potentially result in the
application of all such requirements to Regulation A issuers and crowdfunding issuers that report
under U.S. GAAP. We solicit comment on the costs and benefits of this expanded scope below.
1. REIT Disclosures 272 – Tax Status of Distributions
U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of a public entity’s tax status. 273 For REITs, in addition
to its tax status, Regulation S-X requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of the
tax status of distributions per unit, for example as ordinary income, capital gain, or return of
capital. 274
2. Consolidation 275
Although Regulation S-X 276 and U.S. GAAP 277 both set forth disclosure requirements
about consolidation matters, Regulation S-X incrementally requires disclosure of material
changes in the entities included in or excluded from the consolidated financial statements.
3. Discount on Shares
Regulation S-X 278 and U.S. GAAP 279 both set forth requirements about the presentation
of items in the equity section of the financial statements. However, Regulation S-X
incrementally requires discounts on shares to be presented separately as a deduction from the

applicable accounts. Discounts on shares may arise, for example, from stock issuance costs,
which are recognized as a reduction in equity. 280
4. Assets Subject to Lien
Regulation S-X 281 and U.S. GAAP 282 both require disclosure in the notes to the financial
statements of assets subject to lien and the obligation collateralized for the most recent audited
balance sheet being filed. However, these U.S. GAAP disclosure requirements only apply to
certain financial assets (e.g., repurchase agreements or securities lending transactions), whereas
Rule 4-08(b) applies to all assets.
5. Obligations 283
a. Defaults Not Cured
Regulation S-X requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of the facts and
amounts related to defaults of obligations or breaches of covenants that existed at the most recent
balance sheet date and have not been subsequently cured. 284 This disclosure requirement is
incremental to U.S. GAAP, which sets forth classification requirements for obligations for which
there has been a covenant violation 285 and more limited disclosure requirements. 286

Request for Comment
61.

Item 2.04 of Form 8-K requires disclosure of a triggering event that causes the increase or
acceleration of a direct financial obligation, among other disclosures, if material. In
addition, Part II, Item 3 of Form 10-Q and Part II, Item 13 of Form 20-F both require
disclosure of material defaults and the amount of default for debt that exceeds 5 percent
of total assets. Moreover, Item 303(a)(1) of Regulation S-K requires liquidity-related
disclosures. 287 These disclosures, unlike those required by Rule 4-08(c), may be
provided outside the audited financial statements, giving rise to Disclosure Location –
Financial Statement Considerations. In addition, the disclosures under Form 8-K and
Form 10-Q are required at different times than the annual disclosures required by Rule 408(c). In light of these requirements in Form 8-K, Form 10-Q, Form 20-F, and Item
303(a)(1), should the disclosure requirement in Rule 4-08(c) be eliminated, rather than
retained, modified, or referred to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP?
b. Waived Defaults
If a default of an obligation exists, but acceleration of the obligation has been waived for

a period of time, Rule 4-08(c) requires disclosure of the amount of the obligation and the period
of the waiver. This disclosure requirement is incremental to U.S. GAAP, which sets forth
requirements for when to present debt subject to a covenant violation as a current liability on the

287

Item 303(a)(1) requires disclosure of any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result
in or that are reasonably likely to result in the issuer’s liquidity materially increasing or decreasing. In addition,
if a material deficiency is identified, Item 303(a)(1) requires disclosure of the course of action that the issuer has
taken or proposes to take to remedy the deficiency.

balance sheet, 288 but does not require disclosure of the amount of the obligation or the period of
the waiver for all waived defaults.
c. Changes in Obligations
Regulation S-X 289 and U.S. GAAP 290 both require disclosure of issuances of debt
subsequent to the balance sheet date. However, Rule 4-08(f) of Regulation S-X incrementally
requires disclosure of significant changes in the authorized amounts of debt subsequent to the
latest balance sheet date.
d. Amounts and Terms of Financing Arrangements
Regulation S-X 291 and U.S. GAAP 292 both require certain disclosures of an issuer’s
financing arrangements. However, Regulation S-X incrementally requires disclosure, if
significant, of the amount and terms (including commitment fees and the conditions under which
lines may be withdrawn) of unused lines of credit for short-term financing, the weighted average
interest rate on short-term borrowings outstanding as of each balance sheet date, and the amount
of any lines of credit which support a commercial paper borrowing or similar arrangement. It
also requires similar disclosure of the amount and terms (including commitment fees and the
conditions under which commitments may be withdrawn) of unused commitments for long-term
financial arrangements.

6. Preferred Shares
Regulation S-X 293 and U.S. GAAP 294 both require disclosure about preferred share
preferences in involuntary liquidation. However, Regulation S-X requires disclosure in more
circumstances than U.S. GAAP. Specifically, Regulation S-X requires disclosure when
preferences are other than par or stated value, whereas U.S. GAAP requires disclosure when
preferences are considerably in excess of par or stated value.
7. Income Tax Disclosures 295
Regulation S-X 296 and U.S. GAAP 297 both require disclosures about income taxes in the
notes to the financial statements. 298 However, Rule 4-08(h) includes certain incremental
requirements, some of which gives rise to Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations.
Specifically, although U.S. GAAP and Regulation S-X both require disclosure of the
components of income tax expense, Rule 4-08(h) incrementally: (1) requires disclosure of the
amount of domestic and foreign pre-tax income and income tax expense, (2) requires
disaggregation of the foreign component of pre-tax income and income tax expense with the
domestic component if it exceeds five percent of the respective total, and (3) defines “foreign”
for purposes of this disclosure.

90

In addition, although U.S. GAAP and Regulation S-X both require a reconciliation of the
domestic federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate, Rule 4-08(h) incrementally: (1)
requires disaggregation of reconciling items if they individually exceed five percent of the
amount computed by multiplying pre-tax income by the applicable statutory income tax rate, (2)
clarifies the statutory tax rate to use in the income tax rate reconciliation for foreign issuers, and
(3) requires, when the statutory tax rate used differs from the U.S. federal corporate income tax
rate, disclosure of the basis for using that rate.
Request for Comment 299

Are there additional income tax disclosures that would be useful to investors? Please
explain. As discussed above, Rule 4-08(h) requires disclosure of the amount of domestic
and foreign pre-tax income and income tax expense. Would further disaggregation of
foreign amounts be useful to investors? What, if any, burdens would such additional
disclosure create for issuers? Issuers are currently required to provide foreign amounts.
Would there be impediments to disaggregating these amounts by material jurisdiction? If
so, what are the impediments?
8. Related Parties 300
Regulation S-X 301 and U.S. GAAP 302 both require the amount of related party

transactions to be disclosed in the financial statements. We note that Rule 4-08(k)(1)
incrementally requires that these amounts be presented on the face of the financial statements, if

requirements, including income tax disclosures. See sections IV.A.4 and IV.G.7 of the S-K Concept Release.

separate financial statements, Rule 4-08(k)(2) incrementally requires disclosure of the
intercompany profits or losses on transactions with related parties that are not eliminated.
9. Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements 304
Regulation S-X 305 and U.S. GAAP 306 both set forth presentation and disclosure
requirements for repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements in the financial statements.
However, Regulation S-X incrementally requires: (1) the liabilities associated with repurchase
agreements that are separately presented on the balance sheet to include accrued interest
payable, 307 (2) disclosure of the interest rates associated with certain repurchase liabilities, 308 (3)
information about counterparties and agreements with them, where there is a concentration of
counterparties, 309 (4) separate presentation on the balance sheet of the carrying amount of reverse
repurchase agreements, 310 and (5) disclosure of the nature of any provisions to ensure that the
market value of the underlying assets remains sufficient to protect the issuer in the event of
counterparty default. 311 Regulation S-X requires these incremental disclosures when a specified
bright line threshold is met, giving rise to Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations.

Pursuant to Rule 4-02 of Regulation S-X, this separate presentation is only required if material.

10. Interim Financial Statements – Computation of Earnings Per Share 312
Although Commission disclosure requirements 313 and U.S. GAAP 314 both require
disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of the computation of earnings per share, U.S.
GAAP does not specifically require disclosure of the computation in interim financial
statements.
11. Interim Financial Statements – Retroactive Prior Period Adjustments
Regulation S-X requires disclosure, in interim period financial statements, of material
retroactive changes to prior period financial statements. 315 Retroactive prior period adjustments
arise due to:
•

Changes in accounting principle, as discussed in sections II.B.11 and III.C.8.

•

Corrections of errors. Regulation S-X 316 and U.S. GAAP 317 both require disclosure, in
interim financial statements, of the effect of a correction of an error on income, income
per share, and retained earnings.

•

Changes in reporting entities. 318 Regulation S-X and U.S. GAAP 319 both require
disclosure of the effect of changes in reporting entities on net income and per share

312

Please refer to the related discussion in section II.B.8.

See Rule 8-03(b)(5) and Rule 10-01(b)(7) [17 CFR 210.10-01(b)(7)] of Regulation S-X. Rule 8-03(b)(5)
applies to SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP, while Rule 1001(b)(7) applies to non-SRCs.

316

Regulation S-X only requires disclosure of the effect of a correction of an error on retained earnings for nonSRCs. U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the effect on all financial statement lines items, not only income,
income per share, and retained earnings.

amounts. However, Regulation S-X, unlike U.S. GAAP, explicitly requires such
disclosures in the interim period of change and, for non-SRCs, incrementally requires
disclosure of the effect on retained earnings.
Because U.S. GAAP does not scale disclosure requirements by SRC status, any
incorporation of these requirements into U.S. GAAP would result in the application of these
requirements to SRCs.
Request for Comment
63.

Would the application of the requirement to disclose the effect of retroactive prior period
adjustments on retained earnings to SRCs result in additional costs? Please discuss any
such costs. Would investors benefit from such disclosure? Does that affect your view as
to whether we should refer this requirement to the FASB? If so, how?
12. Interim Financial Statements – Common Control Transactions 320
Regulation S-X 321 and U.S. GAAP 322 both set forth accounting and disclosure

requirements for combinations of entities under common control. However, Rule 10-01(b)(3)
incrementally requires non-SRCs to disclose the separate results of the combined entities for
periods prior to the combination. 323 Because U.S. GAAP does not scale disclosure requirements

318

Examples of changes in reporting entity include: (1) changes in the specific subsidiaries that comprise the group
of entities for which consolidated financial statements are presented, or (2) changes in the entities included in
combined financial statements. See FASB ASC Master Glossary.

Should the FASB revise ASC 250-10-50-6 to address the incremental Commission disclosure requirements
discussed in section III.E.11, such revisions would also address the incremental Commission disclosure
requirements discussed in this section. Specifically, ASC 250-10-50-6 requires disclosure of the effect of a

Would the application of this disclosure requirement to SRCs result in additional costs?
Please discuss any such costs. Would investors benefit from such disclosure? Does that
affect your view as to whether we should refer this requirement to the FASB? If so,
how?
13. Products and Services
Regulation S-K 324 and U.S. GAAP 325 both require disclosure of the amount of revenue

from products and services. Regulation S-K, however, only requires this disclosure for products
and services which account for 10 percent or more of consolidated revenue in each of the last
three fiscal years. 326 U.S. GAAP, on the other hand, requires this disclosure for each product or
service, or group of similar products and services, unless impracticable. We note that because
disclosures required by Regulation S-K, unlike those required by U.S. GAAP, may be provided
outside of the audited financial statements, these differences give rise to Disclosure Location –

change in a reporting entity, of which a combination of entities under common control is an example. From this
information, an investor can determine the separate results of the combined entities for periods prior to the
combination, as required by Rule 10-01(b)(3).
However, as discussed in section III.E.11, ASC 250-10-50-6 does not explicitly apply to interim periods, while
Rule 10-01(b)(3) does. Thus, any revision to U.S. GAAP to apply the provisions of ASC 250-10-50-6 to
interim periods, to address the points raised in section E.E.11, would also address the points raised in this
section.

Threshold Considerations.
Request for Comment
65.

Do issuers encounter challenges in disclosing revenue by products and services? If so,
how significant are these challenges and how do issuers overcome these challenges,
given that Regulation S-K does not provide an impracticability exception?
14. Major Customers
Regulation S-K 327 and U.S. GAAP 328 both require disclosures about major customers.

However, Regulation S-K is more expansive in its requirements and differs from U.S. GAAP in
two ways: (1) the threshold for disclosure and (2) the requirement to disclose a customer’s name
in certain instances. We note that because disclosures required by Regulation S-K, unlike those
required by U.S. GAAP, may be provided outside of the audited financial statements, these
differences give rise to Disclosure Location – Financial Disclosure Considerations. These
differences also give rise to Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations.
First, Item 101(c)(1)(vii) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure if loss of a customer, or a
few customers, would have a material adverse effect on a segment. This threshold differs from
U.S. GAAP in that it is qualitative and focuses on the impact on a segment. In contrast, U.S.
GAAP requires disclosure, for each customer that comprises 10 percent or more of total revenue,
of that fact. Although the requirements for SRCs in Item 101(h)(4)(vi) are more similar to U.S.

327

See Item101(c)(1)(vii) [17 CFR 229.101(c)(1)(vii)] and Item 101(h)(4)(vi) [17 CFR 229.101(h)(4)(vi)] of
Regulation S-K. Item 101(c)(1)(vii) applies to non-SRCs and Item 101(h)(4)(vi) applies to SRCs.

328

See ASC 280-10-50-42.

96

GAAP in that they do not prescribe a segment focus, they also differ from U.S. GAAP in that
they do not set forth a 10 percent bright line test for disclosure.
Second, Item 101(c)(1)(vii) requires disclosure of the name of any customer that
represents 10 percent or more of the issuer’s revenues and whose loss would have a material
adverse effect on the issuer. 329 In 1999, the Commission considered deleting this requirement to
conform to U.S. GAAP. However, the Commission determined to retain this requirement, as it
continued to believe that the identity of major customers is material information to investors and
that the disclosure allows a reader to better assess risks associated with a particular customer, as
well as material concentrations of revenues related to that customer. 330
Because U.S. GAAP does not scale disclosure requirements by SRC status, any
incorporation of these requirements into U.S. GAAP would result in the application to SRCs of
the disclosure threshold and the requirement to name a customer in certain instances.
Request for Comment
66.

U.S. GAAP does not require identification of major customers by name because many
constituents argued in the standard-setting process that it could be competitively harmful
to either the enterprise or the customer. 331 In what way would such disclosures be
competitively harmful? Does the fact that the Regulation S-K requirement to identify the
customer is triggered where the loss would be material, whereas the U.S. GAAP

329

Item 101(h)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-K does not require disclosure of the name of major customers.

whether disclosure would be competitively harmful?
67.

What would be the impact on SRCs if the disclosure threshold discussed above and
requirement to disclose a customer’s name in certain circumstances were to apply to
SRCs? Would investors benefit from such disclosure? Does any potential impact affect
your view as to whether we should refer this requirement to the FASB? If so, how?
15. Legal Proceedings
U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of loss contingencies. 332 Regulation S-K requires

disclosure of certain legal proceedings, 333 which are one type of loss contingency. In practice, to
comply with Regulation S-K, issuers commonly repeat some or all of the disclosures provided in
the notes to the financial statements under U.S. GAAP or include a cross-reference thereto.
Three commenters to the Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative generally noted similarities
between the disclosures required by Item 103 of Regulation S-K and U.S. GAAP. 334 One
commenter suggested removing any overlap between Item 103 and relevant accounting standards
and financial reporting requirements. 335 Another commenter encouraged the Commission to
coordinate with the FASB to determine, generally, whether differences between U.S. GAAP and
the disclosures required by Regulation S-K continue to serve a purpose. 336

As further described below, although Item 103 and U.S. GAAP have overlapping
requirements, they differ in certain respects. Incorporation of Item 103 requirements into U.S.
GAAP would have implications for investors, issuers, and other stakeholders.
The discussion below is organized as follows:
•

Section III.E.15.a identifies differences between Item 103 and U.S. GAAP.

•

Section III.E.15.b discusses the potential consequences of incorporating the Item 103
requirements into U.S. GAAP.

U.S. GAAP and (2) other criteria. Each type of matter in part (1) of the table is subject to each

102

b. Consequences
In light of the differences between Item 103 and U.S. GAAP, as discussed above,
incorporation of Item 103’s requirements into U.S. GAAP would result in the following
consequences. These consequences assume that the most expansive requirements from either
Item 103 or U.S. GAAP are retained. Refer to the table above to identify the specific
consequences associated with each difference between Item 103 and U.S. GAAP.
1. Disclosure of the Possible Range of Loss in More Circumstances
U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts
accrued 338 or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. 339 Where the scope of
proceedings or matters covered by Item 103 is more expansive than that of U.S. GAAP,
incorporation of these incremental disclosure requirements into U.S. GAAP may benefit
investors, as they would receive range of loss disclosures for matters previously outside the
scope of U.S. GAAP. Provision of this disclosure, however, may create additional burdens for
issuers and auditors to develop and audit additional estimates and disclosures.
2. Disclosure Subject to Audit/Review, Internal Control over Financial Reporting, and XBRL
Tagging Requirements in More Circumstances
Certain disclosures made outside the audited financial statements would be included
within the notes to the financial statements, giving rise to Disclosure Location – Financial
Statement Considerations. Some issuers already include this information in their audited
financial statements, and, thus, the additional burdens should not be significant for these issuers.

338

See ASC 450-20-25-2, which requires accrual of an estimated loss from a loss contingency if: (a) it is probable
that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated.

339

See ASC 450-20-50-3.

103

3. Disclosure of Factual Information in More Circumstances
Item 103 requires disclosure of the court or agency in which the proceedings are pending,
the date instituted, the principal parties involved, the alleged factual basis to the proceeding, and
the relief sought. Where the scope of U.S. GAAP is more expansive than that of Item 103,
incorporation of these factual disclosure requirements into U.S. GAAP may benefit investors, as
they would newly receive these factual disclosures for incremental matters previously outside the
scope of Item 103. Provision of this disclosure, however, may create additional burdens for
issuers and auditors to develop and audit additional disclosures.
c. Other Considerations
Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 (“NEPA”), 340 Congress required
all federal agencies to include consideration of the environment in regulatory action. In response
to this mandate, the Commission adopted environmental compliance and litigation disclosure
requirements. 341 The incorporation of Item 103’s requirements into U.S. GAAP could result in
changes to required disclosures about environmental legal proceedings, such as replacement of
the 10 percent and $100,000 thresholds 342 related to environmental matters with a more general

340

42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.

341

As a result of NEPA, the Commission issued an interpretive release in 1971 alerting companies to potential
disclosure obligations that could arise from material environmental litigation and the material effects of
compliance with environmental laws. The Commission later adopted more specific disclosure requirements

estimated capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

For the following disclosures, would inclusion of these disclosures in the audited
financial statements create significant burdens for issuers and auditors? Would it require
revision to standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(“PCAOB”) or the American Bar Association Statement of Policy Regarding Lawyers’
Responses to Auditors’ Requests for Information? 343 If so, how do auditors of issuers
that currently include the above disclosures in the audited financial statements audit
them?
a. Proceedings known to be contemplated but which are not probable of being asserted.
b. Material bankruptcy, receivership, or similar proceeding.
c. Non-monetary damages.
d. Proceedings involving capital expenditures or deferred charges.
e. Environment proceedings in excess of the 10 percent or $100,000 thresholds that may
not be otherwise material to the registrant.
f. Low probability-high magnitude proceedings.
g. The court or agency in which the proceedings are pending, the date instituted, the
principal parties involved, the alleged factual basis to the proceeding, and the relief
sought.

16. Oil and Gas Producing Activities
Regulation S-K 344 and U.S. GAAP 345 both require issuers engaged in oil and gas
producing activities to disclose information about those activities in the notes to the financial
statements. However, Item 302(b) of Regulation S-K incrementally requires that the U.S. GAAP
disclosures must be provided for each period presented. This requirement is only applicable to
non-SRCs. 346 Because U.S. GAAP does not scale disclosure requirements by SRC status, any
incorporation of these requirements into U.S. GAAP would result in the application of this
requirement to SRCs.
Request for Comment

Would the application of this disclosure requirement to SRCs impose additional costs?
Please describe any such costs. Would investors benefit from such disclosure? Does that
affect your view as to whether we should refer this requirement to the FASB? If so,

requirements to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP? If so, which
requirements and how?
b. Would the expansion of the disclosure requirements to Regulation A and
crowdfunding issuers that report under U.S. GAAP result in additional costs and
benefits? Please describe any such costs and benefits. Do any of these potential costs
and benefits affect your views as to whether the disclosure requirements should be
referred to the FASB? If so, how?

Are there other Commission disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require
information incremental to, U.S. GAAP? If so, what requirements do they overlap with
and what action, if any, should we take to address the overlap?

IV.

Outdated Requirements
A. Background
We have also preliminarily identified Commission disclosure requirements that have

become obsolete as a result of the passage of time or changes in the regulatory, business, or
technological environment. We propose to amend these outdated requirements. The proposed
amendments are intended to simplify issuer compliance efforts. To reduce any loss of
information or increased burdens for investors, we also propose to require additional disclosure
of information which is expected to be readily available to issuers at minimal to no cost.

107

Section IV.B below discusses each outdated Commission disclosure requirement and the
proposed amendment.
B. Proposed Amendments
1. Stale Transition Dates
In certain circumstances, when the Commission revised its disclosure requirements, it
specified the date beyond which issuers are required to comply with the new requirements. 347
Given the passage of these transition dates, we propose to delete references to them in our
disclosure requirements.
2. Income Tax Disclosures 348
In February 1992, the FASB revised its income tax disclosure requirements, as part of a
broader project on the accounting for income taxes, 349 effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1992. In October 1992, the Commission amended Regulation S-X 350 to clarify
that parts of certain rules 351 do not apply to issuers that have adopted the new FASB standard. 352
Because all issuers are now required to apply the FASB’s revised standard, we propose to
eliminate the parts of Rule 4-08(h) that no longer apply: Rule 4-08(h)(1)(ii), the parenthetical at
the end of Rule 4-08(h)(1), part of the introductory sentence of Rule 4-08(h)(2), and all of Rule
4-08(h)(3) of Regulation S-X.

347

See Rule 4-01(a)(3) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.4-01(a)(3)] for non-SRCs and Note 6 to Rule 8-01 of
Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.8-01] for SRCs. See Forms S-3, F-1, F-3, F-4, and 20-F. See Exchange Act Rule
13a-10(g)(3) [17 CFR 240.13a-10(g)(3)], Exchange Act Rule 15d-2 [17 CFR 240.15d-2], and Exchange Act

3. Available Information
a. Public Reference Room
Various Commission disclosure requirements and forms require issuers to disclose the
availability of their filings for reading or copying at the Commission’s Public Reference Room
and the Public Reference Room’s physical address and phone number. 353 However, the
Commission staff has observed that the Commission’s Public Reference Room is rarely used by
the public to obtain or review issuer filings, 354 as paper filings are now only permitted (and
sometimes required) in very limited circumstances. 355 Generally, issuers are required to file
most filings electronically and, with the widespread availability of the Internet, investors can
access for free substantially all issuers’ Commission filings on EDGAR. As a result, we propose
to delete the requirements to identify the Public Reference Room and disclose its physical
address and phone number. 356
353

See Item 101(e)(2) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.101(e)(2)] for non-SRCs and Item 101(h)(5)(iii) of
Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.101(h)(5)(iii)] for SRCs. The Commission’s Securities Act registration
statements filed on Forms S-1, S-3, S-11, S-4, F-1, F-3, and F-4 require similar disclosures. Regulation AB also
has similar disclosure requirements for asset-backed issuers. See Item 1118(b) of Regulation AB [17 CFR
229.1118(b)] and Forms SF-1 [17 CFR 239.44] and SF-3 [17 CFR 239.45]. In addition, Forms N-1A [17 CFR
239.15A and 274.11A], N-2 [17 CFR 239.14 and 274.11a-1], N-3 [17 CFR 239.17a and 274.11b], N-5 [17 CFR
239.24 and 274.5], N-6 [17 CFR 239.17c and 274.11d], and N-8B-2 [17 CFR 274.12] have similar disclosure
requirements.

354

Commission staff who currently operate the Public Reference Room indicate that it is now primarily used by
legal publishers who wish to review paper Forms 144 [17 CFR 239.144] (filings made by an affiliate of an
issuer as notice of the proposed sale of securities in reliance on Rule 144), which are still permitted to be filed in
paper form. See http://www.sec.gov/answers/form144.htm.

355

See Rules 14 [17 CFR 232.14], 101[17 CFR 232.101], and 102 [17 CFR 232.102] of Regulation S-T.

356

We also propose to delete the requirement to disclose how to send a written request by mail to the SEC’s Public
Reference Room to obtain certain hard copy information. Disclosure of how to obtain this information
electronically would still be required.
Three commenters on the Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative recommended deleting the requirements to identify
the Public Reference Room and disclose its location and phone number. See letters from ABA (Mar. 6, 2015);
CCMC (July 29, 2014); and SCSGP (Sept. 10, 2014).
Although we are proposing to delete the requirements to identify the Public Reference Room, its physical
address, and its phone number, the Public Reference Room will remain open and available for interested
persons to access Commission filings.

109

Additionally, electronic filers are required to disclose the Commission’s Internet address
and that electronic SEC filings are available there. We intend to retain this requirement but
propose to delete the qualifier “if you are an electronic filer” as all but a limited number of
issuers are now required to file electronically. 357 We also propose to expand this requirement to
Forms 20-F and F-1, which do not currently call for such disclosure, to align the requirements for
foreign private issuers with domestic issuers. While these proposed amendments would impose
additional disclosure burdens on certain classes of issuers (i.e., paper filers and foreign private
issuers), we believe the cost of providing this information would be minimal.
Request for Comment
74.

Are the disclosures to identify the Public Reference Room and disclose its physical
address and phone number useful to investors?

75.

Are there significant burdens and costs associated with disclosing the Commission’s
Internet address and a statement that electronic SEC filings are available there?
b. Issuer Internet Address
In 2002, the Commission recognized that “[a]n efficient and economical method for

companies to make information available about themselves to many investors is through their
Internet websites.” 358 The Commission believed that it was important for issuers to make
investors aware of the different sources, including corporate websites, that provide access to
information about the issuer. 359 Consequently, the Commission revised Regulation S-K to

357

See Rules 100 [17 CFR 232.100] and 101 [17 CFR 232.101] of Regulation S-T.

require accelerated and large accelerated filers 360 to disclose their Internet address, if they have
one, in their annual reports filed on Form 10-K, 361 and to encourage other filers to do so. 362
Various forms also encourage filers to disclose their Internet address, if available. 363
In the 2002 adopting release, the Commission noted that commenters supported
extending this disclosure requirement to all issuers, including smaller issuers and foreign private
issuers. 364 The Commission indicated it would “continue to study this issue and consider
extending the requirement to all reporting companies after evaluating [its] initial experience with
the requirement by accelerated filers.” 365
The Commission staff has observed that many non-accelerated filers already disclose
their Internet addresses annually in their Form 10-Ks. This current practice, combined with the
minimal costs of disclosing an Internet address, suggest that such a requirement would impose
limited burden on issuers. In addition, the Commission has provided guidance about the liability
framework for certain types of disclosures on company websites, including hyperlinked and
archived data, so that investors could gain the benefits of Internet disclosure. 366 We also believe
that such a requirement would help ensure that investors are aware of an additional resource for
information about issuers.

360

Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act defines the terms accelerated filer and large accelerated filer.

Based on the foregoing, we propose to amend Items 101(e) and 101(h)(5) of Regulation
S-K and Forms S-3, S-4, F-1, F-3, F-4, 20-F, SF-1, and SF-3 to require all issuers to disclose
their Internet addresses (or, in the case of asset-backed issuers, the address of the specified
transaction party), if they have one.
Request for Comment
76.

Are there significant burdens and costs associated with disclosing the issuer’s Internet
address? Are the burdens or costs that may be imposed on non-accelerated filers,
including SRCs, different from those that may be borne by accelerated and large
accelerated filers?
4. Market Price Disclosure
a. Item 201(a)(1) of Regulation S-K
Item 201(a)(1) of Regulation S-K 367 requires issuers to disclose the following:
•

The principal U.S. market(s) where its common equity is traded. Foreign issuers must
also disclose the principal established foreign public trading market, if applicable. Where
applicable, issuers must disclose that there is no established public trading market for
their common equity. 368

•

If the principal U.S. market is an exchange, issuers must disclose the high and low sale
prices for their common equity for each quarter within the two most recent fiscal years
and subsequent interim period. 369

367

17 CFR 229.201(a)(1).

368

Item 201(a)(1)(i) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.201(a)(1)(i)].

369

Item 201(a)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.201(a)(1)(ii)].

112

•

If the principal U.S. market is not an exchange, issuers must disclose the high and low
bid quotations for the same periods as above. Where applicable, issuers must identify the
source of the quotations and include appropriate qualifying language. 370

•

Foreign issuers that identify a principal established foreign trading market for common
equity are also required to provide market price disclosure comparable to that of a
domestic issuer. If the primary U.S. market for the foreign issuer trades using American
Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”), then foreign issuers must disclose prices based on the
ADRs. 371

•

When Item 201(a)(1) disclosure is included in a Securities Act registration statement or
an Exchange Act proxy or information statement, issuers must also disclose the price for
their common equity as of the latest practicable date. 372
Today, the daily market prices of most publicly traded common equity securities,

including those quoted on an automated quotation system, are readily available for free on
numerous websites, including the exchanges’ or quotation systems’ websites. 373 On these
websites, investors can view daily closing prices, up to the previous day, and intra-day quotes,
which would be more up-to-date than the prices required by Item 201(a)(1)(v) of Regulation SK. Additionally, many of these websites allow users to download the daily historical data over
370

Item 201(a)(1)(iii) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.201(a)(1)(iii)]. This paragraph requires qualification where
the over-the-counter quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission
and may not necessarily represent actual transactions. Reference to quotations must be qualified by appropriate
explanation where there is an absence of an established public trading market.

371

Item 201(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.201(a)(1)(iv)].

372

Item 201(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.201(a)(1)(v)]. The Commission has required this or similar
pricing disclosure since the 1960s. See Guides for Preparation and Filing of Registration Statements, Release
No. 33-4936 (Dec. 9, 1968) [33 FR 18617].

373

www.otcmarkets.com.

113

customized time horizons for their own consumption. These features result in more robust
information than the disclosure required by Item 201(a)(1) of Regulation S-K. 374
Based on the foregoing, we propose the following amendments to Item 201(a)(1) of
Regulation S-K:
•

Issuers with one or more classes of common equity would be required to disclose the
principal U.S. market(s) where each class is traded and the trading symbol(s) used by the
market(s) for each class of common equity. Foreign issuers also would be required to
identify the principal established foreign public trading market, if any, and the trading
symbol(s), for each class of their common equity.

•

Issuers with common equity that is not traded on an exchange must indicate, as
applicable, that any over-the-counter quotations in such trading systems reflect interdealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily
represent actual transactions.

•

Issuers with no class of common equity traded in an established public trading market
would be required to state such fact and disclose the range of high and low bid
information, if applicable, for each quarter over the last two fiscal years and any
subsequent interim period. 375 Also, such issuers would be required to disclose the source
and explain the nature of such quotations.

374

Some commenters on the Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative have also suggested that the stock price disclosures
are obsolete and should be eliminated. See, e.g., letters from ABA (Mar. 6, 2015); Corporate Governance
Committee Business Roundtable (Apr. 15, 2015); CCMC (July 29, 2014); CFA Institute (Nov. 12, 2014); IBM
Corporation (Aug. 7, 2014); SCSGP (Sept. 10, 2014); and Shearman (Nov. 26, 2014).

375

Item 201(a)(1)(i) currently notes that the existence of limited or sporadic quotations should not, by itself, be
deemed to constitute an established public trading market.

114

As proposed to be amended, Item 201(a)(1) would eliminate the detailed disclosure
requirement of sale or bid prices for most issuers whose common equity is traded in an
established public trading market and replace it with disclosure of the trading symbol. 376 The
proposed amendments would also align Item 201(a)(1) with Item 501(b)(4) of Regulation SK. 377
b. Item 9.A.4 of Form 20-F
Foreign private issuers that file Form 20-F are subject to disclosure requirements similar
to those included in Item 201(a)(1) of Regulation S-K. Item 9.A.4 of Form 20-F requires the
following price history of the stock to be offered or listed for both the U.S. market and the
principal trading market outside the United States, as applicable:
•

The annual high and low market prices for the last five full financial years;

•

Quarterly high and low market prices for the last two full financial years and any
subsequent period; and

•

Monthly high and low market prices for the last six months;
For preemptive share issuances, the issuer must disclose the market prices for the first

trading day in the most recent six months, the last trading day before the announcement of the

376

Form N-2, which is used for registration of closed-end management investment companies, includes disclosure
requirements relating to sales prices and bid information that are similar to those in Item 201(a)(1) of
Regulation S-K. Item 1, Instruction 1 and Item 8.5(b) of Form N-2. In addition to these requirements, Form N2 requires disclosure of information relating to net asset value and discount or premium to net asset value. Item
8.5(b), Instructions 4 and 5 and Item 8.5(c) through (e) of Form N-2. Disclosure of sales prices and bid
information is needed in registration statements on Form N-2 so that the required premium/discount disclosure
can be fully understood. Accordingly, we are not proposing to change the requirements in Form N-2 relating to
sales prices and bid information.

377

17 CFR 229.501(b)(4). Item 501(b)(4) of Regulation S-K requires prospectus cover page disclosure of the
trading symbol(s) and market(s) for securities being offered and registered on a Securities Act registration
statement.

115

offering, and for the latest practicable date. If an issuer’s securities are “not regularly traded in
an organized market,” the issuer must discuss any lack of liquidity.
We propose to amend Item 9.A.4 to be consistent with the proposals related to Item
201(a)(1) of Regulation S-K. Specifically, we propose to amend Item 9.A.4 to require disclosure
of the U.S. and principal market(s) where the issuer’s common equity trades and the trading
symbol(s) assigned to the issuer’s common equity that is traded in the U.S. market and principal
market. For those issuers whose common equity is not traded in any established public trading
market, disclosure of that fact would still be required.
Request for Comment
77.

Is disclosure of trading symbols an adequate substitute for the current required
disclosures in Item 201(a)(1) of Regulation S-K and Item 9.A.4 of Form 20-F? Why or
why not?

78.

Would elimination of the detailed disclosure of sale or bid prices place a burden on retail
investors? Would the proposed disclosures help retail investors by facilitating their
research?

79.

Where a class of common equity is traded in multiple markets, should issuers have to
provide disclosure only for the principal established public trading market or every
established public trading market? Why?

80.

Should foreign issuers be required to disclose the trading symbol(s) for both the principal
U.S. market and the principal established foreign public trading market(s), as applicable?
Why or why not?

81.

How do investors and issuers currently understand the term “established public trading
market?” Is further guidance needed to determine what constitutes “limited or sporadic

116

quotations” and whether a quotation or trading medium is an established public trading
market?
82.

Is there uncertainty in the current marketplace regarding the determination of the
principal established public trading market?
5. Exchange Rate Data
Item 3.A.3 of Form 20-F requires foreign private issuers to provide exchange rate data

where the financial statements required to be provided in the Form 20-F are prepared in a
currency other than the U.S. dollar. In these situations, the exchange rate between the financial
reporting currency and the U.S. dollar must be provided:
•

At the latest practicable date;

•

The high and low exchange rates for each month during the previous six months; and

•

For the five most recent financial years and any subsequent interim period for which
financial statements are presented, the average rates for each period, calculated by using
the average of the exchange rates on the last day of each month during the period.
Exchange rate information is readily available for free on a number of websites. 378 These

websites allow investors to obtain exchange rate data for the relevant periods, and investors may
obtain information that is more current than the information provided in the Form 20-F. In
addition, although certain exchange rate information, such as the average exchange rates for each
of the five most recent financial years and any subsequent interim period, may be more difficult
to obtain and necessitate investors to calculate the averages themselves, we do not expect that
investors would face significant challenges in deriving this information.

378

See, e.g., www.finance.yahoo.com; www.google.com/finance; www.bloomberg.com; and
www.reuters.com/finance.

117

Based on the foregoing, we proposed to delete Item 3.A.3 of Form 20-F.
Request for Comment
83.

Is the exchange rate information that is available on websites an adequate substitute for
the current required disclosures? Why or why not?

84.

Would the proposed amendments place a burden on retail investors?

85.

What are the burdens and costs on registrants associated with disclosing this information?
6. Foreign Private Issuer Initial Public Offering – Age of Financial Statements
Form F-1, through its reference to Item 8.A.4 of Form 20-F, requires that audited

financial statements for an initial public offering by a foreign private issuer must not be older
than 12 months as of the date of the filing. 379 Audited financial statements for all other foreign
private issuer offerings or listings must not be older than 15 months at the time of the offering or
listing. 380
Instruction 2 to Item 8.A.4 states that we will waive the 12-month requirement if the
foreign private issuer adequately represents that it is not required to comply with the 12-month
requirement in any jurisdiction outside the United States and that complying with the
requirement is impracticable or involves undue hardship. However, the issuer must still comply
with the 15-month requirement in these circumstances.
In light of this instruction, the Commission staff has almost always granted these waiver
requests. Based on the foregoing, we propose to amend Instruction 2 to Item 8.A.4 to remove
the requirement that foreign private issuers in these situations seek a waiver. This amendment
379

This age of financial statements requirement is more stringent than the requirements for domestic issuers, which
permit the age of financial statements to exceed 12 months for a period of between 45 days and 90 days after
the fiscal year end, depending on the issuer’s filer status and other conditions if the issuer is a smaller reporting
company. See Rule 8-08 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.8-08](applicable to SRCs) and Rule 3-12 of
Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.3-12] (applicable to non-SRCs)].

380

Item 8.A.4 of Form 20-F.

118

would enable foreign private issuers that file the above representations as an exhibit to the
registration statement, as currently required, to forgo the 12-month requirement and instead
comply with the 15-month requirement without incurring the time and expense associated with
the waiver process.
C. Request for Comment
86.

We solicit comment on the foregoing proposed amendments to address outdated
requirements. Is our approach to these outdated requirements appropriate? Please be as
specific as possible for each of the proposed amendments on which you provide
comments.

87.

Are there other Commission disclosure requirements that are outdated? If so, why is the
requirement outdated and how should it be amended?

V.

Superseded Requirements
A. Background
As accounting, auditing, and disclosure requirements change over time, inconsistencies

may arise between the newer requirements and existing Commission disclosure requirements.
We propose amendments to update Commission disclosure requirements to reflect, as applicable,
recent legislation, more recently updated Commission disclosure requirements, or more recently
updated U.S. GAAP requirements, as discussed in section I.C.2. 381
The Commission staff has observed in its filing reviews that, in practice, issuers
typically navigate these inconsistencies by complying with the requirement that was updated
more recently. This is particularly the case with respect to changes in U.S. GAAP requirements,
381

Some of the proposed amendments to eliminate superseded Commission disclosure requirements apply to both
issuers that report under U.S. GAAP and IFRS. We do not expect our proposed amendments to conform these
requirements to U.S. GAAP to cause confusion for issuers that report under IFRS because U.S. GAAP and
IFRS are substantially converged for these topics.

119

as the Commission has designated the FASB as the private-sector accounting standard setter for
U.S. financial reporting purposes, as discussed in section I.C.1. As such, we anticipate that these
proposed amendments generally will not affect current disclosure practices. Periodically,
however, issuers and their advisers express confusion about how the more recently updated
requirements affect existing Commission disclosure requirements and seek guidance from the
Commission staff. In these situations, the proposed amendments should help simplify
compliance by updating superseded Commission disclosure requirements and addressing any
potential confusion by codifying Commission staff guidance. In turn, investors and other users
should benefit from greater consistency across issuers.
Section V.B below discusses each Commission disclosure requirement that we believe is
superseded and the proposed amendment. 382
B. Proposed Amendments
1. Auditing Standards
Section 103(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act authorized the PCAOB to establish auditing
and related professional practice standards used by registered public accountants when
conducting audits of issuers. 383 Prior to the creation of the PCAOB, public accounting firms
conducted audits of issuers pursuant to Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (“GAAS”) 384
and many Commission rules continue to refer to those standards. In addition, section 10A of the
Exchange Act also refers to GAAS in its requirements for audits. The standards of the PCAOB
are different from GAAS.
382

This section also includes proposed technical corrections of non-existent or incorrect references.

383

Pub. L. 107-204, 116 Stat. 745 (2002). Pursuant to section 2(a)(7) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, an issuer is
defined as an issuer with securities registered under section 12 of the Exchange Act or required to file reports
under section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 15 U.S.C. 7201(a)(7).

384

These standards are currently promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

120

In 2004, the Commission published interpretive guidance explaining that references to
GAAS in Commission rules and staff guidance, as they relate to issuers, should be understood to
mean the standards of the PCAOB plus any applicable rules of the Commission. 385 The
Commission also stated its intent to codify this interpretation in the future. 386
We propose to codify the 2004 interpretation by amending Rule 1-02(d) of Regulation SX to refer to “the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(“PCAOB”)” as it relates to the audit of issuers and to note that, for different types of nonissuers, the Commission requires PCAOB auditing standards or GAAS or permits the use of
either. 387 We are also proposing amendments to Rule 436(d)(4) of Regulation C and General
Instructions E(c)(3) and G(f)(1) and Instruction 2 to Item 8.A.2 of Form 20-F to replace the
references to GAAS with “the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (“PCAOB”)” and to state that financial statements of entities other than the issuer
must be audited in accordance with applicable professional standards. Additionally, we propose
amending Rule 2-01(f)(7)(ii)(B) of Regulation S-X to update its language to make it consistent
with current auditing standards, Rules 2-02(b)(1), 8-03, and 10-01 of Regulation S-X to refer to
“applicable professional standards” instead of GAAS, and Rules 10A-1(b)(3) 388 and 13b22(b)(2) 389 of the Exchange Act to replace the references to GAAS with “the standards of the

385

See Commission Guidance Regarding the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s Auditing and Related
Professional Practice Standard No. 1, Release No. 34-49708 (May 14, 2004) [69 FR 29064]. Subsequently,
section 982 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”)
amended the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to establish the PCAOB’s authority to oversee the independent public
accountants that audit registered brokers and dealers. See Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010).

386

Id.

387

The auditing standards of the PCAOB apply to all issuers and only some entities that are not issuers as defined
by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (e.g., broker-dealers). For other non-issuers, GAAS is permitted.

Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.” Related to auditing, we are also proposing an
amendment to Instruction E(c)(3) of Form 20-F to clarify the auditor independence requirement
by replacing the reference to U.S. standards for auditor independence with “qualified and
independent in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation S-X.”
2. Statement of Cash Flows
In October 1992, to conform to changes in U.S. GAAP, 390 the Commission amended
various rules and forms to replace references to “changes in financial position” and “funds
flows” with “cash flows.” 391 The 1992 amendments inadvertently failed to amend the title of
Rule 3-02 of Regulation S-X, which continues to refer to changes in financial position. We
propose to replace that reference in the title of Rule 3-02.
3. Gain or Loss on Sale of Properties by REITs 392
Regulation S-X requires REITs to present separately all gains and losses on the sale of
properties outside of continuing operations in the income statement. 393 U.S. GAAP, however,
restricts that presentation to gains and losses on disposals that meet the definition of discontinued
operations. 394
Prior to 2014, application of Regulation S-X often resulted in the same presentation as
U.S. GAAP because most REIT dispositions met the definition of discontinued operations, such
that any gains or losses were presented outside of continuing operations in compliance with both
requirements. In 2014, the FASB narrowed the definition of discontinued operations in U.S.
390

In November 1987, the FASB superseded APB Opinion No. 19, Reporting Changes in Financial Position, with
its issuance of SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows.

Regulation S-X. We propose to update Regulation S-X by eliminating Rule 3-15(a)(1).
4. Consolidation 396
The Commission provided guidance on the presentation of consolidated and combined
financial statements when it first issued Regulation S-X in 1940. 397 Since that time, certain U.S.
GAAP consolidation requirements have changed significantly, creating inconsistencies between
Regulation S-X and U.S. GAAP. 398 To address these inconsistencies, we propose the
amendments discussed below.
a. Difference in Fiscal Periods
Regulation S-X prohibits the consolidation of an entity if its fiscal period differs
substantially, for example by more than 93 days, from that of the issuer. 399 U.S. GAAP,

395

See Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and
Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals
of Components of an Entity. ASU No. 2014-08 is effective for public business entities on a prospective basis to:
(1) all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity that occur within annual periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years and (2) all businesses that, on
acquisition, are classified as held for sale that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15,
2014, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or
classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available
for issuance.

Please refer to the related discussions in sections II.B.2, III.C.2, and III.E.2.

397

See Adoption of Regulation S-X, 5 FR 954 (March 6, 1940) [5 FR 954].

398

For example, Accounting Research Bulletin (“ARB”) No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements (“ARB No.
51”), was issued in 1959. More recently, the FASB has issued SFAS No. 94, Consolidation of All MajorityOwned Subsidiaries – an amendment of ARB No. 51, with related amendments of APB Opinion No. 18 and ARB
No. 43, Chapter 12; FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities – an interpretation
of ARB No. 51; FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities – an interpretation of ARB No. 51; SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R); and
ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.

See Rule 3A-02(b) [17 CFR 210.3A-02(b)] and Rule 3A-02(b)(1) [17 CFR 210.3A-02(b)(1)] of Regulation SX.

123

however, requires consolidation despite different fiscal periods. 400 Thus, we propose to update
Regulation S-X by deleting the consolidation prohibition in Rule 3A-02(b).
Regulation S-X permits the combination of entities under common control even if their
fiscal periods differ by more than 93 days, but requires the recasting of the latest fiscal year to
within 93 days and disclosure of amounts excluded or included more than once as a result of the
recasting. 401 Under U.S. GAAP, the fiscal periods of combined entities must differ by less than
about three months. 402 Thus, we propose to update Regulation S-X by deleting Rule 3A02(b)(2).
b. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956
The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHC Act”) 403 prohibits a bank holding
company from certain holdings and activities. 404 When a bank becomes involved in a prohibited
activity, for example through a business combination or possession of collateral, the bank
holding company may temporarily continue these activities, as long as the bank holding
company disposes of the restricted activities within the grace period afforded by the BHC Act. 405
Regulation S-X prohibits consolidation of subsidiaries of issuers subject to the BHC Act
when a divestiture has been made or it is substantially likely that the divestiture will be necessary
in order to comply with provisions of the BHC Act. 406 U.S. GAAP, however, does not provide

such an exception to consolidation. 407 Instead, U.S. GAAP requires consolidation of such
subsidiaries until their disposal, but provides for their separate presentation in the financial
statements prior to disposal if they meet the criteria for “held for sale” classification. 408 Thus,
we propose to delete Rule 3A-02(c).
c. Intercompany Transactions Generally
Regulation S-X provides disclosure requirements for intercompany transactions that are
not eliminated. 409 U.S. GAAP, however, requires the elimination of intercompany transactions
from consolidated financial statements. 410 Accordingly, we propose to update Regulation S-X
by deleting this disclosure requirement in Rule 3A-04.
d. Intercompany Transactions in Separate Financial Statements
When separate financial statements of a subset of a consolidated group, such as a parent,
subsidiaries, or investees, are presented, Regulation S-X contemplates the elimination of some
transactions between the subset of the consolidated group presented in the separate financial
statements and other entities in the consolidated group. 411 U.S. GAAP, however, does not permit
elimination of these transactions in the separate financial statements. 412 Rather, U.S. GAAP

407

ASC 810-10-15-10a. See also paragraph C2.a of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets (August 2001), which eliminated the pre-existing exception from consolidation for
subsidiaries under temporary control under ARB No. 51.

408

See ASC 360-10-45-9, ASC 360-10-45-14, and ASC 205-20-45.

409

Specifically, if an issuer does not eliminate intercompany transactions from its financial statements, it must
explain why and how the transactions are treated. See Rule 3A-04 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.3A-04].

410

See ASC 323-10-35-5a and ASC 810-10-45-1.

411

This provision is implicit in the first sentence of Rule 4-08(k)(2) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.4-08(k)(2)],
which requires disclosure of which intercompany amounts are eliminated or not eliminated.

412

U.S. GAAP requires elimination of intercompany transactions only in consolidated financial statements. See
ASC 810-10-45-1.

125

treats these transactions as related party transactions for which disclosure is required. 413
Accordingly, we propose to delete this requirement in Rule 4-08(k)(2).
e. Dividends Per Share in Interim Financial Statements
Regulation S-X requires, for interim periods, the presentation of dividends per share on
the face of the income statement. 414 U.S. GAAP permits this disclosure in the notes to the
financial statements, but prohibits it on the face of the financial statements. 415 Because of this
prohibition under U.S. GAAP, the requirement under Regulation S-X results in a presentation
that does not comply with U.S. GAAP.
To address this issue, we propose to eliminate the requirement to present dividends per
share on the face of the income statement for interim periods in Rule 8-03(a)(2) and Rule 1001(b)(2). Because we believe that the presentation of interim dividends per share is useful,
however, we propose to require its presentation alongside disclosure of changes in stockholders’
equity. To effect this relocation of the interim dividends per share disclosure, as discussed in
section III.C.16, we propose to extend Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X, which requires annual
disclosure of changes in stockholders’ equity and the amount of dividends per share for each
class of shares, to interim periods. 416

413

See ASC 850-10-50-1.

414

See Rule 8-03(a)(2) [17 CFR 210.8-03(a)(2)] and Rule 10-01(b)(2) [17 CFR 210.10-01(b)(2)] of Regulation SX . Rule 8-03(a)(2) specifically applies to SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under
U.S. GAAP, while Rule 10-01(b)(2) applies to non-SRCs.

415

See ASC 260-10-45-5.

416

Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.3-04] provides that annual disclosures of changes in stockholders’
equity, including dividends per share amounts, may be provided in a note to the financial statements or in a
separate financial statement. The option to present dividend per share disclosures in a separate financial
statement does not comply with U.S. GAAP, which, as discussed above, prohibits this per share presentation on
the face of financial statements. However, we see benefits in continuing to provide (and extending to interim
periods) an option to present dividends per share on the face of the statement of stockholders’ equity, if an
issuer elects to present changes in stockholders’ equity in a separate financial statement, irrespective of the
prohibition under U.S. GAAP. We believe that the presentation of dividends per share alongside disclosure of

126

This proposed amendment may create some additional burden for issuers, including
Regulation A issuers, because it would require disclosure of dividends per share for each class of
shares, rather than only for common stock. The proposed amendment, as discussed in section
III.C.16, would also require disclosure of changes in stockholders’ equity in interim periods. 417
However, we expect this burden would be minimal, as the required information is already
available from the preparation of other aspects of the interim financial statements. The proposed
amendments may also give rise to Disclosure Location Considerations in that issuers will now
disclose dividends in a separate financial statement or in the notes, instead of the face of the
income statement.
Request for Comment
88.

Should we retain the option to present dividends per share on the face of the statement of
stockholders’ equity, despite the U.S. GAAP prohibition?

changes in stockholders’ equity facilitates investor understanding of stockholders’ equity, as dividends are
distributed from stockholders’ equity. In addition, the proposed amendments would address the more
significant issue in Regulation S-X associated with the requirement to present interim dividends per share on the
income statement, which is unrelated to dividends, a component of stockholders’ equity.
For Regulation A issuers, we propose amendments directly to Forms 1-A and 1-SA to require interim
disclosures of changes in stockholders’ equity and dividends per share amounts to address the inconsistency
described above with U.S. GAAP, rather than to refer to Rule 3-04. The proposed amendments to Form 1-A
would apply to all Regulation A issuers and the proposed amendments to Form 1-SA would apply to all
Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering, even though Rule 8-03(a)(2) only applies to Regulation A issuers in a
Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP. However, we do not expect any increased burdens for Regulation
A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under IFRS, as such issuers are already required to present a condensed
statement of changes in equity and dividend amounts either in the aggregate or per share, pursuant to paragraphs
8 and 16A(f), respectively, of IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. We expect the burdens for Regulation A
issuers in a Tier 1 offering that report under U.S. GAAP on Form 1-A to be minimal, as the required
information already would be available from the preparation of the interim financial statements.
417

ASC 505-10-50-2 requires disclosure of changes in the separate accounts comprising stockholders’ equity
during at least the most recent annual fiscal period and any subsequent interim period presented. The proposed
amendments would require disclosure of changes in stockholders’ equity for each period presented, which
would include comparative periods.

127

89.

Should we extend requirements to disclose changes in stockholders’ equity to interim
periods, as proposed? Would doing so pose any significant burdens and costs on issuers?
Would the proposed requirements benefit investors? If so, how?
f. Interim Financial Statements – Pro Forma Business Combination
Information 418
Regulation S-X 419 and U.S. GAAP 420 both require supplemental pro forma information

about business combinations in the notes to interim financial statements. In 2010, the FASB
clarified that the pro forma financial information should reflect the business combination as if it
occurred at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year. 421 At the time, the Commission staff
acknowledged that the U.S. GAAP clarification diverged from Regulation S-X, but stated that it
did not object to application of Regulation S-X in a manner consistent with U.S. GAAP, while it
considered ways to update Regulation S-X. 422 To update Regulation S-X, we propose to delete
reference in Rule 8-03(b)(4) and Rule 10-01(b)(4) to when a business combination should be
assumed to have occurred in pro forma financial information.
5. Development Stage Entities
Regulation S-X requires presentation in interim periods of cumulative financial
information from inception for development stage companies. 423 In June 2014, the FASB

U.S. GAAP, while Rule 10-01(b)(4) applies to non-SRCs.

U.S. GAAP, while and Rule 10-01(a)(7) applies to non-SRCs.

eliminated the U.S. GAAP requirement for development stage companies to present cumulative
financial information from inception. 424 To update Regulation S-X, we propose to eliminate this
requirement in Rule 8-03(b)(6) and Rule 10-01(a)(7).
6. Insurance Companies 425
a. Statutory Accounting Requirements
Regulation S-X permits mutual life insurance companies and their wholly-owned stock
insurance company subsidiaries to prepare financial statements in accordance with statutory
accounting requirements. 426 The Commission originally provided this alternative because, prior
to 1995, U.S. GAAP did not address accounting by mutual life insurance companies. 427 In 1995,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 120, Accounting and Reporting by Mutual Life Insurance
Enterprises and by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Participating Contracts
(“SFAS No. 120”), which sets forth the accounting requirements for mutual life insurance
companies and does not permit use of statutory accounting in U.S. GAAP financial
statements. 428

Currently, no issuers under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act rely on Rule

424

ASU No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting
Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation.

financial information from inception disclosures were effective for public business entities on a retrospective
basis for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein.

428

SFAS No. 120 extended the requirements of SFAS No. 60, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises
(“SFAS No. 60”), SFAS No. 97, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain LongDuration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments, and SFAS No. 113,

to mutual life insurance companies.

129

7-02(b) of Regulation S-X as a basis to report under statutory accounting requirements. 429 We,
therefore, propose to eliminate Rule 7-02(b).
b. Reinsurance Recoverable
Regulation S-X requires insurance company balance sheets to separately present an asset
called “reinsurance recoverable on paid losses.” 430 This requirement aligned with SFAS No. 60,
Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises, which required that amounts recoverable
from reinsurers on paid losses be classified as an asset, but that amounts recoverable from
reinsurers on unpaid losses be classified as a reduction of liabilities. 431 In 1992, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 113, which established that reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses are also assets. 432
SFAS No. 113 further provided that amounts recoverable from reinsurers on unpaid losses may
be presented together with other reinsurance receivables or separately. 433 To conform to SFAS
No. 113, we propose to delete the reference to paid losses in Rule 7-03(a)(6).
c. Separate Account Assets
Regulation S-X requires the amount of assets held in separate accounts – defined as
assets used to fund liabilities related to variable annuities, pension funds, and similar activities –

429

Some insurance companies sponsoring variable annuity contracts for registration on Forms N-3 and N-4 under
the Investment Company Act and the Securities Act and some insurance companies offering variable life
insurance contracts for registration on Form N-6 under the Investment Company Act and Securities Act prepare
financial statements under statutory accounting requirements. These companies are permitted to do so in certain
circumstances by the applicable form requirements. Specifically, each of these forms requires financial
statements of the insurance company and states that if the insurance company would not have to prepare
financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP except for use in the registration statement being filed or
other specified registration statements used for variable insurance contracts, then its financial statements may be
prepared in accordance with statutory accounting requirements. See Form N-3, Item 28(b), Instruction 1; Form
N-4, Item 23(b), Instruction 1; Form N-6, Item 24(b), Instruction 1. The proposed elimination of Rule 7-02(b)
would not change these forms.

sheet. 434 U.S. GAAP, however, defines differently separate account assets that are required to be
reported as a summary total. 435 We propose to replace the reference to variable annuities,
pension funds, and similar activities in Rule 7-03(a)(11) with a reference to U.S. GAAP for
assets to be reported as a summary total.
7. Bank Holding Companies 436
a. Net Presentation
Regulation S-X requires federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements or similar arrangements to be presented on the balance sheet gross of federal funds
purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase. 437 U.S. GAAP permits net
presentation under certain conditions. 438 To conform with U.S. GAAP, we propose to delete this
requirement in Rule 9-03.3 of Regulation S-X.
b. Goodwill
Regulation S-X requires that goodwill net of amortization be presented on the balance
sheet or disclosed in a note to the financial statements, 439 with goodwill amortization presented
on the income statement. 440 However, in June 2001, the FASB issued a standard that prohibits

amortization of goodwill. 441 To update Regulation S-X, we propose to eliminate the
parenthetical reference to net of amortization in Rule 9-03.10(1) of Regulation S-X. 442 We also
propose to delete the reference to goodwill amortization in Rule 9-04.14(c).
8. Discontinued Operations
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K contain specific requirements related to discontinued
segments and disposed segments, respectively. 443 For purposes of these Commission disclosure
requirements, the term “segments” refers to discontinued operations that are presented separately
on the income statement, as prescribed by a now-superseded requirement in U.S. GAAP. 444
Since the adoption of these Commission disclosure requirements, the definition of “discontinued
operations” under U.S. GAAP has changed multiple times and no longer incorporates the term
“segment.” 445
To update Commission disclosure requirements, we propose to replace the reference to
“segments” in Instruction 1 to Rule 11-02(b) of Regulation S-X and Item 302(a)(3) of Regulation
S-K with the more appropriate term, “discontinued operations.”

441

See SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

442

We also propose to clarify Rule 9-03.10(1) by replacing the phrase “Excess of cost over tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired” with “goodwill.”

443

Specifically Instruction 1 to Rule 11-02(b) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.11-02(b)] states that the historical
income statement used in pro forma financial information shall not report operations of discontinued segments,
among other items. Item 302(a)(3) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.302(a)(3)] requires a description of the
effect of any disposals of segments of a business, among other items.

444

See APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations – Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment
of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.

9. Pooling-of-Interests
In April 2009, following the FASB’s elimination of the pooling-of-interests method of
accounting, 446 the Commission adopted technical amendments to certain rules and forms to,
among other items, eliminate references to pooling-of-interests and replace them with references
to combinations of entities under common control. 447 The 2009 amendments inadvertently
omitted to replace such references in Rule 11-02(c)(2)(ii) of Regulation S-X, 448 Rule 405 of
Regulation C, Item 4A(b)(1)(iii) of Form F-1, Instruction 1 to paragraphs (e) and (f) of Item 3 of
Form F-4, Item 10(c)(3) of Form F-4, the introduction to Item 12 of Form F-4, and Item
12(b)(2)(iv) of Form F-4. We propose to update these references accordingly. 449
10. Statement of Comprehensive Income
Various Commission disclosure requirements and forms refer to “income statements” and
variations thereof. In June 2011, the FASB replaced the income statement with the statement of
comprehensive income. 450 Comprehensive income is the change in equity of a business entity
during the period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner

17 CFR 210.11-02(c)(2)(ii).

449

We also propose to replace references to “acquired businesses” with “transferred businesses” in Item
4A(b)(1)(iii) of Form F-1, Item 10(c)(3) of Form F-4, the introduction to Item 12 of Form F-4, and Item
12(b)(2)(iv) of Form F-4, as combinations of entities under common control are not referred to as acquisitions.
See ASC 805-50.

450

See ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. ASU No.
2011-05 was effective for public entities on a retrospective basis for fiscal years, and interim periods within
those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
The statement of comprehensive income may be presented as either: (1) a single statement of comprehensive
income or (2) two separate but consecutive statements, comprised of the income statement and a separate
statement, which begins with net income and separately presents the components of other comprehensive
income, a total of other comprehensive income, and a total of comprehensive income.

133

sources. 451 In light of the FASB’s revision, various Commission disclosure requirements and
forms that refer only to an income statement (or similar term) are no longer consistent with U.S.
GAAP because they do not address the presentation of comprehensive income.
To update Commission disclosure requirements, we propose to replace (or, in some
cases, supplement) the existing references to “income statement” and variations thereof with
“statement of comprehensive income” in our rules and forms. We also propose to clarify the two
presentation options for the statement by defining the term “statement of comprehensive income”
in Regulation S-X. 452
We further propose to amend Rule 5-03, Rule 7-04, and Rule 9-04 of Regulation S-X to
add line items to present comprehensive income and related items in the statement of
comprehensive income.

451

See ASC Glossary.

452

The proposed amendments apply to the following rules: Rule 1-02 [ 17 CFR 210.1-02], Rule 3-02 [17 CFR

229.302], and Item 303 [17 CFR 229.303] of Regulation S-K, Item 1010 [17 CFR 229.1010] of Regulation MA, Securities Act Rule 158 [17 CFR 230.158], Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1g [17 CFR 240.15c3-1g], Exchange
Act Rule 17a-5 [17 CFR 240.17a-5], Exchange Act Rule 17a-12 [240.17a-12], Exchange Act rule 17g-3 [17
CFR 240.17g-3], and Exchange Act Rule 17h-1T [17 CFR 240.17h-1T]. The proposed amendments also apply
to the following forms: Form 1-A [17 CFR 239.90], Form 1-K [17 CFR 239.91], Form 1-SA [17 CFR 239.92],
Form 20-F [17 CFR 249.220f], Form 11-K [17 CFR 249.311], and Form X-17A-5 [17 CFR 249.617].
Investment companies generally do not have any other comprehensive income. ASC 220-10-15-3(a) states that
entities that have no items of other comprehensive income are not required to report other comprehensive
income or comprehensive income. Accordingly, we are not proposing to include references to “statement of
comprehensive income” within the rules and forms applicable to investment companies, other than a reference
within Rule 6-07 of Regulation S-X to allow for statements of operations to be replaced with statements of
comprehensive income, where applicable.

134

In addition, U.S. GAAP requires accumulated other comprehensive income to be
separately presented in the equity section of the balance sheet. 453 We propose to amend Rule 502.30(a) 454 and Rule 7-03(a)(23)(a) 455 of Regulation S-X to include accumulated other
comprehensive income in its list of balance sheet line items. 456 We also propose to delete the
reference in Rule 7-03(a)(23)(a) to unrealized appreciation or depreciation of equity securities, as
it is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and, under U.S. GAAP, is
required to be presented separately either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes
thereto. 457
11. Extraordinary Items
Various Commission disclosure requirements and forms refer to extraordinary items. In
January 2015, the FASB eliminated extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP. 458 To update
Commission disclosure requirements, we propose to delete references to extraordinary items in
our rules and forms. 459

17 CFR 210.5-02.30(a).

456

We do not propose to amend Rule 9-03 of Regulation S-X. Through its reference to Rule 5-02.30, which we
propose to amend, Rule 9-03 would be effectively updated if we adopt the proposed amendment to Rule 502.30.

457

See ASC 220-10-45-14A.

458

See ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement – Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying
Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items. Previously, ASC 225-2045-2 defined “extraordinary items” as an event or transaction that is unusual in nature and infrequent in
occurrence, and ASC 225-20-45-3 required separate presentation of the effect of the extraordinary item on the
income statement. ASU No. 2015-01 is effective for public business entities on a prospective or retrospective
basis for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early
adoption is permitted provided that the ASU is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.

459

The proposed amendments apply to the following rules: Rule 1-02(w)(3) [17 CFR 210.1-02(w)(3)], Rule 102(bb)(1)(ii) [17 CFR 210.1-02(bb)(1)(ii)], Rule 3-01(c)(2) [17 CFR 210.3-01(c)(2)], Rule 3-01(c)(3) [17 CFR

12. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles 460
Various Commission disclosure requirements and forms refer to a line on the income
statement for a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. A change in accounting
principle is a change from one generally accepted accounting principle to another generally
accepted accounting principle when there are two or more generally accepted accounting
principles that may be used or when the accounting principle formerly used is no longer
generally accepted. 461 Prior to 2005, U.S. GAAP ordinarily required that the cumulative effect,
or total effect on prior periods, of a change in accounting principle be reported separately in a
single line in the income statement in the period the change took effect. 462 In 2005, the FASB
eliminated from U.S. GAAP the requirement to report cumulative effect of a change in
Rule 11-02(b)(7) [17 CFR 210.11-02(b)(7)], and Instruction 1 to Rule 11-02 [17 CFR 210.11-02] of Regulation
S-X, Item 10(b)(2) [17 CFR 229.10(b)(2)], Item 302(a)(1) [17 CFR 229.302(a)(1)], and Item 302(a)(3) [17 CFR
229.302(a)(3)] of Regulation S-K, Securities Act Rule 405, Exchange Act Rule 3a51-1(a)(2)(i)(A)(3) [ 17 CFR
240.3a51-1(a)(2)(i)(A)(3)], Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 [17 CFR 240.12b-2], Exchange Act Rule 13a-10(b) [17
CFR 240.13a-10(b)], and Exchange Act 15d-10(b) [17 CFR 240.15d-10(b)]. The proposed amendments also
apply to Form X-17A-5 [17 CFR 249.617].
Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act contains a net income measure that is used in evaluating whether certain
equity securities are penny stocks, which currently excludes “extraordinary and non-recurring items” from the
net income calculation. As a result of the proposed amendment, the reference to “extraordinary items” will be
deleted, but the exclusion of non-recurring items from net income will remain. The deletion of the
“extraordinary items” reference from net income calculations under Rule 3a51-1 is not intended to affect the
application of the rule, as the Commission believes that non-recurring items encompass items that would have
been “extraordinary items” previously. Thus, the calculation of net income for purposes of Rule 3a51-1 should
not change.
While the FASB has eliminated the concept of extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP for general purpose
financial reporting, the concept of extraordinary expenses is still relevant for investment companies, particularly
in disclosure of expense ratios in registration statements. Certain investment company registration forms
eliminate extraordinary expenses from expense ratios in the fee table in order to disclose to investors the
ongoing level of expense that can be expected. We believe it is appropriate to continue requiring that
extraordinary expenses be excluded in the fee table and require footnote disclosure reflecting extraordinary
expenses if they would have a material effect. Thus, the investment company registration forms (Form N-1A,
Form N-3, Form N-4 [17 CFR 239.17b and 274.11c], and Form N-6) that reference extraordinary items in
relation to expenses and the related historical U.S. GAAP definition are being amended to include a definition
of extraordinary expenses, consistent with the historical U.S. GAAP definition. With these proposed
amendments, we do not intend to change the content required to be presented in these forms.

accounting principle in the income statement. 463 U.S. GAAP now requires, unless impracticable
or otherwise provided for in a newly issued accounting standards update, retrospective
application of a change in accounting principle to all prior periods, with the cumulative effect
reported in the opening balance of retained earnings for the earliest period presented. 464
To update Commission disclosure requirements, we propose to eliminate references to
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. 465
13. Published Report Regarding Matters Submitted to Vote of Security Holders
Prior to 2009, Forms 10-K and 10-Q required disclosure of the voting results for matters
that were submitted to shareholders. 466 Issuers were able to satisfy this disclosure requirement
by providing the disclosure within the forms or by referring to a report containing the voting
results and filing such report as an exhibit to the applicable form pursuant to Regulation S-K. 467
In 2009, the Commission eliminated the requirement to disclose shareholder voting
results in Forms 10-K and 10-Q and added it to Item 5.07 of Form 8-K. 468 As such, we propose
to eliminate Item 601(b)(22) of Regulation S-K and its accompanying inclusion in the Exhibit
Table within Item 601, as these requirements are no longer applicable.
463

See SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. This is now reflected in ASC 250, Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections.

464

See ASC 250-10-45-5. Where impracticable or otherwise provided for in a newly issued accounting standards
update, U.S. GAAP requires prospective application such that the existing line on the income statement for a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is unnecessary.

465

The proposed amendments apply to the following rules: Rule 1-02, Rule 3-01, Rule 3-15, Rule 5-03, Rule 7-04,
Rule 8-03, Rule 8-04, Rule 9-04, Rule 10-01, Rule 11-02, and Instruction 1 to Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X,
Item 302 of Regulation S-K, Securities Act Rule 405, Exchange Act Rule 12b-2, Exchange Act Rule 13a-10(b),
and Exchange Act Rule 15d-10(b). The proposed amendments also apply to Form X-17A-5.

466

These requirements were contained in Item 4, Part I of Form 10-K and Item 4, Part II of Form 10-Q prior to
2009.

467

See Item 601(b)(22) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(22)].

468

See Proxy Disclosure Enhancements, Release No. 33-9089, (Dec. 16, 2009) [74 FR 68334]. In addition, the
Form 8-K containing the voting results must be filed within four business days after the meeting at which the
votes took place.

137

We also propose to eliminate Item 5 of Form 10-D 469 regarding disclosure of matters
submitted to a vote of security holders. In 2009, when the Commission adopted Item 5.07 of
Form 8-K, it did not exclude asset-backed issuers from the requirements; however, Item 5 of
Form 10-D was not revised or eliminated following the adoption of Item 5.07 of Form 8-K. 470
Rather, current Item 5 of Form 10-D contains a reference to Item 4 of Part II to Form 10-Q,
which, as stated above, was eliminated with the adoption of Item 5.07 to Form 8-K. 471 As such,
we propose to eliminate Item 5 of Form 10-D.
14. Selected Financial Data for Foreign Private Issuers that Report under IFRS
Prior to 2005, Form 20-F required all foreign private issuers, including those that
reported under IFRS, to present five years of selected financial data under their primary basis of
accounting and U.S. GAAP. 472 As a result of two amendments, foreign private issuers that
report under IFRS are now only required to present selected financial data under IFRS for those
periods for which the issuer has prepared financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
Specifically:
•

In April 2005, the Commission amended Form 20-F to allow foreign private issuers to
present two years of financial statements, instead of three, in the year that they first adopt

469

17 CFR 249.312.

470

A Form 10-D is a periodic distribution report for asset-backed issuers that is typically filed three weeks or more
after the end of a reporting period. Reporting on Form 8-K provides users of the information with a date certain
upon which disclosure of the results of a vote is required and reduces delay between the end of a meeting and
when voting results are disclosed in periodic reports. See 17 FR 68334 at 68350. Investors in asset-backed
securities may vote for a variety of reasons, such as to amend the terms of the securities (e.g., maturity date),
substitute transaction parties, or to trigger a review of the underlying assets.

471

Current Item 4 of Part II to Form 10-Q refers to mine safety disclosure requirements.

472

Item 3.A of Form 20-F provides an exception from presenting up to the earliest two of the five years of selected
financial data under the primary basis of accounting and U.S. GAAP if the issuer represents that such
information cannot be provided without unreasonable effort or expense.

138

IFRS. 473 At the time, the Commission created a new General Instruction G(c), which
states that, for first-time IFRS adopters, selected financial data prepared under IFRS is
only required for the two most recent financial years.
•

In December 2007, the Commission eliminated the reconciliation requirement for foreign
private issuers that prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS. 474 In adopting
amendments to Form 20-F to reflect the elimination of the reconciliation requirement, the
Commission also clarified that selected financial data based on the U.S. GAAP
reconciliation is only required if the issuer prepares its financial statements using a basis
of accounting other than IFRS. 475
However, General Instruction G(c) of Form 20-F continues to require an issuer that

reports under IFRS to present selected financial data in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the five
most recent years. To update Form 20-F, we propose to amend: (1) General Instruction G(c) of
Form 20-F to delete the requirement to present selected financial data in accordance with U.S.
GAAP and (2) Instruction 2 to Item 3.A of Form 20-F to explicitly state that selected financial
data is required only for the periods for which the issuer has prepared financial statements in
accordance with IFRS.
15. Canadian Regulation A Issuers
Foreign private issuers that report under IFRS must comply with IFRS requirements for
form and content within the financial statements rather than the specific presentation and

disclosure provisions in Regulation S-X. 476 Regulation A permits Canadian issuers to report
under IFRS. 477 However, in certain places, Forms 1-A and 1-SA inadvertently refer all
Regulation A issuers, including Canadian issuers that report under IFRS, to rules in Regulation
S-X, rather than IFRS, for the form and content within the financial statements. 478 As we did not
intend for the form and content requirements in Regulation S-X to apply to Canadian Regulation
A issuers reporting under IFRS, we propose to amend such references to Regulation S-X in
Forms 1-A and 1-SA only to apply to Regulation A issuers that report under U.S. GAAP.
16. Non-Existent or Incorrect References
Various Commission disclosure requirements contain non-existent or incorrect
references. We propose to update them as follows:
•

Rule 5-02 of Regulation S-X refers in four places 479 to Rule 4-05 of Regulation S-X,
which no longer exists. We propose to delete these references.

•

Rule 5-02.22(a) of Regulation S-X refers to Rule 4-06 of Regulation S-X, which no
longer exists. We propose to delete this reference.

•

Rule 7-04.9 of Regulation S-X on income tax expense refers to Rule 4-08(g) of
Regulation S-X, which addresses summarized financial information of investments
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. This reference should be to Rule
4-08(h) of Regulation S-X, which addresses income tax expense. We propose to update
this reference accordingly.

Rule 9-03.7(e)(3) of Regulation S-X refers to Rule 4-08(L)(3), which no longer exists.
We propose to delete this reference.

•

Item 512(a)(4) of Regulation S-K provides that a post-effective amendment need not be
filed to include on Form F-3 the financial statements and information required by Rule 319 of Regulation S-X, if such financial statements and information are filed or furnished
on reports incorporated by reference in the Form F-3. 480 However, Rule 3-19 no longer
exists. When the Commission revised Form 20-F in 1999, it replaced references to Rule
3-19 with references to Item 8.A of Form 20-F as the source for foreign private issuer
financial statement requirements, but inadvertently omitted to replace the reference in
Item 512(a)(4). 481 We propose to update Item 512(a)(4) accordingly.

•

General Instruction J(1)(e) to Form 10-K is blank. Although the Commission deleted the
instruction in 2011, 482 it did not reserve the instruction. We propose to clarify that
General Instruction J(1)(e) is reserved.

•

General Instruction J(1)(f) to Form 10-K permits asset-backed issuers to omit Item 5 of
Form 10-K, but the Instruction incorrectly describes Item 5. We propose to conform the
description in Instruction J(1)(f) to the title of Item 5 of Form 10-K: Market for
Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of
Equity Securities.

•

Paragraph (c)(1)(i) of Part F/S of Form 1-A refers to the age of interim financial
statements discussed in paragraphs (b)(3)-(4) of Part F/S. However, paragraphs (b)(3)-

reference, we propose to delete “interim” in paragraph (c)(1)(i).

Forms F-1, F-3, F-4, F-6, 483 F-7, 484 F-8, 485 F-10, 486 F-80, 487 20-F, and 40-F 488 include
references to incorrect telephone numbers and offices at the Commission. We propose to
update these references to the correct telephone numbers and offices.

current baseline, which consists of both the regulatory framework of disclosure requirements in
existence today and the current use of such disclosure by investors and other users. As discussed
above, we are proposing amendments to certain of our disclosure requirements that may have
become redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded, in light of other
Commission disclosure requirements, U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or changes in the information
environment. We are also soliciting comment on certain Commission disclosure requirements
that overlap with, but require information incremental to, U.S. GAAP to determine whether to
retain, modify, eliminate, or refer them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.
These proposals are a result of the Division of Corporation Finance’s Disclosure Effectiveness
Initiative and part of our efforts to implement title LXXII, section 72002(2) of the Fixing
America’s Surface Transportation Act.
The discussion below addresses the potential economic effects of the proposals, including
the likely benefits and costs, as well as the likely effects on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation. 489
A. Baseline and Affected Parties
Our baseline includes the current disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K, Regulation
S-X, and other rules and Commission forms promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, and the Investment Company Act. The parties that are likely to be affected by the proposals
include investors and other users, auditors, and entities subject to Regulation S-K, Regulation S489

Section 2(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(b)] and section 3(f) of the Exchange Act [17 U.S.C. 78c(f)]
require the Commission, when engaging in rulemaking where it is required to consider or determine whether an
action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors,
whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Further, section 23(a)(2) of the
Exchange Act [17 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2)] requires the Commission, when making rules under the Exchange Act, to
consider the impact that the rules would have on competition, and prohibits the Commission from adopting any
rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Exchange
Act.

143

X, and other rules and Commission forms promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, and the Investment Company Act.
The proposals affect both domestic issuers and foreign private issuers. We estimate
approximately 7,600 issuers that file on domestic forms 490 and 800 foreign private issuers that
file on F-forms would be affected by the proposals. Among the issuers that file on domestic
forms, 26% are large accelerated filers, 18% are accelerated filers, 18% are non-accelerated
filers, and 38% are SRCs. About 12% of issuers that file on domestic forms are also EGCs.
Among the foreign private issuers that file on F-forms, 38% are large accelerated filers, 22% are
accelerated filers, and 40% are non-accelerated filers. 491 About 15% of foreign private issuers
that file on Forms 20-F and 40-F are also EGCs. With respect to foreign private issuer
accounting standards, 43% of foreign private issuers report under U.S. GAAP, 56% report under
IFRS, and less than 1% report under Another Comprehensive Body of Accounting Principles
with a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. 492
Certain proposals also affect requirements applicable to:
•
490

Fewer than 100 asset-backed issuers.

This number includes fewer than 50 foreign private issuers that file on domestic forms, approximately 100
business development companies, and a portion of the approximately 12,000 investment advisers, as discussed
further below.

491

Approximately 16% of foreign private issuers that file on F-forms are Canadian issuers that file on Form 40-F
under the multijurisdictional disclosure system. Form 40-F does not require disclosure of large accelerated,
accelerated, or non-accelerated filer status. Accordingly, these amounts exclude foreign private issuers that file
on Form 40-F.

492

The number of domestic and foreign private issuers affected by the proposals is estimated as the number of
unique companies, identified by Central Index Key (CIK), that filed Forms 10-K, Form 20-F, and Form 40-F
with the Commission during calendar year 2015. The estimates for the percentages of SRCs, accelerated filers,
large accelerated filers, and non-accelerated filers are based on information from Form 10-K, Form 20-F, and
Form 40-F. The number of EGCs is estimated by analyzing several types of filings filed with the Commission
during calendar year 2015. The estimates for the percentages of foreign private issuers’ basis of accounting used
to prepare the financial statements are calculated from the information in Forms 20-F and 40-F. These
estimates do not include issuers that filed initial registration statements during calendar year 2015, which would
also be affected by the proposals.

144

•

Issuers that rely on Regulation A exemptions. 493

•

Approximately 4,100 investment companies, including approximately 100 business
development companies, and the portion of the approximately 12,000 investment advisers
to which Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K apply.

•

Up to approximately 4,200 registered broker-dealers. 494

•

10 NRSROs.
This release also solicits comment on certain Commission disclosure requirements that

overlap with, but require information incremental to, U.S. GAAP. 495 One potential outcome of
this feedback is a referral of these incremental requirements to the FASB for potential
incorporation into U.S. GAAP. While a referral alone would have no effect on issuers, any
changes to U.S. GAAP that may result from such a referral would potentially affect all entities
that report under U.S. GAAP, including crowdfunding issuers and those outside the scope of our
regulatory authority. Any potential changes to U.S. GAAP would be subject to the FASB’s
standard-setting process, as discussed in section I.C.
B. Potential Costs and Benefits
In this section, we discuss the anticipated economic benefits and costs of the proposals in

493

Between June 19, 2015 and July 5, 2016, approximately 48 Regulation A offerings have been qualified. Over
the same time period, approximately 108 Regulation A offering statements have been filed. Withdrawals and
post-qualification amendments are excluded.

494

The proposed amendments to Exchange Act Rules 17a-5, 17a-12, and 17h-1T, and Part III of Form X-17A-5
collectively affect approximately 4,230 broker-dealers who must file annual reports with the Commission. The
proposed amendments to Part II of Form X-17A-5 affect approximately 470 broker-dealers, based on the
number of broker-dealers who filed Part II as of September 30, 2015. The proposed amendments to Part IIA of
Form X-17A-5 affect approximately 3,685 broker-dealers, based on the number of broker-dealers who filed Part
IIA as of September 30, 2015. The proposed amendments to Part IIB of Form X-17A-5 affect approximately 4
broker-dealers, based on the number of broker-dealers who filed Part IIB as of September 30, 2015.

495

As discussed in section III.E, we are not proposing amendments to this category of disclosure requirements in
this release. Rather, the comments received in response to this release may inform both potential future
Commission rulemaking and FASB standard-setting activities.

145

each category of redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, and superseded disclosure
requirements.
1. Redundant or Duplicative Requirements
We have preliminarily identified redundant or duplicative Commission disclosure
requirements that require substantially the same disclosures as U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or other
Commission disclosure requirements. The proposed amendments would eliminate certain
redundant or duplicative Commission disclosure requirements.
Elimination of Commission disclosure requirements that are considered redundant or
duplicative with U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or other Commission disclosure requirements would
simplify issuer compliance efforts by reducing the number of rules to consider. To the extent
that the redundant or duplicative requirements result in duplicative disclosures, elimination of
these requirements also would be potentially beneficial to investors and other users. Academic
research suggests that duplication is associated with less efficient price discovery 496 and that
individuals invest more in firms with more concise financial disclosures. 497 Thus, to the extent
that the proposed amendments alleviate duplication and do not affect the completeness of
financial disclosures, 498 they could result in improved price discovery, enhance the allocative
efficiency of the market, and facilitate capital formation.
The potential adverse effects of these proposed amendments on investors and other users

are likely to be limited as these parties would still receive substantially the same information
from issuers. However, potential costs to investors may arise if U.S. GAAP were to change in
such a way that information previously required by Commission disclosure requirements is no
longer provided under U.S. GAAP. 499 The potential for such changes may be mitigated by the
FASB’s transparent, public standard-setting process and our oversight of the FASB. 500
2. Overlapping Requirements
We have preliminarily identified Commission disclosure requirements that are related to,
but not the same as, U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or other Commission disclosure requirements. For
certain of these overlapping requirements, the proposed amendments would: (a) delete the
overlapping Commission disclosure requirements or (b) integrate them with other related
Commission disclosure requirements. For certain other overlapping requirements, we are
soliciting comment on certain Commission disclosure requirements to determine whether to
retain, modify, eliminate, or refer them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.
We discuss below the economic effects of the proposals and provide examples of requirements
affected by the proposals.
First, some proposals may give rise to Disclosure Location Considerations. Where
proposals relocate existing disclosure from outside the financial statements to within the
financial statements, issuers may incur additional costs to comply with audit and/or interim
review and internal control over financial reporting requirements, whereas investors and other

499

See discussion of current FASB projects with the potential to broadly affect the proposed amendments in
section I.C.3.

500

See discussion in section I.C.

147

users may benefit to the extent that information is considered more reliable. 501
The relocation of existing disclosures, for example, from outside the financial statements
to within the financial statements or from the face of the financial statements to the notes to the
financial statements, may also affect the prominence of the disclosures. Some experimental
research provides indirect evidence that users may treat information differently depending on the
location of the disclosure. For instance, research shows a weaker relation between equity prices
and disclosed items (in the notes to the financial statements) versus recognized items (on the face
of the financial statements). 502 Additionally, experimental research on laboratory participants
shows that positioning pro-forma (non-GAAP) earnings earlier than U.S. GAAP earnings in an
earnings announcement influences a nonprofessional investor’s judgment. 503 Other research on
the effect of disclosure location shows recognized and disclosed items are treated equivalently by
501

In contrast, some proposed amendments may require disclosure to be moved from inside the financial
statements to outside the financial statements. In this case, the potential economic effects would be similar to
the effects discussed above but in the opposite direction.

502

See, e.g., R. M. Harper Jr., W. G. Mister, and J. R. Strawser, The Impact of New Pension Disclosure Rules on
Perceptions of Debt, Journal of Accounting Research 25, 1987 at 327 (showing that financial statement users do
not treat pension information included in a note to the financial statements as they would a balance sheet
liability); C. Viger, R. Belzile, and A. A. Anandarajan, Disclosure versus Recognition of Stock Option
Compensation: Effect on the Credit Decisions of Loan Officers, Behavioral Research in Accounting 20, 2008 at
93-113 (showing that loan officers are more affected by the same earnings recognized in the income statement
than disclosed in the notes to the financial statements); M. Müller, E.J. Riedl, and T. Sellhorn, Recognition
versus Disclosure of Fair Values, The Accounting Review 90, 2015 at 2411−2447,(showing a lower association
between equity prices and disclosed investment property fair values relative to recognized investment property
fair values. The authors also find that reduced information processing costs and higher readability mitigates the
discount applied to disclosed fair values); D. Aboody, Recognition versus Disclosure in the Oil and Gas
Industry, Journal of Accounting Research 34, 1996, at 21−32 (using the disclosure requirements for oil and gas
companies, which requires the firm-specific effect of a macroeconomic event to be recognized in the financial
statements for firms adopting the full cost method, but only requires disclosure in the notes to the financial
statements for firms following the successful efforts method, to show that the effect of note disclosure on price
differs from the effect of recognition on price); and H. Espahbodi, P. Espahbodi, Z. Rezaee, and H. Tehranian,
Stock Price Reaction and Value Relevance of Recognition versus Disclosure: The Case of Stock-Based
Compensation, Journal of Accounting and Economics 33 (3), 2002 at 343−373 (examining the equity price
reaction to the announcements related to accounting for stock-based compensation to assess the value relevance
of recognition (on the face of the financial statements) versus disclosure (in the notes to the financial
statements) and concluding that recognition and disclosure are not substitutes).

Announcements? The Accounting Review 81 (1), 2006 at 113-133.

investors. 504
The relocation of existing disclosures from outside the financial statements to within the
financial statements may also subject the disclosures to XBRL tagging requirements. Issuers
may incur additional costs to comply with these requirements, whereas investors and other users
may benefit from more readily-available information in structured formats. In general, we
believe the marginal costs of applying XBRL data tagging likely would be relatively low, as
issuers already have implemented software enabled processes and controls to structure
previously mandated disclosures.
Furthermore, the relocation of existing disclosures may affect the extent of information
that investors receive. Since the PSLRA does not provide a safe harbor for forward-looking
information located within the financial statements, issuers may be less likely to voluntarily
supplement those disclosures with forward-looking information as compared with disclosures
made outside the audited financial statements. However, issuers retain the option of providing
forward-looking information outside the financial statements if they so choose.
Second, some proposed deletions, such as those related to bright line disclosure
thresholds, may change the mix of information available to investors. Bright line thresholds set
forth explicit quantitative criteria for disclosure. If the bright line thresholds are consistent with
the preferences of investors and other users, they will result in disclosure at an appropriate level

504

P. Y. Davis-Friday, L. B. Folami, C. S. Liu, and H. F. Mittelstaedt, The Value Relevance of Financial Statement
Recognition vs. Disclosure: Evidence from SFAS No. 106, The Accounting Review. 74 (4), 1999 at 403−423
(testing whether market agents treat disclosed and recognized amounts equivalently by examining firms’
obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions before and after formal recognition. This research
focuses on a sample of 229 firms that elected disclosure of the postretirement benefit liability in the year(s)
prior to adoption of SFAS 106). The authors find that both post-retirement benefit liabilities disclosed prior to
adoption of SFAS No. 106, Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions, and those
recognized subsequent to adoption significantly contribute to explaining stock prices, thus suggesting that
market agents treat disclosed and recognized amounts equivalently).

149

of detail. If the bright line thresholds differ from the preferences of investors and other users,
they will result in too much or too little detail.
The economic effects of replacing the bright line thresholds with new criteria will depend
on the nature of the new criteria. If the new criteria are more consistent with the preferences of
investors and other users, the changes may benefit them. If the new criteria are less consistent
with the preferences of investors and other users, the changes may have negative impacts on
them. On one hand, bright line thresholds may be easier to apply. On the other hand, although
other criteria may require more judgment, may be more difficult to apply, and may lead to more
variation in disclosure, they may also permit more tailored information to be presented.
a. Deletion of Commission Disclosure Requirements
When we believe that Commission disclosure requirements: (1) require disclosures that
convey reasonably similar information to or are encompassed by the disclosures that result from
compliance with the overlapping U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or Commission disclosure requirements or
(2) require disclosures incremental to the overlapping U.S. GAAP or Commission disclosure
requirements and are no longer useful to investors, we are proposing to eliminate the
requirements.
In addition to the economic effects of changing disclosure location and bright line
disclosure thresholds, as discussed above, potential costs to investors may arise if U.S. GAAP
were to change in such a way that information previously required by Commission disclosure
requirements is no longer provided under U.S. GAAP. 505 As noted above, the potential for such
changes may be mitigated by the FASB’s transparent, public standard-setting process and the

505

See discussion of current FASB projects with the potential to broadly affect the proposals in section I.C.3.

150

Commission’s oversight of the FASB. 506
The effects of the proposed deletion of these overlapping Commission disclosure
requirements may also depend on the level of overlap between the requirements. On the one
hand, eliminating overlapping requirements may reduce search costs and lead to more efficient
information processing for investors. This, in turn, may lead to better informed investment
decisions and an increase in allocative efficiency. On the other hand, to the extent eliminating a
requirement results in a loss of information incremental to the overlapping requirement, it could
result in a loss of information for investors.
The examples below illustrate the potential effects of the proposed elimination of
Commission disclosure requirements on issuers, investors, and other users.
One example of an item we propose to delete due to its sufficient overlap with another
item is Item 101(d)(3) of Regulation S-K. Item 101(d)(3) requires risk disclosures outside the
financial statements relating to geographic areas. We believe this provision requires disclosures
that are largely encompassed by the disclosures that result from compliance with other parts of
Regulation S-K. More specifically, Item 101(d)(3) requires disclosure of “any” risks associated
with an issuer’s foreign operations. This requirement is similar to Item 503(c) of Regulation SK, which requires disclosure of “significant” risk factors. Item 101(d)(3) also requires
disclosures of a segment’s dependence on foreign operations. This requirement is similar to Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of trends and uncertainties by segment, if
appropriate to an understanding of the issuer as a whole.
Since Item 101(d)(3) is more expansive than other parts of Regulation S-K, the economic
effects of the deletion would depend on the nature of the incremental information required by
506

See discussion in section I.C.

151

Item 101(d)(3). Research shows that international corporate diversification may affect issuers’
stock market performance and valuation. For example, the required rate of return among U.S.
firms listed on the NYSE has been shown to reflect the benefit of geographical diversification. 507
There is also a positive correlation between the level of foreign operations and firm value, 508 and
studies have found that the positive impact of intangible assets on firm value can be enhanced by
foreign operations to the extent the intangible assets may be used across multiple countries. 509
Therefore, some investors may want incremental information on foreign operations. Deletion of
Item 101(d)(3) may adversely affect this group of investors. However, if the requirements in
Item 101(d)(3), such as the requirement to disclose “any” risk associated with foreign operations,
tend to yield immaterial disclosures, deletion of Item 101(d)(3) would benefit investors by
eliminating immaterial information, reducing search costs, and facilitating more efficient
information processing. 510

507

See T. Agmon and D. R. Lessard, Investor Recognition of Corporate International Diversification, Journal of
Finance 32(4), 1977 at 1049–1055 (arguing that multinational firms have an advantage relative to singlecountry firms because of their ability to overcome the barriers to portfolio capital flows). The empirical results
of the study support the notion that U.S. investors recognize the international composition of the activities of
U.S.-based corporations.

508

See V. Errunza and L. Senbet, International Corporate Diversification, Market Valuation and Size-Adjusted
Evidence, Journal of Finance 34, 1984 at 727−745 (developing a model where international corporate
intermediation through direct foreign investment can undo barriers to international capital flows faced by
individual investors and lead to a positive valuation effect associated with the degree of international
involvement). The authors tested the model using generalized least squares and maximum likelihood
procedures, controlling for the size and price to earnings effects, and obtain results consistent with the
theoretical valuation effect.

509

See R. Morck and B. Yeung, Why Investors Value Multinationality, Journal of Business, 64 (2), 1991 at
165−187 (examining the value of multinationality as reflected in Tobin's Q). The authors find that the positive
impact of research and development and advertising spending on Q is enhanced by multinationality, but
multinationality itself has no significant impact on Q, supporting the notion that multinational corporations have
intangible assets that can be used internationally.

510

See D. Hirshleifer and S. Teoh, Limited Attention, Information Disclosure, and Financial Reporting, Journal of
Accounting and Economics 36, 2003 at 337−386 (developing a theoretical model where investors have limited
attention and processing power). The authors show that with partially attentive investors, means of presenting
information may have an impact on stock price reactions, misvaluation, long-run abnormal returns, and
corporate decisions.

152

Another example of an item we propose to delete because it results in reasonably similar
disclosures as other requirements is Item 101(c)(1)(xi) of Regulation S-K. Item 101(c)(1)(xi)
requires disclosure of the amount spent on research and development activities for all periods
presented. 511 Although Commission disclosure requirements use different terminology than U.S.
GAAP, 512 the meaning under U.S. GAAP is either no different or broader in scope than that in
Regulation S-K. The most notable difference in terminology is Regulation S-K’s reference to
“customer-sponsored” research and development activities, as compared to U.S. GAAP’s
reference to “research and development performed on behalf of others.” Since the U.S. GAAP
terminology is broader in scope, deletion of Item 101(c)(1)(xi) of Regulation S-K and Item
101(h)(4)(x) of Regulation S-K should not change the information available to investors and
other users.
Finally, an example of a change that might affect the extent of information disclosed as a
result of the disclosure no longer being subject to the PSLRA safe harbor involves Item 303(b) of
Regulation S-K. Item 303(b) requires seasonality disclosures outside of the financial statements
in interim periods. U.S. GAAP 513 similarly requires seasonality disclosures, but this disclosure
is required in the notes to the interim financial statements. Eliminating the seasonality disclosure
requirements in Item 303(b) would result in the removal of this information from MD&A, with
the effect that investors and other users would likely have this disclosure available only in the

511

Item 101(c)(1)(xi) of Regulation S-K for non-smaller reporting companies and Item 101(h)(4)(x) of Regulation
S-K for smaller reporting companies.

512

See ASC 730-10-50-1 and ASC 730-20-50-1.

513

ASC 270-10-45-11 states: Revenues of certain entities are subject to material seasonal variations. To avoid the
possibility that interim results with material seasonal variations may be taken as fairly indicative of the
estimated results for a full fiscal year, such entities shall disclose the seasonal nature of their activities, and
consider supplementing their interim reports with information for 12-month periods ended at the interim date
for the current and preceding years.

153

notes to the financial statements, unless issuers voluntarily provide it in both locations. In
addition, as discussed above, investors may not receive certain forward-looking information that
may be supplementally provided on a voluntary basis in connection with seasonality disclosure
in MD&A, as issuers do not receive safe harbor protection under the PSLRA for information
disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
b. Integration of Commission Disclosure Requirements
When we believe that Commission disclosure requirements overlap with, but require
information incremental to, other Commission disclosure requirements, the proposed
amendments integrate the Commission disclosure requirements. In addition to the economic
effects of changing disclosure location and bright line disclosure thresholds, as discussed above,
integration of overlapping Commission disclosure requirements would simplify issuer
compliance efforts by reducing the number of rules to consider and the extent of disclosures that
need to be provided. Integration of these requirements should also facilitate more efficient
information processing by investors.
One example to illustrate the potential effects of the proposed integration of Commission
disclosure requirements is Item 101(d)(4) of Regulation S-K. Item 101(d)(4) requires, when
interim financial statements are presented, a discussion of the facts that indicate that the threeyear financial data for geographic performance may not be indicative of current or future
operations. This requirement is similar to requirements in Instruction 3 to Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K and Instruction 4 to Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K to identify elements of
income which are not necessarily indicative of the issuer’s ongoing business, except that there is
no explicit reference to “geographic areas” in either item requirement. To integrate the
requirements into one location of Regulation S-K, we propose to amend Item 303 explicitly to

154

refer to “geographic areas.” As noted above, integration of these requirements should facilitate
more efficient information processing by investors. We note, however, that to the extent that
some investors focus more on the business description section or find it is easier to interpret
geographic performance information when presented with other business description disclosures,
these investors might be negatively affected if this information is relocated to MD&A.
c. Potential Modification, Elimination or FASB Referral of Commission
Disclosure Requirements
When we believe that the Commission disclosure requirements overlap with, but require
information incremental to, U.S. GAAP requirements, we solicit comment on certain
Commission disclosure requirements to determine whether to retain, modify, eliminate, or refer
them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. The comments received in
response to this proposal may inform both potential future Commission rulemaking and FASB
standard-setting activities. If the disclosure requirements are ultimately added to U.S. GAAP
and removed from Commission rules, some information would be relocated from outside the
financial statements to within the financial statements, giving rise to Disclosure Location
Considerations, potentially impacting issuers, investors, and other users.
In addition to the economic effects of changing disclosure location and bright line
disclosure thresholds, as discussed above, a movement of disclosure requirements from
Commission rules to U.S. GAAP may potentially increase costs to investors if U.S. GAAP were
to change in a way that this information is no longer provided, as discussed above. 514 As noted
above, the potential for such changes may be mitigated by the FASB’s transparent, public

514

See discussion of current FASB projects with the potential to broadly affect the proposals in section I.C.3.

155

standard-setting process and the Commission’s oversight of the FASB. 515 The specific economic
effects of any potential amendments to our disclosure requirements if these incremental
disclosures are subsequently incorporated into U.S. GAAP would be considered in connection
with any future rulemaking in this area.
As an alternative to referring these requirements to the FASB for potential incorporation
into U.S. GAAP, we could simply eliminate the overlapping requirements and forego disclosure
of the incremental information. Although such an alternative would simplify issuer compliance
efforts, it also may result in less informed investment decisions and diminished investor
protections. To help inform commenters’ assessment of possible future changes to Commission
disclosure requirements, we provide below salient examples examined in academic studies of
potential economic uses of the incremental information from some of the overlapping provisions.
Waived Defaults: If a default of an obligation exists, but acceleration of the obligation
has been waived for a period of time, Rule 4-08(c) of Regulation S-X requires disclosure of the
amount of the obligation and the period of the waiver. 516 This disclosure requirement is
incremental to U.S. GAAP, which sets forth requirements for when to present debt subject to a
covenant violation as a current liability on the balance sheet, but does not require disclosure of
the amount of the obligation and the period of the waiver for all waived defaults. Waivers often
come with additional fees and concessions, 517 which likely vary with the amount of the
obligation and the period of the waiver. These additional concessions typically include

515

See discussion in section I.C.

516

17 CFR 210.4-08(c).

517

See, e.g., M. Beneish and E. Press, Cost of Technical Violation of Accounting-Based Debt Covenants, The
Accounting Review 68, 1993 at 233−257.

156

restrictions on investing and financing. 518 Therefore, information on the amount of the obligation
and the period of waiver might be beneficial to investors and other users.
Major Customers: Regulation S-K and U.S. GAAP both require disclosures about major
customers. However, the requirements in Regulation S-K and U.S. GAAP differ in the following
respects. First, Item 101(c)(1)(vii) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure if loss of a customer, or
a few customers, would have a material adverse effect on a segment, whereas U.S. GAAP
requires disclosure, for each customer that comprises 10 percent or more of total revenue, of that
fact. Second, Item 101(c)(1)(vii) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of the name of any
customer that represents 10 percent or more of the issuer’s revenue and whose loss would have a
material adverse effect on the issuer. Since the requirements in Regulation S-K differ from the
current requirement in U.S. GAAP, the incorporation of these requirements into U.S. GAAP
would potentially change the disclosure threshold and add a requirement to name certain
customers.
Academic research shows that customer-supplier linkages affect stock performance – for
instance, financial distress affecting the customer often spreads to suppliers. 519 Academic
research also shows that the customer-supplier relationship has significant effects on firm capital
structure and investment activities, which may affect an investor’s valuation of the firm. For
instance, a firm is more likely to make relationship-specific investments when its supply-chain
partner has lower leverage. 520 Further, information on supply chain partners may inform

filings of customers are associated with negative price effects to suppliers.

Suppliers and Customers, Journal of Financial Economics 83, 2007 at 321–365. A firm may need to encourage

157

portfolio decisions. 521 Therefore, incremental audited information on customers might be
beneficial to investors and other users.
Amounts and Terms of Financing Arrangements: Regulation S-X 522 and U.S.
GAAP 523 both require certain disclosures of an issuer’s financing arrangements. However, Rule
5-02.19(b) incrementally requires disclosure of the amount and terms (including commitment
fees and the conditions under which lines may be withdrawn) of unused lines of credit for shortterm financing, the weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings outstanding as of
each balance sheet date, and the amount of any lines of credit which support a commercial paper
borrowing or similar arrangement. Rule 5-02.22(b) requires similar disclosure of the amount and
terms (including commitment fees and the conditions under which commitments may be
withdrawn) of unused commitments for long-term financial arrangements.
Research shows that credit lines and short-term financing offer sources of liquidity to
companies, affect investment decisions, and affect capital structure. With respect to saving
cash, firms that may face capital market frictions save more cash out of cash flow, 524 while those
with access to credit lines do not. 525 Among firms with access to credit lines, those with higher
cash flows and cash holdings have smaller drawdowns from their credit lines, suggesting a
its supply chain partners to make relationship-specific investments. These relationship-specific investments
may lose value if the firm goes into liquidation or bankruptcy. To reduce the chance of liquidation, the authors
argue that the firm could reduce the debt in its capital structure, thereby reducing the risk that is associated with
the relationship-specific investment. The authors find support for their argument.
521

For example, recent academic research has suggested that public information about concentrated sales
relationships may be profitably incorporated into equity trading strategies. See, D. Alldredge and D. Cicero D,

substitution effect between internal and external liquidity. 526 Also among firms with credit
lines, an increase in cash leads to an increase in investment activity, while for those without
credit lines, increases in cash are associated with a decrease in investment (increase in
savings). 527 Availability of unused loan commitment financing affects capital structure decisions
in that it is positively related to firm leverage and negatively related to the cost of funds. 528
Therefore, detailed information about a firm’s credit lines and short-term financing might be
beneficial to investors and other users.
3. Outdated Requirements
Outdated requirements are Commission disclosure requirements that we believe have
become obsolete as a result of the passage of time or changes in the regulatory, business, or
technological environment. The proposed amendments would eliminate certain outdated
Commission disclosure requirements. Elimination of outdated disclosure requirements would
simplify issuer compliance efforts by reducing the number of rules to consider and the extent of
disclosures that need to be provided. In some cases, the proposed amendments also would
require additional disclosure of information to reduce any loss of information or decrease the
burden for investors and other users to retrieve such information from other sources. Such
information is expected to be readily available at minimal to no cost to issuers.
The effect of these proposed amendments on investors and other users will depend on
the information. If investors do not use the deleted information to make informed decisions,

financial officers in early 2009 on how they manage liquidity and investment.

these amendments may have limited effect on investors, or the amendments may have a positive
effect on investors since elimination of such disclosures may reduce search costs and facilitate
more efficient information processing. This, in turn, could enhance the allocative efficiency of
the market and facilitate capital formation. If the information is used by investors but can be
retrieved from alternative sources with little or no cost to investors (e.g., share prices), the effects
of these revisions on investors should be minimal. In other cases where the information is less
readily available from alternative sources (e.g., average exchange rates for each of the five most
recent financial years and any subsequent interim period), these amendments may lead to a loss
of information for investors and other users with a potentially adverse effect on the cost of
capital of issuers. We do not expect these potential adverse effects to be significant as we
attempt to propose deletion of only those requirements that call for information that is either no
longer relevant or is readily available or can be derived from alternative sources, and may, in
fact, be more robust than the information currently required to be disclosed. As noted above,
some proposed amendments require additional disclosure of information (e.g., the issuer’s
Internet address, if available) to mitigate the loss of information or decrease the burden for
investors and other users.
One example of outdated disclosure is the disclosure of historical market price
information. We propose substituting this disclosure with disclosure of the issuer’s ticker
symbol, which can be used to obtain information on stock price, among other information. This
additional disclosure may help reduce any loss of information as well as facilitate access to
additional information while imposing minimal or no cost on issuers and saving them the
expense of disclosing information that is readily available in more up to date form from
alternative sources.

160

4. Superseded Requirements
Superseded requirements are Commission disclosure requirements that we believe are
inconsistent with recent legislation, more recently updated Commission disclosure requirements,
or more recently updated U.S. GAAP requirements. The proposed amendments would conform
existing Commission disclosure requirements to the more recent requirements.
Elimination or amendment of Commission disclosure requirements that are inconsistent
with recent legislation, more recently updated Commission disclosure requirements, or more
recently updated U.S. GAAP may simplify issuer compliance efforts by resolving some
confusion for issuers. Where there are superseded requirements, issuers may need to expend
time and resources seeking advice from outside professionals or guidance from Commission staff
as to compliance with such requirements. To the extent that, in practice, many issuers already
comply with the more recently adopted requirements, we do not expect these costs to be
significant. In addition, investors and other users may benefit from the reduction in the variation
of disclosure practices that could result from confusion about the superseded requirements
among issuers.
One example of superseded disclosure is the requirement to report the cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle in the income statement, which the FASB eliminated from
U.S. GAAP in 2005. Instead, U.S. GAAP now requires the cumulative effect of retrospectivelyapplied changes in accounting principle to be reflected in the opening balance of retained
earnings for the earliest period presented. The Commission disclosure requirements, by contrast,
continue to refer to a line on the income statement for a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle. Eliminating references to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle in the income statement in the Commission disclosure requirements would resolve this

161

contradiction and remove any resulting issuer confusion.
As another example, Rule 10-01(b)(2) of Regulation S-X requires, for interim periods,
the presentation of dividends per share applicable to common stock on the face of the income
statement. These rules are inconsistent with U.S. GAAP, which prohibits presentation of
dividends per share on the face of the income statement. We propose to delete Rule 10-01(b)(2)
to conform to U.S. GAAP. We also propose to create a new requirement to disclose the amount
of dividends per share for each class of shares, rather than only for common stock, as part of
changes in stockholders’ equity for interim periods. 529 Investors and other users may benefit
from the additional information on dividends per share for each class of shares for interim
periods. Shareholders may use dividends to value an issuer. 530 Information about dividends is
also important for debtholders. 531 There may also be different dividend preferences based on an
investor’s characteristics. 532 Therefore, dividend disclosure is likely to be important to investors.
The proposed amendments, however, may give rise to Disclosure Location Considerations, in
that issuers would now disclose dividends in a separate financial statement or in the notes,
instead of the face of the income statement. The proposed amendments may create additional
costs for issuers to prepare the additional information (i.e., dividends per share for other classes

of stock). However, such costs would be limited to the extent that the required information is
already available from the preparation of other aspects of the interim financial statements.
Disclosure of additional information may also lead to additional costs for issuers, including
Regulation A issuers, to comply with internal control over financial reporting, audit, and XBRL
tagging requirements, as applicable.
C. Anticipated Effects on Efficiency, Competition and Capital Formation
As discussed above, the proposals may improve capital allocation efficiency by enabling
investors and other users to make more efficient investment decisions. For example, the
proposals may reduce search costs for investors by eliminating information that is redundant,
duplicative, overlapping, outdated or superseded and therefore no longer useful to investors.
Given that investors may have limited attention and limited information processing
capabilities, 533 elimination of such information may facilitate more efficient investment decisionmaking. In addition, elimination of these disclosure requirements may reduce issuer compliance
costs and encourage capital formation. The reduction in compliance costs might be particularly
beneficial for smaller and younger issuers that are resource constrained. A better disclosure
environment may make the U.S. capital markets more competitive relative to markets in other
countries. However, we do not expect such effect to be substantial.
However, eliminating information could result in increased information asymmetries
between issuers and investors. Such asymmetries may increase the cost of capital, reduce capital
formation, and hamper efficient allocation of capital across companies. If a useful disclosure is
no longer required, low-quality firms will be less likely to disclose information that signals their
lower quality; this will make it more difficult for higher quality firms to distinguish their quality
533

See supra note 510.

163

even with voluntary disclosures. Such negative effects might be more pronounced among
smaller and younger issuers that suffer more from information asymmetries. Overall, though, to
the extent that we are proposing to eliminate disclosure that is redundant, duplicative,
overlapping, outdated, or superseded, we do not think these effects are likely.
D. Request for Comments
In addition to our request for comments in sections II through VI of this release, we
request comment on various aspects of the costs and benefits of our proposals. We also request
comment on any effect the proposals may have on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.
In particular, we appreciate any data or analysis that may help quantify the potential costs and
benefits identified.
VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act
A. Background
Certain provisions of the proposed amendments contain a “collection of information”
within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 534 The Commission is
submitting the proposed amendments to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for
review in accordance with the PRA. 535 The hours and costs associated with preparing, filing,
and sending the schedules and forms constitute reporting and cost burdens imposed by each
collection of information. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required
to comply with, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control
number. The titles for the collections of information are:

We adopted all of the existing regulations, schedules, and forms pursuant to the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or the Investment Company Act. The regulations, schedules,
and forms set forth the disclosure requirements for registration statements, periodic reports, and
proxy and information statements filed by issuers to help investors make informed investment
and voting decisions. Certain other forms and reports are filed by broker-dealers, entities
regulated by the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisors Act, and NRSROs in
connection with the Commission’s oversight of such entities.
We are proposing amendments as part of an initiative by the Division of Corporation
Finance to review disclosure requirements applicable to issuers to consider ways to improve the
requirements for the benefit of investors and issuers. We are also proposing these amendments
as part of our efforts to implement title LXXII, section 72002(2) of the FAST Act.
Compliance with the proposed amendments would be mandatory. Responses to the
collection would not be kept confidential, and there would be no mandatory retention period for
the information disclosed.
B. Summary of the Proposed Amendments’ Impacts on Collection of Information
We propose amendments to certain of our disclosure requirements that may have become
redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded, in light of other Commission
disclosure requirements, U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or changes in the information environment.
By eliminating the redundancy, duplication, and overlap in current Commission
disclosure requirements, respondents would need to consider fewer rules and requirements in

167

their compliance efforts even as they are preparing a substantially similar level of disclosures.
As such, except for the proposed amendment to eliminate the requirement to disclose the ratio of
earnings to fixed charges, which may decrease the paperwork burden, we believe that the
proposed elimination of these redundant, duplicative, and overlapping Commission requirements
would marginally reduce, if at all, respondents’ overall paperwork burden.
Similarly, we expect that the proposed amendments to eliminate outdated requirements
would marginally reduce the information collection burden on respondents by eliminating any
efforts that were undertaken to prepare these disclosures. With the exception of the proposed
amendments to require the disclosure of an issuer’s website address and the ticker symbol of
their common equity that is publicly traded, the proposed amendments related to outdated
requirements would have no change or a minimal reduction in the paperwork burden associated
with preparing such information when respondents are providing information in response to
Forms 10, 10-K, 20-F, S-1, and F-1.
Finally, we believe that our proposed amendments to update superseded Commission
disclosure requirements would marginally reduce, if at all, respondents’ collection of information
burden, except for the extension of the application of Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X to interim
period disclosures, 537 which we estimate may marginally increase the paperwork burden. While
we intend to eliminate any existing confusion related to contradictory and inconsistent
requirements, in many instances, we believe respondents are not providing information in
response to the requirements that we are proposing to delete. Instead, we believe they provide
information in response to U.S. GAAP or other Commission disclosure requirements that have

537

The extension of Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X addresses both overlapping and superseded disclosure issues and
is presented in both sections III.C.16 and V.B.5.

168

been updated more recently, rather than the superseded requirement subject to the proposed
amendments. As a result, we do not believe these proposed amendments would result in a
change to respondents’ overall paperwork burden.
C. Estimate of Burdens
1. Forms 10, 10-K, 10-Q, 20-F, and 1-SA
We believe the proposed amendments to eliminate the requirement to disclose the market
prices for an issuer’s common equity for the two most recent fiscal years would nominally
reduce affected issuers current paperwork burdens. We estimate that issuers currently expend an
average of 2 hours internally preparing the market price disclosure for inclusion in their Forms
10-K and 20-F. As such, we estimate that affected issuers would experience a 2 hour reduction
in their annual paperwork burden. 538
We believe the proposed amendments to require that issuers disclose their ticker symbol
and internet address would result in a minimal increase in their paperwork burden. We estimate
that these proposed requirements would increase the paperwork burden by 0.1 hours per year for
the disclosure of the issuer’s internet address and 0.05 hours per year for the disclosure of the
issuer’s ticker symbol. 539 We also estimate that there are 8,862 annual responses made in
connection with Forms 10-K and 20-F. The table below illustrates the overall impact on
respondents filing Forms 10-K and 20-F as a result of these proposed amendments.

538

Although the proposed additional requirement to disclose an issuer’s ticker symbol would create a minimal
paperwork burden increase, such increase would be far outweighed by the reduction in burden associated with
the elimination of two years’ worth of market price disclosure.

539

The burden estimate for the issuer’s Internet address and ticker symbol as it applies to Form 10 filers is not an
annual burden because these registration statements are only filed upon the initial registration of a class of
securities under the Exchange Act.

The proposed amendments to eliminate the requirement to disclose the market prices for
an issuer’s common equity for the two most recent fiscal years would not reduce the paperwork
burden for the overwhelming majority of Form 10 filers. 540 Form 10 filers would be subject to
the proposed requirements, if adopted, to disclose their ticker symbols or anticipated ticker
symbols, if known, and internet address. We estimate that there are 238 annual responses made
in connection with Form 10. The table below illustrates the overall impact on respondents filing
Form 10 as a result of these proposed amendments.

The proposed amendments discussed in sections III.C.16 and V.B.5, if adopted, would
extend to interim periods the requirements under Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X to disclose
changes in stockholders’ equity and dividends per share for each class of shares, rather than only
for common stock. Currently, these disclosures are not required for interim periods. While this
creates a new disclosure requirement for issuers, the information being required is generally
readily available from the issuer’s preparation of other aspects of its interim financial statements.
As a result, we estimate that this proposed amendment would increase the paperwork burdens by

540

Most filers of Form 10 do not have a class of common equity publicly traded at the time the registration
statement is filed. Issuers that already have a class of common equity publicly traded are typically able to file a
Form 8-A to register new classes of securities under the Exchange Act.

23,333 annual responses in connection with Forms 10, 10-Q, and 1-SA. The table below
illustrates the overall impact on respondents filing Forms 10, 10-Q, and 1-SA, as a result of the

2. Forms S-1, S-3, S-4, S-11, SF-1, SF-3, F-1, F-3, F-4, and 1-A
The proposed amendments to eliminate the market prices disclosure and require the
disclosure of the ticker symbol for an issuer’s common equity and the issuer’s internet address
have the same paperwork burden effect for Forms S-1, S-4, S-11, F-1, and F-4. 543 As such, we
estimate that there would be a corresponding reduction in the burden estimate for these forms.
We estimate that there are approximately 1,751 annual responses made in connection with the
referenced forms. The table below illustrates the overall impact on respondents filing the
referenced forms as a result of these proposed amendments.

541

As Form 10-Q is filed for the first three quarters of an issuer’s fiscal year, the annual burden increase is
estimated to be 1.5 hours annually. As such, there is no increase to the paperwork burdens associated with
preparing annual reports filed on Forms 10-K or 20-F. However, for registration statements filed on Form 10
and 20-F, to the extent that interim period disclosures are made, the issuer would experience an increase in
paperwork burden.

542

While this proposal would not impact foreign private issuers that file a Form 20-F as an annual report, it may
impact those that file the form to register a class of securities when they would be required to provide interim
period disclosures. However, the staff has observed that this does not occur frequently. As such, we have not
included Form 20-F in this estimate.

543

The information subject to the proposals discussed in this paragraph are incorporated by reference into Forms S3 and F-3 and not provided in direct response to a form item requirement. As such, the proposals do not affect
the paperwork burdens associated with Forms S-3 and F-3.

Additionally, we estimate that the paperwork burdens associated with Forms SF-1 and
SF-3 would be minimally increased by the proposed amendment to disclose the issuer’s internet
address. We estimate that there are approximately 77 annual responses made in connection with
the referenced forms. The table below illustrates the overall impact on respondents filing the
referenced forms as a result of these proposed amendments.

The proposed amendments discussed in sections III.C.16 and V.B.5 to extend Rule 3-04
of Regulation S-X to interim periods would also impact the paperwork burdens of registration
statements filed on Forms 1-A, S-1, S-4, S-11, F-1, and F-4 because such forms require interim
period financial disclosures, when applicable. 544 We believe that the estimated burden increase
of 0.5 hours discussed above similarly applies to the referenced registration statements. We
estimate that there are approximately 2,001 annual responses made in connection with the
referenced forms. The table below illustrates the overall impact on respondents filing the
referenced forms as a result of these proposed amendments.

544

Filers of the referenced forms may have to provide interim period financial disclosures in order to comply with
Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.3-12]. While the timing of the effectiveness of the registration
statement or qualification of the offering statement may not trigger the requirement for interim period financial
disclosure, we have used the full population of responses for our estimate to be conservative.

The proposed amendment to eliminate the requirements to disclose the ratio of earnings
to fixed charges, when an issuer registers debt securities, and the ratio of combined fixed charges
and preference dividends to earnings, when an issuer registers preference securities, would
reduce the current paperwork burden for issuers registering such securities on Forms S-1, S-3, S4, S-11, F-1, F-3 and F-4. Depending on the size and complexity of the issuer, the paperwork
burden associated with preparing this information for inclusion in the aforementioned
registration statements varies greatly. We estimate that issuers expend an average of 4 hours
preparing this disclosure for inclusion in their registration statements. For the purposes of this
analysis, we assume that the ratio is prepared internally, and we have estimated that there are
approximately 2,195 annual responses made in connection with the referenced forms. Based on
this average, the table below illustrates the overall impact on respondents filing the referenced
forms as a result of the proposed amendments.

D. Request for Comment
Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(B), we request comment in order to:
•

Evaluate whether the proposed collections of information are necessary for the proper
performance of the functions of the Commission, including whether the information will
have practical utility;

•

Evaluate the accuracy of our assumptions and estimates of the burden of the proposed
collection of information;

•

Determine whether there are ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the
information to be collected;

•

Evaluate whether there are ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information
on those who respond, including through the use of automated collection techniques or
other forms of information technology; and

•

Evaluate whether the proposed amendments would have any effects on any other
collection of information not previously identified in this section.
Any member of the public may direct to us any comments concerning the accuracy of

these burden estimates and any suggestions for reducing these burdens. Persons submitting
comments on the collection of information requirements should direct their comments to the
Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, and send a
copy to, Brent J. Fields, Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE,
174

Washington, DC 20549-1090, with reference to File No. S7-15-16. Requests for materials
submitted to OMB by the Commission with regard to the collection of information should be in
writing, refer to File No. S7-15-16 and be submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington DC 20549-2736. OMB is
required to make a decision concerning the collection of information between 30 and 60 days
after publication of this proposed rule. Consequently, a comment to OMB is best assured of
having its full effect if the OMB receives it within 30 days of publication.
IX.

Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) 546 requires the Commission, in promulgating

rules under section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act, to consider the impact of those
rules on small entities. The Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
(“IRFA”) in accordance with section 603 of the RFA. 547 This IRFA relates to amendments
proposed as part of the Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative, which aims to review the
Commission’s disclosure requirements applicable to issuers to consider ways to improve the
requirements for the benefit of investors and issuers, and part of our efforts to implement title
LXXII, section 72002(2) of the FAST Act.

546

5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

547

5 U.S.C. 603

175

A. Reasons for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Action
The primary reason for, and objectives of, the proposed amendments is to update and
simplify the Commission’s current disclosure requirements. Specifically, the proposed
amendments would:
•

Eliminate certain Commission disclosure requirements that are redundant or duplicative
of requirements in U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or other Commission disclosure requirements;

•

Streamline certain overlapping Commission disclosure requirements by deleting or
integrating provisions that address disclosure topics covered elsewhere in our rules or
regulations.

•

Revise certain Commission disclosure requirements that are outdated.

•

Revise certain superseded Commission disclosure requirements to update and conform
our rules with recent legislation, more recently updated Commission disclosure
requirements, or more recently updated U.S. GAAP requirements.
Additionally, as discussed in section III.E above, we are soliciting comment on certain

overlapping Commission disclosure requirements to determine whether to retain, modify,
eliminate, or refer them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.
The proposed amendments are also part of our efforts to implement title LXXII, section
72002(2) of the FAST Act.
B. Legal Basis
We are proposing the rule and form amendments pursuant to sections 7, 10, 19(a), and 28
of the Securities Act, sections 3(b), 12, 13, 15, 23(a), and 36 of the Exchange Act, sections 8,
24(a), 24(g), 30, and 38 of the Investment Company Act, and title LXXII, section 72002(2) of
the FAST Act.

176

C. Small Entities Subject to the Proposed Amendments
The proposed amendments would affect small entities that file registration statements
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the Investment Company Act and periodic
reports, proxy and information statements, or other reports under the Exchange Act and the
Investment Company Act. The RFA defines “small entity” to mean “small business,” “small
organization,” or “small governmental jurisdiction.” 548
For the purposes of the RFA, under our rules, an issuer of securities, other than an
investment company, is a “small business” or “small organization” if it had total assets of $5
million or less on the last day of its most recent fiscal year and is engaged or proposing to engage
in an offering of securities that does not exceed $5 million. 549 We estimate that there are
approximately 428 of such issuers that may be considered small entities. The proposed
amendments would affect small entities conducting registered public or Regulation A offerings
or that have a class of securities that are registered under section 12 of the Exchange Act.
An investment company, including a business development company, is considered to be
a “small business,” for the purposes of the RFA, if it, together with other investment companies
in the same group of related investment companies, has net assets of $50 million or less as of the
end of its most recent fiscal year. 550 We believe the proposed amendments would affect some
small entities that are investment companies. We estimate that there are approximately 29
investment companies that would be subject to the proposed amendments that may be considered
small entities.

548

5 U.S.C. 601(6).

549

See Securities Act Rule 157 [17 CFR 230.157] and Exchange Act Rule 0-10(a) [17 CFR 240.0-10(a)].

550

17 CFR 270.0-10(a).

177

For the purposes of the RFA, an investment adviser generally is a small entity if it: (1)
has assets under management having a total value of less than $25 million; (2) did not have total
assets of $5 million or more on the last day of the most recent fiscal year; and (3) does not
control, is not controlled by, and is not under common control with another investment adviser
that has assets under management of $25 million or more, or any person (other than a natural
person) that had total assets of $5 million or more on the last day of its most recent fiscal year. 551
We estimate that there are approximately 515 investment advisors that would be subject to the
proposed amendments that may be considered small entities.
For the purposes of the RFA, a broker-dealer is considered to be a “small business” if its
total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) is less than $500,000 on the date in the prior
fiscal year as of which its audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5(d)
under the Exchange Act, 552 or, if not required to file such statements, a broker-dealer with total
capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last day of the
preceding fiscal year (or in the time that it has been in business, if shorter); and that is not
affiliated with any person (other than a natural person) that is not a small business or small
organization. 553 The Commission estimates that there are approximately 1,349 broker-dealers
that were “small” for the purposes Rule 0-10. 554
The Commission has also stated, and continues to believe, that an NRSRO with total
assets of $5 million or less would qualify as a “small” entity for purposes of the RFA. 555

551

See 17 CFR 275.0-7.

552

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d).

553

See 17 CFR 240.0-10(c).

554

This estimate is based on the number of small broker-dealers as of December 31, 2014.

555

See, e.g., Final Rules: Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, Exchange Act Release No.
72936 (Aug. 27, 2014) [79 FR 55077].

178

Currently, there are 10 NRSROs and, based on their most recently filed annual reports pursuant
to Rule 17g-3, two NRSROs are small entities under the above definition.
D. Duplicative, Overlapping, or Conflicting Federal Rules
We believe that the proposed amendments would not duplicate, overlap, or conflict with
other federal rules.
E. Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements
As noted above, the purpose of the proposed amendments is to update and simplify the
Commission’s disclosure requirements. As such, the proposed amendments do not impose any
significant new disclosure obligations. If adopted, the majority of the proposed amendments
would eliminate or integrate current Commission disclosure requirements and thus are expected
to have a minimal effect on existing reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance burdens for
all issuers, including small entities. To the extent the proposed amendments do have an impact,
it would likely be a reduction in these burdens.
F. Significant Alternatives
The Regulatory Flexibility Act directs us to consider alternatives that would accomplish
the stated objectives of our proposed amendments, while minimizing any significant adverse
impact on small entities. Specifically, we considered the following alternatives: (1) establishing
different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources
available to small entities; (2) clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying compliance and reporting
requirements for small entities; (3) using performance rather than design standards; and (4)
exempting small entities from coverage of all or part of the proposed amendments.
With respect to clarification, consolidation, and simplification of compliance and
reporting requirements for small entities, the proposed amendments do not impose any

179

significant new disclosure obligations. As noted above, we are proposing amendments to certain
of our disclosure requirements that may have become redundant, duplicative, overlapping,
outdated, or superseded, in light of other Commission disclosure requirements, U.S. GAAP,
IFRS, or changes in the information environment. The proposed amendments would simplify
compliance for all issuers, including small entities.
For similar reasons, we do not believe it is necessary, and indeed would be contrary to the
stated objectives of the proposed rulemaking, to establish different compliance or reporting
requirements or timetables or to exempt small entities from all or part of the proposed
amendments. We note in this regard that the Commission’s existing disclosure requirements
provide for scaled disclosure requirements and other accommodations for SRCs and EGCs, and
the proposed amendments would not alter these existing accommodations.
Finally, with respect to use of performance rather than design standards, the proposed
amendments to eliminate certain prescriptive Commission rules that call for information that
duplicates or overlaps with information required by U.S. GAAP may result in issuers, including
small entities, being provided with additional flexibility when preparing their disclosures. For
instance, Rule 4-08(m) of Regulation S-X requires certain disclosures regarding repurchase
agreements based on a 10 percent threshold and specified maturity levels. As we propose to
delete the referenced requirements, as discussed in section III.C, under the proposed amendments
issuers would be subject only to the corresponding the requirements in U.S. GAAP, which
require similar disclosure but do not use similar bright line thresholds. While the proposed
amendments do not use performance standards, they would have a similar effect—namely, to
provide issuers, including small entities, with additional flexibility to present more tailored
disclosures without meaningfully reducing the total mix of information provided to investors.

180

G. Solicitation of Comments
We encourage the submission of comments with respect to any aspect of this Initial
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. In particular, we request comments regarding:
•

How the proposed amendments can achieve their objective while lowering the burden on
small entities;

•

The number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed amendments;

•

The existence or nature of the potential impact of the proposed amendments on small
entities discussed in the analysis; and

•

How to quantify the impact of the proposed amendments.
Respondents are asked to describe the nature of any impact of the proposed amendments

on small entities and provide empirical data supporting the extent of the impact. Such comments
will be considered in the preparation of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, if the proposed
amendments are adopted, and will be placed in the same public file as comments on the proposed
amendments themselves.
X.

Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, or

“SBREFA,” 556 we solicit data to determine whether the rule proposed amendments constitute a
“major” rule. Under SBREFA, a rule is considered “major” where, if adopted, it results or is
likely to result in:
•

An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more (either in the form of an
increase or a decrease);

556

123 Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).

181

•

A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or

•

Significant adverse effects on competition, investment or innovation.
Commenters should provide empirical data on: (1) the potential annual effect on the

economy; (2) any increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; and (3) any
potential effect on competition, investment, or innovation.

Amend § 210.1-02 by:
a.

Revising paragraphs (d), (w)(3) and (bb)(1)(ii); and

b.

Adding paragraphs (cc) and (dd).
The revisions and additions read as follows:

§ 210.1-02 Definitions of terms used in Regulation S-X (17 CFR part 210).
*

*

*

*

*

(d) Audit (or examination). The term audit (or examination), when used in regard to
financial statements of issuers as defined by section 2(a)(7) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
means an examination of the financial statements by an independent accountant in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
183

(“PCAOB”) for the purpose of expressing an opinion thereon. When used in regard to financial
statements of entities that are not issuers as defined by section 2(a)(7) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, the term means an examination of the financial statements by an independent
accountant in accordance with either the standards of the PCAOB or U.S. generally accepted
auditing standards (“U.S. GAAS”) as specified or permitted in the regulations and forms
applicable to those entities for the purpose of expressing an opinion thereon. The standards of
the PCAOB and U.S. GAAS may be modified or supplemented by the Commission.

(3) The registrant's and its other subsidiaries' equity in the income from continuing
operations before income taxes exclusive of amounts attributable to any noncontrolling interests
exceeds 10 percent of such income of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most
recently completed fiscal year.
*
(bb) *
(1) *

*
*

*

*

*

*

*
*

(ii) Net sales or gross revenues, gross profit (or, alternatively, costs and expenses
applicable to net sales or gross revenues), income or loss from continuing operations, net income
or loss, and net income or loss attributable to the entity (for specialized industries, other
information may be substituted for sales and related costs and expenses if necessary for a more
meaningful presentation); and
*

*

*

184

*

*

(cc) Statement(s) of comprehensive income. The term statement(s) of comprehensive
income means a financial statement that includes all changes in equity during a period except
those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Comprehensive income
comprises all components of net income and all components of other comprehensive income.
The statement of comprehensive income may be presented either in a single continuous financial
statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. A statement(s) of operations or
variations thereof may be used in place of a statement(s) of comprehensive income if there was
no other comprehensive income during the period(s).
(dd) Restricted net assets. The term restricted net assets shall mean that amount of the
registrant's proportionate share of net assets of consolidated subsidiaries (after intercompany
eliminations) which as of the end of the most recent fiscal year may not be transferred to the
parent company by subsidiaries in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends without the
consent of a third party (i.e., lender, regulatory agency, foreign government, etc.). Not all
limitations on transferability of assets are considered to be restrictions for purposes of this
paragraph, which considers only specific third party restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to
transfer funds outside of the entity. For example, the presence of subsidiary debt which is
secured by certain of the subsidiary's assets does not constitute a restriction under this paragraph.
However, if there are any loan provisions prohibiting dividend payments, loans or advances to
the parent by a subsidiary, these are considered restrictions for purposes of computing restricted
net assets. When a loan agreement requires that a subsidiary maintain certain working capital, net
tangible asset, or net asset levels, or where formal compensating arrangements exist, there is
considered to be a restriction under this paragraph because the lender's intent is normally to
preclude the transfer by dividend or otherwise of funds to the parent company. Similarly, a

185

provision which requires that a subsidiary reinvest all of its earnings is a restriction, since this
precludes loans, advances or dividends in the amount of such undistributed earnings by the
entity. Where restrictions on the amount of funds which may be loaned or advanced differ from
the amount restricted as to transfer in the form of cash dividends, the amount least restrictive to
the subsidiary shall be used. Redeemable preferred stocks (§ 210.5-02, paragraph 27) and
noncontrolling interests shall be deducted in computing net assets for purposes of this test.
3.

Amend § 210.2-01 by revising paragraph (f)(7)(ii)(B) to read as follows:

*

available the registrant reasonably and in good faith expects to report income attributable to the
registrant, after taxes; and
(3) For at least one of the two fiscal years immediately preceding the most recent fiscal
year the registrant reported income attributable to the registrant, after taxes.
*
6.

*

*

*

*

Amend § 210.3-02 by revising the section heading and paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as

follows:
§ 210.3-02 Consolidated statements of comprehensive income and cash flows.
(a) There shall be filed, for the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated and for its
predecessors, audited statements of comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three
fiscal years preceding the date of the most recent audited balance sheet being filed or such
shorter period as the registrant (including predecessors) has been in existence.
(b) In addition, for any interim period between the latest audited balance sheet and the
date of the most recent interim balance sheet being filed, and for the corresponding period of the
preceding fiscal year, statements of comprehensive income and cash flows shall be provided.
Such interim financial statements may be unaudited and need not be presented in greater detail
than is required by § 210.10-01.

187

*
7.

*

*

*

*

Amend § 210.3-03 by revising the section heading and paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) to read

as follows:
§ 210.3-03 Instructions to statement of comprehensive income requirements.
*

*

*

*

*

(b) If the registrant is engaged primarily:
(1) In the generation, transmission or distribution of electricity, the manufacture,
mixing, transmission or distribution of gas, the supplying or distribution of water, or the
furnishing of telephone or telegraph service; or
(2) In holding securities of companies engaged in such businesses, it may at its option
include statements of comprehensive income and cash flows (which may be unaudited) for
the twelve-month period ending on the date of the most recent balance sheet being filed, in
lieu of the statements of comprehensive income and cash flows for the interim periods
specified.
*

*

*

*

*

(d) Any unaudited interim financial statements furnished shall reflect all adjustments
which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the
interim periods presented. A statement to that effect shall be included. If all such
adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, a statement to that effect shall be made;
otherwise, there shall be furnished information describing in appropriate detail the nature and
amount of any adjustments other than normal recurring adjustments entering into the
determination of the results shown.

188

(e) Disclosures regarding segments required by generally accepted accounting principles
shall be provided for each year for which an audited statement of comprehensive income (or
statement of net income if comprehensive income is presented in two separate but consecutive
financial statements or if no other comprehensive income) is provided. To the extent that the
segment information presented pursuant to this instruction complies with the provisions of Item
101 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.101), the disclosures may be combined by cross referencing
to or from the financial statements.
8.

Revise § 210.3-04 to read as follows:

§ 210.3-04 Changes in stockholders' equity and noncontrolling interests.
An analysis of the changes in each caption of stockholders' equity and noncontrolling
interests presented in the balance sheets shall be given in a note or separate statement. This
analysis shall be presented in the form of a reconciliation of the beginning balance to the
ending balance for each period for which a statement of comprehensive income is required to
be filed with all significant reconciling items described by appropriate captions with
contributions from and distribution to owners shown separately. Also, state-separately the
adjustments to the balance at the beginning of the earliest period presented for items which
were retroactively applied to periods prior to that period. With respect to any dividends, state
the amount per share and in the aggregate for each class of shares. Provide a separate
schedule in the notes to the financial statements that shows the effects of any changes in the
registrant's ownership interest in a subsidiary on the equity attributable to the registrant.
9.

Amend § 210.3-05 by revising paragraph (b)(4)(iii) to read as follows:

§ 210.3-05 Financial statements of businesses acquired or to be acquired.
*

*

*

189

*

*

(b) *

*

*

(4) *

*

*

(iii) Separate financial statements of the acquired business need not be presented once
the operating results of the acquired business have been reflected in the audited consolidated
financial statements of the registrant for a complete fiscal year unless such financial
statements have not been previously filed or unless the acquired business is of such
significance to the registrant that omission of such financial statements would materially
impair an investor's ability to understand the historical financial results of the registrant. For
example, if, at the date of acquisition, the acquired business met at least one of the conditions

a.

Revising the undesignated introductory text;

b.

Revising paragraph (a);

c.

Removing and reserving paragraph (b); and

d.

Removing paragraphs (c) and (d).

The revisions read as follows:
§ 210.3A-02 Consolidated financial statements of the registrant and its subsidiaries.
In deciding upon consolidation policy, the registrant must consider what financial
presentation is most meaningful in the circumstances and should follow in the consolidated
financial statements principles of inclusion or exclusion which will clearly exhibit the financial
position and results of operations of the registrant. There is a presumption that consolidated
statements are more meaningful than separate statements and that they are usually necessary for

193

a fair presentation when one entity directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest in
another entity. Other particular facts and circumstances may require combined financial
statements, an equity method of accounting, or valuation allowances in order to achieve a fair
presentation.
(a) Majority ownership: Among the factors that the registrant should consider in
determining the most meaningful presentation is majority ownership. Generally, registrants shall
consolidate entities that are majority owned and shall not consolidate entities that are not
majority owned. The determination of "majority ownership" requires a careful analysis of the
facts and circumstances of a particular relationship among entities. In rare situations,
consolidation of a majority owned subsidiary may not result in a fair presentation, because the
registrant, in substance, does not have a controlling financial interest (for example, when the
subsidiary is in legal reorganization or in bankruptcy). In other situations, consolidation of an
entity, notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership, is necessary to present fairly the
financial position and results of operations of the registrant, because of the existence of a parentsubsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting stock.

information shall be provided for each statement required to be filed, except that the information

195

required by paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this section shall be provided as of the most
recent audited balance sheet being filed and for paragraph (j) of this section as specified therein.
When specific statements are presented separately, the pertinent notes shall accompany such
statements unless cross-referencing is appropriate.

(benefit) and the amount computed by multiplying the income (loss) before tax by the
applicable statutory Federal income tax rate, if no individual reconciling item amounts to
more than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying the income before tax by the
applicable statutory Federal income tax rate, and the total difference to be reconciled is less
than five percent of such computed amount, no reconciliation need be provided unless it
would be significant in appraising the trend of earnings. Reconciling items that are
individually less than five percent of the computed amount may be aggregated in the
reconciliation. Where the reporting person is a foreign entity, the income tax rate in that
person's country of domicile should normally be used in making the above computation, but
different rates should not be used for subsidiaries or other segments of a reporting entity.
When the rate used by a reporting person is other than the United States Federal corporate
income tax rate, the rate used and the basis for using such rate shall be disclosed.

§ 210.8-03 Interim financial statements.
Interim financial statements may be unaudited; however, before filing, interim
financial statements included in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q (§ 249.308(a) of this
chapter) must be reviewed by an independent public accountant using applicable professional
standards and procedures for conducting such reviews, as may be modified or supplemented
by the Commission. If, in any filing, the issuer states that interim financial statements have
been reviewed by an independent public accountant, a report of the accountant on the review
must be filed with the interim financial statements. Interim financial statements shall include
a balance sheet as of the end of the issuer's most recent fiscal quarter, a balance sheet as of
the end of the preceding fiscal year, and statements of comprehensive income and statements

211

of cash flows for the interim period up to the date of such balance sheet and the comparable
period of the preceding fiscal year.
(a) *

(2) Statements of comprehensive income (or the statement of net income if
comprehensive income is presented in two separate but consecutive financial statements)
should include net sales or gross revenue, each cost and expense category presented in the
annual financial statements that exceeds 20% of sales or gross revenues, provision for
income taxes, and discontinued operations. (Financial institutions should substitute net
interest income for sales for purposes of determining items to be disclosed.)

indicating whether or not the change is to a preferable method. Disclosure must be provided
of any retroactive change to prior period financial statements, including the effect of any
such change on income and income per share.

applicable to a Form 10-Q (§ 249.308a of this chapter) and the interim period is more than
one quarter, statements of comprehensive income must also be provided for the most recent
interim quarter and the comparable quarter of the preceding fiscal year.

the most recent balance sheet required by § 210.8-02 or § 210.8-03, a pro forma balance
sheet giving effect to the combination as of the date of the most recent balance sheet. For a
purchase, pro forma statements of comprehensive income reflecting the combined operations
of the entities for the latest fiscal year and interim period, if any, are required.
40.

Amend § 210.8-06 by revising the undesignated introductory text to read as follows:

§ 210.8-06 Real estate operations acquired or to be acquired.

*

*

214

stockholders equity. The remaining assets may be shown as one amount.
(1) Goodwill.
(2) Other intangible assets (net of amortization).
(3) Investments in and indebtedness of affiliates and other persons.
(4) Other real estates.
(a) Disclose in a note the basis at which other real estate is carried. A reduction to fair
market value from the carrying value of the related loan at the time of acquisition shall be
accounted for as a loan loss. Any allowance for losses on other real estate which has been
established subsequent to acquisition should be deducted from other real estate. For each
period for which a statement of comprehensive income is required, disclosures should be
made in a note as to the changes in the allowances, including balance at beginning and end of
period, provision charged to income, and losses charged to the allowance.

*
44.

*

*

*

Revise § 210.9-06 to read as follows:

§ 210.9-06 Condensed financial information of registrant.
The information prescribed by § 210.12-04 shall be presented in a note to the

completed fiscal year. The investment in and indebtedness of and to bank subsidiaries shall
be stated separately in the condensed balance sheet from amounts for other subsidiaries; the
amount of cash dividends paid to the registrant for each of the last three years by bank
subsidiaries shall be stated separately in the condensed statement of comprehensive income
from amounts for other subsidiaries.

Revising paragraphs (b)(1) through (3);

c.

Removing and reserving paragraphs (b)(4) and (5);

d.

Revising paragraphs (b)(6) and (8); and

e.

Revising paragraphs (c)(2) and (4) and (d).
The revisions read as follows:

§ 210.10-01 Interim financial statements.
(a) *

*

*

217

(3) Interim statements of comprehensive income shall also include major captions
prescribed by the applicable sections of this Regulation S-X (part 210 of this chapter). When any
major statement of comprehensive income (or statement of net income if comprehensive income
is presented in two separate but consecutive financial statements) caption is less than 15% of
average net income for the most recent three fiscal years and the amount in the caption has not
increased or decreased by more than 20% as compared to the corresponding interim period of the
preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others. In calculating average net
income, loss years should be excluded. If losses were incurred in each of the most recent three
years, the average loss shall be used for purposes of this test. Notwithstanding these tests, §
210.4-02 applies and de minimis amounts therefore need not be shown separately, except that
registrants reporting under § 210.9 shall show investment securities gains or losses separately
regardless of size.
*

*

*

*

*

(5) The interim financial information shall include disclosures either on the face of
the financial statements or in accompanying footnotes sufficient so as to make the interim
information presented not misleading. Registrants may presume that users of the interim
financial information have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the
preceding fiscal year and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair
presentation may be determined in that context. Accordingly, footnote disclosure which
would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the most recent annual report to
security holders or latest audited financial statements, such as a statement of significant
accounting policies and practices, details of accounts which have not changed significantly in

218

amount or composition since the end of the most recently completed fiscal year, and detailed
disclosures prescribed by § 210.4-08, may be omitted.
*

*

*

*

*

(7) Provide the information required by § 210.3-04.
(b) *

*

*

(1) Summarized statement of comprehensive income information shall be given
separately as to each subsidiary not consolidated or 50 percent or less owned persons or as to
each group of such subsidiaries or fifty percent or less owned persons for which separate
individual or group statements would otherwise be required for annual periods. Such
summarized information, however, need not be furnished for any such unconsolidated
subsidiary or person which would not be required pursuant to § 240.13a-13 or § 240.15d-13
of this chapter to file quarterly financial information with the Commission if it were a
registrant.
(2) The basis of the earnings per share computation shall be stated together with the
number of shares used in the computation.
(3) If, during the most recent interim period presented, the registrant or any of its
consolidated subsidiaries entered into a combination between entities under common control,
supplemental disclosure of the separate results of the combined entities for periods prior to
the combination shall be given, with appropriate explanations.
*

*

*

*

*

(6) For filings on Form 10-Q (§ 249.308(a) of this chapter), a letter from the
registrant's independent accountant shall be filed as an exhibit (in accordance with the
provisions of Item 601 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.601)) in the first Form 10-Q after the

219

date of an accounting change indicating whether or not the change is to an alternative
principle which, in the accountant's judgment, is preferable under the circumstances; except
that no letter from the accountant need be filed when the change is made in response to a
standard adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board that requires such change.
*

*

*

*

*

(8) Any unaudited interim financial statements furnished shall reflect all adjustments
which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the
interim periods presented. A statement to that effect shall be included. If all such
adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, a statement to that effect shall be made;
otherwise, there shall be furnished information describing in appropriate detail the nature and
amount of any adjustments other than normal recurring adjustments entering into the
determination of the results shown.
(c) *

*

*

(2) Interim statements of comprehensive income shall be provided for the most recent
fiscal quarter, for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the
most recent fiscal quarter, and for the corresponding periods of the preceding fiscal year.
Such statements may also be presented for the cumulative twelve month period ended during
the most recent fiscal quarter and for the corresponding preceding period.
*

*

*

*

*

(4) Registrants engaged in seasonal production and sale of a single-crop agricultural
commodity may provide interim statements of comprehensive income and cash flows for the
twelve month period ended during the most recent fiscal quarter and for the corresponding

220

preceding period in lieu of the year-to-date statements specified in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3)
of this section.
(d) Interim review by independent public accountant. Prior to filing, interim financial
statements included in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q (17 CFR 249.308(a)) must be
reviewed by an independent public accountant using applicable professional standards and
procedures for conducting such reviews, as may be modified or supplemented by the
Commission. If, in any filing, the company states that interim financial statements have been
reviewed by an independent public accountant, a report of the accountant on the review must
be filed with the interim financial statements.

Amend § 210.11-02 by:
a.

Revising paragraphs (b)(1), (3), (5), (6), and (7);

b.

Redesignating the Instructions following paragraph (b)(8) consecutively as

Instruction 1 to paragraph (b), Instruction 2 to paragraph (b), Instruction 3 to paragraph
(b), Instruction 4 to paragraph (b), Instruction 5 to paragraph (b), Instruction 6 to
paragraph (b), and Instruction 7 to paragraph (b);
c.

Revising newly redesignated Instruction 1 to paragraph (b), Instruction 2 to

paragraph (b), Instruction 5 to paragraph (b) and Instruction 7 to paragraph (b); and
d.

Revising paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii), (c)(3) and (c)(4).

The revisions read as follows:
§ 210.11-02 Preparation requirements.
*
(b) *

*

*

*

*

221

*

*

(1) Pro forma financial information shall consist of a pro forma condensed balance
sheet, pro forma condensed statements of comprehensive income, and accompanying
explanatory notes. In certain circumstances (i.e., where a limited number of pro forma
adjustments are required and those adjustments are easily understood), a narrative description
of the pro forma effects of the transaction may be furnished in lieu of the statements
described herein.
*

*

*

*

*

(3) The pro forma condensed financial information need only include major captions
(i.e., the numbered captions) prescribed by the applicable sections of this Regulation S-X
(part 210). Where any major balance sheet caption is less than 10 percent of total assets, the
caption may be combined with others. When any major statement of comprehensive income
caption is less than 15 percent of average net income attributable to the registrant for the
most recent three fiscal years, the caption may be combined with others. In calculating
average net income attributable to the registrant, loss years should be excluded unless losses
were incurred in each of the most recent three years, in which case the average loss shall be
used for purposes of this test. Notwithstanding these tests, de minimis amounts need not be
shown separately.
*

*

*

*

*

(5) The pro forma condensed statement of comprehensive income shall disclose
income (loss) from continuing operations before nonrecurring charges or credits directly
attributable to the transaction. Material nonrecurring charges or credits and related tax effects
which result directly from the transaction and which will be included in the income of the
registrant within the 12 months succeeding the transaction shall be disclosed separately. It

222

should be clearly indicated that such charges or credits were not considered in the pro forma
condensed statement of comprehensive income. If the transaction for which pro forma
financial information is presented relates to the disposition of a business, the pro forma
results should give effect to the disposition and be presented under an appropriate caption.
(6) Pro forma adjustments related to the pro forma condensed statement of
comprehensive income shall be computed assuming the transaction was consummated at the
beginning of the fiscal year presented and shall include adjustments which give effect to
events that are directly attributable to the transaction, expected to have a continuing impact
on the registrant, and factually supportable. Pro forma adjustments related to the pro forma
condensed balance sheet shall be computed assuming the transaction was consummated at
the end of the most recent period for which a balance sheet is required by § 210.3-01 and
shall include adjustments which give effect to events that are directly attributable to the
transaction and factually supportable regardless of whether they have a continuing impact or
are nonrecurring. All adjustments should be referenced to notes which clearly explain the
assumptions involved.
(7) Historical primary and fully diluted per share data based on continuing operations
(or net income if the registrant does not report discontinued operations) for the registrant, and
primary and fully diluted pro forma per share data based on continuing operations before
nonrecurring charges or credits directly attributable to the transaction shall be presented on
the face of the pro forma condensed statement of comprehensive income together with the
number of shares used to compute such per share data. For transactions involving the
issuance of securities, the number of shares used in the calculation of the pro forma per share
data should be based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period

223

adjusted to give effect to shares subsequently issued or assumed to be issued had the
particular transaction or event taken place at the beginning of the period presented. If a
convertible security is being issued in the transaction, consideration should be given to the
possible dilution of the pro forma per share data.
(8) *

*

*

Instruction 1 to paragraph (b). The historical statement of comprehensive income
used in the pro forma financial information shall not report discontinued operations. If the
historical statement of comprehensive income includes such items, only the portion of the
statement of comprehensive income through “income from continuing operations” (or the
appropriate modification thereof) should be used in preparing pro forma results.
Instruction 2 to paragraph (b). For a business combination, pro forma adjustments for
the statement of comprehensive income shall include amortization, depreciation and other
adjustments based on the allocated purchase price of net assets acquired. In some
transactions, such as in financial institution acquisitions, the purchase adjustments may
include significant discounts of the historical cost of the acquired assets to their fair value at
the acquisition date. When such adjustments will result in a significant effect on earnings
(losses) in periods immediately subsequent to the acquisition which will be progressively
eliminated over a relatively short period, the effect of the purchase adjustments on reported
results of operations for each of the next five years should be disclosed in a note.
*

*

*

*

*

Instruction 5 to paragraph (b). Adjustments to reflect the acquisition of real estate
operations or properties for the pro forma statement of comprehensive income shall include a
depreciation charge based on the new accounting basis for the assets, interest financing on any

224

additional or refinanced debt, and other appropriate adjustments that can be factually supported.
See also Instruction 4 to paragraph (b) of this section.
*

*

*

*

*

Instruction 7 to paragraph (b). Tax effects, if any, of pro forma adjustments normally
should be calculated at the statutory rate in effect during the periods for which pro forma
condensed statements of comprehensive income are presented and should be reflected as a
separate pro forma adjustment.
(c) *

*

*

(2) *

*

*

(i) Pro forma condensed statements of comprehensive income shall be filed for only
the most recent fiscal year and for the period from the most recent fiscal year end to the most
recent interim date for which a balance sheet is required. A pro forma condensed statement of
comprehensive income may be filed for the corresponding interim period of the preceding
fiscal year. A pro forma condensed statement of comprehensive income shall not be filed
when the historical statement of comprehensive income reflects the transaction for the entire
period.
(ii) For combinations between entities under common control, the pro forma
statements of comprehensive income (which are in effect a restatement of the historical
statements of comprehensive income as if the combination had been consummated) shall be
filed for all periods for which historical statements of comprehensive income of the registrant
are required.
(3) Pro forma condensed statements of comprehensive income shall be presented using
the registrant's fiscal year end. If the most recent fiscal year end of any other entity involved in

225

the transaction differs from the registrant's most recent fiscal year end by more than 93 days, the
other entity's statement of comprehensive income shall be brought up to within 93 days of the
registrant's most recent fiscal year end, if practicable. This updating could be accomplished by
adding subsequent interim period results to the most recent fiscal year-end information and
deducting the comparable preceding year interim period results. Disclosure shall be made of the
periods combined and of the sales or revenues and income for any periods which were excluded
from or included more than once in the condensed pro forma statements of comprehensive
income (e.g., an interim period that is included both as part of the fiscal year and the subsequent
interim period). For investment companies subject to §§ 210.6-01 through 210.6-10, the periods
covered by the pro forma statements must be the same.
(4) Whenever unusual events enter into the determination of the results shown for the
most recently completed fiscal year, the effect of such unusual events should be disclosed and
consideration should be given to presenting a pro forma condensed statement of comprehensive
income for the most recent twelve-month period in addition to those required in paragraph
(c)(2)(i) of this section if the most recent twelve-month period is more representative of normal
operations.
47.

Amend § 210.11-03 by revising the introductory text of paragraph (a) and paragraph

(a)(2) to read as follows:
§ 210.11-03 Presentation of financial forecast.

comprehensive income required by § 210.11-02(b)(1).
*

*

*

226

*

*

(2) The forecasted statement of comprehensive income shall be presented in the same

(2) Format for projections. In determining the appropriate format for projections included
in Commission filings, consideration must be given to, among other things, the financial items to
230

be projected, the period to be covered, and the manner of presentation to be used. Although
traditionally projections have been given for three financial items generally considered to be of
primary importance to investors (revenues, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share),
projection information need not necessarily be limited to these three items. However,
management should take care to assure that the choice of items projected is not susceptible of
misleading inferences through selective projection of only favorable items. Revenues, net
income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share usually are presented together in order to avoid any
misleading inferences that may arise when the individual items reflect contradictory trends.
There may be instances, however, when it is appropriate to present earnings (loss) from
continuing operations in addition to or in lieu of net income (loss). It generally would be
misleading to present sales or revenue projections without one of the foregoing measures of
income. The period that appropriately may be covered by a projection depends to a large extent
on the particular circumstances of the company involved. For certain companies in certain
industries, a projection covering a two or three year period may be entirely reasonable. Other
companies may not have a reasonable basis for projections beyond the current year. Accordingly,
management should select the period most appropriate in the circumstances. In addition,
management, in making a projection, should disclose what, in its opinion, is the most probable
specific amount or the most reasonable range for each financial item projected based on the
selected assumptions. Ranges, however, should not be so wide as to make the disclosures
meaningless. Moreover, several projections based on varying assumptions may be judged by
management to be more meaningful than a single number or range and would be permitted.

(a) Full fiscal years. Discuss registrant's financial condition, changes in financial
condition and results of operations. The discussion shall provide information as specified in
paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section and also shall provide such other information
236

that the registrant believes to be necessary to an understanding of its financial condition,
changes in financial condition and results of operations. Discussions of liquidity and capital
resources may be combined whenever the two topics are interrelated. Where in the
registrant's judgment a discussion of segment or geographic information or of other
subdivisions of the registrant's business would be appropriate to an understanding of such
business, the discussion shall focus on each relevant, reportable segment, geographic area, or
other subdivision of the business and on the registrant as a whole.

which a statement of comprehensive income (or statement of operations if comprehensive
income is presented in two separate but consecutive financial statements or if no other
comprehensive income) is provided and the corresponding year-to-date period of the
preceding fiscal year. If the registrant is required to or has elected to provide a statement of
comprehensive income (or statement of operations if comprehensive income is presented in
two separate but consecutive financial statements or if no other comprehensive income) for
the most recent fiscal quarter, such discussion also shall cover material changes with respect
to that fiscal quarter and the corresponding fiscal quarter in the preceding fiscal year. In
addition, if the registrant has elected to provide a statement of comprehensive income (or
statement of operations if comprehensive income is presented in two separate but consecutive
financial statements or if no other comprehensive income) for the twelve-month period ended
as of the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided, the discussion also shall

237

cover material changes with respect to that twelve-month period and the twelve-month period
ended as of the corresponding interim balance sheet date of the preceding fiscal year.
Notwithstanding the above, if for purposes of a registration statement a registrant subject to §
210.3-03(b) of Regulation S-X of this chapter provides a statement of comprehensive income
(or statement of operations if comprehensive income is presented in two separate but
consecutive financial statements or if no other comprehensive income) for the twelve-month
period ended as of the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided in lieu of the
interim statements of comprehensive income (or statement of operations if comprehensive
income is presented in two separate but consecutive financial statements or if no other
comprehensive income) otherwise required, the discussion of material changes in that
twelve-month period will be in respect to the preceding fiscal year rather than the
corresponding preceding period.

continuous offering. Financial statements and information otherwise required by section
10(a)(3) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77j(a)(3)) need not be furnished, provided that the registrant
includes in the prospectus, by means of a post-effective amendment, financial statements

other information in the prospectus is at least as current as the date of those financial
statements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to registration statements on Form F3 (§ 239.33 of this chapter), a post-effective amendment need not be filed to include financial
statements and information required by section 10(a)(3) of the Act or Item 8.A of Form 20-F

(b) statement of comprehensive income (either in a single continuous financial statement
or in two separate but consecutive financial statements; or a statement of net income if there was
no other comprehensive income);
*

*

*

*

*

5. If the document is dated more than nine months after the end of the last audited
financial year, it should contain consolidated interim financial statements, which may be
unaudited (in which case that fact should be stated), covering at least the first six months of the
financial year. The interim financial statements should include a balance sheet, statement of
comprehensive income (either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but
consecutive financial statements; or a statement of net income if there was no other
comprehensive income), cash flow statement, and a statement showing either (i) changes in
equity other than those arising from capital transactions with owners and distributions to owners,
or (ii) all changes in equity (including a subtotal of all non-owner items recognized directly in
equity). Each of these statements may be in condensed form as long as it contains the major line
items from the latest audited financial statements and includes the major components of assets,
liabilities and equity (in the case of the balance sheet); income and expenses (in the case of the
statement of comprehensive income) and the major subtotals of cash flows (in the case of the
cash flow statement). The interim financial statements should include comparative statements
for the same period in the prior financial year, except that the requirement for comparative
balance sheet information may be satisfied by presenting the year end balance sheet. If not

288

included in the primary financial statements, a note should be provided analyzing the changes in
each caption of shareholders’ equity presented in the balance sheet. The interim financial
statements should include selected note disclosures that will provide an explanation of events
and changes that are significant to an understanding of the changes in financial position and
performance of the enterprise since the last annual reporting date. If, at the date of the document,
the company has published interim financial information that covers a more current period than
those otherwise required by this standard, the more current interim financial information must be
included in the document. Companies are encouraged, but not required, to have any interim
financial statements in the document reviewed by an independent auditor. If such a review has
been performed and is referred to in the document, a copy of the auditor’s interim review report
must be provided in the document.

refers to expenses that are distinguished by their unusual nature and by the infrequency of

Infrequency of occurrence means the expense is not reasonably expected to recur in the

(i) “Other Expenses” do not include extraordinary expenses. “Extraordinary expenses”
refers to expenses that are distinguished by their unusual nature and by the infrequency of
occurrence. Unusual nature means the expense has a high degree of abnormality and is clearly
unrelated to, or only incidentally related to, the ordinary and typical activities of the fund, taking
into account the environment in which the fund operates. Infrequency of occurrence means the
expense is not reasonably expected to recur in the foreseeable future, taking into consideration
the environment in which the fund operates. The environment of a fund includes such factors as
the characteristics of the industry or industries in which it operates, the geographical location of
its operations, and the nature and extent of governmental regulation. If extraordinary expenses
were incurred that materially affected the Registrant’s “Other Expenses,” the Registrant should
disclose in the narrative following the table what the “Other Expenses” would have been had
extraordinary expenses been included.

(b) “Total Annual [Portfolio Company] Operating Expenses” do not include
extraordinary expenses. “Extraordinary expenses” refers to expenses that are distinguished by
their unusual nature and by the infrequency of occurrence. Unusual nature means the expense

foreseeable future, taking into consideration the environment in which the fund operates. The
environment of a fund includes such factors as the characteristics of the industry or industries in
which it operates, the geographical location of its operations, and the nature and extent of
governmental regulation. If extraordinary expenses were incurred by any portfolio company that
would, if included, materially affect the minimum or maximum amounts shown in the table,
disclose in a footnote to the table what the minimum and maximum “Total Annual [Portfolio
Company] Operating Expenses” would have been had the extraordinary expenses been included.
