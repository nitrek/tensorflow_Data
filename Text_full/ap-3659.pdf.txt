HEARING AND SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On February 10, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in
their periodic filings. A hearing is scheduled for March 7, 2016.
To allow time for service of the OIP on Respondents, I POSTPONE the hearing currently
scheduled for March 7, 2016, and schedule a telephonic prehearing conference for 3:00 p.m.
EDT on March 17, 2016. Respondents are on notice that if they fail to file a timely Answer,
appear at the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend the proceeding, I will deem them in
default, determine that the allegations in the OIP are true, and revoke the registrations of their
securities. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f).
