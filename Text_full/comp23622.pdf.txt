COMPLAINT
Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission")alleges:
SUMMARY
1.

This case involves violations of the anti-fraud, securities registration, and broker-

dealer registration provisions ofthe federal securities laws by defendant Michael Andre Jones
("Jones"). Jones employed a scheme to trick investors into buying unregistered securities issued
by a start-up company named Green Bash, LLC ("Green Bash")for which he was the sole
shareholder and director. Green Bash is now defunct. Jones offered and sold more than
$700,000 worth of Green Bash convertible promissory notes to twenty investors, residing in
twelve states. The offering was not registered with the Commission, and did not qualify for an
exemption from registration. Jones made false statements to prospective investors regarding
Green Bash's revenues and business operations and made material misrepresentations about the
offering. Jones acted as an unregistered broker when making Green Bash offers and sales to

Case 1:16-cv-01695 Document 1 Filed 08/19/16 Page 2 of 15

investors. After concluding the sales ofthe notes, Jones sold two investors restricted stock in a
small unrelated biotechnology company. However, when Jones was unable to obtain an opinion
letter lifting the restriction on his shares, he simply kept the shares and the funds investors had
paid him for his shares.
2.

By engaging in the conduct set forth in this Complaint, defendant Jones violated

Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act")[15 U.S.C.
§§ 77e(a), 77e(c), and 77q(a)], Sections 10(b) and 15(a) ofthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934
("Exchange Act")[15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78o(a)], and Exchange Act Rule lOb-5 [17 C.F.R. §
240.1Ob-5] promulgated thereunder.
3.

The Commission seeks an injunction against future violations, aconduct-based

injunction, disgorgement of unjust enrichment with prejudgment interest thereon, and a civil
money penalty pursuant to Section 20(d) ofthe Securities Act[15 U.S.C. § 77t(d)] and Section
21(d) of the Exchange Act[15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)].
JURISDICTION
4.

The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b) and 20(c) of

the Securities Act[15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b) and 77t(c)] and Sections 21(d) and 21(e) ofthe Exchange
Act[15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u(e)].
5.

Jones, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of

interstate commerce or the mails, in connection with the conduct alleged herein.
DEFENDANT
6.

Michael Andre Jones, age 52, is a citizen of the United States and presently

resides in Marysville, Washington. He is currently employed as a uniform salesman. From
April of2010 through July of 2013, Jones was the sole shareholder and director of Green Bash.

2

Case 1:16-cv-01695 Document 1 Filed 08/19/16 Page 3 of 15

Prior to the conduct described herein, Jones was associated with a number ofbroker-dealers
registered with the Commission, but was subsequently barred in 2007 by the National
Association of Securities Dealers("NASD")from association with any NASD member firm.
RELEVANT ENTITY
7.

Green Bash, LLC is a New Mexico limited liability company with its principal

offices in Los Angeles, California. Jones is the sole shareholder and director ofthe company.
Green Bash's securities offering was not registered with the Commission. Green Bash was
purportedly in the business of arranging and promoting "event after-parties" and making sales of
tickets, music, and related merchandise for environmentally themed trade shows. Green Bash
ceased operations in July 2013 and has no assets or revenue.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
8.

From at least April of 2010 through July of 2013, Jones sold convertible

promissory notes of Green Bash to 20 different investors living in 12 different states. The sales
totaled at least $706,145, and the proceeds were deposited into a bank account that Jones opened
and controlled for Green Bash, and for which he was the sole signatory. The Green Bash bank
account was regularly overdrawn, and Green Bash accumulated more than $28,000 in returned
item and overdrawn bank fees over the approximately three-year life of the account. After
several months of inactivity, the bank closed the account.
9.

Jones hired and compensated individuals to solicit potential investors for Green

10.

Jones purchased at least one list of potential investors and used the information

Bash.

from the list to solicit investors for his sales of Green Bash's promissory notes. Jones, and

3

Case 1:16-cv-01695 Document 1 Filed 08/19/16 Page 4 of 15

individuals he hired, contacted approximately 2,000 persons in his efforts to sell the Green Bash
notes.
11.

Jones created telephone scripts that he directed the individuals he hired to use for

their initial "cold" calls to potential investors. He also created a "closing script" that he used to
close sales of Green Bash notes to investors.
12.

Jones used telephone calls to offer and sell the Green Bash notes. During closing

calls, Jones directed potential investors to a website that he used to give potential investors the
impression that he was part of a vibrant investment firm with several active and lucrative funding
initiatives in progress. The website purported to set forth multiple private placement deals that
the firm was working on. In reality, apart from Jones, there was no such firm, and the only
business Jones was conducting was the sale of Green Bash promissory notes.
13.

Jones drafted a Private Placement Memorandum ("PPM")that he sent to each

Green Bash investor. The PPM described the offering of Green Bash securities and gave
detailed information about Green Bash's purported business operations, along with
unsubstantiated projections for its future performance.
14.

Jones used the mails and commercial delivery services to send the PPM and

subscription agreements to Green Bash investors. Jones created and mailed, or used commercial
delivery services to deliver, certificates evidencing the purchase of Green Bash notes.
15.

Jones never filed a registration statement with the Commission for the offering of

Green Bash notes. The PPM described the offering of Green Bash notes as exempt from the
registration requirements ofthe federal securities laws. In fact, the offering did not qualify for
the claimed exemption, principally because Jones used his purchased investor list to solicit
investors with whom he had no prior dealings, thereby conducting a general solicitation. Thus

D

Case 1:16-cv-01695 Document 1 Filed 08/19/16 Page 5 of 15

the Green Bash notes offering was not registered with the Commission and no exemption from
registration applied to the offering.
16.

The PPM contained a number of material false statements regarding the

operations and revenue of Green Bash. Jones drafted these false statements, knowingly or
recklessly disregarding that they were false at the time he wrote them, and knowingly or
recklessly disregarding that they were false when he transmitted them to prospective Green Bash
note purchasers.
17.

The PPM contained revenue projections for Green Bash of $898,000 in year one,

$2,199,796 in year two, and $4,300,087 in year three. Jones had no reasonable basis for these
projections when he made them. Moreover, Jones never updated these projections, despite the
fact that Green Bash had no revenue in 2010, and continued to use the unchanged PPM
throughout the sales period.
18.

Jones started selling Green Bash notes in April of 2010, and by April of 2011, he

had sold at least $145,600 worth of notes. Jones had sold more than $700,000 worth of Green
Bash notes by July of 2013.
19.

The PPM identified six Green Bash revenue streams: sales of tickets, music, and

merchandise, and three forms of website-generated revenue. None of these revenue streams
actually existed.
20.

The PPM described Green Bash as conducting a business that arranged and

promoted "event after-parties" by utilizing a "viral e-commerce" online platform at concert
venues, facilitating "one-click" sales of tickets, music, and merchandise. Purportedly,
concertgoers would thereby avoid the complexities and inconvenience of attempting to navigate
several Internet pages on a mobile device in order to make purchases. In reality, Green Bash was

Case 1:16-cv-01695 Document 1 Filed 08/19/16 Page 6 of 15

not using the "viral e-commerce" online platform, and it generated no revenue. Green Bash
never made any sales of music or merchandise. Green Bash never generated revenue from
operations of any kind.
21.

Jones also misrepresented the size ofthe Green Bash offering to all investors that

bought Green Bash notes after November of 2011. The PPM described the offering as being for
a total amount of$350,000, with the issuer having the option to raise an additional $50,000. In
fact, Jones had already sold $350,000 worth of Green Bash notes by November of 2011. This
misrepresentation was material because the Green Bash notes had conversion rights, a fact that
Jones touted to potential investors. Thus, Green Bash investors who purchased after November
of 2011 were knowingly or recklessly misled by Jones as to the dilutive effect ofthe offering.
22.

No Green Bash notes were ever converted to stock.

23.

Jones hired and compensated individuals to solicit potential investors. Jones

handled all ofthe proceeds ofthe note sales. He prepared all of the transaction documents that
he sent and received back from investors, and he prepared and issued Green Bash note
certificates to investors. He prepared and mailed, or used delivery services to send, initial
account statements to some of the investors. Jones thus effected transactions in securities for the
accounts of others.
24.

Jones used investor proceeds from some Green Bash notes to make some interest

payments to earlier Green Bash note purchasers. The last interest payments he made were in
December 2012. Thereafter, Green Bash defaulted on all of the notes to all ofthe investors.
25.

One Green Bash investor, after complaining, received a return of approximately

one-third of the principal he had invested. No other Green Bash investor received any return of
principal.

Case 1:16-cv-01695 Document 1 Filed 08/19/16 Page 7 of 15

26.

Jones dissipated the rest ofthe Green Bash note proceeds, essentially by paying

his rent and otherwise living off ofthem.
27.

After his sales of Green Bash notes, Jones commenced efforts to sell investors

securities of several other start-up entities. Jones was never actually able to sell any ofthose
securities, although he did form entities, compile preliminary drafts of offering documents, and
negotiated with several small businesses in an attempt to reach agreements to raise capital for
them.
28.

In the Spring of 2014, Jones worked briefly as a consultant for a small

biotechnology company. The arrangement called for Jones to sell the company's promissory
notes through private placements, and he was to be compensated in part with grants of restricted
company stock. However, once he received his initial grant of restricted stock, Jones
concentrated his efforts on selling that restricted stock, instead of selling the company's
promissory notes.
29.

Jones used telephone calls to offer and sell his restricted stock. Two investors

paid Jones a total of$35,000 for some of the stock. He received sales proceeds by mail. Jones
was never able to obtain an opinion letter from the company's counsel lifting the restriction on
his shares. Nevertheless, Jones collected the investors' funds, and conveniently kept both his
restricted stock and the funds.
30.

When the company discovered that Jones was attempting to sell his own stock,

the company terminated his employment.
