REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
Examination of Securities Act Registration Statements

Under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with certain exceptions, securities may not be publicly offered for sale or sold in interstate
commerce or through the mails unless a registration statement has
been filed with the Commission and is effective. A prospectus, containing the more material ultimate facts set forth in the registration
statement, is also required to be filed as part of the registration. statement. The law provides that a copy of the prospectus to be used in
connection with the sale of registered securities must be given to
every person to whom the securities are offered for sale and to every
purchaser at or before the time of the sale.
The registration statement serves a two-fold purpose: (1) it discloses
to investors material facts concerning an issue of securities that is
offered for sale to the public, and (2) it stands as a record of the representations made at the time the securities were sold, and thus, if any
such representation should be false, simplifies the problem of proof in

any legal proceedings which may result. The statement must be filed
on the particular form prescribed by the Commission as appropriate to
the type of the security proposed to be offered and each form provides for the submission of information essential to a fair disclosure
of material facts relative to the issuer and the securities offered for
sale.
. With certain exceptions, the Act provides for the lapse of a period
of twenty days after :filing before the registration statement becomes
effective. This provision gives the investors a reasonable period of
time in which to look into the facts concerning the issue and the issuer
before the issue is offered for sale, and, in addition, allows the Commission to make an examination of the statement for omissions,
inaccuracies, and untruths.
If the examination of the statement discloses deficiencies, but nevertheless indicates a sincere and honest
effort to comply with the requirements, the registrant is so advised.
The deficiencies may be corrected by the filing of amendments.
If,
on the other hand, the examination reveals that the registration statement includes untrue statements or omissions Of material facts in
intentional or reckless disregard of .the standard of disclosure prescribed by the Act, stop order proceedings may be instituted immediately.
The Commission is empowered also to refuse registration
in those instances where the information given is incomplete or inaccurate on its face .and to undertake investigations involving examination of the issuer, underwriters, or any other person for the purpose of
determining whether a stop order should issue. Further, the Commission may suspend registration after a registration statement becomes effective if it develops that the information furnished in the
statement is untrue or misleading in any material particulars.
. N either the fact that a registration statement for a security has been
filed or is in effect, nor the fact that a stop order is not in effect with
respect to that particular statement, can be treated as an indication
that the Commission considers the registration statement to be true
and accurate on its face or that it does not contain an untrue statement
of fact or omits to state a material fact, or be held to mean that the
Commission has in any way passed upon the merits of, or given approval to, the security.
To represent otherwise is made a criminal
act by the statute.
The annual reports filed with the Commission pursuant to the provisions of Section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, by issuers having securities registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, are examined and analyzed in the same manner as registration statements.
, For the purpose of giving. some indication of the nature of disclosures
made as a result of examinations, a few typical cases are briefly summarized below.

4

SECURITIES'ANDEX!1:HA'NGE.OOl\DIISSION

A company engaged in the business of creating and selling to the
public a class of securities known as investment contracts sought to
register $10,000,000 face amount of certificates to be offered under a socalled investment trust accumulation plan. These contracts provided
for either a lump sum payment or monthly installment payments on
the part of the purchaser, the net proceeds being used for the purchase
of shares of an underlying investment trust which were to be deposited
with a trustee, who was to hold them for the account of certificate
holders. The plan of investment thus involved a trust upon a trust
with two sets of loading or service charges, one on the underlying trust
shares and the other on the investment certificates.
The certificates to be issued under the periodic or installment
investment plans were stated on the face thereof and in the prospectus
as having a "maturity value" of $2,000 for each $1,200 agreed to be
paid by the investor. The prospectus did not disclose the fact that
this figure of $2,000 was purely arbitrary, representing nothing more
than the sum which the investor would obtain only when, as, and if
the value of the underlying trust shares purchased with the funds paid
in, less the charges and reductions, had reached $2,000. The investor
had no assurance that the so-called "maturity value" would ever be
reached. In fact, by reason of the substantial charges deducted from
the $1,200 paid in bY,the investor, amounting to approximately $200,
the attainment of the stated "maturity value" would require a total
appreciation of almost 100% of the market value of the under1~
securities. This element of contingency was artfully concealed and
the use of this term, appearing in the prospectus no less than twenty
times, indicated an endeavor to import to the concept of "maturity
value" a specious reality for apparently no purpose other than to
mislead prospective investors. The prospectus, further, in connection with an elaborate recital of the routine duties of the trustee under
the plan, gave unwarranted prominence to the name of the trustee,
which was a well-known financial institution, in what appeared to be
an unjustified attempt to trade on its reputation.
In consequence
of such misleading representations and the failure of the prospectus
in certain other respects to set forth clearly the information required
to be furnished, the Commission instituted stop-order proceedings.
The registrant subsequently amended its registration statement and
prospectus, eliminating all reference to "maturity value" and otherwise revising the prospectus in keeping with the requirements of full
and fair disclosure of the material facts relating to the investment plan.
A registration statement filed by a bottling company in connection
with a proposed public offering of common stock contained a balance
sheet of the issuer which included among its assets franchise rights
at a stated valuation of $2,500,000. It appearing from information
contained in the registration statement that the valuation ascribed
to the franchise rights was excessive, the Commission proceeded to a

THIRD

AN1'o"UAL REPORT

5

hearing under Section 8 (e) of the Act. At this hearing, evidence was
adduced to indicate that no basis existed for the valuation placed
upon this intangible asset, whereupon stop-order proceedings were
instituted under Section 8 (d) of the Act. Upon notice of hearing the
registrant filed an amended balance sheet reducing the valuation of
the franchise rights from $2,500,000 to $1.
In a similar case involving the matter of property valuation, the
balance sheet of a newly organized manufacturing company set forth
its fixed assets at a valuation of approximately $700,000. The properties in question had recently been acquired at a cost of $200,000 and
were appraised, on the basis of reproduction cost new less depreciatjon, at approximately $1,200,000. For balance sheet purposes the
company placed an arbitrary valuation of $700,000 on the properties,
thus creating a "surplus" of approximately $500,000. The Commission instituted stop-order proceedings on the grounds that the balance:
sheet representations were misleading and that, in this instance,
reproduction cost less depreciation did not constitute a criterion of
value since the issuer had not demonstrated successful use of the
.properties warranting such valuation. As a result of the proceedings,
the issuer amended its balance sheet to show the properties at cost,
$200,000, thereby eliminating the "surplus" of one-half million dollars
which appeared on the balance sheet as originally filed.
A business trust filed a registration statement covering an issue of
$800,000 of certificates of beneficial interest, proposing to use the
proceeds from their public sale to acquire oil properties which it had
previously contracted to purchase from an oil operator in the MidContinent Field. Shortly after the effective date of the registration
statement a preliminary investigation was undertaken which disclosed
that the income of the properties was insufficient to support the dividends paid during the promotional period and, in addition, that the
sponsors of the trust were misappropriating the proceeds from the
sale of securities offered to the public instead of applying these proceeds on the purchase price of the properties. Injunction proceedings
were instituted in the Federal Court, as a result of which the promoters
were forced to restore the funds which had been diverted and the
company was required to make full disclosure to prospective investors
regarding the current earnings of the properties. Further investigation established that the estimates contained in the registration
statement regarding the value, productivity, and income of the properties had been grossly exaggerated, the estimate of recoverable oil
being overstated almost 500 percent. In addition, it was revealed
that a certain over-the-counter dealer was selling the trust certificates
in a nation-wide campaign involving willful and reckless misrepresentation.s Stop-order proceedings have been instituted under the
IOn July 7, 1937,proceedings to revoke the registration of this- dealer were Insntuted pursuant to SectIon 15 Cb)of the SecuritIes Exchange Act ofl934.

Securities .Act of 1933 to suspend the effectiveness of the registration
statement and proceedings under the Securities Exchange .Act of 1934
have also been instituted with a view to revocation of thp dealer's
license.
An express trust, created in accordance with the laws of the State
of Oklahoma with assets consisting of oil and gas interests in Oklahoma and Texas, filed a registration statement with the Commission
on Form .A-Ion December 12, 1935. The statement became effective, as amended, on February 19, 1936. Some $1,070,000 of certificates of interest in the trust were sold to the public. In January,
1937, stop-order proceedings were instituted under Section 8 (d) of
the Securities .Act. .After full and complete hearings before an examiner and argument before the Commission on exceptions to the exaIiJ.iner's findings, the Commission 6 issued its order stopping the effectiveness of the registration statement.
The registration statement
'was found to be deficient in the following respects:
(a) The registration statement failed to disclose the identity
of the one promoter and failed to disclose. the amount of profit
that he had made. .A great majority of the assets of the trust
had been purchased from him.
'
(b) The statement that quarterly reports would be furnished,
when at the time of the hearing no reports at all had been
issued.
,
(c) The failure to disclose certain pending litigation relative
to certain of the properties in the trust.
(d) The engineer's reports attached as exhibits to the registration statement were found to include misstatements of material physical facts and td omit facts necessary to prevent the
estimate arrived at from being misleading.
The reports also,
in some instances, failed to follow methods approved in the
profession.
(e) The statement of the present monthly income in the
registration statement was found to be erroneous. Motions to
dismiss the proceedings and to withdraw the registration statement were made in the proceedings, but were both denied by
the Commission .
.A manufacturing company filed a registration statement with the
Commission for the purpose of registering a large block of its common
stock of which approximately 80% was outstanding and to be offered
for the account of certain stockholders and 20% represented unissued
stock to be offered for the account of the issuer. The registration
statement stated that approximately 60% of the company's output
was sold to one customer, a large automobile manufacturer.

istration 'statement contained also, as part of the required financial
information, a profit and loss statement covering a six months period
subsequent to the close of the issuer's last fiscal year which apparently
indicated, in comparison with profit and loss statements for the three
years preceding, a pronounced upward trend in its profits. Investigation by the Commission revealed that the principal customer of
the registrant intended in the immediate future to reduce substantially its purchases from the issuer in consequence of certain changes
effected in the design of its own product and, further, that this customer. purchased most of its annual requirements during that portion
of the year covered by the aforementioned six months profit and loss
statement, a circumstance which would render such statement misleading unless the seasonal nature of the business were clearly indicated. Since full and fair disclosure respecting these matters had not
been made in the registration statement, the Commission instituted
stop-order proceedings whereupon the registrant, upon notice of hearing, withdrew its registration statement. The issuer later :filedanother
registration statement.
This statement properly set forth the limitations attached to tho six months profit and loss statement and indicated clearly the possibility that a large portion of the issuer's business which had accounted for its profits in recent years might be lost
as a result of an adverse change which appeared imminent in' the
business relationship between the registrant and its principal customer.
Securities Act Forms, Rules and Regulations

During the past year, the Commission adopted a new form (Form
A-o-l) for the registration of securities under the Securities Act of
1933 for promotional mining companies. Theretofore, mining issues
had been registered on the more general forms, A-I and A-2. It had
been found, however, that a number of the requirements. of these
forms were not well adapted to the problems of a newly organized
mining enterprise. To meet the problem, the Commission prepared
the new Form A-o-l, which is specifically designed to meet the needs
of such new mining enterprises. In preparing this new form, the
Commission not only drew heavily upon the services of its own experts,
but also, in accordance with "its usual practice, invited criticism and
suggestions from many interested persons throughout the country,
including the principal mining and engineering societies, and many
engineers, lawyers, accountants, and other technicians experienced in
the field.
'
The preparation of a general form having specialized alternative
questions to be answered by particular categories of issuers has been
undertaken.
Experience gained from the registration statements on
:filewith the Commission indicates that a form of this type will promote standardization of requirements and should materially lessen the

8

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

problems confronting the prospective registrant.
For certain special,
types of securities, revised forms are in course of preparation.
One
of these forms, i. e., Form 0-3, For American Certificates Against
Foreign Issues and For the Underlying Securities, was adopted shortly
after the close of the fiscal year,? In connection with this program, the
instructions as to financial statements to be filed are being appropriately modified to conform to the other changes.
A considerable number of improving amendments have been made
to the basic forms for registration under the Securities Act. These
amendments are designed to clarify the requirements of the several
forms and to extend the use of certain basic forms to additional classes
of issuers upon the furnishing of appropriate specialized information.
Section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
on May 27, 1936, requires registrants under the Securities Act of 1933
to file annual reports with the Commission under certain circumstances. During the year, the Commission adopted rules and regulations prescribing the nature of the information to be filed pursuant to
this legislation. For the purpose of filing such annual reports, the
Commission adopted a new general form (Form I-MD), modeled
after the basic form for annual reports of issuers having securities
listed on national securities exchanges. Additional special forms for
this purpose have also been adopted, i. e., Form 2-MD, For Investment Trusts having Securities Registered on Form o-r, Form 3-MD,
For Voting Trust Certificates; and Form 4-MD, For Certificates of
Deposit Issued by a Committee.
Revisions of numerous rules and regulations have been made from
time to time to perfect the mechanics of registration and to provide
for special situations.
In connection with the preparation of forms and rules, representatives of the Commission have been in close touch, through conferences
and correspondence, with various accountants, lawyers, and other
interested persons. Many of the suggestions received from such
persons have been incorporated in the forms and rules and regulations
as finally promulgated.
Numerous legal opinions and interpretations
have been preparedjn connection with the application of the existing
forms and rules to the individual problems of prospective registrants.
Several interpretative opinions by the Director of the Forms and
Regulations Division have been published by the Commission.
These opinions have been concerned primarily with the form in
which information is to be given in the prospectus. They are designed to be the first of a series interpreting the requirements of the
Commission as to the mode of furnishing information and are intended
to assist registrants in making a prospectus a concise and legible presentation of the material facts of the particular offering.

THIRD ANNUAL REPORT
Statistics of Securities Registered

Under the Securities Act

At the beginning of the fiscal year, there were 2,314 registration
statements on file. Of these, 1,757 were effective, 129 were under stop
or refusal order, 294 had been withdrawn, and 134 were under examination or held pending the receipt of amendments.
During the period of July 1, 1936 to June 30, 1937, inclusive, 967
additional registration statements were filed. There were 887 registration statements which became effective during this period (of
which all but 17 were fully effective); a total of 2,571 statements were
effective at the end of the period, 73 of those effective at the beginning
of the period or during the period either having been withdrawn or
placed under stop order.
The net number of registration statements withdrawn increased by
128, to a total of 422 on June 30, 1937. The net number of stop or
refusal orders increased during the period by 14, a total of 143 of such
orders being in effect on June 30, 1937. As of June 30, 1937, there
were 145 registration statements in the process of examination or
awaiting amendments.
Appendix III contains a list of the registration statements as to
which stop orders, consent refusal orders, and withdrawal orders were
issued during the year.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1937, new securities with
estimated gross proceeds of $4,686,296,000 became fully effective.
This total compares with $4,677,302,000 effectively registered in the
year ended June 30, 1936, $948,471,000 during the year ended June
30, 1935, and $759,406,000 from July 27, 1933, when the first statement became effective, to June 30, 1934.
In addition to these new issues, there were effectively registered,
during the year ended June 30, 1937, $164,462,000 of voting trust
certificates, certificates of deposit and securities proposed to be
offered in exchange for registrants' or predecessors' securities.
This
amount compares with $157,747,000 of similar securities registered
during the previous fiscal year.
Of the $4,686,296,000 of new securities effectively registered during
the past fiscal year, about $298,515,000 were registered for reserve
against the conversion of other securities, so that a total of $4,387,781,000 was available for present or future sale-for cash or other considerations for the accounts of the registrants or other persons. While
the total of all new securities registered during the year ended June 30,
1937, was higher than for any fiscal year under the Securities Act, the
total of securities other than amounts reserved for conversion
amounted to $4,387,781,000 or approximately $45,000,000 less than
the comparable figure for the year ended June 30, 1936.
In addition to the securities registered for reserve against conversion, there were other securities which were registered but not in21123-37-2

COMMISSION

tended to be immediately offered for sale for cash for the benefit of the
registrants.
Approximately $374,395,000 of securities were registered
during the past fiscal year "for the account of others". These represented securities already issued by the registrants and outstanding
with security-holders at the time of registration; for the most part
their registration was undertaken in connection with proposed resale
to the general public, no part of the proceeds to accrue to the registrants. In addition, a total of $245,587,000 of securities was proposed to be issued in exchange for other securities-$120,843,000 to
retire outstanding preferred stock issues by replacement, $11,813,000
to payoff indebtedness through issuance of other securities, and
$112,931,000 for various other purposes. Finally, $103,243,000 were
reserved against the exercise of options and warrants, $23,099,000
were reserved for other subsequent issuance and $8,372,000 were
intended to be issued for various assets, claims, and selling commissions. Thus, including the securities reserved against conversion, a
total of $1,053,210,000 of new securities effectively registered during
the fiscal year, or 22.5% of total registrations, was intended for purposes other than immediate cash sale for the account of the-registrants .
.After deducting this amount, registered securities with estimated
gross proceeds of $3,633,086,000 remained available for cash offering
for the account of the registrants.
Of these securities all but 3.1 %
represented issues of already established enterprises. In connection
with the sale of these securities the registrants estimated that they
, would incur $140,963,0008 of expense; $114,950,0008 (3.2% of estimated gross proceeds) for .commissions and discounts to underwriters and agents, and $26,013,000 (0.7% of estimated gross proceeds) for other expenses in connection with flotation and" issuance.
The registrants estimated that upon the sale of their securities as
contemplated in their registration statements and after 'payment of
these expenses, they would retain as net cash proceeds $3,492,123,000.
A comparison of the uses to which the registrants during the past
fiscal year proposed to apply their net proceeds with the intentions
of the registrants during the preceding fiscal period, indicates the
declining importance of repayment of Indebtedness and the increasing
significance of the needs for additional working capital and expanded
plant and equipment. Nevertheless, the main use proposed to be
made of these cash funds still was the repayment of indebtedness.
The table below shows the proposed employment of the net cash
proceeds as indicated by the registrants of the year ended June 30,
1937, and of the preceding period .

The registration statements disclosed that $3,021,647,000, or 83.1 %,
of the $3,633,086,000 of securities proposed for cash offering for the
account of registrants were to be offered to the public generally,
$456,603,000, or 12.6%, to the registrants' security-holders and
$154,836,000, or 4.3%, to special persons. About $2,839,375,000, or
78.2%, of the securities were underwritten while $411,990,000, or
11.3%, were to be offered by the registrants themselves, and
$381,721,000, or 10.5%, were to be offered by various selling agents.
The last fiscal year witnessed an increase in the number of offerings
by registrants to their own security-holders. Such offerings were
chiefly effected through the issuance of rights to stockholders to
purchase common shares at a price below the market. More than
65% of the, securities offered to security-holders was common stock,
and slightly more than 48% of the common stock registered for cash
sale was offered to the registrants' own security-holders.
Of the total of $4,387,781;000 of securities effectively registered
(after, deducting amounts reserved against conversion) $1,091,816,000,
or 24.9%, were for common stock issues; $569,371,000, or 13.0%,
were for preferred stock issues; $247,958,000, or 5.6%, were for
certificates of participation, beneficial interest, and warrants; $1,552,871,000, or 35.4%, were for secured bonds; $921,186,000, or 21.0%,
were for debentures, and $4,579,000, or 0.1 %, were for short term
notes. Interest bearing obligations, then, totaled 56.5%, stock
issues 37.9%, and other types of securities 5.6%.
Approximately $1,249,333,000, or 28.5%, of the registrations (after
deducting amounts reserved against conversion) were for manufacturing companies; $1,175,468,000, or 26.8%, were for the electric light
and power, gas and water utility companies; $771,888,000, or 17.6%,
were for financial and investment companies; $557,477,000, or 12.7%,
were for transportation and communication companies (exclusive of

common carriers exempt under the Securities Act of 1933); -$276,058,000, or 6.3%, for merchandising companies; $61,068,000, or 1.4%,
were for companies in the extractive industries; and $296,489,000, or
6.7%, were for all other registrants including foreign governments.
Detailed statistical tables showing number of issues, type of security,
classification of issuers, gross proceeds, cost of distribution and selling,
channels of distribution, and proposed use of funds for the securities
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission are contained
in Appendix V. In interpreting the tables, as well as the summary
figures quoted above, it should be kept in mind that these statistics
are based solely on the registration statements as filed by the registrants with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All data,therefore, refer to registrants' intentions and estimates as they appear
in the registration statements on the effective dates. They thus
represent, in reality, statistics of intentions to sell securities rather
than statistics of actual sales of securities.
The statute does not provide for the ~ccumulation of data showing
the extent to which securities registered have actually been sold by
the registrant.
Although the Commission has endeavored to obtain
such data, it does not yet have exact knowledge upon this subject.
However, in cases where securities are underwritten by responsible
banking houses, it is certain that the issuing corporation has received
the stipulated sales price. As indicated above, of the $3,633,086,000
of new securities proposed to be offered for cash about $2,839,375,000,
or 78.2%, were intended to be sold to underwriters and may, therefore, be assumed to have netted the issuing corporations the contemplated amount of funds.
For the purpose of ascertaining the proportion of registered
securities not sold to underwriters which were actually disposed of
by registrants through contracts with selling agents or their own
facilities, follow-up questionnaires were sent to registrants, other
than investment companies, who have registered on Form A-I and
whose registrations had become effective before April 30, 1936.
Approximately 435 replies, inclusive of the 270 replies mentioned in
the annual report of 1936, were received up to June 30, 1937. From
these replies it appeared that only about 20% of the total estimated
gross proceeds of the securities registered by this group of registrants
which consists almost entirely of unseasoned companies disposing of
their securities without the aid of underwriters, has actually been
sold. About one third of the registrants reported no sales whatever
of registered securities, while the remaining registrants reported sales
of slightly more than one fourth of the amount registered.

Statistics of Private Pfaeings

Registered securities, of course, constitute only a part of all new
securities offered for sale to investors in the United States. The
Commission has no authoritative knowledge of the offerings of
securities exempt under the Securities Act of 1933.9 However, in
view of the importance of private placings and of their affinity to
certain types of registered offerings the Commission is keeping So
record of unregistered private placings based on information published in the financial press and supplemented by short questionnaires
sent to the issuers of securities reported as privately placed.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1937, 28 unregistered private
placings with total estimated gross proceeds of almost $296,000,000
came to the attention of the Commission comparing with 37 issues
with estimated gross proceeds of over $213,000,000 during the preceding fiscal year. The proceeds of these privately placed issues
were equivalent to approximately 8% of the securities effectively
registered for cash offering with the Commission during the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1937, comparing with the corresponding ratio
of approximately 5% during the preceding fiscal year. Industrial
corporations sold slightly over one half of the reported private placings,
public utilities accounting for about 80% of the rest. Repayment of
indebtedness continued the chief purpose for which the proceeds of
the securities placed privately were to be used but the proportion to
total proceeds declined to 58% compared with 85% during the fiscal
year ended .-rune 30, 1936. The amounts to be used for working
capital and plant and equipment rose to $119,000,000 compared with
slightly over $30,000,000 during the preceding year. Monthly data
on the type of securities, the classification of the issuers and the use
of proceeds of the privately placed securities on which the Commission has information are presented in Table 10 of Appendix V.
Securities placed privately according to the information supplied
by the issuer of the registration statements, but registered either on
issuance or later under the Securities Act of 1933, (such securities
are, of course, included in the statistics of the registered issues) were
very small during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1937, amounting to
less than $12,000,000 in 4 issues compared to $211,000,000 in 20
issues during the preceding fiscal year.
.
g The chief categories of exempt securities are: Securities Issued or guaranteed by the United States
Government; securities Issued by any State or by any political subdivision or any public instrumentality
-of any State; securities issued by any banking institution; securlnes of common or contract carriers the
issuance of which is subject to section 20 (8) of the Interstate Commerce Act; securities of a noncommerical
character Issued by eleemosynary institutions; secunties which are part of an issue sold only to residents
within 8 single Stste where the Issuer is incorporated by and doing business In such State; securities ex.

of the Commission's General Rules and Regulations under the Securi ...
ties Act of 1933, as amended, on July 1, 1936, the Commission established the Oil and Gas Unit. The functions of this Unit are to
examine all offering sheets and amendments thereto; to examine
prospectuses involving oil and gas issues filed pursuant to Rule 202
of the Commission's General Rules and Regulations; to assist in the
examination of and to furnish technical, engineering and valuation

Stock Exchange was granted an extension to April 1, 1938 within
which it might apply for reinstatement as a national securities
exchange. The application of the Denver Stock Exchange was
denied.
The Commission, during the year, revised its rules specifying the
manner in which registered and exempt exchanges should file amendments and supplements in order to keep their applications for registration or exemption up to date. These revised rules eliminate the
necessity for the filing of formal supplements containing certain
information regularly published by the exchanges and require the
submission to the Commission of annual financial statements for
each exchange and its affiliates.
The amendments and financial statements are examined for the
purpose of ascertaining compliance with the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and the Rules and Regulations of the Commission. During
the year, more than 250 amendments were filed.

REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES
Applications for the Registration of Securities on Exchanges

One of the main objectives of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 is to make available for the investor, reliable, current, and comprehensive information regarding the affairs of the company whose
securities are listed, or are to be listed, on a national securities
exchange. Certain information is also required to be furnished by
companies whose securities are listed, or are to. be listed, on exempt
exchanges.
A company which seeks to list its securities on national securities
exchanges may accomplish such listing by conforming to the requirements of the exchange to which it applies, and by :filing, on the appropriate form, an application for the registration of such securities with
the Commission and with the exchange on which the registration is
sought. For the purpose of the basic registration, several forms have
been adopted and each one provides for the submission of data of the
character called for in the Act and appropriate to the particular type
of issuer or security. These forms in general require non-financial
as well as financial information. Data is required concerning the
organization of the registrant and of the system of which it may be
an integral part, its capital structure, its authorized outstanding
funded debt, the debt structure of its subsidiaries, its authorized,
issued and outstanding capital stock, the amount of securities of
other corporations that it may have guaranteed, its position with
reference to outstanding warrants-and rights, an adequate description of the actual securities being registered, recent financing, control
and management, stock options, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, together with supporting schedules, the remuneration of
officers and directors, and other pertinent information.
The continuance of registration upon an exchange is conditioned
upon the filing of interim reports covering material changes occurring
from time to time, and the filing, within 120 days after the close of
the fiscal year of the registrant, of an annual report. These reports
are designed to bring up to date the information contained in the
applications for permanent registration of securities.
A detailed examination is made of each of these applications,
annual reports, and current reports for the purpose of determining
whether they contain full and adequate disclosure of the information
required by the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Deficiencies which are revealed by such examinations are
communicated to the registrant and amendments correcting such
deficiencies are required to be filed. Upon receipt, the correcting
amendments are examined in the same manner as the applications
and reports.

THIRD ANNUAL 'REPORT

.Applicationsfor 'the Withdrawal or Striking from Listing and Registration of
Securities on Exchanges

In accordance with the provisions of Section 12 (d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule JD2-(b) promulgated thereunder, the
Commission received 78 applications for withdrawal or striking from
listing of securities fully-listed and registered on exchanges. Public
hearings were held on these applications and 56 of them were granted.
The remaining 22 were pending as of June 30, 1937.
Pursuant to Rule _JD3 (a) of the Commission, 433 certifications
were received from national securities exchanges relative to the
withdrawal from listing and registration of maturing securities and
securities redeemed or retired.
Application for the Granting, Extension and Termination of Unlisted Trading
Privlleges on Exchanges.

The Commission, during the year, amended its rules governing
unlisted trading privileges on national securities exchanges pursuant
to Section 12 (f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
on May 27, 1936.10 These rules permit the continuation of unlisted
trading privileges in a security without further application to the
Commission if only minor changes have occurred in such security ~
such as changes in the title thereof, the interest rate, the par value,
the amount outstanding, etc. The exchanges are required to notify
the Commission in writing of any changes promptly after they have
knowledge thereof. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1937~
the Commission received 424 such notifications.
If more substantial changes are made in securities, an application
must be filed' by the exchange supporting the contention that the
altered security is substantially equivalent to the security admitted
to unlisted trading privileges. Before the altered security may be
traded on an exchange, the application must be approved by the
Commission. During the past year, 50 such applications were
received, of which 24 were granted and 26 were denied.
It may be interesting at this point to sum up the record of reduction in the total number of securities admitted to unlisted trading
privileges since October 1, 1934. The total number of securities
originally admitted to unlisted trading privileges, pursuant to Clause
1 of Section 12 (f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 amounted to:

initial series of forms for registration of securities on national securities exchanges, i. e., Form 22, For Issuers Reorganized in Insolvency
Proceedings or which have Succeeded to a Person in Insolvency Pro-ceedings; Form 23, For Successor Issuers; and Form 24, For Bank
Holding Companies.
A form (Form 8-C) has also been adopted to
facilitate the registration of securities on additional exchanges."
In
connection with the promulgation of these forms, previously existing
exemptions with respect to such issuers have in large part been
repealed.
, To the series of forms for annual reports, and as-companion forms
to the forms for registration previously adopted, the Commission has
added four annual report forms, i. e., Form 18-K, For Foreign Governments and Political Subdivisions Thereof; Form 19-K, For American Certificates Against Foreign Issuers and for the Underlying
Securities; Form 2o-K, For Securities other than Bonds of Foreign
Private Issuers ; and Form 21-K, For Bonds of Foreign Private
.Issuers.
To supplement the information required in the annual reports ana
to provide a mechanism for making important events known to investors with as little delay as possible,' a new form (Form 8-K) has
been 'adopted for reporting shortly' alter the close of each month
certain important events occurring during the month within which
the specified events occur. In addition, the' problem of obtaining
financial information more frequently than once each year is being
studied to determine whether a forin for quarterly reports of listed
companies should be adopted.
At the present time, there is in progress a complete revision of the
existing forms with a view to coordination of their requirements with
each other and with the requirements of forms' for registration under
the Seeurities Aet of 1933. It is anticipated that such revision will
result in the elimination of a number of the existing forms by combination into more general categories.

Statistics of Securities

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Registered

or Exempt from Registration

on Exchanges

The Commission is now engaged in the development of a new
program for the collection and analysis of significant data relating
to all phases of exchange trading. It is expected that the data
yielded by this new program will be both more comprehensive and
more significant than the data which have been accumulated to date.
Further reference to this new program will be made below.
Certain interesting data concerning securities registered or exempt
from registration upon exchanges follow;
Sales of securities on registered exchanges for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1937, amounted to $28,052,500,834, increasing 9.1 per cent
over sales in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1936. Stock sales totalled
$24,581,956,285, a figure 11.8 per cent higher than that of the preceding
year, and bond sales were valued at $3,470,144,794, declining 6.5 per
cent from the comparable figure in the preceding year.
Shares of stock sold totalled 945,164,509, 1.8 per cent less than the
total a year earlier, while the principal amount of bond sales declined
9.9 per cent to $4,307,104,255.
These figures indicate that the average price per share of stock sold
and the average price per hundred dollars of principal amount of
bonds sold both increased.
The two leading New York exchanges accounted for 95.8 %
of sales on all registered exchanges; 95.3 per cent of stock sales and
99.8 per cent of bond sales.
The Commission, in addition to continuing its regular monthly
releases on the value and volume of trading on securities exchanges,
has instituted, in the past year, several series of releases making available to the public for the first time regular data on the trading of
various groups on the two leading N ew York exchanges.
In accordance with the program embodied in its report to Congress
on the Feasibility and Advisability of the Complete Segregation of the
Functions of Broker and Dealer, the Commission commenced in
October 1936 to issue weekly releases showing daily the purchases
and sales for their own account of several groups of members on the
N ew York Stock Exchange and the New York Curb Exchange. A
summary of these releases, with corrections as received from the
exchanges, was made available in June 1937 at the public reference
rooms of the Commission's Washington office and principal regional
offices. Through the weekly releases and the annual summary,
there is now available to the public a continuous record of members'
trading on the N ew York Stock Exchange and the New York Curb
Exchange since March 1936.
In June 1937, the Commission commenced to release to the public
figures on odd-lot trading. There is made available daily at the '
Washington office figures showing for the second day preceding that

THIRD ANNUAL REPORT

21

of the release the number of shares purchased and the number of shares
sold in odd-lots by odd-lot dealers and specialists on the New York
Stock Exchange, together with the number of orders involved in such
trades. Weekly summaries of these figures, as corrected by more
complete reports from the odd-lot dealers and expanded to include the
value of daily purchases and sales in odd-lots, are publicly distributed
in release form.
These two series enable the investing public to follow in some
detail and with reasonable dispatch the extent and the direction of two
important sections of total trading on the two largest stock exchanges;
purchases and sales by members of the exchanges and transactions in
small amounts (i. e., in amounts of less than full lots) which may be
assumed to reflect purchases and sales by smaller traders.
During
the six-month period ending June 30,1937, member trading has represented about 21% and odd-lot trading about 12% of total exchange
trading (i. e., total purchases and sales both in round lots and oddlots). The .two new series, therefore, provide information concerning
one third of the total stock exchange trading.
In addition to statistical information on the securities markets
made available through public releases, the Commission has regularly
collected from a number of member houses of the N ew York Stock
Exchange and the New York Curb Exchange data on margin accounts,
commission orders received and executed, orders on specialists' books
and orders executed for account of foreign customers.
Most of these
series are still in an experimental stage, but have provided the Commission with current information valuable in its administration of the
Securities Exchange Act. The Commission has been gratified by the
ready cooperation of the member houses in furnishing the basic
material for these statistics.
During the year, the Commission instituted proceedings to determine whether to suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months
or to withdraw the registration of securities of seven companies
listed on national securities exchanges. In general, these proceedings were based upon the failure of the registrants to conform to the
requirements of certain sections of the Act, and the Rules and Regulations thereunder.
At the close of the fiscal year, four of these
proceedings had been terminated, two by entry of an order by the
Commission directing the withdrawal of the securities registered on
such national securities exchange, and two by dismissing the proceedings in view of the satisfactory fulfillment of the requirements by the
registrant company, and tbree were pending.
Annual reports on Forms 18-K, 19-K, 2o-K, and 21-K are due to
be filed on <or before September 30, 1937 by 155 foreign issuers having securities registered on a national securities exchange. As the
securities- of such issuers -
were exempt from registration until May

REGISTRATION OF PUBLIC U T I L I ~ YHOLDING COMPANIES

Registration of a public utility holding company, pursuant to the
provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, i s
accomplished by filing with the Commission a notification of registration and, later, a registration statement.
During the fiscal year, the Cornmiasion adopted a permanent form
for notification of registration (Form U5A) and a form for the registration statement (Form U5B). In requiring the completion of statements on this latter form (Form U5B), the Commission made effective
one of the vital provisions of the law.
Congress, by incorporating in the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 the provisions of Sections 4 and 5, realized that the informatory process was fundamental to the positive powers of regulation established in other parts of the Act. Sections 4 and 5 require
that interstate utility holding company systems disclose complete
financial and operating information as well as management interests,
Since many abuses enumerated in Section 1 of the Act have sprung
from the inaccessibility and unavailability of information about t h e
holding company, its interests and activities, the publicity thus

28

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

req uired will prove a great deterrent of future financial chicanery and
abuse .
.Although the registration provisions were established as the means
whereby other parts of the law were-made effective;theywere designed
to serve a necessary purpose in and by themselves, independent of
other parts of the .Act. They represent an important supplement to
the regulations in the Securities .Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in providing protection, through disclosure, to
investors, consumers, and the general public.
To provide full information regarding interstate holding' company
systems a comprehensive form was required. Perhaps the most essential requirement contained in Form U5B is .that the registrant submit,
as part of the exhibits, consolidating balance sheet, income and surplus statements.
The consolidating type of statement reveals the
financial interrelationships within a given system since it requires
that the individual statements of the registrant and each subsidiarywhich is customarily consolidated shall be set forth separately, with
explanations of the intercompany eliminations made by the accountants in compiling the consolidated statement.
In addition to these consolidating statements which in themselves
provide a wealth of important financial data not generally available
in the past, certain pertinent information is required, relating to specific subjects of which the following are representapive: ,(except where
noted, the various required data pertaining to these general subjects
must be furnished for both the registrant and its subsidiary companies)
,(I) general character of business; (2) analysis 'of balance sheet
accounts including funded debt, capital stock and property; (3) revaluations of property; (4) intercompany holdings of securities and
evidences of indebtedness issued by companies Within the system;
(5) investments in outside holding companies and public utility 'com-'
panies; (6) interstate sales of 'electric energy and gas; '(7) important'
leases; (8) important financing during the past five years; '(9) distribution of capital stock of the registrant; (10) officers' and directors'
other business affiliations, including connections with financial institutions; (11) loans to officers and directors; (12) interests of officers and
directors in contracts to which the registrant or subsidiaries are
parties; (13) compensation to officers, 'directors and :highly-paid
employees; (14) important sales, service, construction ailE): other'
contracts; and (15) litigation relating to 'franchises,' orders of a-State
Commission or other govemmentel ' agency and, 'other' 'important
matters.
;,.'!
As exhibits, in addition to the consolidating statements 'referred' to'
. above, certain additional material is required. These include, among
other things, maps showing the areas in which electric and gas service
are furnished and maps showing the nature and location of various
1

. THIRD ANNUAL REPORT

types of electric and gas property, such as generating plants, transmission systems, points of interconnection with all other systems, and
aimilar or related material.
The illumination of the facts required by Form U5B should be a
potent influence in eradicating serious abuses which exist in some
systems, and in dispelling suspicions which may unjustly be prevalent
regarding the activities in other systems.
Upon filing with the Commission, the registration statements are
thoroughly examined for the purpose of determining compliance with
the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
When the examination discloses the existence of deficiencies, the registrant is so advised, Deficiencies in the statements may be corrected
by the registrant filing the necessary amendments. Amendments
filed with the Commission are also examined.
Although it is difficult to accurately determine the total number of
holding companies subject to regulation under the Act, or the volume
of assets which they control, it is estimated that at the present time
somewhat less than 45% of the total number of companies subject to
the Act are registered. However, the assets controlled by these
registered companies probably constitute not more than 30% of the
total assets of the companies subject to the Act.
As of June 30, 1936, there were sixty-five holding companies registered under the Act. During the year ended June 30, 1937, there
occurred a net increase of twenty-one companies, bringing the total
number of registered holding companies to eighty-six. Included in
the companies which registered during the last fiscal year were such
large systems as The North American Company, American Water
Works and Electric Company, Inc., and American Light and Traction
Company.
The eighty-six holding companies which were registered at June 30,
1937, comprise the following:
American Light & Traction Company
American Public Service Company
American Utilities Service Corporation
American Water Works and Electric Company, Inc.
Arkansas-Missouri Power Company

EXEMPTIONS FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE PUBLIC UTILITY
HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935

Applications for exemptions 'from registration requirements under
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 are filed with the
Commission pursuant to specific sections of the Act which exempt by
rule or order of the Commission holding companies of certain specified
types and holding companies which meet certain specified requirements.
The requirements as to the various kinds of applications for exemption under Sections 2 and 3 of the Act are extremely flexible. The
Commission has adopted rules specifying the minimum information
which was thought relevant in the ordinary situation, but has suggested that each applicant omit irrelevant data and furnish any additional information which is pertinent to the particular case, reserving
the right on the part of the Commission to call for any other data that
might be necessary.
As of June 30, 1937, 399 applications for exemption of holding companies and for orders declaring companies not to be holding companies
or declaring companies not to be electric or gas utilities had been
received. Twenty-four of these applications were received during the
past year. Of these 399 applications, there were 87 granted exemption,
172 withdrawals, and 140 pending at the close of the fiscal year.
RULES, REGULATIONS, AND FORMS UNDER THE PUBLIC UTILITY
HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935

During the year ended June 30,1937, the Commission adopted nine
new rules, while sixteen rules were amended to a greater or lesser
degree. In addition to adopting four new forms, the Commission also
adopted the "Uniform System of Accounts for Public Utility Holding
Companies" .

SECURITIES

AND EX<mANGE

COMMISSION

The new rules adopted during the year include the following:
Rule 3B-2 exempts public utility companies operating
within the United States from duties and obligations as holding
companies under the Act if such companies would be considered
holding companies under the Act solely because of a foreign
public-utility
subsidiary company operating in Mexico or
Canada.
Rule 3D-6 exempts from the provisions of Section 6 (a) the
issue of initial shares of a company in process of organization,
if all such shares having a par, stated, or declared value not
exceeding $10,000 are acquired for cash by a single company.
Rule 5A-3 prescribes the use of Form U5A for notification
of registration.
Rule 5B-l prescribes the use of Form U5B for registration
statements.
.
Rule 6B-l prescribes the-use of Form U6B-l for applications for exemption from Section 6 (a) of the issue and sale of
securities, the proceeds from which are to be used to finance
the business of the applicant and which have been expressly
authorized by the State commission of the State in which the
applicant is organized and doing business.
Rule 12-0-2 provides that no dividend shall be declared or
paid out of capital or unearned surplus, except upon application to and approval by order of the Commission.
Rule 13-60 requires the filing of annual reports by mutual
and subsidiary service companies on Form U-13-60.
Rule 15-10 prescribes the use of the Uniform System of
Accounts for Public Utility Holding Companies which do not
own and operate public utility or other property.
Rule 170-12 grants to newly registered holding companies and their subsidiary companies exemption until September 1, 1937, from the provisions of Section 17 (c), with reference
to :financial connections of directors and officers, which existed
on August 26, 1936.
Of the many amendments to existing rules adopted during the year,
the most far-reaching and important were to Rule 90-3, dealing with
exemptions from the requirement to obtain approval of the Commission as to certain acquisitions of securities. Certain new exemptions were included, namely, the acquisition of securities which have
been issued in accordance with Rule 3D-6 and those which have been
acquired in the exercise of preemptive rights. In this connection,
Rule 14-1, providing for quarterly reports to the Commission on such
acquisitions, redemptions and retirements of securities, was amended

THIRD

ANNUAL REPORT

to eliminate the necessity for filing duplicate reports under certain
circumstances.
Other amendments included amendments to Rule 3, regarding
applications for exemption under Sections 2 or 3 of the A:ct; Rule
9A2-2, permitting brokers, dealers, or underwriters to acquire securities of a public-utility company in certain circumstances; Rule 13-3,
exempting newly registered holding companies from the provisions of
Section 13 for a period of thirty days; Rule 170-3, exempting from
the provisions of Section 17 (c) officers or directors of financial institutions who are acting as directors of a registered holding company
or subsidiary on express approval by a Federal Court.
Forms have been promulgated as follows:
(1) Form U5A-Notification
of Registration pursuant to
Section 5 (a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935.
(2) Form U5B-Registra.tion Statement, pursuant to Section 5 (b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
(3) Form U6B-I-Application
by a subsidiary of a registered
holding company, pursuant to Section 6 (b) of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, for exemption of
securities expressly authorized by a State commission.
(4) Form U-13-60-Annual
Report of Mutual and Subsidiary Service Companies, pursuant to Section 13 of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
(5) The Uniform System of Accounts for Public Utility
Holding Companies, prescribing a system of accounts, pursuant to Section 15 of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935.
Each form has presented a separate problem in the light of the
particular provisions of the Act involved and the character of the
information required. The Commission has attempted to make the
forms simple, readily understandable and not unnecessarily burdensome to the industry, yet at the same time, comprehensive enough to
elicit the requisite information.
UNIFORM SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTS FOR PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANIES

Pursuant to Section 15 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, the Commission, on August 8,'1936, adopted the "Uniform
System of Accounts for Public Utility Holding Companies". This
system became effective January 1, 19.37,as to those registered holding companies for which the system was designed.
This system of accounts is applicable to public utility holding
companies which derive practically all their income from dividends

34

Am)

COMMISSION

and interest on investments in other companies. It was not designed
to meet fully the requirements of those holding companies which
derive a portion of their income from public utility or other physical
property of similar character directly owned and operated by them.
It was the aim of the Commission to provide a system of accounts
which would not impose burdensome requirements upon the companies, but sufficiently comprehensive to provide information essential in the administration of the Act. In formulating the system,
certain matters had to be dealt witll'respecting which diverse accounting practices were being followed. It .is not anticipated, however, that the companies will.be faced with any serious problem in
conforming their accounting. practices to the uniform methods
prescribed by the system.
Financial data for public utility holding companies, thus compiled
for the :first time on a uniform basis, will be of material assistance to
investors, as well as to this Commission and to State regulatory commissions in protecting the interests of consumers and investors.
In the preparation of this .system of accounts, the Commission
invited the cooperation of .accounting officers of public utility holding
companies and of the American Institute of Accountants. Numerous
conferences were held with representatives of the foregoing, at which
extended discussions were. had upon various matters involved.
Upon completion of a tentative draft of the system, copies were
distributed to holding companies and others inviting comments,
suggestions and criticism in connection therewith. The replies
received in response to this invitation were given careful consideration,
and as a result, a number of modifications, amendments, and changes
suggested were embodied in the system as finally adopted.
ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES BY REGISTERED HOLDING COMPANIES

One of the important provisions of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 relates to control over the issuance of securities.
During the fiscal year just ended, the Commission received 95 applications and declarations under Sections 6 (b) and 7 relating to the issuance of securities by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries. Prior 'to July 1, 1936,24 applications and declarations had
been received, making a total of 119 received since the Act became
effective. Of these, 87 have been approved, 11 withdrawn, and the
balance of 21 were still pending on June 30, 1937.
The eighty-seven applications and declarations which have been
approved by the Commission related to the issuance of over $750,000,000 H of securities, while the 11 withdrawals covered securities
aggregating almost $90,000,000. Applications and declarations
pending on June 30, 1937 related to securities amounting to over

were approved under Sec. 7 and the balance of $260.000.000under

TRlRD A W L REPORT

$225,000,000. Thus the issuance of well over $1,000,000,000 of
securities has been covered by applications and declarations filed with
the Commission under this Act.
A vcry large proportion of the approved security issues were those
of subsidiary operating companies of registered holding companies
which were issued in refinancing outstanding securities with securities
having smaller fixed charges. Representatives of companies appearing in these cases have maintsjned before the Commission that the
resultant savings in the course of time should materially benefit consumers of these companies. Many of these issues had been authorized
previously by State commissions. I n certain instances, the Commission made suggestions which were adopted by the local commissions, which it is hoped resulted in improved security issues. Jn
certain other instances where, because of the lack of local commission
control, the initial responsibility lay with this Commission, it has
likewise endeavored to improve the character of securities which were
issued.
ACQUISITION OF SECURITIES, UTILITY ASSETS AND OTHER INTERESTS BY REGISTERED HOLDING COMPANIES OR THEIR SUBSIDIARIES

The Cornmiasion received, during the fiscal year ended June 30.
1937, 56 applications requesting approval of the acquisition of securities and assets under Section 10 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Since the effective date of the Act, 76 such applioations had beenreceived. Of these 76 applications, 53 were approved, g
were withdrawn or dismissed, and 15 were pending on June 30,1937.

The preponderance of these applications related to the acquisition

During the past year, 25 reports on Form U-12 (i)-l were :filed
with the Commission pursuant to Section 12 (i) of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935. This section of the Act requires any
person employed or retained by any registered holding company, or
by any subsidiary company thereof, who presents, advocates, or
opposes any matter affecting any registered holding company or any
subsidiary company thereof before the Congress, or any member or
committee of Congress, or before the Securities and p;xchange Commission or the Federal Power Commission or any member, officer,
-or employee of either such Commission, to :file a statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The information required in
"this statement covers the subject matter in respect of which. a person
is retained or employed, the nature and character of his retainer or
employment, and the amount of compensation received or to be
received, directly or indirectly, in connection therewith.
CONTROL OF SERVICE COMPANIES

Following the adoption on May 12, 1936 of a "Uniform System of
Accounts For Mutual Service Companies and Subsidiary Service
Companies", the Commission, during the year, adopted Form U-13-60
as the form of annual report to be submitted to the Commission by
such companies.
The principal requirements of the report embrace the following:
a, balance sheet statement as of the close of the year with supporting
schedules; a statement of revenues and expenses classified in accordance with the prescribed accounts, together with detailed' analyses
of the more important classes; and various schedules to show 'the
allocations made of charges for service, including a schedule of the
amount of service charges billed to associated companies or other
customers.
The purpose of this report is to secure information with respect to
the financial condition of service companies and the charges made
by them to associate companies and others in the performance of
service, sales, or construction contracts. ;.s a result of the information obtained, it is expected that the Commission will be in a position
to adequately safeguard the interests of consumers and investors with
respect to the operations of mutual service companies and subsidiary
service companies without placing any undue burden on any such
company with respect to the necessity of disclosing in full its methods
and means of operations.
.
Furthermore, under the uniform system of accounts for service
companies, detailed information with reference to the costs of furnishing services are made available for the first time to local regulatory

A report on Form U-13-60 covering the calendar year must be
filed by each mutual service company or subsidiary service company
on or before the first day of April, following the close of the year for
which the report is made. The form of this annual report is based
upon the requirements of the uniform system of accounts for such
service companies. As this system of accounts became effective
August 1, 1936, the first of the annual reports covered the five months
period ended December 31, 1936.
During the past year, 3 applications were filed for approval of
mutual service companies and 13 applications were filed for approval
of subsidiary service companies. .All of the applications in the first.
category have been approved, while in the second group 11 have been
approved, one withdrawn, and one was pending on June 30,1937.
VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE WITH THE PURPOSES,OF SECTION 11 OF
THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935 BY REGISTERED HOLDING COMPANIES AND SUBSIDIARIES

Since the passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, a number of applications have been received and granted by
the Commission, which involved simplification of corporate structures
and indicated the desire of the applicant to comply with the provisions
embodied in Section 11 of the Act.
Transformation or Holding Companies Into Operating Companies by Acquisitioll
of the Utility Assets of Subsidiaries

There have been two outstanding examples of the type of simplification in which registered holding companies acquired the utility
assets of their operating subsidiaries and thereby became entitled to
the exemption provided for under Section 5 (d).
The Neveda-Oalifornia Electric Corporation, a Delaware corporation, 'fermerly ()'W'D.edthree electric utility operating companies,
namely, . ,
The Nevada-California Power Company, a Wyoming corporation
The Southern Sierras Power Company, a. Wyoming corporation
Yuma Utilities Company, an Arizona corporation

All the outstanding securities of these three utility subsidiary
companies were owned by The N evada-Oalifornia Electric Corporation. The properties of such subsidiaries constituted
and were
operated as a single interconnected system for the generation, transmission and distribution of electric energy in the States of California,
Nevada and Arizona.
.
On .April 16, 1936, the Commission approved the acquisition by
The Nevada-California Electric Corporation of all the assets of the
subsidiary companies above named. Upon the acquisition of such

28

assets, The Nevada-California
Electric Corporation surrendered all .
their outstanding securities of each of the subsidiary companies for
cancellation and assumed their other obligations and liabilities .
.As a result of the foregoing transection, The Nevada-California
Electric Corporation ceased to be a. holding. company and an order,
to that effect was issued by the Commission pursuant to Section 5 (d)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, on December
10,1936.
A further simplification of the corporate structure of The.NevadaCalifornia Electric Corporation was achieved by its acquisition Of the
properties of two of its non-utility subsidiaries, in exchange for which
it surrendered all the outstanding securities of such subsidiaries.
This transaction was likewise approved by 1;he Commission, pursuant.
to Section 9 (a) of the Act.

On March 13, 1936, the Commission issued an order pursuant .to
Section 9 (a) of the Act, approving the acquisition by the MontanaDakota Utilities Oo., a Delaware corporation, which was both 'a;

The Commission had occasion to approve two applications which
involved the exchange by two holding company systems of minority
interests in a group of operating companies for control of two utility
companies. The purpose of these transactions was the ultimate
elimination of, a number of subsidiary holding .companies and the
creation of an integrated public utility system.
On March 19, 1937, the Commission, pursuant to Section 9 (a) of
the Act, approved the acquisition -by Massachusetts Utilities Asso-.
ciates of the outstanding minority interests.in 16 of its existing subsidiary companies from New England. Gas and Electric.Association,
in exchange for securities of Plymouth. County Electric Company
(representing 9~.73% of voting control) and 'of Plymouth 'Gas Light
'
Company (representing 84.04%. o~.the V:2tWgcontrol);
Massachusetts Utilities 'Associates, a subsidiary company of New
England Power Association, both of which are registered holding
companies, is a Massachusetts voluntary association. Massachusetts
Utilities Associates has four subsidiary holding companies, and controls, directly or indirectly, 29 public utility. companies, all of which
operate in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
The electric properties of the subsidiaries of Massachusetts UtilitiesAssociates, in which New England Gas and Electric Association
owned a minority interest, together with other' electric properties
controlled by Massachusetts Utilities Associates and New England
Power Association, form an interconnected system which serves
generally contiguous areas. .Two gas utility companies' which were
included in the above mentioned 16 companies likewise operate in the'
area served by subsidiaries of the' New England Power Association.
The acquisition of the minority interests in these operating companies will facilitate the ultimate elimination of four subsidiary
holding companies of Massachusetts Utilities Associates, and,' therefore, result in the simplification of the corporate structure of the NewEngland Power Association system.

Simplification of Corporate Structure of Holding Company Systems by Merger of
Subsidiaries Operating in the Same Area

There is one outstanding example of the type of transaction by
which the corporate structure of a holding company system was
simplified through a merger of a number of subsidiary companies
into one operating company.
In orders dated May 24, May 27 and June 25,1937, the Commission
approved certain declarations and applications as a result of which
five subsidiary companies of the Union Electric Light and Power Company (Missouri) were reorganized and merged into one company whose
name was changed to Union Electric Company of Illinois. These
five companies, all Illinois corporations, were as follows:
East St. Louis Light & Power Co.-Surviving company
Union Electric Light and Power Company of Dlinois
Alton Light & Power Co.
Alton Gas Company
Power Operating Company

The above companies are public utility companies operating in and
around Alton and East St. Louis, Illinois, Power Operating Company
owned no properties of its own, but leased its power generating facilities
from Union Electric Lig4~.l!:¥d Power Company of Illinois and sold
electric energy at wholesale to Union Electric Light and Power Company (Missouri), to East St. Louis Light and Power Company and to
Illinois-Iowa Power Corporation.
The parent company of the :five merged companies was Union Electric Light and Power Company (Missouri), a subsidiary of the North
American Edison Company, which in turn is a subsidiary of the
North American Company, both registered holding companies.
Four of the five merged companies had securities outstanding with
the public. Union Electric Light and Power Company (Missouri)
acquired all the common stock and the :first mortgage bonds of the
new company so that only two small issues of underlying non-callable
bonds remain outstanding in the hands of the public. The :first mortgage- bonds of Union Electric Company of Illinois were pledged under
a new large issue of first mortgage and collateral trust bonds of Union
Electric Light and Power Company (Missouri).
The result of these transactions, therefore, was the reduction of the
number of subsidiaries in the North American Company system by
four and a very substantial simplification in the capital structure of
its Missouri and Illinois subsidiaries.

COMMISSION REPORTS ON REORGANIZATION PLANS

Section 11 (g) of the .Act requires the Commission to make reportson plans of reorganization of registered holding companies or their
subsidiaries. .Any person soliciting proxies or other authorizations in
connection with a plan must accompany or precede such solicitation
with a copy of the Commission's report. This section is applicable
not only to court reorganization proceedings, but to readjustment
plans affecting stockholders alone and consummated through their
vote. Two large companies whose securities are widely held, have
carried through stock readjustment plans and have obtained and submitted to their security holders reports of the Commission in connection with such plans.
One of the companies which carried through such a stock readjustment plan is Illinois Power & Light Corporation, all of whose common
stock was held by its parent, North .American Company. The company also had outstanding a large amount of publicly held preferred
stock on which there were substantial aeenmuletions of unpaid
dividends. .A plan was proposed to the preferred stockholders by
the company and it may fairly be assumed that it represented the
wishes of the parent company which was the sole owner of the common
stock. The plan offered to preferred stockholders 60% of the common
stock equity in return for a reduction in the dividend rate on the
preferred stock and a funding of accumulated dividends into dividend
arrears certificates. The Commission's report attempted to make
clear to preferred stockholders the fact that the interest of the management proposing the plan was necessarily adverse to theirs and to set
forth the considerations which would be relevant to appraise the fairness of the proposal made to them by the management. The application was filed with the Commission on March 1, 1937 and the plan was
formally approved by the requisite vote of the company's stockholders on .April 30, 1937.
The other plan presented to the Commission was that of the International Paper & Power Company, which presented questions on which
there was a division of opinion on the part of the Commission, both as.
to its jurisdiction in the matter and as to the merits of the plan.
The division of opinion as to jurisdiction arose out of the circumstance that the company had not registered but was claiming the.
status of temporary exemption pending disposition by the Commission
of an application for exemption under Section 3. It was not considered feasible to dispose of the exemption application immediately.'
The company desired, however, without delay to propose to its stockholders a plan calling for reclassification of its outstanding stock into

21123-37--4

COMMISSION

new securities, including preferred stock, convertible into common,
and option warrants to purchase common stock. The company
wished to avoid the risk of being unable to fulfill its commitments
with respect to future issues of common stock in the event of termination of its existing status as to exemption prior to conversion of all
the preferred stock and exercise of all the purchase warrants and
applied for an order which would .have the effect of exempting such
future issues.'
. The application also submitted all information which would have
been required from a registered company and requested a report on
the plan in the manner provided in Section 11 (g).
The Commission rendered an opinion holding that it had jurisdiction and at the same time made. the report on the plan. One Commissioner wrote a separate, concurring opinion agreeing that the
Commission should make a report on the plan but pointing out some
features of the.new securities which, in his opinion, were objectionable.
4nother Commissioner, in a dissenting opinion, denied the jurisdiction
of the Commission to make the report and in certain respects disagreed
with ;the report as made. No order was entered pursuant to the
request 'for exemption until after the Commission was advised of the
action taken by shareholders in voting to assent to the plan. Thereafter the Commission entered an order exempting from the .Act the
shares of common stock to be issued upon conversion of preferred
stock and exercise of warrants.
The Commissioner who had previously dissented did not participate in this and the Commissioner
who had previously written the separate concurring opinion dissented
because of the objections stated in such concurring opinion to some
features of the new securities. IS
GENERAL POLICIES WITH RESPECT TO ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC
UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT

_In spite of pending litigation which has resulted in the failure of a
substantial proportion of the holding companies to register under the
Act, a sufficient number of companies have registered to provide
exercise by the Commission of practically all important regulatory
functions. Under Section 11 of the Public Utility Holding Company
.Act of 1935, it will be the duty of the Commission as soon as practicable after January 1, 1938, to take steps looking toward the simplification and integration of public utility holding company systems.
The Commission has been preparing itself for the discharge of these
duties, both by extensive research into these problems and by actual
ezperienee in working with companies which' have voluntarily simplified their corporate structures.
II A oommon stockholder who had appeared before the Commlssion in opposition to the plan applied for
a rehearing on september 9, 1937. This application was denied, under date of October 12th. This stock.

, THIRD

A!.~NU.AL REPORT

43

The Commission continues to administer this law to the end that
abuses which brought about its passage will not recur. But in carrying
out this program it endeavors to impose no more than a minimum of
necessary restrictions on the industry.
The importance of active
cooperation by utility holding companies in expediting the changes
required under Section 11 and other sections of the law are clearly
understood, . and the Commission's general policy is designed to
develop a spirit of cooperation by encouraging registered holding
companies to initiate constructive policies wherever possible.
COMPLAINTS, INFORMAL AND FORMAL INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission receives thousands of letters annually complaining
of fraudulent or other illegal activities by persons engaged in the sale
of securities. While most of such letters are sent by members of the
general public, many are likewise sent by State Securities Commissions, State and 'Federal officials, and voluntary agencies such as
Better Business Bureaus and Chambers of Commerce.
H the information thus brought to the Commission's notice by
complaint, or information independently obtained by the Commission
from its own surveillance of trading activities and examination of
registration statements, indicated a substantial possibility of a violation of any of the Acts administered by the Commission, it was
handled as a complaint case, and the facts thereof were investigated
informally. During the past year 678 new complaint cases were set up.
H an informal investigation disclosed no violation of the legislation
administered by the Commission, or if sufficient facts did not appear
to warrant a belief that there had been a violation, the case was closed
at that point and no further action was taken by the Commission.
. H, as a result of the informal investigation, sufficient facts were
developed to warrant the institution of civil or criminal proceedings,
appropriate action along those lines was immediately taken. Where
enough facts were not elicited in the course of an informal investigation to. merit immediate court proceedings, but substantial basis
existed for the belief that the legislation administered by the Commission had in some respect been violated, a formal order for investi-.
gation was entered by the Commission pursuant to the powers conferred upon it under Sections 19 and 20 of the Securities Act of 1933
and. Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These
formal orders empowered designated officers of the Commission to
administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, take evidence,
and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence,
memoranda, or other records which were relevant or material to the
mquiry. H facts indicating a violation of any of the Acts administered by tb,e Commission were discovered in a formal investigation,
such action as was deemed most fitting to the circumstances was
thereafter undertaken.
But if the facts as developed in the formal

SECUIIITIES AND EXCHANGE COJlBlISSION

44

investigation indicated that no violation had talien place, the case
was closed.
During the past yesr formal orders were issued by the Commission
in 87 cases. At the close of the preceding fiscal year 185 such investigations were pending, resulting in a total of 272 such investigations
which were pursued by the Commission during the past yosr. Of the
272 cases in u.hich formal investigations were undertaken, 123 are
pending and 149 were concluded.

LITIGATION

UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1937, 86 civil proceedings
were initiated with respect to the enforcement of the Securities Act
of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, bringing the total
of such suits since the creation of the Commission to 209. The
large majority of these proceedings have been injunctive suits instituted by the Commission to enjoin violations ot Sections 5 and 17
of the Securities Act and Section 9 of the Securities Exchange Act.
The remainder have included suits to enjoin enforcement of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act, suits to enforce subpenas
issued by the Commission, and petitions for review of the Commission's determination that information for which application was made
for confidential treatment, pursuant to Section 24 (b) of the Securities
Exchange Act, be made public. In accordance with the provisions
of Section 20 (b) of the Securities Act and Section 21 (e) of the Securities Exchange Act, the Commission has also referred a number of
cases to the Attorney General for criminal prosecution. The status
of the cases filed or pending during the fiscal year ended June 30,
1937, is given in the tables in Appendix VI, and the more important
of these cases are there discussed in detail.

During the :fiscalyear ended June 30, 1937, 31 petitions were filed
or pending in 7 Circuit Courts of Appeal and in the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia for review of determinations made by
the Commission upon application for confidential treatment of material

References

to The Attorney General For Criminal Prosecution

During the fiscal year, 42 cases were referred to the Attorney General
for criminal prosecution, bringing the total so referred to 112. Most
of these references followed formal investigations conducted by the
Commission. Of the 112 cases referred, indictments containing
counts charging violations of the Securities Act or conspiracy to
violate the Securities Act were returned in 54 cases, 21 of such indict-

THIRD ANNUAL REPORT

49

ments having been returned during the past fiscal year. During the
same period, indictments charging violations of the Securities Exchange Act were returned in 3 cases.
Thirty of the cases in which violations of the Securities Act were
charged have been tried, and 99 individuals have been convicted.
Eighty-seven of these individuals were given jail sentences ranging
from 5 days to 17 years, and were fined from $50 to $15,000; 9 received
suspended sentences; 2 are awaiting sentences; and 1 has been placed
on probation. The cases in which indictments were returned or pending during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1937, are listed and briefly
described in Table VI of Appendix VI, and the more important are
there discussed in some detail.
LITIGATION

UNDER

THE PUBLIC UTILITY
OF 1935

HOLDING

COMPANY

ACT

Litigation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act has consisted almost wholly of actions to determine the validity of that Act,
Since its enactment, a total of 58 suits challenging the constitutionality
of this Act have been brought. These suits may be classified into
three groups according to the manner in which they have arisen:
(1) suits by holding companies to enjoin enforcement of the Act;
(2) petitions by trustees of holding companies in bankruptcy seeking
determinations that the Act is unconstitutional; and (3) stockholders'
suits seeking similar decisions. Two suits to enjoin the investigation
of investment trusts conducted by the Commission pursuant to Section
30 of that Act were begun during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1937.
These cases are discussed in detail in Part III of Appendix VI.
Suits by Holding Companies to Enjoin Enforcement

Thirty-nine of the 44 suits brought by holding companies to enjoin
enforcement of the Holding Company Act of 1935 were pending during
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1937. This number is exclusive of the
suit brought by the Commission in the District Court of the United
States for the Southern District of New York against the Electric
Bond & Share Company and its principal intermediate holding companies (Securities arid Exchange Oommission v. Electric Bond and Share
Oompany), in which defendants filed a cross bill and counter-claim
seeking an injunction against enforcement and a declaratory judgment
that the Act was unconstitutional.
This case is discussed more fully
in Appendix VI, Part III.
The Comission and the Attorney General announced at the time
the latter case was instituted that no penalties would be sought for
failure to comply with the requirements of the Act until its validity
had been confirmed by the Supreme Court. Each of the 44 suits
brought by holding companies involved substantially similar questions
of law and fact; and the maintenance of those actions harassed the

50

SECURITIES

AND EXCJl4.NGE

COMMISSION

government with a needless multiplicity of suits. .All of these suits
have been handled in accordance with a uniform policy developed by
the Commission in collaboration with the Department of Justice.
No effort was made to defend the suits outside the District of Columbia on their merits. In each such suit, appropriate motions were
made for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. The suits then remained
pending as to the local government officials. In 26 of the suits, injunctions have been issued against such local government officials;
in the remainder, the courts either refused to make any disposition
until after a decision by the Supreme Court in the Electric Bond and
Share case or the parties have agreed to hold the litigation in abeyance
until such a decision.
In the 7 suits which were instituted in the District Court for the
District of Columbia, the government obtained a stay of proceedings
pending a determination of the Electric Bond and Share case (North
American 00. v. Landis, D. C., decided January 6, 1936). On appeal,
the Supreme Court, in a decision rendered December 7, 1936, remanded the causes for further proceedings on that stay. (Landis v.
North American 00., 299 U. S. 248). Four of these cases are now in
the District Court for the District 9f Columbia awaiting further proceedings on the motion to stay. The Tennessee Electric Power Oompany case, the American Water Works &: Electric 00., Inc., case, and
the North American 00., Inc., case have been dismissed on motions
by the plaintiffs.

the fiscal year, listed according to the district court in which the
suit was :filed, are as follows:

Two of the six petitions filed in the District Courts by trustees of

fiscal year. In another suit, that brought by the Standard Gas and
Electric 00., government officials were joined as parties. Except for
the Burco case (Burco, Inc. v. Whitworth), discussed in the Second

Fisher v. Landis, et al; Fisher v. The Equity Corporation, et ai-On.
July 27, 1936, the complainant filed two suits, one in his individual
capacity and one as a stockholder of The Equity Corporation, challenging the validity of subpenas issued by the Commission in its
investigation into investment trusts conducted pursuant to Section
30 of the Holding Company Act. In the former suit, Fisher sought
to enjoin the individual Commissioners from compelling his appearance pursuant to subpenas, from issuing any further subpenas, and
from taking any steps to cause him to be prosecuted for refusal to
obey these subpenas. In the companion suit which named as defendants, in addition to the Commissioners, The Equity Corporation
and its officers and directors, the complainant sought to restrain the
Commission from taking any action to compel the giving of evidence
by the latter persons, or the prosecution of such persons for failing
to give evidence, and also sought to enjoin such persons from appearing and testifying at the inquiry. On August 11, 1936, the District
Court for the District of Columbia denied the motions for preliminary
injunctions on the ground of want of equity.

VIOLATIONS

FILES

The Securities Violations Files, established on May 1, 1935, and
described in the Commission's previous annual reports, were enlarged
during the fiscal year by the addition of 5,613 items of information
pertaining to existing files and by the addition ~f 3,604 new .files.
As of June 30, 1937, the Commission had assembled data relative to
the records of 25,379 persons against whom State and Federal action
had been taken during the past ten years in connection with the sale
of securities.

ASSISTANCE

Numerous inquiries as to the' application to particular tranS!ictions'
of the provisions of the Acts administered and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission are constantly received by the
Commission, in both written and oral form. In order that legitimate
financing might not be impeded, the Commission, during the year,
continued carefully and promptly to consider such inquiries and,
wherever possible, to render advisory assistance.
The extent of this service, however, is determined by the purpose
which' it is designed to serve, i. e., assistance to those who seek to
comply with the law but who have a bona fide doubt as to the proper
interpretation of particular provisions.
The Commission declines to
answer hypothetical questions or problems arising otherwise than from
sections of the Acts which it administers.
The Commission does not
feel at liberty to render interpretative opinions with respect to possible
civil liabilities since it has no jurisdiction over these matters, .nor are
advisory opinions rendered unless the inquirer states all the relevant
facts of an existing or proposed transaction and, in addition, discloses
the names of the persons or corporations, as well as the amounts
involved.

60

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

New problems of interpretation
are continually raised by the
inquiries.
In many instances, the solution of the question presented
has necessitated, in addition to analysis of complicated factual situations, a thorough understanding both of the history of the legislative
provisions in question and of the practical results of a particular
interpretation.
Furthermore, in order to answer many questions of
this type, the general body of judicial case law must be searched for
relevant analogies. While an advisory opinion upon a particular
factual situation may serve as a basis for a similar opinion upon an
analogous set of facts, the great variety of circumstances under which
financing transactions are undertaken give rise to a constant stream
of novel prohlems of interpretation.
The advisory service afforded by the Commission has been designed
for the benefit of those seeking assistance in their endeavor to comply
with the Acts. But the Commission has likewise benefited.
Through
correspondence and conferences incident to the rendering of advisory
legal opinions, the Commission has itself obtained invaluable factual
information which has provided the basis upon which existing rules
and regulations have been improved and which has materially aided
the Commission in the promulgation of new rules and regulations.
REPORTS

OF OFFICERS,

DIRECTORS,

AND PRINCIPAL

STOCKHOLDERS

As part of its new comprehensive survey of significant data relating
to trading upon. exchanges, the Commission is making new analyses
of reports of officers, directors, and principal stockholders, filed pursuant to Section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Where any issuer has any class of equity security listed and registered on a national securities exchange, its officers, directors, and
principal stockholders (i. e., persons who beneficially own, directly
or indirectly, more than 10% of a class of registered equity security)
are required under Section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act to file
initial reports showing their beneficial ownership of equity securities
of such issuer and monthly reports showing all changes in their holdings
of any equity security of their company.
Corresponding reports' are
required under Section 17 (a) of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act to be filed by officers and directors of registered holding companies
concerning their holdings of all securities of the registered holding
'Company and its subsidiaries.
The principal purpose of these reports is to make available information with respect to the amount of equity securities of issuers beneficially owned by their officers, directors, and principal stockholders
and with respect to transactions on the part of such persons closely
identified with the management or control of their enterprises.
The numbers of original and amended reports filed and examined
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1937 are compared below with
corresponding figures for the two preceding fiscal years:

A separate file is established for each person reporting on a given
issuer or a given holding company system. At the close of the fiscal
"year"2n;017' suclr ftles had -been-established for '23'13:10different persons, representing largely the leaders of American business and
industry, who had filed with the Commission a grand total of 86,993
reports, or an average of nearly 4 reports each. On the other hand,
there are only about a half dozen cases of persons who have failed to
file reports apparently required of them under Section 16 (a) of the
Securities Exchange Act or to furnish a satisfactory statement orexplanation regarding their apparent non-compliance with the statutory requirement. Appropriate action is being taken in these cases;
The Commission compiles and publishes semi-monthly an Official,
Summary of Security Transactions and Holdings of Directors, Officers;
and Principal Stockholders as reported to it under Section 16 (a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 17 (a) of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Copies of these summaries
are available at each regional office of the Commission and each na:tiollw.securities exchange, us well as at the offite of the Commission
in Washington, D. C. In addition; the actual reports filed are themselves available for public inspection at the office of the Commission
in Washington, D. C. and the particular exchange with which copies
relating to the issuer concerned are required to be filed.
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES, CONSENTS, AND AUTHORIZATIONS

The administration of the rules and regulations governing the
solicitation of proxies, consents, or authorizations, adopted pursuant
to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, has involved,
among other things, the examination of soliciting material sent to
the security holders of more than 1,500 listed companies. This
examination is for the purpose of determining whether the companies
have complied with the rules and regulations of the Commission.
The examination of proxy, consent, or authorization soliciting material
has disclosed the need for a general revision of these rules and regulations, to the end that the 'purpose thereof may' be mere completely
and effectively accomplished. Such a revision has been undertaken
and is in the final stage of preparation.
During the past fiscal year, 1,896 proxies and approximately 230
amendments thereto were filed with the Commission.

62

SECURITIES

AND EXOHANGE OOMMISSION

In one case, the Commission, upon the examination of soliciting
material, raised a question as to whether statements contained in
such material might not be misleading, and suggested to the company
that it reciroularize its stockholders with supplemental information
to correct any false impressions which might have been formed by
them. When the company declined to do so,' the Commission,
acting pursuant to Section 21 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, decided that it was in the public interest and in the interest of
all the stockholders of the company to make public information available to the Commission bearing upon the adequacy of, certain statements contained in the soliciting material.
In the release. which t)i.e
Commission made public, the Commission set forth various particulars
in which it appeared to the Commission that tl1e..soliciting ,material
might be misleIlding.,
"
. " .",
In another case in which the Commission .desired soliciting I¥ftteJ;ial .
to be supplemented in order to eliminate false impressions, and.In
which the corporation concerned agreed .to do so, the OO~!UQll
issued a public release ,explaining the Particulars in which it felt th~t
further disclosure was essential to, the ~protection, of stockholders
and in the public interest generally.

them with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act may
file the confidential portion of such material with the Chairman of the
Commission, together with an application stating the. grounds upon
which the objection to public disclosure is based.
.
During the year, 234 applications for confidential treatment of
material, involving a' total rof 308 separate items of information
primarily in connection with annual reports filed with the Commission
pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were
filed. Material filed by 202 issuers, involving 288 items,' was made
public during the year, the Commission having determined that disclosure of such information is iIi the public interest; and material 'filed
by 49 issuers, in respect of 62 items, was granted confidential treatment. During the year 48 private hearings on the applications for
confidential treatment were held.:'
One application for confidential treatment with respect to ownership reports of equity securities required by Section 16 (a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to be filed by directors, officers, and
certain securities holders, was filed with the Commission during the
year. This report, together with 3"such reports covered by appliestions pending at' the beginning of the Year, were made available to

THIRD ANNUAL REPORT

Sixty-eight applications for confidential treatment of material contracts or portions thereof contained in registration statements filed
under the Securities Act of 1933 were submitted during the year pursuant to Rule 580 under said Act. Of these 65 requests, 65 were
granted in their entirety, 1 was granted in part, 1 was denied and 1
was withdrawn.
One application for confidential treatment of material filed under
the Public Utility Hording Company Act of 1935 was received during
the fiscal year and is still pending.
At the beginning of the year, petitions had been filed in the several
Circuit Courts of Appeal by 31 issuers seeking to review findings of
the Commission that disclosure of information filed by such issuers in
pursuance of Rule UB2 is in the public interest. During the year,
10 of these petitions were dismissed by the petitioners, and the
material in question, involving 17 items of information, was made
public. No new petitions for judicial review of the Commission's
determinations in these matters were filed during the fiscal year.
ADMISSIONS TO PRACTICE AS ATTORNEY OR AGENT BEFORE THE
COMMISSION

In order to gain admission to practice before the Commission as
Attorney or Agent, the Rules of Practice require the submission to
the Commission of an application disclosing certain specified information regarding the qualifications of the ipplicant. During the year,
733 applications for admission to practice as Attorney and 143 applications for admission to practice as Agent were received. The
register, which the Commission established November 1, 1935, containing the names and addresses of all persons admitted to practice
before the Commission, was enlmged during the fiscal y e a by
the addition of 873 names. The following statistics indicate the

COMMISSION

REPORT ON THE STUDY AND INVESTIGATION .OF PROTECX1.VE AND
REORGANIZATION COMMITTEES

The Commission continued work on the report to the Congress
based on its study and investigation of the work, activities, personnel
and functions of protective committees. This study, investigation,
and report were authorized and directed by Section 211 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
During the preceding year, three parts of the report had been completed and submitted to the Congress. These were Part III, pertaining to the Committees for the Holders of Real Estate Bonds;
Part IV, pertaining to tile Committees for the Holders of M4lli~ipal
and (.luasi-Municipal Obligations; and Part VI, pertaining to Trustees
Under Indentures.
.
During the current year, three additional parts of the report have
been completed. These are the following:
Part I, entitled Strategy and Techniques of Protective and
Reorganization Committees, which was transmitted to the
Congress on May 10, 1937.
Part II, entitled Committees and Conflicts of Interest,
which was transmitted to the Congress on June 21, 1937.
Part V, entitled Protective Committees and Agencies for
Holders of Defaulted Foreign Governmental Bonds, which
was transmitted to the Congress on May 14, 1937.
The two remaining parts of the report are in process of completion.
The basic recommendations contained in the Commission's reports
were embodied in three bills introduced at the last session of Congress:
The Barkley Bill (S. 2344); the Lea Bill (H. R. 6968); and Chapter X
of the Chandler Bill (H. R. 6439; H. R. 8046). The last, Chapter X
of which contains a complete revision of the corporate reorganization
provisions of the existing law, revises the National Bankruptcy Act.
It was passed by the House on August 10, 1937, and is now pending
before the Senate, where it has been referred to the Committee on
the Judiciary. The Barkley Bill, still pending before the Senate
Committee on Banking and Currency, deals with the corporate
trustee and the trust indenture. The Lea Bill, still pending before
the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, deals
with the solicitation of deposits, proxies or assents in reorganization
situations. Administrative powers created by the three bills would
be vested in the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Representatives of the Commission aided in drafting these bills
and appeared before the Congressional committees at hearings on
the bills and testified in support of them.

THIRD ANNUAL REPORT
STUDY OF INVESTMENT

TRUSTS AND INVESTMENT

65
COMPANIES

In the Commission's study of investment trusts and investment
companies, undertaken pursuant to the Congressional mandate of
Seetion 30 of the Public Utilities Act of 1935, the major portion of
the work was completed during the fiscal year.
In addition to four questionnaires distributed at the inception of
the study, the Commission, with cooperation of the representatives
of the industry, prepared a questionnaire for common or commingled
trust funds and another for investment counsel and investment
advisory services. Both questionnaires were of the summary type
and required only basic information.
As of June 30, 1937, the Commission had received questionnaire
replies from 495 management investment companies; from 178 fixed
investment trusts; from 37 investment special plans; from 5 companies offering guaranteed face amount certificates; from 16 common
trust funds; and from 400 investment counsel organizations.
The great amount of material received by the Commission in
response to its questionnaires, the unexpected ramifications of the
activities of investment companies and investment trusts discovered
in the course of the study, and the necessity of including a considerable
number of additional investment organizations in the study, has
delayed the Commission in submitting its final report and its recommendations to the Congress. On January 8, 1937, the Commission
submitted to the Congress a progress report indicating the Commission's method of procedure and detailing the progress of the study
and its status.
Detailed studies have been made of the larger investment trusts
and investment companies and of a number of smaller companies
regarded as representative
examples. These have. been based in
most instances upon the information furnished by the companies in
reply to the questionnaire and in some instances through a field study
of the books and records of the companies. During the fiscal year,
public examinations were held on approximately
125 investment
companies and investment trusts at which about 20,000 pages of
testimony were taken and 2,100 exhibits introduced into evidence.
All public examinations were preceded by preliminary conferences
with respresentatives of the companies
At the close of the fiscal year, the Commission had received information from practically all companies believed to be within the purview
of the study and had almost completed its field studies. Considerable
progress had been made on the statistical and analytical study of
the material collected, and on the preparation of the final report.

MARGIN

REGULATIONS

Under Section 7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, jurisdiction to regulate the extension and maintenance of credit on national
securities exchanges is vested in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Commission has endeavored to assist the
Board by making suggestions from time to time for methods to increase the effectiveness of Regulations T and U, which have been
promulgated by the Board pursuant to Section 7.
The Commission has taken steps to eliminate violations of Regulation T in respect of the time when margin was required to be deposited
by customers with members of exchanges. As a result of conferences
held between representatives of exchanges, the Commission, and the
Board, substantially all national securities exchanges adopted rules
prohibiting members from permitting customers to make a practice
of avoiding the requirement for depositing margin by liquidating the
unmargined commitment within three days.
Although Regulations T and U are promulgated by the Board of
Governors of th~ Federal Reserve System in the exercise of the
Board's exclusive jurisdiction, responsibility for the enforcement of
Regulation T devolves entirely upon the Commission. The task is
one of great magnitude, for which the Commission unfortunately only
has a limited staff available. It involves the systematic inspection of
accounts of firms which carry' margin accounts for customers; the
analysis of reports resulting from such inspections; the institution of
proceedings to enforce the rule and the 'statute whenever violations
are found. The Commission keeps the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System currently informed concerning the results.
During the fiscal year, 107 margin inspections were made, in which
62,876 accounts were examined. As a result, a number of cases
involving members of exchanges have been referred to such exchanges
for disciplinary action. As yet, no cases have been discovered which
required the institution of legal proceedings by the Commission itself •

DETECTION

OF MANIPULATIVE

AND DECEPX1VE PRACTICES

Our national securities exchanges have not as yet demonstrated the
capacity themselves to police their markets effectively against manipulative and deceptive practices. In consequence, the burden of
detecting and instituting proceedings against such practices has rested
almost entirely upon the Commission.
During the year, machinery was set up for a systematic coverage of
trading in as large a number of securities as was considered practical
in an effort to solve the problem of detection of manipulation. A
total of 2,778 exchange issues were under regular observation at the
close of the fiscal year and price and volume records of approximately
225 securities traded in the over-the-counter markets were made.

70

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE 'COMMISSION

To facilitate the detection of manipulation, all securities, wherever
traded in, were classified according to the broad categories of industry.
The reports of changes in the beneficial ownership of equity securities
by those persons called upon to report under Section 16 (a) of the Act
were reviewed. The stock ticker tape quotations of the New York
Stock Exchange and the New York Curb Exchange were under continued surveillance, and lists of daily security transactions were
regularly examined.
Transactions on all exchanges were constantly
scrutinized.
On July 1, 1936, 54 preliminary and 30 formal investigations were
in process. During the year, 420 reports dealing with the probability
of manipulation on exchange markets, and 72 preliminary investigations were made. As a result of these preliminary investigations, 18
new formal investigations were authorized, 60 were closed or completed, and 48 were in process as of June 30,1937.
In addition to the
18 new formal investigations begun as the result of preliminary investigations, there were 12 authorized without preliminary investigations.
Thus, with the 30 formal investigations carried over from the previous
fiscal year, there were 60 formal investigations in process during the
year. Of these 60 formal investigations, 31 were closed during the
year, and 29 were still pending at the end of the year.
When a formal investigation develops evidence which makes it
appear to the Commission that any person is violating or about to
violate any provision of the Act, appropriate legal proceedings are
instituted.
Such proceedings may take the form of a suit for injunction; they may take the form of a reference to the Department of
Justice for criminal proceedings; and they may take the form of a proceeding by the Commission under Section 19 (a) (3) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 to suspend or expel the offender (if the offender
is a member of a national securities exchange) from the exchange ofwhich he is a member. A brief description of injunctive proceedings
brought during the fiscal year against violations of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and of criminal proceedings instituted against
violations of that statute upon reference by the Commission to the
Department of Justice, may be found in Appendix VI, Part II. A
summary of proceedings instituted under Section 19 (a) (3) follows.
{Although some of the events in these summaries preceded the fiscal
year and some did not take place until after the fiscal year, it has been
thought desirable to include them all, in the interest of giving a
reasonably complete picture of the proceedings.)

SPECIAL STUDIES AND RESEARCHES
Study of Exchange Rules Governing Miscellaneous Exchange Practices

As we have already indicated, the Commission has undertaken a
comprehensive new program for the collection and analysis of data
relating to all aspects of exchange trading. This program will cover
the study of such subjects as: statistics on members' trading; status
of margin accounts; orders on specialists' books; short sales statistics;
printing on tape of all sales; round-lot orders entered and opened in
commission houses; analysis of executed round-lot and odd-lot
orders; analysis of executions of all orders of 1,000 shares or more;
analysis of tenders and deliveries of certificates; transactions in
foreign accounts; statistics of cash and margin accounts and firms'
financial positions; analysis of the activity of brokers and dealers;
analysis of broker-dealer income and expenses; volume of put and call
sales; and data concerning the government and operation of the
exchange, In devising this program, the Commission was guided by
both its practical experience and its previous research.
During the past year, the Commission has undertaken a number
of studies relating to problems arising in connection with the rules of
national securities exchanges. These studies have been conducted
with a view to obtaining a measure of uniformity in some of the
essential rules of registered exchanges and with-a view to improving
the standards of practice and organization prevailing thereon. The
studies undertaken are as follows:
1. A study of the nues of all registered exchanges dealing with
those matters specified in Section 19 (b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, concerning which the Commission is authorized to
request any registered exchange to alter its rules. These matters
include: (a) safeguards in respect of the financial responsibility of
members and adequate provision against the evasion of financial
responsibility through the use of corporate forms or special partnerships; (b) the limitation or prohibition of the registration or trading
in any security within a specified period after the issuance or primary
distribution thereof; (c) the listing or striking from listing of any
security; (d) hours of trading; (e) the manner, method, and place of
soliciting business; (f) fictitious or numbered accounts; (g) the time
and method of making settlements, payments, and deliveries and of
closing accounts; (h) the reporting of transactions on the exchange
and upon tickers maintained by or with the consent of the exchange,
including the method of reporting short sales, stopped sales, sales of
securities of issuers in default, bankruptcy, or receivership, and
sales involving other special circumstances; (i) the fixing of reasonable
rates of commission, interest, listing, and other charges; (j) minimum
units of trading; (k) odd-lot purchases and sales; (1) minimum deposits on margin accounts; and (m) similar matters.

2. Studies of specific practices have been combined with a general
survey of the scope and effectiveness of all the important rules of four
national securities exchanges.
3. A study of the rules and practices of national securities exchanges
relating to specifications for admission of securities to listing and setting forth the conditions under which securities may be removed from
the list. Conferences with exchange officials have been held in regard
to, matters relating to exchange policy on the listing and delisting of
securities.
4. A study of the methods of providing adequate reporting of transactions effected on exchanges in securities of issuers in bankruptcy,
reorganization or receivership, dissolution or liquidation, and securities in respect of which there has been a default in interest or principal
or both; and in securities which have been called for retirement or
redemption, or which have matured but have been extended, or which
have not been fully paid for, or upon which assessments have been
levied.
The Commission also continued its studies and researches preparatory to the drafting of rules and regulations on (1) puts, calls, straddles
and other options; (2) borrowings and solvency of brokers and dealers,
and the hypothecation of customers' securities; (3) pegging, fixing and
stabilizing operations; and (4) short selling and stop-loss orders. '
A study of the status of margin accounts was also made by the staff.
Study of Over-the-Counter

Practices and Problems

The studies inaugurated by the Commission in 1934 of appropriate
measures for the control of over-the-counter markets were continued
during the year. Following the adoption of the original plan for
registration of brokers and dealers on January 1, 1936, which plan
became specifically part of the Act by the amendment of May 27,
1936, attention was directed to the need for comprehensive research
into various significant problems in the investment banking and overthe-counter fields. Securities traded .in on the over-the-counter
!
markets were enumerated and classified. A special study was made
with respect to the dissemination of ~tations
for securities traded in
over-the-counter markets. The legal aspects of various problems of
regulation for these markets were studied exhaustively and the possible economic effects of all such proposals were given due consideration. Conferences were held with representative members of the industry upon their problems. Representatives of the Commission co- \
operated with representatives of the over-the-counter business in the
formation of the Investment Bankers Conference, Incorporated, and \
has maintained close contact with the officials of that organization
since its inception in a joint endeavor to improve the standards of
practice prevailing.in the business. The Commission has also wel-

Formulation of Rules to Define Manipulative; Deceptive and Other Fraudulent
Devices in the Over-the-Counter Markets

During the fiscal year, the Commission conducted studies and researches in connection with and drafted rules to define manipulative,
deceptive and other fraudulent devices in the over-the-counter markets.
These rules were drafted pursuant to Section 15 (c) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In accordance with the custom of
the Commission, drafts of the rules were forwarded to an extensive
and representative list of members of the securities business for
criticism during the latter part ot the fiscal year."
Study of "When Issued" Trading Rules

A complete revision of the rules and regulations governing the registration on national securities exchanges of unissued securities and the
exemption of issued warrants from the provisions of Section 12 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 has been undertaken with a view to
, simplifying the regulations and the procedure thereunder.'
A draft
of the revised rules has been sent by the Commission to all national
securities exchanges tor comment.
Further Study of the Segregation of the Functions of Broker and Dealer
Consideration is being given to methods of effectuating the sugges-

tion contained in the Segregation Report that firms carrying margin
accounts for customers, and general partners of such firms, should be
prohibited from trading on margin for their own account.
,.
The Segregation Report expressly left open for further study certain
important questions concerning 'the status and functions of the specialist: This further study will, of course, be carried forward, as part of
the comprehensive program to which reference has been made:

In addition to these two rules, a considerable body of reguliitiohs has,
of course, been promulgated by the Commission under the 'EX&f8:'~:
Act. These other regulations, however, do not govern traffing practices as such, but relate to such subjects as: registration by exchanges:
registration of securities upon exchanges; annual and other reports;
admission of securities to unlisted. trading; admission of securities to
when-issued trading; the solicitation of proxies. in respect of securities
registered upon national. securities exchanges; the registration of
over-the-counter brokers and dealers; regulation of over-the-counter
tradirig; complete, limited, or temporary exemption from various
provisions of the statute; and rules defining certain formal requirements, such as the format of registration statements, the mechanics
of filing, etc. The two rules which regulate trading are:
(1) Rule ND1, which brings arbitrage transactions
by
officers and directors of issuers of listed equity securities under
restrictions equivalent to those prescribed by Sections 16 (a)
and 16 (b) of the Exchange Act for ordinary transactions.'
.
(2) Rule GB2, which supplements Section 9 (a) (2) of the
Act and outlaws an. unmistakably manipulative practice."
B. Trading Rules .Adopted by Exchanges at the Request of the Commission.

These rules consist of the following:
(1) The sixteen trading rules recommended by the Commission in
,!pril1935 for. adoption by national securities exchanges.
(2) The .interpretation .of the tenth of the foregoing sixteen rules,
applicable to trading by specialists, made by the Director of the
. Trading and Exchange Division.
(3) The margin rules adopted by exchanges .which desired to permit
"when issued" dealing thereon, covering the amount of margin
required on all commitments in securities or rights admitted to "when
issued" dealing upon such exchanges.
(4) The rules embodying the requirement that commitments of
members, their firms and their partners made during any single day
shall be fully margined at all times.
(1) The Sixteen Trading Bules«.
.
The sixteen rules for the regulation of trading on exchanges recommended by the Commission on April 16, 1935 for adoption by national
securities. exchanges are intended to provide additional safeguards

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

It should be noted, that although all of these rules relate to trading
activities, three of the rules, in whole or in part, are applicable only to
members while on the floor, i. e., the second, fourth and seventh rules.
~It ;mould also be noted that bonds, arbitrage and odd-lot transactions are exempted from the operation of some of the rules.
As is noted in the discussion, some of these rules approximate
existing regulations of the exchange before April 1935 or codified
existing practices.
The First Rule in general terms prohibits members, then- firms and
partners, from effecting transactions of purchase and sale for their
own account, which transactions are excessive in view of the market for
such security or in view of the financial resources of the member, firm,
or partner.
The Second Rule reads as follows: Trading for Joint Account.
(a) No member, while on the floor, shall, without the prior approval
of the exchange, initiate the purchase or sale on the exchange of any
security classified for trading as a stock by the exchange for any
account in which he, or the firm of which he is a partner or any partner
of such firm, is directly or indirectly interested with any person other
than such firm or partner.
(b) The provisions of this rule shall not apply to any purchase or
sale (1) by any member for any joint account maintained solely for
effecting bona fide domestic or foreign arbitrage transactions, or (2)
by an odd-lot dealer or a specialist for any joint account in which he
is expressly permitted to have an interest or participation by the
Eleventh or Fourteenth Rules, respectively.
This rule is intended to curtail the ability of members, while on the
floor, to engage in manipulative practices by means of financial
resources made available through joint accounts. The Senate investigation disclosed that members joined in such accounts to a very ,
large extent, and that many manipulative operations were based on a
combination of a member's manipulative skill and trading ability with
the' financial backing of outsiders .jointly interested. in the account.
For the odd-lot dealer and specialist, other rules specifically govern
the conditions, and this rule is therefore not applicable to them.
The Third Rule merely provides for the reporting of joint accounts
to the exchange. It is supervisory in intent, and approximates an
exchange regulation in force before the issuance of these rules.
The Fourth Rule deals with the fiduciary obligation which a broker
owes to his customer. A member handling a customer's discretionary
account is forbidden, while on the floor, to execute purchases or sales
for such account which are excessive in size or frequency in view of
the financial resources in the account. The purpose is twofold:
(1) it is designed to eliminate trading for discretionary accounts which
is primarily motivated by the broker's desire to increase his com-

. THIRD ANNUAL REPORT

missions; (2) to eliminate any opportunity for a member on the floor
to effect transactions by means of discretionary accounts for the purpose of stimulating activity or raising or depressing the price.
The Fifth R'IJ1e,relating also to fiduciary obligations, is declaratory
.of prior New York Stock E:xichmIg6.practice. It prohibits a broker,
while holding a customer's unexecuted market or limited price order,
from competing with the customer by trading for his own account in
the same security on the same side.
The Sixth R'IJ1e is intended as a deterrent to a familiar device for
manipulation.
Members, firms and partners are prohibited from
making purchases at successively higher prices or sales at successively
lower prices for the purpose of creating a misleading appearance of
activity, or making a price which does not reflect the true state of the
market in any security.
The Seventh Rule is aimed at another device which might facilitate
manipulation.
It was disclosed by the Senate investigation that members-of e~~es,had
pal'tiGipatee.,in.opoon&.to a large extent in.connection with manipulative operations.
This rule provides that a member, while on the floor, may not initiate the purchase or sale for his
own account or for that of his firm or a partner, of any security classified for trading as a stock by the exchange, in which he or the firm
or partner holds or has granted any put, call, straddle or option.
The Eighth R'IJ1eprovides for the keeping of records of orders. This
rule embodies what was considered by most firms as good practice.
It is intended to aid the exchange in supervising activities.
The Ninth R'IJ1erequires the registration of specialists.
It is supervisory in intent.
The Tenth R'IJ1erequires specialists to restrict their dealings for their
own account in securities in which they specialize.to those reasonably
necessary to maintain a fair and orderly market.f" Under date of
March 30, 1937, an interpretation of this specialist rule was issued,
which is summarized and discussed below.
The Eleventh R'IJ1e permits the specialist to carry a joint account
in any security-classified by the exchange as a stock only with a partner
of such specialist, a member of the exchange, or a firm of which a
member is a partner.
This rule is intended to prevent joint accounts between specialists
and members of the public, in which the participation of the specialist
might serve as a means to manipulative operations conducted from the
floor of the exchange.
The. Twelfth. .Rule .provides merely for the. keeping of records by
specialists.
It was always considered good practice by exchange
officials.
10 Section 11 (b) of the statute provides that II the Commission pennlta the llPIlCialist to act as both broker
and dealer hls dealings shall be lunlted to those reasonably necessary to maintain a falr and orderly market.

78

SECURITIES'.AND

EXCHANGE:OOMMISSION

The Thirteenth Rule provides for the registration, of odd-lot dealers.
. The. Fourteentl: Rule covers the. conditions' under which odd ..lot
dealers may carry joint accounts. in .the same way as the. Eleventh
Rule .does for specialists. '
The Fifteenth. Rule prohibits the holding or granting of an option
by an odd-lot dealer or specialist in any, security classified for trading
as a stock by the exchange in which such. specialist or odd-lot dealer
is registered.
Its purpose follows that of the Seventh Rule, which
governs all members.
The Sizteenth Rule forbids a member from. effecting a short sale-of
a security at a price below the last sale price of such security on the
exchange. This rule was a settled practioe of the New York Stock
Exchange before the issuance.of these trading rules.
(2) The Interpretation of the Tenth of the Sizteen Bulee:
. . ,
The Tenth Rule, as noted, deals with appropriate restrictions of
the activities of the specielist.vin general. terms, . Under ..date ~of
March 30, 1937, an interpretation
of this rule was issued' by fhe
Director of the Trading and Exchange Division.
' .
This interpretation stated that the phrasing of the rule prohibits
all transactions .for .the account .of a specialist in the security in
which he is registered, excepting, only such transactions as are prop ..
erly a part of a course of dealings reasonably- necessary to permit
the specialist to maintain a fair and orderly market, or to act as an
odd-lot dealer. Therefore, each transaction by a specialist for his
own account must meet the test of reasonable necessity.. A. comprehensive. affirmative statement of the criteria: of reasonable necessity
was considered inadvisable, but certain negative tests were-set out-in
this interpretation.
'
. "
. -:
For example, certain types of transactions effected by a. specialist
in taking or increasing a position were specifically described as tending to have a detrimental effect upon the market, and as being therefore commonly unjustifiable.
In this category were plaoedc .
(1) a purchase above the last sale price; '.
(2) the purchase of all. or substantially all the stock-offered on the
book at the last sale price; and
. .
(3) the supplying of all or substantially all the stock bid for on the
book at the last sale price.
(3) "When Issued" Margin Rule8: .
. ,'.' ,. These rules cover the requirements -for commitments in. securities
or rights admitted to "when issued" dealings upon -the .exehanges,
In general, these-requirements are designed 'to be -equivalent Ito'. those
imposed in Regulation T in respect of transactions
in -issued
securities.
->', .
(4) "Daylight Trading" lJtJarginRules:
'." . ~
These rules put into effect the recommendetion made-in ,the- Commission's report to Congress that trading by members of exchanges,
i ,

exchange firms, and their partners be fully-margined at all times.
They were intended as a means for eliminating the "shoestring
trader" and discouraging excessive trading, and to establish a parity
between member traders and traders who were part of the public.
In essence, these rules apply the standards of Regulation T to
transactions by members of the exchange during the course of a
single day.

PUBLICATIONS
Registration

Record,

Securities

Act of 1933

During the year, the Commission developed and put into operation
a new daily report, known as the "Registration Record, Securities
.Act of ,193B" ,o,.eontftining.information .concerning .registration' events
occurring each day in connection with the registration of securities
under the Securities Act of 1933. At the time public distribution of
this daily report was begun (May 10, 1937), the periodic releases
covering registrations, hearings, orders, e.te., under the Securities
Act were discontinued.
The Registration Record, which is in tabular form, was designed: (1)
To eliminate delay in reporting to investors and interested members
of the public the fact that registration statements have been filed (on
the great majority of issues, this information had been released only
on a weekly basis); (2) to combine in a single daily release, the registration.information which had been made public through many ..different
releases; and (3) to augment the information made available, by reporting daily the filing of each amendment, the date and manner in which
each statement becomes effective, the data as to post-effective amendments, and all 'Other 'material. relating to each security issue with
respect to which there is a Securities Act registration statement.
At the time of the inauguration of this Registration Record, a
handbook was issued as a guide to its use. This handbook gives
brief descriptions of the various types of actions in registration procedure, and contains a summary of each of the major registration
forms.
Releases

The Commission issues currently releases concerning its activities.
Releases are issued announcing rules, regulations, orders, opinions,
findings, filings of registration statements and applications, effectiveness of registration statements, public hearings, and reports and statements filed by security issuers, officers, directors, and principal stockholders. These releases are classified according to subject and are
made available to the public through issuance to the press and through
.the.medium of a m.ailing~listm.ain.tained,for the. convenience of. those
members of the public who desire to receive them currently.
Members of the public may have their names placed upon the mailing list
to receive any or all classes of releases.

82

SECURITIES'

AND EXCHANGE 'COMMISSION

During the year ended June 30,- 1937; the Commission published
625 releases-under the Securities .Act of. 1933, .526 releases under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934,. 459 releases under the Public
Utility Holding Company .Act of 1935, and 32 general releases. Of
the total of 1,642 releases thus issued, 685 releases were orders of the
Commission; 614 announced .tP.e.filing of registration statements,
applications, and other public documents filed with the Commission;
110 releases announced rules, regulations and-interpretations by the
Commission; 79 releases eontained statistical-data; and 154 miscellaneous releases covering such matters as civil and. criminal actions
taken by the Commission in the Courts, announcements Of hearings
held in connection with the Commission's Investment Trust Study,
tabulations of effective registrations, 'personnel changes and appointments, etc .
. For the convenience of the' general public, the Commission -has
published compilations of releases issued by it under the Securities
Act of 1933, .the Securities Exchange ,Act of 1934".and .the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. ,These compilations cover
releases issued from the date of the 'Passage of each of the Acts to
and including December 31,'1936.
Accounting Opinions

For the purpose of contributing to the development' of uniform
standards and practice in major accounting questions, the Cbtritilission instituted during the year a program for the publication from
time to time of opinions on accounting principles. Many accounting
problems have arisen during the course of the Commission's administration of the SecUrities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange' Act
of 1934, and the PUblic Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 which
have general application and in these instances the Commission, in
following this program, intends to publish opinions as the necessity
therefor arises in specific cases. It is believed that by this procedure
the quality of the financial statements filed with the Commission
will be improved materially and there will be a more general acceptance of good accounting practice in -the handling of problems heretofore subject to wide variations in treatment.

date of the latest balance sheet filed with the registration statement.
If such corporation has subsidiaries, such income shall be determined

SPECIAL

RULES

AS TO THE

USE OF FORM A-2

FOR CORPORATIONS

1. Notwithstanding that Form E-l is specifically prescribed for
use in cases involving an exchange of securities by the issuer thereof
for others of its securities or a modification of the terms of securities
by agreement between the issuer and its security holders, a registrant
otherwise entitled to use Form A-2 may, at its option, use Form A-2
~
 any such case if the registrant is not in reorganization pursuant

THmD ANNUAL REPORT

99

to Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act or in bankruptcy or receivership and if no default exists on any outstanding funded debt (other
than a default in sinking fund payments which has been waived by
the holders of at least 80 percent in principal amount of the .issue
outstanding). If Form A-2 is used pursuant to this rule, the fee payable for registration shall be calculated in accordance with Instruetion 7 in Form E-l, and the table setting forth the calculation shall
be prepared as prescribed in such form.
2. Form A-2 may be used by a registrant if all the following conditions exist:
(a) The registrant was organized as the successor to a single predecessor, or to a group of predecessors one of which, at the time of
succession, directly or indirectly owned substantially all of the outstanding stock of all the other predecessors;
(b The registrant acquired all of the assets and assumed all of
the liabilities of such predecessor or predecessors, and the capital
structure of the registrant immediately following the succession was
substantially the same as the capital structure of the single predecessor, or as the consolidated capital structure of the group of predecessors, except for such changes as may have resulted from the
substitution of issuers incident to the succession or from changes in
capital stock liability per share; and
- (c) The single predecessor, or the parent company in a group of
predecessors, could have used Form A-2 if the succession had not
taken place.
In determining whether such single predecessor or such parent
company in a group of predecessors could have used Form A-2, the
record of the registrant in regard to income or annual reporting to
security holders shall be considered a continuation of the record of
such single predecessor or such parent company. In the case of a
group of predecessor companies, the income of the parent company
of the group shall be determined on the basis of consolidated reports
for such parent company and its subsidiaries, the subsidiaries to be
included in the consolidated reports whether or not they were combined with the parent company to form the registrant.

r

3. Notwithstanding the provisions of the last sentence of the rule
for the use of Form A-2 for corporations, that form may be used
by a corporation otherwise entitled to use the form, if the property
acquired from promoters under the circumstances stated in such last
sentence consisted principally of one or more going businesses, or of
securities representing directly or indirectly more than 50 percent of
the voting power controlling such businesses.
4. Notwithstanding the rules as to the use of Form E-l, or the rule
as to the use of Form A-2 for corporations, Form A-2 may be used in
the situation described below for registration statements, except those
for which a special form (other than Form E-l) is specifically prescribed, by corporations which file profit and lOBSstatements of their
own or of their predecessors for 3 years and which, or the predecessors

100

SECURITIES

AND ,EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of which, have in the past 15 years paid dividends upon any class of
common stock for at least 2 consecutive years. The situation in which
Form A-2 may thus be used is that of registration of securities issued
or sold in the course of a "reorganization", as defined in Rule 5 (1) as
to the use of Form E-l, where the only operation which brings the
transaction within the definition is the acquisition of assets -of a subsidiary by the registrant in consideration of securities of the registrant,
or the exchange of securities of the registrant for outstanding securities
of a subsidiary."
5. Any corporation which was formed by the consolidation of two
or more corporations may use Form A-2, if each of the constituent
corporations which collectively brought in a majority of the assets,
as shown by the books of the constituent corporations prior to the
consolidation, could have used Form A-2 if the consolidation had
not taken place. In determining whether any such constituent corporation could have used Form A-2, the record of the registrant in
regard to income or annual reporting to security holders shall be
considered a continuation of such constituent corporation's record.
In this rule, all the corporations consolidated to form the registrant
are called the "constituent corporations."
6. Form A-2 may be used by a registrant if all the following con-

ditions exist:
(a) The registrant was a wholly owned subsidiary of a corporation
which, either alone or with one or more of its other wholly owned
subsidiaries, was merged into the registrant;
(b) The registrant acquired all the assets and assumed all the liabilities of the corporations merged into it; and
(c) The parent corporation could have used Form A-2 had the
merger not taken place. In determining whether such parent corporation could have used Form A-2, the record of the registrant
subsequent to the merger, in regard to income or annual reporting
to security holders, shall be considered a continuation of the record
of such parent corporation.

APPENDIX
LITIGATION

INVOLVING

VI

STATUTES ADMINISTERED
COMMISSION

BY

THE

This appendix lists the court proceedings in which this Commission
or the Acts administered by it have been involved.
Included are those
cases instituted during the period from June 30, 1936 to June 30,1937,
as well as those instituted before that date in which no final disposition
had been made on June 30, 1936. The more important litigation is
described at some length; the less important cases are indicated by a
brief notation.
Although the cases are grouped and discussed under
three main headings with reference to the statute primarily in issue
in the particular case and into subheadings depending on the principal
topic in issue, each case is also classified under all statutes and subheadings which it involves. The status of litigation is described only
as it existed as of June 30, 1937, no attempt being made to describe
developments occurring subsequent to that date.
I. SECURITIES

.ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED

Suits under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, are considered
under seven groupings: (1) Suits against the Commission under that
Act to enjoin enforcement of its provisions; (2) miscellaneous proceedings instituted by the Commission pursuant to Section 20 (b) of the
Act to enjoin violations thereof, generally violations of Sections 5 and/or
17; (3) suits against brokers and dealers operating "bucket shops";
(4) suits involving the use of the "sell and switch" device; (5) cases
dealing with the definition of "security"; (6) criminal prosecutions;
and (7) civil litigation between private parties involving the civil
liability provisions of the Securities Act.
SUITS TO ENJOIN ENFORCEMENT OF THE SECURITIES ACT

Three suits brought directly against the Commission for the purpose of enjoining the enforcement of the Securities Act were pending
during the fiscal year. The Commission was also forced to intervene
in an action brought by one person to enjoin another from complying
with subpenas issued by the Commission in the course of its investigations under the Securities ,Act and the Securities Exchange Act.
These cases are:

MISCELLANEOUS INJUNCTION PROCEEDINGS

The majority of injunction proceedings instituted by the Commission under the Securities Act have been to enjoin violations of Sections 5 and/or 17. Section 5, subject to the exemptions therefrom
provided in Sections 3 (a) and 4 and in the Commission's rules promulgated pursuant to Section 3 (b), prohibits in paragraph (a) the
use of the mails or the channels of interstate commerce to offer, sell,
or' deliver after sale unregistered securities, and in paragraph (b)
prohibits the use of the mails or facilities of interstate commerce to
transmit a prospectus relating to registered securities unless it meets
the requirements of Section 10, or to deliver registered securities after
sale unless accompanied or preceded by such a prospectus.
Section
17, in general, prohibits fraud in the sale of securities by the use of
the mails or the channels of interstate commerce.
.
McDowell Mines, Inc. et al.-This
action was instituted on April
16, 1937, in the District Court of the United States for the Distrl.ct
of Colorado to enjoin defendants from violating the provisions of Section 17 (a) (2) in the sale of delendents -stock, . The complaint
alleged that the company, in the sale of its securities, had misrepre-sented the proven quality as well as the state of development-of its
mine, arid that ..there had been omissions to state material facts
necessary in order to make the statements made, in: the light of the
circumstances under which they ~were rnader.-not misleading .. -The
court, in an oral opinion rendered May 14~'193'1,granted a permanent
injunction against violation of Section 17 (a) (2);Y . . . ,.,"
'
Otis &: Oompany.-The Commission filed a bill in the District
Court'for the Northern District of Ohio on April 1, 1936, alleging that
the defendants in the sale to its customers of stock of the Murray-

THIRD ANNUAL REPORT

159

Ohio Company had violated and would continue to violate Section
17 (a) (2) of the Securities Act and Section 9 (a) (2) of the Secuities
Exchange Act. The defendants i n acquiring a block of approximately
5,000 shares of this stock had received agreements from the vendors
thereof that they would withhold the balance of their stock, some
17,000 s h m of a total issue of 60,000 shares, from the market for
sixty days. During this period the price of the stock on the Cleveland
Exchange was stimulated by a series of purchases made by the defendant. These purchases constituted approximately 90 percent of the
trading. The Commission claimed that the failure of the defendants
to disclose these facts in selling the stock to the public "at the market"
constituted an "omission to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the slatenlents made, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading." On December 28, 1936,
Judge West sustained this argument and granted an injunction against ,
violation of Section 17 (a) (2) by such omissions. With respect to
Section 9 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchmge Act, the court held that
the evidence was "insufficient to establish with the necessary degree
of certainty to warrant an injunction" the claim that the defendants
contemplated any future v~olationof that Section (18 F. Supp. 100).
An appeal by the defendants is pending.
Boise Petroleum Co~porationand C. S. Hassler - On April 15, 1@37,
the defendant corporation and its sales manager, C. S. Hmsler,
consented in the District Court for the Distuct of Idaho to the entry
of a permanent injunction restraining them from selling unreg~stered
oil and gas leasehold interests in an area known as "Beacon Hllls,
Idaho", contrary to the provisions of Sect~on5 (a) of the Securities
Act of 1933, and in the sale of these securities from obtaining money
or property by means of certain untrue statements of material facts
in violation of Section 17 (a) (2) of that Act. The decree also enjoined
Hassler from acting as a broker or dealer in the sale of securities
unless registered as such with the Commission in accordance u i t b the
requirements of Section 15 (b) of the Securit~esExchange Act. Later,
t.he Commission instituted criminal contempt proceedings against
the corporation and Hassler on the ground that they were continuing
to engage in the acts and practices against which the court had issued
the injunction. The defendants i n their answer admitted that
since the entry of the decree, the mails had been used in the sale and
delivery of the securities, but alleged as a defense that such sales
and deliveries had been made solcly uithin the State of Idaho. The
court held that the use of the mails violated the injunction order,
and on June 7, 1937, fined the oorporation $500 and Hassler $300.
This is the first case in which a penalty has been imposed in contempt
prooeedings for violation of an injunction obtained by the Commission.
Other miscellaneous cases are:

PROCEEDINGS AGAINST BROKERS AND DEALERS OPERATING
"BUCKET SHOPS"

Securities are often sold on margin or deferred payment plans
wherein the broker or dealer makes no provision for acquiring securities
with which to fulfill his commitment to the customer. I n the normal
case this involves "bucketing" orders, a fraudulent practice which is
specifically d e h e d as a crime under the laws of most States. I n
many instances the operator of a "bucket shop", in addition to failing
to provide for the acquisition of securities with which to meet his
commitment to his customer, embezzles the partial payments made,
or the margin collateral deposited, by customers. The following
cases instituted by the Commission involve this type of fraudulent
operation:

"SELL AND SWITCH" DEVICE

The practice of first selling seasoned, dividend-paying stocks listed
on major securities exchanges to customers, and after, gaining their
confidence, "switching" them to a low-grade speculative stock being
distributed by the dealer, which, of course, he. highly recommends,
has been' frequently encountered by the Commission, This device,
often involving as concomitant features the use of "tipster sheets" as
well as the misrepresentation of bid and asked prices in a fictitious
over-the-counter market, was involved in the following court
proceedings:

CASES INVOLVING THE DEFINITION OF "SECURITY"

Crude Oil Oorporationof America, et al.-On April 27, 1936, the
Commission filed a bill in the western district of WISconsin to restrain
the Crude Oil Corporation of America, B. C. Buckmann Company,
Wells-Kendall Company, and Douglas Winslow Adams from further
violations of Sections 5 and 17 of the Securities Act in the sale of certain
oil contracts.
The bill alleged that while the oil contracts purported
to constitute a sale of a number of barrels of oil, such contracts were
sold to people who never intended to take delivery of the oil, and that
the contraots were in fact "investment contracts" within the meaning
of the term "security" as defined in Section 2 (1). The bill further
alleged that the defendants in the sale of these contracts had made
certain misrepresentations constituting violations of Section 17. On
December 1, 1936, Judge Stone in his findings of fact and conclusions
of law held that the contracts were "securities" within Section 2 (1),
.that the Securities Act was constitutional, that the petition should be
granted as against Crude Oil Corporation and B. C. Buckmann Company, and that the bill should be dismissed as to Wells-Kendall Company. The Commission had previously dismissed the bill as to the only
other defendant, Douglas Winslow Adams. A permanent injunction
was granted on January 21,1937. The case is now pending on appeal
by the enjoined defendants to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit.

in the district of Massachusetts on February 8, August 20, and September 9, 1935, charging W. L. Jarvis, and others, with violation of
the mail fraud statute and conspiracy to violate Section 17 (a) of the
Securities Act. The indictments charged Jarvis and his co-defendants
with aelling 'Polymer Manufacturing
Corporation stock to the investing public by means of a high pressure telephone sales campaign
run in conjunction with the circulation of a so-called investment
service which purported to be unbiased, at a market price previously
inflated by defendants' manipulative transactions.
Jarvis and his
principal co-defendant, Gaines, as well as certain others, have been
convicted and sentenced.
On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit in an opinion rendered by Judge Morton on May
24, 1937, sustained the conviction (90 F. (2d) 243). Jarvis, Gaines,
and two of his associates were also indicted in the southern district of
New York in connection with manipulative operations in the stock of
Atlas Tack Corporation listed on the N ew York Stock Exchange.
The trial, held in October 1935, ended in a jury disagreement.
A

CIVIL LITIGATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF WHICH THE
COMMISSION IS INFORMED

. 'Oontinental Distillers and Importers Oorporation.-Various purchasers of securities of the Continental Distillers and Importers Corporation sued the corporation and its directors in the District Court
for' the District of Columbia under Section 11 of the Securities Act,
alleging that they had purchased these securities which were then
registered under the Act, relying partly upon false and misleading
representations in a prospectus filed with the Federal Trade Commission. Nineteen suits of identical nature brought in the District of
Columbia against the' same defendants were by agreement stayed
pending the determination of a single such action by the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia. On June I, 1937, the latter
court held in Martin v. Hull et al. that the standard of care which
must be exercised by a director in submitting for filing with the
Commission statements compiled on the authority of experts was
one of reasonableness and was not "the high degree of care necessary
m the protection of the interests of the stockholders of the corpora
tion." A petition for re-argument was filed on June 14, 1937.
, Lawrence Adams &1 Oompany.-Three bills were filed under Section 12 (1) and (2) of the Securities Act in companion suits in the
District Court for the District of Columbia on May 8, 1936, by
Arnold K. Balls, Charles A. Browne, and Marion E. Lapp against
Lawrence Adams & Company and Clarence Falk to rescind certain
sales of oil royalty interests. The bills alleged that the defendants
in failing to register the interests sold had violated Section 5, and
further alleged that the sales had been induced by certain misrepresentations in charts purporting to show the location of producing oil
wells and in misleading omissions to disclose that the oil wells were
not in condition to begin production. Lawrence Adams & Company
moved to quash service made upon it in New York. This motion was
overruled on the theory that a plea in abatement should have been
filed. The case is pending.

ACT OF 1934, AS

MIS~ELLANEOUS INJUNCTION PROCEEDINGS

Archie M."A,)w,rews'et al.-O~ August 12,'1936, suit was instituted
by the Commission in the southern district of New York to enjoin
the defendants from effecting wash sales, matched orders, and other
manipulative transactions in the capital stock of the Dictograph
Products Company, Inc., in violation of the provisions of Section 9 (a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On September 24, 1936, one
of the defendants consented to the entry of a permanent injunction.
While the suit was pending as to the other defendants upon the bill,

Conimission by order dated November Ii, '193f(au.'thorized an investigation to determine whether unlisted trading privileges on the New York
Curl> Exchange in the Dictograph stock should .be suspended 9f
terminated.
The plaintiff's motion for an injunction pende,'(/,telite
was denied Novemb~r,23, 1936.' On the same date the-defendanta
filed a cross bill seeking to enjoin the Commission from engaging in
any activity or investigation with rlilspe~t, to th~ capital stock o~
Dictograph Products.Company,
Inc., and the trading therein,until
final determination of ,~he Commission's suit. The relief requested in
the cross bill was predicated upou numerous grounds, among them the
unconstitutionality
of the Act. ' The Commission moved to dismiss
the cross bill for lack, of jurisdiction and failure of the.cross bill to state,
a cause of action in equity. That motion was granted, and 'on
November 25, 1936, defendants took an appeal-from the entry of the
order granting the motion. On March I, 1937, the Circuit Court of
Appeals of the Second Circuit affirmed the order dismissing the cross
bill, on the ground that a suit against the Commission could only be
maintained in the manner and upon the terms specified in the statute
(88 F. (2d) 441). The time for filing an application for a writ of
certiorari was extended to July 29, 1937, and the defendants' petition
was pending before the Supreme Court on June 30, 1937.
Aaron S. Saphier et al.-Qn August 25, 1936, the Commission filed
suit in the southern district of N ew York to enjoin the defendants
from further violations of Sections 9 (a) (1), (2) and (4) of the Securities
Exchange Act and 5 (a) and 17 (a) of the Securities Act. An injunction pendente lite was denied without prejudice by Judge Mack on
December 19, 1936. The suit was dismissed on January 26, 1937, on
stipulation that the defendants would discontinue the practices of
which complaint was made.
Northwest Gas and Oil Properties, Ine., et al.-This
represents the,
first case in which an injunction was obtained against violation of
Section 15 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act. A bill was filed
March 5, 1937, in the western district of Washington, charging violations of Section 15 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act and of sections 5
(a) and 17 (a) (2) of the Securities Act and a permanent consent
injunction was entered o~: the ~ame date.
Additional cases involving miscellaneous injunctions, under the
Securities Exchange Act are as follows:

Mc1vlann v. Engel et al, Securities and Exchange Oommiseion, intervener.-On July 21, 1936, McMann filed suit in the District Court
of the United States for the Southern District of New York to enjoin
the defendant Engel and others, partners in the stock brokerage
firm of Engel and Company, from producing statements of the plaintiff's' account in response to subpenas issued by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in the course of its investigation to determine
whether the plaintiff and others were engaged or about to engage in
manipulative and other fraudulent acts and practices in the stock
of the Budd Wheel Company and Wil-Iow Cafeterias in violation of
the Securities Act of 1933, and the Securities Exchange.Act of 19.34.
The bill of complaint alleged that the transactions in question were
confidential; that the information called for by the subpenas was
privileged and protected by the fourth amendment: that the subpenas infringed the plaintiff's immunity against "unreasonable
searches"; and that the statutes under which the subpenas were
issued were unconstitutional and void. Engel and Company, the
primary defendant, took a neutral position and the Commission

THIRD AJ.~NUAL REPORT

l77

found it necessary to intervene to protect its rights. On August 5,
'1936, the district court decided against the plaintiff on all questions
raised and denied the motion for a preliminary injunction (16 F.
Supp. 446}. From this decree McMann appealed to the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On January 19, 1937,
the circuit court of appeals affirmed the order of the court below
(87 F. (2d) 377). McMann secured a stay pending application to
the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari but the petition was denied
by the Supreme Court on April 12, 1937.
Ryan and Ryan Florida Gorp. v. Newfield and Western Union Telegraph Oo.; Ryan and Ryan Florida Gorp. v. Newfield and Postal
Telegraph-Gable o«, Inc.; Florida Tex. Oil Go. v. Ballentine and Postal
Telegraph-Gable 00., Inc.-These three cases, involving almost identical
questions, were consolidated for purposes of argument. The suits
were brought in March 1937 in the southern district of Florida against
representatives of the Commission and against Western Union and
Postal Telegraph to enjoin enforcement of and compliance with certain
subpenas duces tecum issued by the Commission, calling for the production by the telegraph companies of copies of certain telegrams in
their possession sent or received by the plaintiffs. The subpenas had
been issued only after preliminary investigations and the issuance of
formal orders of investigation to ascertain possible violations of Sections 5 and 17 of the Securities Act, and after the Commission had
expressly found that the telegrams called for in the subpenas were
relevant and material to the investigations authorized. On the
ground that the subpenas violated the plaintiff's rights under the
fourth and fifth amendments, the District Court for the Southern
District of Florida, on April 14, 1937, granted interlocutory orders
restraining enforcement and compliance. An appeal was taken by
the Commission's representatives to the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit, and on July 22, 1937, that court reversed the
decision of the district court. A unanimous court speaking through
Judge Hutcheson held. that the plaintiffs had no standing to invoke
the fourth and fifth amendments, and that the subpenas in question
had been issued pursuant to lawful authority and were valid process.
In a number of instances the Commission, under the authority
conferred by Section 22 (b) of the Securities Act and Section 21 (c)
of the Securities Exchange Act, has deemed it necessary to resort to
the courts to enforce compliance with subpenas issued in connection
with investigations of violations of the Acts. Although several applications to enforce subpenas have been fully argued before the courts,
many were continued indefinitely because the Commission, prior to
decision, obtained the required evidence from other sources: The
applications filed or pending during the fiscal year are:

APPEALS FROM ORDERS OF THE COMMISSION PROMULGATED
UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT

Section 24 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act permits any person
filing any application or report with the Commission to make written
objection to the public disclosure of some or all of the information
contained therein. Under Section 25 (a) of the Act provision is made
for review in a circuit court of appeals or in the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia of orders of the Commission rendered in a
proceeding under this Act. More than 600 issuers seeking registra,
tion upon national securities exchanges fled, in connection with their
application for registration, objections to disclosure of certain information, for the most part relating to sales and itemized break-down
of the cost of sales. In many other instances objection was made to
public disclosure of salaries and other remuneration paid to officers
and directors. At the request of the issuers concerned, pursusslt to
Seqtion 24 (b) the Commission, in private hearings, heard the objections to public disclosure of the information for w-hich confidential
treatment was sought. Approximately 30 issuers whose applications
for confidential treatment of information filed had been denied by

the Commission, purportmg to act under Section 25 (a) of the Act,
filed petitions in various circuit courts of appeal and in the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia to review the Commission's
action. A group of these cases was consolidated and argument was
had June 11, 1937, before the Court of Appeals for the District of
-Oolumbia, on the question whether the Commission's determination
under Section 24 (b) is the type of order which is reviewable under the
special appeal section, 25 (a). As of the close of the fiscal year no
decision had been rendered in these cases, nor had any circuit court
of appeals made any disposition on. the merits of any such petition.

AV-ENUE RAILWAY"COMPANY

'0-':1July '31,'-1936, The Third- Aven,ue, Railway Company filed it
petition for review by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit of an-alleged: order of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
The petitioners had requested that the Commission
~me~(l ~ts r~quiremenit. that the financial statements included in the
annual report subnmtea to 'the -'Comptission be certified by 'public
aceountants, to provide -that 'Where' 'the principal properties of the

registrant were common carriers, required by, the laws of New York
to make annual reports to the Department of Public Service, .they
could file annual financial statements not so certified. The Commission denied this request but there were no proceedings and it did not
enter a formal order. On October, 19, .J936, the Court of Appeals
dismissed the petition on the ground that since this was not a proceedings inter parties the court was without jurisdiction to entertain
the petition.
SUITS TO ENJOIN ENFORCEMENT OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT
'

In addition to the case of McM,ann v. Engel et al in which the Commission intervened, and the cases brought by Ryan, Ryan Florida
Corp., and the Florida Tex., Oil Company against Agents of the
Commission, the Western Union Telegraph Company, and the Postal
Telegraph-Cable Company all of which are described above*, the
only action to enjoin the application of the Act is that commenced
by J. Edward Jones on January 2,1936 to enjoin enforcement against
him of Section 15 of the Act. This case is described in detail in the
Second Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On April 17, 1937 the suit was dismissed by the court for want of
prosecution.
III. THE PUBLI~

UTILITY HOLDING
ACT OF 1935

COMPANY

Thus far, cases which have arisen under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 have been for the purpose of obtaining an adjudication as to the constitutionality of the Act. The constitutional
question has been raised directly in suits by holding companies to
enjoin enforcement of the provisions of that Act, in suits by trustees
of holding companies in bankruptcy instituted for the nominal
purpose of obtaining instructions from the court as to whether to
comply with the Act, and in stockholders' suits against the corporation
to enjoin compliance with the Act. At an early date the Commission
instituted the Electric Bond and Share case in the southern district
of New York in order fairly to present all the issues in a single case.
The majority of the other suits were not defended by the Commission.
Electric Bond omd Share' Oompany et al.-The
provisions of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 became effective on
December 1, 1935. Even before this date the Government was faced
with a multitude of injunction suits, actual 'or anticipated, on the
part, of most of the larger holding companies. The Commission,
desiring a prompt and fair test of the provisions of the Act, brought
suit in the southern district of New York agains~.the Electric Bond
and Share Company and its principal intermediate holding companies
• Under the heading CIUU InliOlrifl{/ Subpena P01IIerI,

THIRD .ANNUAL REPORT

to enjoin activities which were declared unlawful by that Act. Other
defendants were subsequently added in order to bring before the
court as many typical situations to which the terms of the Act apply
as was possible without confusing the issues of the case. A stipulation
of facts, approximately 2,000 pages in length, was filed with the court
on June 30, 1936. Thus, the court had before it a record comprehensively detailing many of the more important instances in which
the Public Utility Holding Company Act impinged upon holding
company activities. On January 29, 1937, Judge Mack in an exhaustive opinion held that the defendant utility companies, under existent
circumstances, could only attack the registration provisions of the
Act, that these provisions were separable from the remainder of the
Act, and that they came within the ambit of congressional power to
regulate interstate commerce. A petition for certiorari directly to
the Supreme Court, joined in by all parties, was denied by that
Court on June 1, 1937. The case is now pending on appeal to the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Landis v. North American Oompany.-:Seven suits were filed in the
District of Columbia to enjoin enforcement of the Holding Company
Act. On December 7, 1935, a motion was made by the Commission
to stay these suits pending a decision of the Supreme Court in the
Electric Bond and Share case .. This motion was granted by the district
court on January 6, 1936, but on special appeal the stay order was
reversed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on the
ground that the parties and issues were not identical with those in the
Electric Bond and Share case. Certiorari was granted by the Supreme
Court October 5, 1936. On December 7, 1936, the Supreme Court
reversed the decision of the court of appeals, vacated the order of the
district court, and remanded the cause to the lower court for a reconsideration of the motion for a stay. Mr. Justice Cardozo, speaking
for a unanimous Court (Mr. Justice McReynolds concurring in result
only), stated that although the Court did have the power to grant the
stay, the stay was excessive insofar as it was to continue in effect
beyond the decision of the district court in the Electric Bond and
Share case (299 U. S. 248). The cases are now in the District Court
for the District of Columbia awaiting further proceedings on the
motion to stay.
The status of the cases arising under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act which were pending during the fiscal year is as follows:
