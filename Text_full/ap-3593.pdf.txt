On January 11, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondent has securities registered with the Commission and is delinquent in its
periodic filings.
Respondent was served with the OIP on January 14, 2016, and its answer was due by
January 27, 2016. DC Brands Int’l, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3548, 2016 SEC
LEXIS 300 (ALJ Jan. 28, 2016). After Respondent failed to file a timely answer, I ordered
Respondent to show cause by February 8, 2016, why this proceeding should not be determined
against it due to its failure to file an answer or otherwise defend this proceeding. Id. To date,
Respondent has not filed an answer or responded to the show cause order.

Respondent’s request to extend the time to file an answer.
Respondent shall file an answer to the OIP and respond to the show cause order by

default, the proceeding will be determined against it, and the registration of its securities will be
revoked. See OIP at 2-3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
