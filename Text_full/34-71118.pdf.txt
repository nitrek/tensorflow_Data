FUND RESIDUAL

On March 16, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") issued
an Order Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions Pursuant to Section 8A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as to
Prime Capital Services, Inc. and Gilman Ciocia, Inc. (Securities Act Release No. 9113 (Mar. 16,
2010)) (the "Order''). Simultaneously with the entry of the Order, the Commission accepted
settlement offers from Respondents Prime Capital Services, Inc. ("PCS") and Gilman Ciocia,
Inc. ("G&C") in which they consented to the entry of the Order without admitting or denying the
Commission's findings. PCS was ordered to pay total of $144,262.58 in disgorgement and
prejudgment interest to the Commission, and G&C was ordered to pay total of $450,001.00 in
disgorgement and civil penalties to the Commission. The Commission established a Fair Fund
pursuant to Section 308 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for these payments (the "Fair Fund").
On March 14, 2011, the Commission issued an Order Approving Distribution Plan of a
Fair Fund and Appointing a Fund Administrator (Exchange Act Release No. 64081 (Mar. 14,

Disbursement of $390,054.77 to eligible investors who paid fees and charges associated with
their variable annuity investment and who were described in the Order and/or who testified about
their investment experience at an administrative hearing (Exchange Act Release No. 66947 (May
8, 2012)).
