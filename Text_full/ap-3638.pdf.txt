Release No. 3638/February 24, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-16008

In the Matter of
CRUCIBLE CAPITAL GROUP, INC., and
CHARLES MOORE

ORDER CANCELING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding in August 2014.
I previously stayed this proceeding pending a parallel criminal proceeding, upon the application
of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. On December 9, 2015,
I extended the stay until February 29, 2016, and scheduled a prehearing conference for that same
day. Crucible Capital Grp., Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3381, 2015 SEC LEXIS
5005.
Thereafter, in January 2016, the Division of Enforcement moved the Commission to
dismiss the proceeding as to Crucible Capital Group, Inc. That motion remains pending.
Meanwhile, on February 18, 2016, the Commission settled this proceeding as to Charles Moore.
My office then inquired with all parties and the U.S. Attorney’s Office whether anyone wished to
proceed with the prehearing conference scheduled for February 29. The Division represented to
my office that neither it nor the U.S. Attorney’s Office wished to proceed with the conference,
and no other party has advised otherwise. The Division also represented that the U.S. Attorney’s
Office no longer seeks a continued stay.
Accordingly, the prehearing conference currently scheduled for February 29, 2016, is
CANCELED. In light of the Division’s pending motion to dismiss before the Commission, there
are no further steps for me to take at this time.
