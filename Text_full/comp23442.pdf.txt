ECFCASE
15-CV-9874-RJS

against defendants Edward Durante ("Durante"), Abida Khan ("Khan"), Larry Werbel
("Werbel''), Christopher Cervino ("Cervino"), Walter Reissman ("Reissman"), Kenneth Wise

Case 1:15-cv-09874-RJS Document 7 Filed 01/06/16 Page 2 of 19

("Ken Wise") and Evolution Partners Wealth Management LLC ("Evolution Partners")
(collectively, "Defendants"):

SUMMARY
1.

From 2012 to 2014, Durante, a recidivist securities law violator, defrauded at least

50 relatively unsophisticated investors out of at least $11 million through the sale of securities of
VGTel, Inc. ("VGTel"), a shell company he controlled. Durante sold approximately six million
shares ofVGTel stock to investors using a fictitious name to hide his criminal past and lying to
investors regarding the use of stock sale proceeds. Durante also bribed Khan and Werbel, the
managing member of Evolution Partners, who advised their clients to purchase VGTel stock
without disclosing to their clients that they had been bribed. Durante also engaged in matched
trading ofVGTel stock with a stockbroker, Cervino, to artificially control the stock's market
price. Durante's associates, Reissman and Ken Wise, aided and abetted Durante in his
fraudulent sales.
2.

By this action, the Commission seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten

gains and civil penalties.

FACTS
A.

Background
15.

While serving his ten-year prison term for a securities fraud conviction, Durante

began laying the groundwork for his next stock fraud. In 2011, Durante used the fictitious name
"Anthony Walsh" to negotiate the acquisition ofVGTel as a shell company. As a result of the
purchase, Durante came to control almost all of the issued shares ofVGTel. Durante assigned
VGTel certificates to several entities he apparently controlled in order to disguise the fact that he

5

Case 1:15-cv-09874-RJS Document 7 Filed 01/06/16 Page 6 of 19

controlled most of the outstanding stock ofVGTel. Durante also formed his private companies,
New Market and Zenith.
16.

After his release from prison, Durante moved to New York City and conducted

his business activities at Zenith's and New Market's offices in Manhattan. In 2010, Durante
hired Reissman to help him develop VGTel's business. Durante was unsuccessful in obtaining
financing because potential investors had concerns about his criminal history, and therefore,
VGTel never had any ongoing business operations. In 2012, Durante told Reissman he was
going to use a fictitious name to sell VGTel securities and asked Reissman what he thought
about Durante using the name "Efran Eisenberg." Shortly thereafter, to avoid investor concerns
about his criminal history, Durante began using the fictitious names Ted Wise and Efran
Eisenberg in addition to occasionally using Anthony Walsh as he had previously.
17.

In 2009, Durante hired Ken Wise to nominally control Zenith's and New

Market's bank accounts and to process the transfer of funds to Durante. At Durante's direction,
Ken Wise withdrew cash from these accounts for, among other things, paying kickbacks to
Werbel and Cervino. Ken Wise also obtained debit cards in his name for the New Market and
Zenith accounts and gave them to Durante for Durante's personal use.
B.

New England Investors
18.

Between 2012 and 2013, Durante sold approximately $1.2 million worth of

worthless VGTel stock to Investor A, who lives in the New England area, and at least thirty of
his friends and family members. When soliciting stock sales, Durante identified himself as Ted
Wise whenever communicating with Investor A. Durante's false identity prevented Investor A
and other investors from learning about Durante's criminal history.
19.

Durante told Investor A that VGTel was a publicly traded company that could

6

Case 1:15-cv-09874-RJS Document 7 Filed 01/06/16 Page 7 of 19

expand quickly. Durante told Investor A that he had done several major deals and that he had
obtained large investments for VGTel. Both of these statements were false. Durante also told
Investor A that, although he was not a VGTel officer or board member, he nonetheless controlled
the company.
20.

Based on these conversations, Investor A introduced Durante to at least 30 friends

and/or family members who ultimately became VGTel investors.
21.

In early 2013, Durante traveled to, and held approximately four sales meetings in,

Tewksbury, Massachusetts. During these meetings, Durante continued to represent himself as
Ted Wise. Durante told these investors that the stock sale proceeds would be used by VGTel to
fund its operations (as opposed to being paid to the stock seller, in this case Durante).
22.

Durante also told investors that VGTel's stock price would increase significantly,

and at one point predicted a $50 per share price.
23.

In total, Investor A and his friends and family members purchased a total of

approximately $1.2 million ofVGTel stock from Durante, and as Durante directed, investors sent
their funds to either Zenith or New Market.
24.

Durante explained to Investor A that there was only a limited amount of shares of

VGTel, and that by having friendly investors purchase the majority of the shares, Durante could
ensure the stability of the market. Durante said that this type of control made the investments in
VGTel safe. Based on these representations, Investor A also recommended that his family and
friends purchase VGTel stock in the public market.

C.

Khan's Clients
25.

Khan, while working as an associated person of a dually-registered investment

adviser and broker-dealer, had approximately 30 clients, mostly conservative, older investors,

7

Case 1:15-cv-09874-RJS Document 7 Filed 01/06/16 Page 8 of 19

who owned annuities.
26.

In 2012, Durante contacted Khan using the fictitious name Ted Wise and offered

to pay Khan in exchange for transferring her clients to him. In 2013, Khan sold her business to
Durante for $377,500 and agreed to continue working with her clients at Durante's direction.
27.

Although Khan informed her clients that she was associating with Durante (Ted

Wise), she never informed them about the $377,500 payment she received from Durante.
28.

At Durante's direction, Khan advised at least 20 of her clients to sell their

annuities, often incurring penalties, and then Khan solicited the clients to purchase VGTel stock.
29.

Also at Durante's direction, Khan arranged for at least 20 of her clients to open

brokerage accounts using Cervino as the account representative.
•

30.

i

Khan invited Durante to solicit sales ofVGTel stock directly to her clients. At

one sales meeting in San Diego in September 2013, Durante (posing as Ted Wise) told investors
that VGTel would be a profitable investment.
31.

Khan vouched for Durante's predictions, promising that investors would double

or triple their money by investing in VGTel. As a result, at least 20 Khan clients invested a total
of approximately $2 million by making purchases in trading accounts Khan helped them to open.
32.

In addition, several of Khan's clients purchased VGTel stock directly from

Durante by writing checks to Zenith or New Market.
33.

Beginning in 2014, Durante caused Khan to be paid at least $110,000 in

kickbacks for soliciting VGTel stock sales, which Khan never disclosed to her clients.
34.

In November 2013, Khan repeatedly called one of her client's stockbroker,

impersonating the client, and directing the sale of existing investments to fmance the purchase of
VGTel stock. Shortly thereafter, in November and December 2013, again impersonating the

8

Case 1:15-cv-09874-RJS Document 7 Filed 01/06/16 Page 9 of 19

client, Khan placed orders to purchase approximately $1,000,000 ofVGTel stock.
35.

In July 2013 Khan purchased VGTel stock in another client's account without

authorization when Khan knew that the client was away on vacation.

D.

Werbel's Investment Adviser Clients
36.

In approximately 2010, Werbel entered into a consulting agreement with

Durante's company, New Market. Pursuant to this agreement, Durante caused Ken Wise to pay
Werbel $200,000 in exchange for Werbel inducing six of his clients to purchase approximately
$2 million worth ofVGTel stock.
37.

On another occasion, Durante directed Ken Wise to send Werbel three cash

payments of$9,500 each as a commission for causing another client to purchase approximately
$150,000 ofVGTel stock from New Market.
38.

Werbel took no steps to learn anything about the assets or revenues ofVGTel, did

not review its balance sheet. never met with an officer or director of the company, and never
performed any due diligence regarding VGTel other than talking to Durante. Nonetheless, in
2012 and 2013, Werbel recommended investments in VGTel to his clients.
39.

When recommending VGTel to his clients, Werbel made no disclosure of any

compensation from Durante, either the $200,000 "consulting" payment from Durante, the
$28,500 cash kickback from Ken Wise, or anything about Werbel's financial relationship with
Durante or New Market.
40.

Werbel also did not disclose to his clients that Durante used a fictitious name or

that Durante had a criminal history.

E.

Matched Trading in VGTel Stock
41.

Reissman introduced Durante to Cervino for the purpose of Durante maintaining

9

Case 1:15-cv-09874-RJS Document 7 Filed 01/06/16 Page 10 of 19

artificial control of the publicly traded stock price ofVGTel.
42.

Cervino and Durante engaged in matched trades ofVGTel stock in accounts

maintained by Durante and Ken Wise at the broker-dealer where Cervino worked. Durante paid
Cervino secret cash payments of at least $30,000.
43.

Durante caused at least 23 customer accounts to be set up at a clearing firm to

trade VGTel stock. Beginning in August 2013, these accounts, which were comprised of a
mixture of Khan's clients, Werbel's clients, and accounts in the name of New Market and Zenith,
were opened with Cervino acting as the trader for the accounts.
44.

None of the investors' accounts provided for third-party trading authority for

Durante.
45.

Reissman assisted Durante in coordinating the trading with Cervino, and

Reissman placed orders to sell his own shares ofVGTel stock at Durante's direction.
46.

Cervino was in frequent communication with Durante. During these

communications, Durante explicitly discussed his desire to manipulate and control VGTel's
stock price. For example, on August 12, 2013, Cervino and Durante (using an alias) were
discussing via email opening a trading account for one of Khan's clients. Durante wrote to
Cervino and asked him to control bidding at approximately $1.04 per share: "Please set these
accounts up for [a Khan client]. Ted [Wise] will be out of office until the afternoon. He will call
you when available. Please keep bids in the 1.04/05 range and he will give you further details."
47.

Durante's and Cervino's manipulative trading caused VGTel's share price to

steadily increase from $0.25 in April 2013 to $1.90 in October 2013.
48.

At times, Durante placed matched VGTel stock purchase and sell orders during

the course of one telephone call to Cervino. For example, during the same call, Durante would

10

Case 1:15-cv-09874-RJS Document 7 Filed 01/06/16 Page 11 of 19

place a VGTel stock sell order on behalf of New Market or Zenith to be matched at the same
price and share amount against a VGTel stock purchase order on behalf of one of Khan's or
Werbel' s clients.
49.

The trading proceeds and funds sent to New Market or Zenith by investors were

transferred to Durante, or made available for Durante's personal use, by Ken Wise, who opened
bank accounts and trading accounts to facilitate Durante's fraudulent conduct.
