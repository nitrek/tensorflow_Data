COMPLAINT
Plaintiff United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
alleges as follows:

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 2 of 29

NATURE OF ACTION
1.

The SEC brings this action to stop an ongoing bond offering fraud by

Defendants Matthew E. White, Rodney A. Zehner, Daniel J. Merandi, and several
shell companies under their control.
2.

For nearly a decade, the defendants tried unsuccessfully to develop a

resort and amusement park complex outside of Atlanta, Georgia called “Grand
Empire Palace and Resorts.” In 2013, they attempted to fund the project by issuing
$1 billion in corporate bonds.
3.

The defendants had significant difficulty selling the bonds, which

were unrated and unsecured. They never came close to obtaining the funding
necessary for their real estate project.
4.

The defendants did, however, raise at least $5.6 million from

investors. The defendants were supposed to use these investor funds to buy a
securities portfolio, which would collateralize the bonds. But instead of using the
proceeds to collateralize the bonds, as they were required to do, the defendants
misappropriated the funds for their own personal use.
5.

Among other things, the defendants used investor money to fund

lavish shopping sprees at Saks Fifth Avenue, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Prada,
Versace, and Republic of Couture. The defendants also used investor funds to pay
numerous personal expenses and provide gifts to family and friends.
2

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 3 of 29

6.

None of the $5.6 million raised from investors went to secure the

bonds.
7.

The bonds expired in November 2015. Nevertheless, the defendants

continue to seek investors to purchase the bonds.
8.

The defendants are also currently engaged in a fraudulent scheme to

artificially inflate the value of the bonds so that their brokerage firm will allow
them to borrow against the bonds.
9.

The defendants, by virtue of their conduct, directly or indirectly, have

engaged and, unless enjoined, will continue to engage in violations of Section
17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)], and
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C.
§ 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. The Commission
seeks a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions, an
accounting, disgorgement and pre-judgment interest, civil penalties, and an asset
freeze as to each defendant.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
10.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20 and 22 of

the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t and 77v] and Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u(e)] to enjoin Defendants from engaging
in the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this complaint,
3

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 4 of 29

and transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business of similar purport and
object, for civil penalties and for other equitable relief.
11.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22 of the

Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v], Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Exchange Act
[15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa], and 28 U.S.C. § 1331.
12.

Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities

Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v], Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa], and 28
U.S.C. § 1391. Defendants White and Zehner reside in this district.
13.

Defendants, directly and indirectly, made use of the mails, and the

means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this complaint.
14.

Certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business

constituting violations of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act occurred within
the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Georgia.
15.

Defendants, unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, will continue

to engage in the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this
complaint, and in transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business of similar
purport and object.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
A.

The GEPR Trust Bond Offering

25.

In 2005, White and Zehner planned to create “Grand Empire Palace and

Resorts.”
26.

Grand Empire Palace and Resorts was a proposed $675 million resort

and amusement park complex to be located outside of Atlanta, Georgia.
27.

White’s and Zehner’s design included a water park, conference center,

6,500-seat performing arts center, hotels, restaurants, and retail shops.
28.

Between 2005 and 2009, White and Zehner did not obtain the funding

necessary for the Grand Empire Palace and Resorts project.
29.

In 2009, the planned site for the resort complex entered foreclosure.

30.

Following the 2009 foreclosure, White and Zehner began exploring

alternative ways of funding the Grand Empire Palace and Resorts project.
31.

White and Zehner eventually settled on a structured financing scheme

that involved the sale of corporate bonds.
32.

In 2012, White and Zehner formed GEPR Investments.

33.

In 2012, GEPR Investments then formed GEPR Trust for the purpose

of issuing the bonds (“the GEPR bonds”).
8

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 9 of 29

34.

On March 1, 2013, GEPR Trust (as issuer) and U.S. Bank National

Association (“U.S. Bank”) (as trustee) entered into a Trust Indenture.
35.

Zehner signed the Trust Indenture on behalf of GEPR Trust and

GEPR Investments.
36.

GEPR Trust retained investment bank Stern Brothers & Company

(“Stern Brothers”) to create a private placement memorandum (“PPM”) for its
bond issuance.
37.

On March 12, 2013, Stern Brothers issued the PPM for the bonds to

be issued by GEPR Trust.
38.

White, Zehner, and Merandi had the PPM and Trust Indenture created

for GEPR Investments and/or GEPR Trust.
39.

The PPM and Trust Indenture provide that the proceeds generated

from the sale of the GEPR bonds will go toward purchasing a securities portfolio.
40.

The securities portfolio would collateralize the GEPR bonds.

41.

The financing structure for the GEPR bonds depended upon raising $1

billion within 30 days of the issuance to create a securities portfolio that
collateralized the bonds.
42.

Returns generated by the securities portfolio were supposed to be used

to pay bondholders.

9

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 10 of 29

43.

Any remaining excess profits above the payments to bondholders

were supposed to go toward funding the Grand Empire real estate project.
44.

In March 2013, GEPR Trust issued $1 billion (face value) of

corporate bonds.
45.

On March 14, 2013, GEPR Trust sold the $1 billion of its bonds to

Grand Empire, LLC in return for a promissory note.
46.

Matthew White signed the promissory note on behalf of Grand

Empire, LLC.
47.

Rodney Zehner signed the promissory note on behalf of GEPR

Investments.
48.

The GEPR bonds were not secured.

49.

There has never been collateral backing the GEPR bonds.

50.

The GEPR bonds have never been rated by Moody’s, S&P, or any

other comparable entity.
51.

White and Zehner have attempted to get the GEPR bonds rated by

Moody’s and/or S&P, but were unable to do so.
52.

Under the terms of the promissory note, Grand Empire, LLC had

thirty business days to pay at least $953,846,154 is cash and/or escrowed securities
for the GEPR bonds.

10

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 11 of 29

53.

The cash and/or escrowed securities were to be used to collateralize

the GEPR bonds.
54.

Grand Empire, LLC did not deliver any cash or escrowed securities to

GEPR Trust within 30 business days.
55.

From April 2013 until November 2014, Grand Empire, LLC and

GEPR Trust executed five amendments to the Trust Indenture that extended the
deadline for Grand Empire, LLC to deliver the cash and/or escrowed securities as
payment for the GEPR bonds.
56.

White signed the five amendments to the Trust Indenture on behalf of

Grand Empire, LLC.
57.

Zehner signed the five amendments to the Trust Indenture on behalf

of GEPR Investments.
58.

The final deadline for Grand Empire, LLC to deliver payment for the

GEPR bonds was November 15, 2015.
59.

Grand Empire, LLC did not deliver payment for the GEPR bonds by

November 15, 2015.
60.

Grand Empire, LLC still has not delivered payment for the GEPR

bonds.

11

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 12 of 29

61.

According to Section 2.07(m) of the Trust Indenture and subsequent

amendments, if Grand Empire, LLC did not provide payment for the GEPR Bonds
by November 15, 2015, the sale of the GEPR Bonds would be null and void.
62.

Grand Empire, LLC proposed a sixth amendment to the Trust

Indenture that would extend the deadline beyond November 15, 2015. U.S. Bank,
as the Trustee, did not sign a sixth amendment to the Trust Indenture.
63.

GEPR Trust has not provided written notice to U.S. Bank that Grand

Empire failed to deliver the required payment for the GEPR Bonds.
64.

Grand Empire, LLC has not instructed the Depository Trust Company

(“DTC”) to cancel Grand Empire, LLC’s beneficial interest in the GEPR bonds as
required by section 2.07(m) of the Trust Indenture.
65.

The GEPR bonds expired on November 15, 2015.

66.

The GEPR bonds have been null and void since November 15, 2015.

B.

The Defendants Misappropriated Investor Funds

67.

White and Zehner never came close to raising the $1 billion in

funding that they originally sought and needed for their real estate project.
68.

White and Zehner did successfully obtain, with the assistance of

Merandi, more than $5.6 million from various investors through sales of the GEPR
bonds.

12

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 13 of 29

69.

White, Zehner, and Merandi did not use investor funds to establish a

securities portfolio to collateralize the GEPR bonds.
70.

Instead, White, Zehner, and Merandi spent the proceeds on personal

items, gifts to friends and family, and transfers to various business associates.
1. Western Canada Oil and Gas
71.

Western Canada Oil and Gas, Ltd. (“WCOG”), is a private energy

company based in Alberta, Canada.
72.

In January 2013, WCOG signed a joint venture agreement with Grand

Empire, LLC to create a company that would acquire interests in several oil and
gas properties in the United States.
73.

At that time, WCOG extended a bridge loan to Grand Empire, LLC to

assist Grand Empire, LLC in paying the closing fees associated with bringing their
bonds to market.
74.

WCOG also obtained a copy of the PPM and several other operating

documents from Grand Empire, all of which laid out the financing structure for the
GEPR bonds.
75.

In addition to the bridge loan, in August 2013, WCOG wired

$250,000 to Grand Empire, LLC to purchase GEPR bonds at par (i.e., at face
value).

13

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 14 of 29

76.

White told WCOG management that the proceeds received from their

bond purchase would be used to acquire securities in accordance with the
controlling documents (specifically, the PPM and the Trust Indenture).
77.

WCOG did not receive the $250,000 in GEPR bonds.

78.

Grand Empire, LLC did not use WCOG’s money to purchase

securities.
2. Lutel Primus
79.

Lutel Primus, LLC (“Lutel”) is a California-based company formed in

April 2013 for the purpose of raising capital to invest in real estate.
80.

On September 16, 2013, Lutel entered into an agreement with Grand

Empire, LLC to purchase $1 million (face value) of GEPR bonds in exchange for
$400,000 cash.
81.

According to the terms of the agreement, Grand Empire, LLC was to

buy back the bonds at face value for $1 million within 10 business days.
82.

After the initial transaction concluded, the agreement gave Lutel the

option of purchasing an additional $2.5 million in bonds for only $1 million.
Grand Empire, LLC committed again to repurchase those bonds within 10 business
days at face value.
83.

In order to induce Lutel to purchase the GEPR bonds, White made

several misrepresentations to the company.
14

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 15 of 29

84.

The agreement between Lutel and Grand Empire, LLC was signed by

White and falsely stated that the GEPR bonds were “investment grade.”
85.

White also falsely stated that the GEPR bonds had been rated

investment grade by Moody’s.
86.

White falsely stated that the bonds had “real” value in the open

market.
87.

Finally, the Lutel principals received the PPM, which falsely indicated

that the bonds would be secured by a sound securities portfolio.
88.

On September 17, 2013, Lutel wired $400,000 to Grand Empire,

LLC’s TD Ameritrade account.
89.

Grand Empire, LLC only provided Lutel with $800,000 (face value)

of GEPR bonds, instead of the $1 million in GEPR bonds that were stated in the
agreement.
90.

The defendants did not use the $400,000 from Lutel to secure the

GEPR bonds.
3. White and Zehner Misappropriated WCOG’s and Lutel’s Funds
91.

White and Zehner did not use any of the $650,000 received from

WCOG and Lutel to secure the GEPR bonds through the purchase of investmentgrade securities.

15

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 16 of 29

92.

White and Zehner instead used the funds for their own personal

benefit.
93.

White and Zehner wired WCOG’s money through several different

accounts before eventually transferring the funds to a Bank of America account
that designated White and Zehner as the owners.
94.

White and Zehner began wiring Lutel’s money to the same Bank of

America account shortly after receiving those funds.
95.

Once White and Zehner moved the proceeds from WCOG and Lutel

into the Bank of America account, they used the funds to purchase a variety of
personal goods and services.
96.

These purchases included trips to luxury stores such as Saks Fifth

Avenue, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Versace, and Republic of Couture.
97.

White and Zehner also made cash withdrawals from the account.
4. Sales Through Daniel Merandi and M&M Financial

98.

On March 25, 2014, Zehner transferred $10 million (face value) in

GEPR bonds into M&M Financial’s Fidelity brokerage account.
99.

Merandi controlled M&M Financial’s Fidelity brokerage account.

100. On May 12, 2014, Advantage Solutions Limited paid M&M Financial
$1.5 million in exchange for $3 million (face value) of GEPR bonds.

16

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 17 of 29

101. Advantage Solutions Limited purchased the bonds through a foreign
securities account managed by Rothschild Bank AG in Zurich, Switzerland.
102. On May 20, 2014, Advantage Solutions Limited purchased an
additional $7 million (face value) of GEPR bonds from M&M Financial for $3.5
million.
103. In total, Advantage Solutions paid M&M Financial $5 million for $10
million (face value) of GEPR bonds.
104. Merandi did not use the $5 million from Advantage Solutions to
secure the GEPR bonds.
105. Merandi instead gave the money to various business associates –
including White and Zehner – and transferred the rest to other bank and brokerage
accounts that he controlled.
106. Merandi transferred approximately $1.4 million in cash to M&M
Financial’s commercial bank account at BB&T.
107. Merandi disbursed the money in the BB&T account to other accounts
and spent the remainder on personal goods and services.
108. These expenditures included outings to night clubs and personal trips
where Merandi stayed in five-star accommodations (like the Greenbrier resort).
109. Merandi also gave thousands of dollars to friends and family.

17

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 18 of 29

110. Merandi used approximately $1 million of the proceeds to engage in
day trading in a TD Ameritrade account.
111. Merandi lost more than $637,000 over a 24-month period in the TD
Ameritrade account.
112. Merandi transferred an additional $1.5 million to business associates.
113. White and Zehner also received $940,000 from the Advantage
Solutions transactions.
114. Merandi sent $940,000 to Grand Empire, LLC’s Bank of America
account.
115. White and Zehner did not use any of the funds from Advantage
Solutions to secure the GEPR bonds.
116. White and Zehner spent the money received from Advantage
Solutions.
117. White, for example, spent $60,000 at a Mercedes dealership in
Atlanta, Georgia.
118. White and Zehner also made cash withdrawals from the Bank of
America account.
119. White and Zehner also transferred the funds into other accounts.

C.

The Bonds Expired in November of 2015, But the Defendants
Have Failed to Cancel Them as Required by the Trust Indenture

120. The Trust Indenture requires Grand Empire, LLC to provide $1 billion
in cash or escrowed securities to GEPR Trust within 30 days of the initial issuance.
121. The Trust Indenture states that, in the event that payment is not
received within the allotted timeframe, GEPR Trust must cause Grand Empire,
LLC to surrender its notes for cancellation and notify DTC of the cancellation of
the bonds.
122. White and Zehner have amended the Trust Indenture five times in
order to extend the date required for repayment.
123. The most recent amendment required payment by November 15,
2015. The parties have not signed any subsequent amendment to the Trust
Indenture.
124. Grand Empire, LLC has not delivered the required securities or cash
as payment for the GEPR bonds.
125. The GEPR bonds expired on November 15, 2015.
126. The GEPR bonds are now, under the terms of the offering documents,
null and void.
127. After November 15, 2015, the defendants continued trying to sell the
GEPR bonds.

19

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 20 of 29

128. As of the date of this filing, the defendants are still trying to sell the
GEPR bonds.
D.

The Defendants’ Recent Attempts to Artificially Inflate the Value
of Their Bonds

129. In December 2015, White and Zehner opened a new brokerage
account in the name of WIGEL at NMS Capital (“NMS”) in Beverly Hills,
California.
130. WIGEL is a shell company controlled by White and Zehner.
131. Shortly after opening the account at NMS, White and Zehner
transferred approximately $600 million (face value) of GEPR bonds from their
brokerage account at Interactive Brokers.
132. Upon transferring the GEPR bonds, White and Zehner attempted to
borrow against them in order to buy additional securities for their NMS account.
133. NMS denied White’s and Zehner’s request to borrow against the
GEPR bonds.
134. At the time the GEPR bonds entered White’s and Zehner’s NMS
account, the bonds did not have a price. This meant that, according to NMS’s
system, the bonds did not have a value.
135. In February 2016, WIGEL arranged the sale of $10,000 (face value)
of GEPR bonds at par to Mountaineer.

20

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 21 of 29

136. This trade was subsequently recorded in FINRA’s Trade Reporting
and Compliance Engine (“TRACE”), which caused the value of the GEPR bonds
in WIGEL’s NMS brokerage account to balloon to approximately $560 million.
137. NMS specifically asked Zehner about the relationship between
WIGEL and Mountaineer before authorizing the trade.
138. Zehner falsely stated that the two entities were not directly related.
139. In truth, Mountaineer is 100% owned by White and Zehner’s business
associate, Merandi.
140. Merandi started Mountaineer in June 2015.
141. The Mountaineer transaction created a price for the GEPR bonds.
142. Once the GEPR bonds were priced, NMS allowed WIGEL to borrow
approximately $60,000 on margin.
143. White and Zehner used the margin funds to purchase United States
Treasury bonds.
144. Executing a trade that was reported through TRACE also allows the
defendants to show potential buyers the artificial price of the GEPR bonds.
COUNT I – FRAUD
Violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act
[15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(1)]
(All Defendants)
145. Paragraphs 1 through 144 are incorporated herein by reference.
21

Case 1:16-cv-02715-WSD Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 22 of 29

146. Between in or around 2013 and the present, the defendants, in the offer
