antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 in their operation of three collateral
loan obligation funds by reporting misleading values for the assets held by the funds and failing to
disclose a conflict of interest arising from Lynn Tilton’s undisclosed approach to categorization of
assets. A prehearing schedule was set on July 20, 2016.1 Lynn Tilton, Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 4004, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2499 (A.L.J. July 20, 2016). Respondents request, and the
Division does not oppose, an addition to the schedule: that August 15, 2016, be set as the deadline
for the Division to produce 18 U.S.C. § 3500 (Jencks Act) material. Accordingly, the following
will be added to the prehearing schedule:
August 15, 2016: Division to produce 18 U.S.C. § 3500 (Jencks Act) material
IT IS SO ORDERED.
