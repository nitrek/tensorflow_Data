FUND

On December 23, 2014, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment1 (“Notice”) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans. The Notice advised interested
persons that they could obtain a copy of the proposed Plan of Distribution (“Plan”) from the
Commission’s public website at http://www.sec.gov/litigation/fairfundlist.htm or by submitting a
written request to Nancy Chase Burton, Esq., United States Securities and Exchange
Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-5631.
Two comments were submitted, one from Eiszel Lee on December 29, 2014 and one
from Annette DeLorenzo (“DeLorenzo”) on February 10, 2015. Only DeLorenzo’s comment
concerned the inclusion of additional recipients in the distribution plan.

Exchange Act Rel. No. 73921 (Dec. 23, 2014).

The staff revised the Plan to include DeLorenzo as an additional distributee (“Proposed
Amended Plan of Distribution”). The Proposed Amended Plan of Distribution provided for the
distribution of the disgorgement, prejudgment interest, additional interest, and civil penalties
paid by Respondents, less any reserve for taxes, fees, or other expenses of administering the
Amended Plan of Distribution (“Net Fair Fund”) to eligible investors according to the
methodology set forth in the Proposed Amended Plan of Distribution.
On April 26, 2016, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Amended Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment2 pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules
on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans. The Commission received no comments on the Proposed
Amended Plan of Distribution.
On June 17, 2016, the Commission issued an Order Approving Amended Plan of
Distribution.3
The Fair Fund is comprised of $346,671.45 with the Net Fair Fund being $340,870. As
set forth in paragraph 5, the Amended Plan of Distribution seeks to distribute the Net Fair Fund
to certain investors identified by Commission staff during its investigation who were harmed by
Respondents’ misappropriation of the unearned “incentive fees” described in the Order. 4 The
methodology for calculating an eligible investors’ estimated net distribution amounts is set forth
in paragraph 7 of the Amended Plan of Distribution.
The Fund Administrator, Nancy Chase Burton, Supervisory Assistant Chief Litigation
Counsel in the Commission’s Division of Enforcement’s Office of Distributions, represents that

a verified payment file has been prepared pursuant to the Amended Plan of Distribution, with a
list of payees and the amount to be paid to each person, with $340,870 being the total amount to
be disbursed. Commission staff have reviewed the payment file and request that, pursuant to
Rule 1101(b)(6) of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans,5 the
Commission direct the payment of $340,870 from the Fair Fund for distribution by the Fund
Administrator according to the Amended Plan of Distribution. Any remaining monies in the Fair
Fund will be transferred to the U.S. Treasury after a final accounting is approved by the
Commission, pursuant to paragraph 15 of the Amended Plan of Distribution.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff direct the payment of $340,870
from the Fair Fund to be distributed to injured investors pursuant to the Amended Plan of
Distribution.

By the Commission.
