and lower.
1.2 This policy is aimed at preparing a framework in which non-teaching staff with nontechnical qualifications, in the grades N5 and below, will be recruited only on
contractual basis, as these positions present very little scope for inherent career
growth. The employees in these grades will be encouraged to improve their skills
and acquire higher education and use the current experience to move on to better
career path elsewhere in due course.
1.3 However, non-teaching staff with technical qualifications, who may typically be
diploma holders, will be employed on regular rolls of the organization.

2.1 The objective of this policy is to provide guidelines and procedure to recruit
employees in non-teaching and non-technical positions on a contractual basis, for a
specified period.
3. Eligibility and Applicability

grades N5 and below
3.2 The employees on outsourced rolls are not covered under this policy

4. Recruitment Procedure
The procedure for contractual engagement of staff involves the following:
4.1 That a position is contractual, and the duration of the contract must be clearly
outlined even before the process of recruitment begins, and so specified in
advertisements, or other communication.

4.4 After the finalization of the candidate, and before doing the salary negotiation, it will
once again be reiterated to the candidate that this is a contractual position.
4.5 Salary fitment will be done as per the existing band in that particular grade and take
into account concerns of internal consistency.
4.6 Salary details will not be provided to potential candidates either via email or on

offer to negotiate other offers elsewhere as bargaining chips.
4.7 Appointment letter, together with salary stack up, will be issued for the contractual
employment.
5. Statutory Benefits: Contractual employees shall be entitled to statutory benefits like, PF
and ESI, as applicable. They will also be covered for medical insurance as per the

6. Leave eligibility: Contract employees will be eligible for 30 days of leave in a calendar
year. The leave shall be availed for any number of days based on prior approval of

8. Performance Evaluation: Performance evaluation of the contract staff will be done by
the concerned HOD at the end of first 6 months and thereafter, after completion of one
year, as well as at the time of the expiry of the contract, in case the candidate is to be
considered for further employment. HR will send the performance evaluation form to the
concerned HOD at least one month in advance.
