TO:

Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee (EMSAC)

FROM:

EMSAC Customer Issues Subcommittee

DATE:

April 19, 2016

SUBJECT:

Customer Issues Subcommittee Status Report

_________________________________________________________________________________
Subcommittee Description
This Subcommittee will consider initiatives to protect investor interests and promote investor
confidence. The Subcommittee is charged with assessing retail investor concerns such as trading
practices and potential conflicts of interests, and making recommendations to the full Committee
that would support more granular information to investors and enhance transparency. Topics
include issues around meaningful execution quality and review of order routing disclosures
(Rules 605 and 606), payment for order flow, as well as processes to educate retail customers on
order types and market volatility.

Current Status
• The primary focus of the Customer Issues Subcommittee has revolved around four topics:
(1) understanding retail investor perspective on equity market structure, (2) use of stop
order types by retail customers, (3) review execution quality statistics from a retail
perspective, and (4) payment for order flow. Our progress to date on each of these topics
is provided below.
• We have met with a group of retail broker dealers and reviewed their recommendations.
We expect to meet with other market participants including the co-chairs of the Market
Structure subcommittee of the SEC Investor Advisory Committee and other industry
groups.
• We also expect to review institutional order routing/execution quality issues as they relate
to Rule 605/606 and proposed SEC rulemaking.
• The Customer Issues Subcommittee expects to make a final recommendation to the
EMSAC at the 3Q2016 full committee meeting.
Progress to Date
1. Retail Investor Perception of Equity Market Structure
• Since the February EMSAC meeting, we have had further discussions on the benefits of
understanding retail investor perception of equity market structure in a standardized
manner and on an ongoing basis.
• Members of the subcommittee have reached out to the SEC's Office of the Investor
Advocate (OIAD) to understand their expected survey activity.
• Additionally, we are in the process of reviewing academic studies and surveys
specifically focused on investor sentiment. We expect to complete our review of these

studies over the next several weeks and make a recommendation on how the Commission
can assess retail investor perception of the equity markets on a regular basis.
2. Use of Stop Order Types by Retail Investors
• The subcommittee discussed the use of stop orders, particularly by retail investors, and
the operation of stop orders in volatile market conditions.
• As a general matter, the subcommittee concluded that stop orders are, and continue to be,
a useful tool for investors to mitigate investment risk. However, the subcommittee also
recognized that these order types by their terms may execute at prices significantly
inferior to the market prices that prevail when customers enter them, particularly during
periods of extreme market volatility, such as the trading that occurred on August 24th.
• The subcommittee believes that firms should review their practices regarding stop orders,
with an emphasis on educating investors regarding the risks and benefits of stop orders
and special considerations around the use of stop orders during volatile market
conditions.
o Firms should consider providing targeted training to registered representatives
regarding the risks associated with stop orders and, where appropriate, making
alternative recommendations to meet customer objectives.
o Firms that allow customers to enter stop orders directly online should ensure that
clear and comprehensive disclosures are prominently provided prior to or at the
time of order entry.
o Firms also should consider implementing other systemic safeguards around the
use of stop orders, such as preventing stop orders that do not include a limit price
or restricting the time of day during which a stop order may be executed.
• The subcommittee recommends that the SEC and FINRA consider issuing additional
guidance to further emphasize the importance of these effective practices relating to stop
orders.
3. Enhancements/Expansion of Execution Quality Reports
Execution Quality Reports at the Individual Broker-Dealer Level
• Today, Rule 605 requires market centers 1 to publish reports. Broker-dealers who route
order flow to other execution venues only produce Rule 606 reports. The subcommittee
sees value in expanding Rule 605 to include all broker-dealers with a possible exception
for small broker dealers.
• While there would be compliance and implementation costs, the use of third party
vendors may mitigate some of these concerns.
• By having all broker dealers provide Rule 605 data, there would be opportunity for
market participants, academics and the press to evaluate these statistics in a consistent
manner.

As defined by Regulation NMS, market center means any exchange market maker, OTC market
maker, alternative trading system, national securities exchange, or national securities association.

Access to Execution Quality Reports
• The subcommittee believes access to Rule 605 and Rule 606 reports should be readily
available in a centralized location.
• The SEC’s existing Market Structure Data and Analysis website could act as the
repository for this data. There may also be opportunities to allow for visualization of this
data leveraging the SEC’s Data Visualization Tool.
Enhancements to Rule 605/606 Reports
• The subcommittee agrees that the general principles of standardization and meaningful
disclosure should guide changes to Rule 605/606.
• Based on an evaluation of Rule 605 and Rule 606 from a retail perspective including
discussions with retail broker dealers and a review of issues raised in comment letters,
the subcommittee believes there is opportunity for enhancements.
• Retail-focused Rule 605 enhancements could include the following:
o Inclusion of odd-lots
o Segregation of Immediate or Cancel (IOC) orders
o Inclusion of “quoted spread” and “enhanced liquidity”
o Revision of FAQs regarding methodology to assign an NBBO for orders received
in the same second as a quote change
• Retail-focused Rule 606 enhancements could include the following:
o Instead of dividing data by listing markets, consider division by S&P 500 and
Other NMS equities
o Inclusion of a new section for OTC Equity Data
o Segregation of data currently in the “Other” category including market
open/close orders, stop/stop on quote orders with odd-lots represented in their
appropriate category
o Consistent identification of routing destination across Rule 606 reporters
o Inclusion of plain English descriptions, definitions and FAQs
o Possible segregation of market orders, marketable limit orders, and nonmarketable orders
o Include execution quality statistics by routing destination
• Evaluating Rule 605/Rule 606 from an institutional perspective was tabled pending the
release of SEC rulemaking related to institutional execution quality. Prior to the 3Q2016
EMSAC meeting, we expect to revisit this issue and seek input from market participants.
The subcommittee expects to cover institutional execution quality issues in its final
recommendation.
4. Payment for Order Flow
• The subcommittee has not come to a consensus on action with respect to payment for
order flow. Discussions spanned several topics including prohibiting the use of payment
for order flow, managing conflicts of interest and opportunities for enhancing existing or
requiring new disclosures.
