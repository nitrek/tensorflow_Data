In the Matter of
GREG RUEHLE

ORDER RESCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
in this matter on May 10, 2016. Respondent shall file an answer to the OIP’s allegations within
twenty days after service of the OIP. See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). However, as
represented by the Division of Enforcement in its declaration submitted yesterday, attempts to
serve Respondent have been unsuccessful.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the telephonic prehearing conference currently
scheduled for June 8, 2016, is RESCHEDULED for July 12, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern. It is
FURTHER ORDERED that a copy of this order shall be served on Respondent, along with the
OIP. I direct the Division to file a declaration regarding the status of service by July 8, 2016,
and, if service has been accomplished by then, to provide supporting evidence.
