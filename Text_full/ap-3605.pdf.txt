ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE, POSTPONING
HEARING, AND SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On January 21, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting administrative proceedings (OIP) against Respondents, pursuant to Section 12(j) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A hearing is scheduled for February 16, 2016.
On January 29, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service,
establishing that service of the OIP was made on Respondents by January 28, 2016, in
accordance with Commission Rule of Practice 141(a)(2)(ii). 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii). As
such, Respondents’ answers to the OIP were due by February 10, 2016, as service was effected
by mail. OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160, .220(b). To date, Respondents have not filed answers.
Accordingly, I ORDER that on or before February 22, 2016, each Respondent shall
SHOW CAUSE why the registration of its securities should not be revoked by default due to its
failure to file an answer or otherwise defend this proceeding. If a Respondent fails to respond to
this order, it will be deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined against it, and the
registration of its securities will be revoked. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
I FURTHER ORDER that the hearing scheduled for February 16, 2016, is POSTPONED
sine die, and a telephonic prehearing conference shall be held on March 8, 2016, at 10:00 a.m.
EST, if the proceeding has not been resolved before then.
