COMPLAINT
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission" or "SEC") alleges as follows
for its complaint against defendants Daniel Rivera, Matthew Rivera and Robbins Lane Properties
Inc. ("Robbins Lane", and, together with Daniel Rivera and Matthew Rivera, "Defendants") and
relief defendants Rivera & Associates (a/k/a Strategic Wealth Partners of New Jersey) ("Rivera
& Associates") and Daniel Rivera Inc.:

SUMMARY
1.

Defendants Daniel Rivera and Matthew Rivera, who are brothers, engaged in a

fraudulent Ponzi scheme, where Daniel Rivera falsely promised investors they would share in the
profits of Robbins Lane, a real estate venture that bought, redeveloped and sold properties. In

1

Case 3:16-cv-01636-MLC-DEA Document 1 Filed 03/24/16 Page 2 of 14 PagelD: 2

fact, Robbins Lane, which was owned by Matthew Rivera, was a sham. Daniel Rivera and
Matthew Rivera misappropriated investor funds for their personal benefit.
2.

From 2008 through at least 2014, Daniel Rivera solicited approximately $2.7

million from approximately 30 investors. Daniel Rivera preyed on a number of elderly,
unsophisticated investors, at times recommending that they liquidate other holdings, including
retirement assets, to invest in Robbins Lane. Investor funds were deposited into Robbins Lane
bank accounts, which Matthew Rivera opened and controlled.
3.

Robbins Lane was founded by Daniel Rivera and Matthew Rivera in 2008

purportedly to develop and sell real estate. In reality, Robbins Lane did not have any employees
and had no operations.
4.

Instead of investing in real estate, hundreds of thousands of dollars of investor

funds were misused to pay other investors. The remainder of the funds was misappropriated to
enrich Daniel Rivera, Matthew Rivera, and other family members and associates. For example,
investor funds were used to purchase tickets for sporting events, to pay for college tuition and
sorority dues for Daniel Rivera's daughter, to pay personal credit card bills, for transfers to two
entities that Daniel Rivera controlled, Relief Defendants Rivera & Associates and Daniel Rivera
Inc., and for transfers to a janitorial business in which Matthew Rivera was a partner.
5.

By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Daniel Rivera violated

Section 17(a} of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"} [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a}], and Section
lO(b} of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"} [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b}], and Rule
lOb-5 [17 C.F .R. § 240. lOb-5] thereunder, which are antifraud provisions, and unless restrained
and enjoined will engage in future violations of these provisions.

6.

By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Matthew Rivera and

Robbins Lane violated Sections 17(a)(l) and (3) of the Securities Act [ 15 U.S.C. § § 77q(a)(l)
and (3)], and Section lO(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c)
[17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5(a) and (c)] thereunder, which are antifraudprovisions, and unless
restrained and enjoined will engage in future violations of these provisions.
7.

The Commission seeks an order enjoining Defendants from future violations,

requiring Daniel Rivera and Matthew Rivera to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment
interest, and imposing monetary penalties. The Commission also seeks an order requiring Relief
Defendants Rivera & Associates and Daniel Rivera Inc. to disgorge their ill-gotten gains.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
8.

The Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the

Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§
78u and 78aa].
9.

Venue is proper in the District of New Jersey pursuant to Section 22(a) of the

Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]
because many of the acts, transactions, practices and courses of business constituting the
violations occurred in this district. Among other acts in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme
alleged herein, Daniel Rivera solicited investors in New Jersey who were offered and purchased
securities issued by or through Robbins Lane. Matthew Rivera accepted into the Robbins Lane
bank accounts funds from investors residing in New Jersey and wrote checks to these investors.
Moreover, Daniel Rivera maintained an office in this district that was visited by certain investors
in Robbins Lane and that was occasionally used by Matthew Rivera. One of the Relief

instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce, and the mails.
DEFENDANTS
11.

Daniel Rivera, age 46, is a resident of Staten Island, New York, who maintains

an office in New Jersey. From approximately 1995 to the present, Daniel Rivera has been
associated with more than ten registered broker-dealers and/or financial advisors. Daniel Rivera

was affiliated with the firm during some of the time he engaged in the fraudulent conduct
outlined in this Complaint. Daniel Rivera also sold insurance products and annuities through
Daniel Rivera Inc. and Rivera & Associates.
12.

Matthew Rivera, age 48, is a resident of Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania. Matthew

Rivera founded Robbins Lane with Daniel Rivera, and is its sole owner, sole officer and
President. Matthew Rivera works as a contractor for a company that, among other things,

Saylorsburg-based company that provides janitorial, landscaping and snow removal services.
13.

Robbins Lane Properties Inc. ("Robbins Lane") was incorporated in

Pennsylvania in March 2008. The company was used as a vehicle through which Daniel Rivera
and Matthew Rivera perpetrated their fraud.

RELIEF DEFENDANTS
14.

Daniel Rivera Inc. was incorporated by Daniel Rivera, its sole owner, in New

York on June 9, 2008. According to its tax returns, the company's principal business is
investment planning.

15.

Rivera & Associates was incorporated by Daniel Rivera, its sole owner, in New

Jersey on November 23, 2011. According to the company's website, Rivera & Associates
specializes in retirement income planning.

DEFENDANTS' VIOLATIONS
A.

Daniel Rivera And Matthew Rivera Founded Robbins Lane
16.

Daniel Rivera and Matthew Rivera founded Robbins Lane in March 2008.

17.

Shortly after founding Robbins Lane, Matthew Rivera opened a Robbins Lane

checking account. In May 2012, Matthew Rivera opened a Robbins Lane savings account.
Matthew Rivera had control over, and was the sole signatory on, both of these accounts.
18.

Robbins Lane never had any employees and engaged in no operations. Robbins

Lane never "redeveloped" any real estate, nor did it pursue any real estate investment activities
designed to generate returns for its investors. During the entire time that Daniel Rivera was
raising money from investors, Robbins Lane never sold or even attempted to sell any real estate.
Robbins Lane was instead used as a vehicle to defraud primarily elderly investors in order to
enrich Daniel Rivera, Matthew Rivera, as well as their family and associates.

5

Case 3:16-cv-01636-MLC-DEA Document 1 Filed 03/24/16 Page 6 of 14 PagelD: 6

B.

Daniel Rivera and Robbins Lane Raised Approximately $2.7 Million From About
30 Investors and Daniel Rivera Made False and Misleading Statements to Investors
19.

Despite the fact that Robbins Lane had no business operations, from 2008 through

2014, Daniel Rivera raised, and Mathew Rivera accepted into the Robbins Lane bank accounts,
approximately $2.7 million from approximately 30 investors in Robbins Lane.
20.

Daniel Rivera targeted a number of elderly unsophisticated retirees, some of

whom were ill. He met some investors through his associations with various investment
advisory and broker dealer firms. He met other investors through his insurance business, events
he hosted and advertised on websites and in local newspapers, or referrals from acquaintances.
21.

Around the time of Robbins Lane's formation, Daniel Rivera created a Robbins

Lane brochure, which Matthew Rivera reviewed. Daniel Rivera provided the brochure to
Robbins Lane investors. The brochure contains false statements, including that:
•

Robbins Lane ''provides an opportunity for the senior investor to share in the
profits from prudent investments in real estate."

•

Robbins Lane "seek[s] out undervalued real estate properties for either resale or
redevelopment to make significant profits."

•

"Our enduring goal is to provide our investors a viable, guaranteed income stream
based on those investments."

•

Robbins Lane has "an experienced staff of real estate investment specialists."

•

Robbins Lane positions "properties for redevelopment or immediate resale at
profit yields markedly above market average."

•

"Senior investors are able to share in our investment portfolio by lending us
money to invest in real estate."

•

"Investing in real estate with Robbins Lane Properties gives the senior investor a
guaranteed monthly income for a contracted amount oftime.u

•

Robbins Lane's ''rate of return is based on secure real estate investments in the
Robbins Lane portfolio."

•

Robbins Lane has "a record of success."
6

Case 3:16-cv-01636-MLC-DEA Document 1 Filed 03/24/16 Page 7of14 PagelD: 7

22.

Each of these statements was false and/or misleading when made to investors.

Robbins Lane, in fact, had no real estate portfolio, had never redeveloped or sold any real estate,
had no record of success, never had any employees (much less a staff of real estate investment
specialists), and had no ability to provide income to investors (much less "guaranteed'' income).
23.

Daniel Rivera also created the content of a publicly available Robbins Lane

website that aimed to attract investors and which Matthew Rivera reviewed. Robbins Lane's
website contained the same misstatements as did the brochure that was provided to investors.
Additionally, it included purported testimonials from individuals falsely portrayed as having
invested in Robbins Lane, including one testimonial from a relative of Daniel Rivera and
Matthew Rivera. Matthew Rivera was listed as a contact on the Robbins Lane website.
24.

Daniel Rivera recommended that some investors liquidate their existing securities

portfolios and other investments, such as annuities or life insurance policies, in order to invest in
Robbins Lane, which he falsely represented was an established company that invested in real
estate. He also encouraged one investor to take out a mortgage on her home in order to invest
over $300,000 in Robbins Lane.
25.

Some investors received documents relating to their investments in Robbins Lane

that were titled, "Promissory Note.'' The notes state that Robbins Lane will pay the investor a
predetermined amount of principal by a date certain-typically several years after the
investment--along with interest.
26.

At least one investor received a document titled, "Investment Contract." The

Investment Contract falsely claimed, among other things, that Robbins Lane would formulate an
"investment strategy" and invest $165,000 on behalf of the investor and further stated that the
investor would receive a return equal to "a minimum of' six percent annually.

C.

Daniel Rivera and Matthew Rivera Misappropriated and Misused Funds Received
From Investors
27.

Investor funds were deposited into, and pooled in, two Robbins Lane bank

accounts.
28.

Matthew Rivera was the only authorized signatory on the accounts. Daniel

Rivera, however, also exercised control over the flow of funds into and out of the accounts.
Specifically, he had online account access, facilitated wire transfers from investors into the
accounts, directed that certain payments be made to investors and others from the accounts, and
directly wrote checks from the checking account.
As detailed further below, Daniel Rivera and Matthew Rivera misused investor

29.

money to pay other investors, and misappropriated funds for their personal benefit or for the
benefit of their family and other associates. Daniel and Matthew Rivera directed and/or
facilitated each of the payments described below.
a.

Funds Used To Pay Other Investors. Hundreds of thousands of dollars of
the funds was misused to pay other investors and create the false impression
that Robbins Lane was generating investment returns. For example, in June
2013, an investment of $133,000 into Robbins Lane by one investor funded, at
least in part, payments totaling nearly $81,000 to another investor. In another
example, in April 2014, investments totaling around $145,000 from two
investors were used to pay nearly $120,000 to two other investors the
following month.

b.

Payments to Daniel Rivera and ms Affiliated Entities. Daniel Rivera and
two entities he controlled, Daniel Rivera Inc. and Rivera & Associates,
received nearly $800,000 directly from Robbins Lane. Neither Daniel Rivera
Inc. nor Rivera & Associates performed any services for or on behalf of
Robbins Lane.

c.

Payments Benefitting Matthew Rivera. Matthew Rivera also misused
investor funds. For example, in June 2011, Matthew Rivera issued a check
from Robbins Lane to himself for $60,000. In December 2011, he wrote a
check from Robbins Lane to his janitorial business for $40,000, purportedly as
8

Case 3:16-cv-01636-MLC-DEA Document 1 Filed 03/24/16 Page 9 of 14 PagelD: 9

a loan. After the Commission began its investigation, Matthew Rivera repaid
to Robbins Lane a substantial portion of the funds that he withdrew, which
were, in turn, repaid to investors.

30.

d.

Payments for Homes for Use by Family Members. In 2012, Robbins Lane
used $94,000 to purchase a condominium that, at one point, was occupied by a
relative of Matthew Rivera. Also in 2012, Robbins Lane put a $20,000 down
payment on a house where Daniel and Matthew Rivera's mother lives.
Robbins Lane did not "redevelop" the condominium or the house for resale at
a profit. Robbins Lane did not purchase or acquire rights to any properties
besides these two properties. After the Commission began investigating
Robbins Lane, the condominium was sold and the proceeds were distributed
to investors.

e.

Payment of Other Non-Business Emenses. The remaining funds raised
from investors were paid to associates of Daniel Rivera, or were used to pay
other non-business expenses, including, New York Jets tickets, New York
Yankees tickets, college tuition and sorority dues for Daniel Rivera's
daughter, expenses relating to Daniel Rivera's insurance business, and
payments of personal credit card and cable bills.
Daniel Rivera and Matthew Rivera concealed the misuse of investor funds by

submitting false tax returns for Robbins Lane from 2008 through 2014, which Daniel Rivera
helped prepare and Matthew Rivera signed. Among other things, the tax returns failed to
disclose that Robbins Lane raised money from and owed money to investors.
