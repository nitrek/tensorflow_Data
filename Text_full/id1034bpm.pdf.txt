INITIAL DECISION ON DEFAULT
AS TO JINZANGHUANG TIBET
PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
July 11, 2016

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Brenda P. Murray, Chief Administrative Law Judge

On May 20, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
JinZangHuang Tibet Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Respondent) has securities registered with the
Commission and is delinquent in its periodic filings.1 Respondent was served with the OIP on
May 23, 2016, and its answer was due June 6. Dragon Bright Mintai Botanical Tech. Cayman
Ltd., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3887, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1948 (ALJ June 1, 2016).
Respondent did not appear at a prehearing conference on June 8, 2016, nor did it file an
answer. Dragon Bright Mintai Botanical Tech. Cayman Ltd., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No.
3913, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2079, at *1 (ALJ June 13, 2016). On June 13, 2016, I ordered
Respondent to show cause by June 23, 2016, why the registration of its securities should not be
revoked by default to its failure to file an answer, appear at the prehearing conference, or
otherwise defend the proceeding. Id. at *3. To date, Respondent has not responded to the show
cause order. Respondent is therefore in default for failing to appear at the prehearing conference,
file an answer, or otherwise defend the proceeding. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(1)(2), .220(f), .221(f). Accordingly, I find the allegations in the OIP to be true as to Respondent.

This proceeding has ended with respect to Macau Resources Group Ltd., which settled. See
Dragon Bright Mintai Botanical Tech. Cayman Ltd., Exchange Act Release No. 78231 (July 6,
2016). The proceeding is stayed with respect to Dragon Bright Mintai Botanical Technology
Cayman Ltd., based on its agreement in principle to a settlement. Dragon Bright Mintai
Botanical Tech. Cayman Ltd., Admin Proc. Rulings Release No. 3957, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2293
(ALJ June 29, 2016).

Findings of Fact
JinZangHuang Tibet Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Central Index Key No. 910832, is a void
Delaware corporation located in Shandong Province, China, with a class of securities registered
with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its
periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form
10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2013. As of May 9, 2016, the company’s stock (symbol
“JZHG”) was quoted on OTC Link, had six market makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback”
exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
In addition to its repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, Respondent failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to it by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance
requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations, or through its failure to maintain a
valid address on file with the Commission, did not receive such letters.
Conclusions of Law
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require issuers of securities
registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the
Commission current and accurate information in annual and quarterly reports, even if the
registration is voluntary under Exchange Act Section 12(g). See 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1,
.13a-13. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and may not be subject to
conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511,
2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), mot. for recons. denied, Exchange Act Release
No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not required to establish
violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and rules thereunder. See SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d
732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978). By failing to
timely file required periodic reports, Respondent violated Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules
13a-1 and 13a-13.
Sanction
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
the registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining the public interest or what sanctions will
adequately protect investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness
of the issuer’s violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of
culpability involved, the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure
future compliance, and the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.”
Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *1920 (May 31, 2006).
Respondent’s failures to file required periodic reports are serious because they violate a
central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is “to supply investors
with current and accurate financial information about an issuer so that they may make sound
[investment] decisions.” Id. at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that
Congress fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate
2

misrepresentations in the sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st
Cir. 1977). Respondent’s violations are also recurrent in that Respondent repeatedly failed to file
periodic reports for several years. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21, 2009); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008).
Respondent is culpable because it knew, or should have known, of its obligation to file
periodic reports. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 249.308a, .310 (Commission Forms 10-Q, 10-K); ChinaBiotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4,
2013) (holding that scienter is not necessary to establish grounds for revocation); Robert L.
Burns, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 3260, 2011 SEC LEXIS 2722, at *41 n.60
(Aug. 5, 2011) (stating that the Commission has “repeatedly held that ignorance of the securities
laws is not a defense to liability thereunder”). By not participating in this proceeding,
Respondent forfeited an opportunity to show it has made efforts to remedy its past violations and
to offer assurances against further violations.
On these facts, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke the
registration of each class of Respondent’s registered securities
Order
I ORDER that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
registration of each class of registered securities of Respondent JinZangHuang Tibet
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Rule of Practice 360. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, I FURTHER ORDER
that a party may file a petition for review of this initial decision within twelve days after service
of the initial decision. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(b). A party may also file a motion to correct a
manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision, pursuant to Rule of Practice 111. See
17 C.F.R. § 201.111. If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a party
shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the order resolving such
motion to correct a manifest error of fact. The initial decision will not become final until the
Commission enters an order of finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a
party files a petition for review or motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission
determines on its own initiative to review the initial decision as to a party. If any of these events
occur, the initial decision shall not become final as to that party.
In addition, a respondent has the right to file a motion to set aside a default within a
reasonable time, stating the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and specifying the nature of
the proposed defense. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). The Commission can set aside a default at any time
for good cause. Id.
