EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time
until June 30, 2015 to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of
the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 CFR 201.1101(a).
On August 14, 2014, the Commission issued an Order Instituting
Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial
Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against Linkbrokers Derivatives
LLC (“Linkbrokers” or “Respondent”).1 The Order required Respondent to pay
disgorgement of $14,000,000 to the Commission within 14 days of the entry of the
Order.
In its request for an extension of time, the Division states that it requires
additional time because a fund administrator needs to be appointed, which includes
development of a proposal to solicit potential fund administrators, evaluation of the

Exchange Act Release No. 72846 (Aug. 14, 2014).

proposals received from the potential fund administrators, and the selection of a fund
administrator, and the fund administrator’s bond amount set. Once a fund
administrator is appointed, a proposed plan of distribution must be developed in
conjunction with the selected fund administrator.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the
Division’s request for an extension of time until June 30, 2015 to submit a proposed
Plan of Distribution is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Secretary
