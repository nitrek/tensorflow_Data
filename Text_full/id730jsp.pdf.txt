INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
January 2, 2015

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Jason S. Patil, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision revokes the registrations of Respondents’ registered securities. The
revocations are based on Respondents’ failure to timely file required periodic reports with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On December 3, 2014, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative
Proceedings (OIP) against Respondents, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The OIP alleges that Respondents each have a class of securities registered with the
Commission and are delinquent in their periodic filings. Respondents were served with the OIP by
December 6, 2014, and their Answers were due by December 19, 2014. See Alamosa (Delaware),
Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 2117, 2014 SEC LEXIS 4748 (Dec. 10, 2014). Moreover,
Respondents were warned that “[a]ny Respondent that fails to file an Answer within the time
provided will be deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined against it, and the
registration of its securities will be revoked.” Id. To date, no Respondent has filed an Answer.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Respondents are in default for failing to file Answers or otherwise defend the proceeding.
See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, as authorized by Rule of Practice

155(a), I find the following allegations in the OIP to be true. I take official notice of the
Commission’s public official records concerning Respondents. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.323.
Alamosa (Delaware), Inc., Central Index Key (CIK) No. 1097722, is a Delaware corporation
located in Reston, Virginia, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). Alamosa is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission,
having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31,
2006.
Amazing Investments, Inc., CIK No. 1101353, is a Wyoming corporation located in Draper,
Utah, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section
12(g). Amazing Investments is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not
filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-QSB for the period ended June 30, 2004.
American Frontiers Marketing Co., CIK No. 1101915, is a dissolved Wyoming corporation
located in Tucson, Arizona, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). American Frontiers is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-QSB for the period
ended March 31, 2005, which reported a net loss of $12,906 from the company’s October 20, 1999,
inception to March 31, 2005.
American Growth Fund I LP, CIK No. 924977, is a California corporation located in Las
Vegas, Nevada, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g). American Growth Fund I is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission,
having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10 registration statement on April 1, 1996.
Americas Gaming International, Inc., CIK No. 818475, is a void Delaware corporation
located in Reno, Nevada, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). Americas Gaming is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-QSB for the period
ended September 30, 1996, which reported a net loss of over $1.68 million for the prior nine
months.
Mammoth Mining Co., CIK No. 61796, is a Nevada corporation located in Salt Lake City,
Utah, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section
12(g). Mammoth Mining is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed
any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10 registration statement on January 2, 2002.
In addition to their repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, Respondents failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance
requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations or, through their failure to maintain a
valid address on file with the Commission, did not receive such letters.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require public corporations to file
annual and quarterly reports with the Commission. Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file
annual reports and Rule 13a-13 requires domestic issuers to file quarterly reports. See 17 C.F.R.
2

§§ 240.13a-1, .13a-13. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and may not be subject
to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511,
2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867,
2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not required to establish violations of Exchange
Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13. See SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir.
1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978). Respondents failed to timely file
required periodic reports. As a result, Respondents failed to comply with Exchange Act Section
13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
SANCTIONS
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary or
appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend for a
period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, that the
issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the Exchange Act or rules
thereunder. In determining the public interest or what is necessary or appropriate for the protection
of investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s
violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved, the
extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and the
credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Respondents’ failure to file required periodic reports is serious because it violates a central
provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is “to supply investors with
current and accurate financial information about an issuer so that they may make sound
[investment] decisions.” Id. at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that Congress
fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate misrepresentations
in the sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977).
Respondents’ violations are also recurrent in that each repeatedly failed to file periodic reports. See
Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20
(Jan. 21, 2009) (respondent failed to file seven required periodic reports due over a two-year
period); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26
(May 23, 2008) (respondent’s failure to make eight filings over an eighteen-month period
considered recurrent).
Additionally, Respondents are culpable because they knew, or should have known, of their
obligation to file periodic reports. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 249.308a, .310 (Commission Forms 10-Q, 10K); Robert L. Burns, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 3260, 2011 SEC LEXIS 2722,
at *40 n.60 (Aug. 5, 2011) (stating that the Commission has “repeatedly held that ignorance of the
securities laws is not a defense to liability thereunder”). In fact, Respondents failed to heed
delinquency letters sent to them by the Division of Corporation Finance or, through their failure to
maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not
receive such letters, and they were therefore on notice, even before the OIP issued, of their
obligation to file periodic reports. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013
SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that revocation may be warranted even
without proof that a respondent was aware of its reporting obligations). Finally, Respondents have
not answered the OIP or otherwise participated in the proceeding to address whether they have
3

made any efforts to remedy their past violations, and have made no assurances against further
violations.
On these facts, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke the
registrations of each class of the registered securities of Respondents.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
registrations of each class of registered securities of Respondents Alamosa (Delaware), Inc.,
Amazing Investments, Inc., American Frontiers Marketing Co., American Growth Fund I LP,
Americas Gaming International, Inc., and Mammoth Mining Co. are hereby REVOKED.
This Initial Decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions of
Rule of Practice 360. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, a party may file a petition for
review of this Initial Decision within twenty-one days after service of the Initial Decision. A party may
also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the Initial Decision, pursuant to
Rule of Practice 111. 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by
a party, then that party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the
undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
This Initial Decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion to
correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the Initial
Decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the Initial Decision shall not become final as to
that party.
Respondents are notified that they may move to set aside the default in this case. Rule of
Practice 155(b) permits the Commission, at any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order
to prevent injustice and on such conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A
motion to set aside a default shall be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure
to appear or defend, and specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
