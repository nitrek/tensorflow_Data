B.
Whether it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to suspend
for a period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of each class of securities
registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act of the Respondent, and any successor under
Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3, and any new corporate names of the Respondent.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on
the questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and
before an Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.

allegations contained in this Order within ten (10) days after service of this Order, as provided by

If Respondent fails to file the directed Answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being
duly notified, the Respondent, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3, and
any new corporate names of any Respondent, may be deemed in default and the proceedings may

engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually
related proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except
as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule
