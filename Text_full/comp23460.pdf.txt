DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Case 2:16-cv-00833 Document 1 Filed 02/05/16 Page 2 of 20 Page ID #:2

Plaintiff U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) alleges the

1
2

following against Defendants Robert M. Munakash (“Munakash”), Carlos A.

3

Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”), and Marc Winters (“Winters”):
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4
1.

5

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d)(1),

6

21(d)(3)(A), 21(e) and 27(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange

7

Act”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(1), 78u(d)(3)(A), 78u(e) & 78aa(a).
2.

8
9

Venue is proper in this district under Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act,

15 U.S.C. §78aa(a), because the defendants reside in this judicial district and because

10

certain of the transactions, acts, practices and courses of conduct constituting

11

violations of the federal securities laws occurred within this district.
SUMMARY

12
3.

13
14

This action concerns insider trading by Defendants Munakash, Rodriguez,

and Marc Winters in the securities of GSI Commerce Inc. (“GSIC”).
4.

15

In the weeks leading up to the March 2011 public announcement that

16

eBay Inc. intended to buy GSIC, Munakash, Rodriguez and Winters purchased or

17

caused to be purchased more than $600,000 of GSIC securities.
5.

18

Having never invested in GSIC prior to February 2011, Defendants made

19

their purchases based on material nonpublic information that Munakash

20

misappropriated from his good friend, a GSIC executive (“Executive A”).
6.

21

Shortly before the trading at issue, Executive A became the Executive

22

Vice President of Strategic Business Development (“EVP of Strategic Business

23

Development”) and was extremely busy traveling from coast to coast, meeting with

24

private equity firms and eBay about the possibility of either taking GSIC private or

25

having eBay acquire it.
7.

26

While transitioning to this new role, Executive A confided in Munakash

27

about these new stresses at work.

1

8.

When Munakash and Executive A traveled together to the Super Bowl

2

during February 4-7, 2011, Executive A continued to confide in Munakash, and

3

discussed with Munakash his work on these potential transactions. In particular, he

4

told Munakash that he was excited about a meeting in New York City the following

5

Thursday, February 10, during which he expected a private equity firm to make an

6

offer to buy GSIC and take it private. Further, Executive A explained to Munakash that

7

even if a deal with a private equity firm did not work out, another company had

8

expressed interest in acquiring GSIC.

9
10
11

9.

Munakash inquired about the deals that Executive A was working on and

asked what they would mean for Executive A’s career.
10.

The morning after returning from the Super Bowl, Munakash

12

misappropriated the material nonpublic information Executive A shared with him in

13

confidence, by both buying GSIC stock for himself and tipping Defendants Rodriguez

14

and Winters.

15

11.

A few weeks after the Super Bowl trip, on February 28, Executive A and

16

his wife hosted Munakash, his wife, and a few other close friends for an intimate

17

dinner to celebrate Executive A’s birthday.

18

12.

During the dinner, Executive A shared information with Munakash on the

19

status of the deals to acquire GSIC. For instance, he confided in Munakash that the

20

GSIC Board of Directors would be taking over the negotiations with the company that

21

was interested in acquiring GSIC.

22

13.

The following morning, March 1, Munakash again misappropriated

23

material nonpublic information which he learned from Executive A. Munakash tipped

24

his mentee, Rodriguez, who purchased another $9,000 of GSIC that morning. Further,

25

Munakash used the information to buy nearly $200,000 of GSIC on margin in his

26

parents’ trading account.

27
28

14.

On March 9, Rodriguez—using the material nonpublic information

Munakash shared with him—purchased more than $14,000 of GSIC.
3

Case 2:16-cv-00833 Document 1 Filed 02/05/16 Page 4 of 20 Page ID #:4

1

15.

On the morning of March 28, eBay and GSIC publicly announced eBay’s

2

agreement to buy GSIC for $29.25 per share. Following the announcement, GSIC’s

3

stock price jumped $9.82 per share. Munakash immediately sold his shares, and the

4

shares held in his parents’ account, realizing profits of more than $178,000 between

5

the two accounts. Winters and his clients sold the shares in their respective accounts

6

for profits totaling more than $31,000. Rodriguez sold his shares for profits of more

7

than $17,000, and a close relative sold his shares for profits of more than $24,000.

8
9
10
11

16.

By engaging in this conduct, Defendants Munakash, Rodriguez, and

Winters violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §78j(b), and Rule 10b5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5.
17.

With this complaint, the SEC seeks permanent injunctions prohibiting

12

future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains

13

together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

FACTS

1
2

A.

Confidential Information About Work and Their Personal Lives

3
4

Executive A and Munakash Were Close Friends Who Shared

27.

Munakash and Executive A met in 2004 and quickly became good

5

friends. In the years leading up to 2011, the two communicated regularly and

6

socialized often, with and without their families. They both belonged to the Jonathan

7

Club, a private social club in Los Angeles, frequented restaurants together, celebrated

8

birthdays together, vacationed together—including a trip across the country to Cape

9

Cod and trips to Executive A’s Palm Springs vacation home—and attended events

10
11

such as a U2 rock concert and the 2011 Super Bowl.
28.

Executive A considered Munakash a close friend and believed that

12

information shared between the two of them would be kept in confidence. The two

13

supported each other through difficult times at their respective jobs, sharing challenges

14

that each faced. They also discussed personal matters regarding their families and

15

other social and professional acquaintances.

16

29.

For example, prior to 2011, Munakash disclosed to Executive A that

17

Munakash had pursued a business transaction in Oregon that eventually caused

18

Munakash and his family to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars, including money

19

that belonged to Munakash’s father. Munakash shared other family details with

20

Executive A, including the fact that Munakash believed his parents favored

21

Munakash’s siblings, even though, he claimed, the siblings were less industrious.

22

Munakash also confided in Executive A regarding the challenges his businesses faced,

23

including competition from other gas stations and legal problems he had with some of

24

his employees.

25

30.

26
27
28

Executive A understood these disclosures to be confidential. He did not

share them with others.
31.

Executive A also confided in Munakash about difficulties he had at work,

including problems he was having with specific colleagues, as well as other issues
6

Case 2:16-cv-00833 Document 1 Filed 02/05/16 Page 7 of 20 Page ID #:7

1

related to his job. Because disclosure of this information could have negatively

2

affected Executive A’s career and reputation, Executive A expected Munakash—

3

whom he considered a trusted friend—to keep it confidential. For example, Executive

4

A discussed with Munakash business deals that his colleagues were working on and

5

the impact those deals would have on their respective compensation packages.

6
7
8

32.

As detailed herein, on several occasions in late 2010 and early 2011,

Executive A shared with Munakash significant nonpublic information about GSIC.
B.

Munakash and Rodriguez Regularly Discussed Their Investment
Decisions and Had a Close Mentor-Mentee Relationship

9
10

33.

Rodriguez has worked full time for Munakash since 2001.

11

34.

Over time, the two developed a mentor-mentee relationship. Munakash

12

gave Rodriguez increasing responsibilities and, eventually, a substantial role managing

13

the businesses and facilities Munakash owned.

14
15
16

35.

During the relevant period, Munakash and Rodriguez shared office space

in Munakash’s Malibu gas station and often spent most of the work day together.
36.

Munakash also gave Rodriguez advice unrelated to his employment. For

17

example, he encouraged Rodriguez to invest in real estate and to take additional higher

18

education courses.

19

37.

Over the course of their relationship, Munakash encouraged Rodriguez to

20

invest in the stock market. The two men routinely discussed investment opportunities

21

and the reasons for their investments. Their investment portfolios have contained some

22

of the same securities.

23

C.

Relationship

24
25

Munakash and Winters Had a Longstanding, Mutually Beneficial

38.

By 2004, Munakash had retained Winters as his broker. Munakash

26

provided Winters information about his finances, businesses and family background.

27

Munakash and Winters also persuaded Munakash’s father to open a business account

28

with Winters.
7

Case 2:16-cv-00833 Document 1 Filed 02/05/16 Page 8 of 20 Page ID #:8

1

39.

Before engaging Winters as his broker, Munakash had engaged in risky

2

investment strategies that had resulted in significant losses. Although Winters did not

3

have discretionary trading authority for Munakash’s accounts, Munakash relied on

4

Winters to keep him “in check” and to help him be “more conservative” in his

5

approach to trading stocks. Winters described Munakash as a “gambler” when it came

6

to investment decisions.

7

40.

Throughout their relationship, Winters provided Munakash with

8

investment advice. The two also shared information that sometimes led to both

9

investing in securities of the same company.

10

41.

Given their broker/client relationship, friendship, and history of sharing

11

information about securities (some of which they both invested in), Munakash stood to

12

benefit from Winters in the future if Winters gained valuable information. For

13

example, Winters had previously learned about an unusual warrant for Bank of

14

America stock where the strike price drops when Bank of America pays dividends.

15

Winters located some of these warrants for Munakash because of Munakash’s prior

16

investment in Bank of America options.

17

42.

With respect to GSIC, Winters alerted Munakash that eBay had publicly

18

announced its intention to purchase GSIC. Winters promptly notified Munakash and

19

recommended that he sell immediately.

20

D.

Munakash Misappropriated, Tipped and Traded on Material, Non-

21

Public Information

22

1.

Potential Acquisition of GSIC

23
24

Executive A Confided in Munakash That He Was Working on a

43.

In the fall of 2010, Executive A became the Executive Vice President of

25

Strategic Business Development at GSIC. In this new role, Executive A was charged

26

with identifying and developing strategic business relationships for GSIC, including

27

finding a potential buyer for the company. Executive A confided in Munakash over

28

the next several months about the challenges of his new role at GSIC.
8

Case 2:16-cv-00833 Document 1 Filed 02/05/16 Page 9 of 20 Page ID #:9

1

44.

During the New Year’s Eve weekend, December 29-31, 2010, Executive

2

A invited Munakash, his family, and one other family to his vacation home in La

3

Quinta, California to celebrate the holiday.

4

45.

Over the course of the weekend, Executive A discussed with Munakash

5

and another close friend the expectations associated with his new job. These

6

conversations concerned Executive A’s meetings with private equity firms that

7

Executive A believed were interested in making a strategic investment in GSIC, as

8

well as what such a transaction would mean for Executive A’s career. Executive A

9

told Munakash that over the coming months he would be actively developing

10
11

relationships with these private equity firms.
46.

In January 2011, Executive A met with private equity funds about the

12

possibility of taking GSIC private. Toward the end of January 2011, Executive A also

13

spoke with eBay representatives about a possible acquisition.

14
15
16

47.

During this period, Executive A communicated with Munakash several

times a week via phone, text and email.
48.

The weekend before the Super Bowl, Executive A traveled across the

17

country for scheduled meetings with eBay and its subsidiary, PayPal. On January 30,

18

Executive A and another senior executive at GSIC had dinner in Philadelphia with two

19

eBay executives. During that dinner, the eBay executives first raised eBay’s interest in

20

acquiring GSIC.

21

49.

After that dinner, Executive A called Munakash to discuss their upcoming

22

trip to the Super Bowl in Dallas on February 4-7, 2011. Executive A had invited

23

Munakash to come to the Super Bowl weekend and to attend various GSIC-hosted

24

Super Bowl events as his guest. During the call, Executive A told Munakash that he

25

was in Philadelphia for high-level business meetings that had gone “very well.”
2.

26

Munakash That A Major Transaction Involving GSIC Was Likely

27
28

During Their Super Bowl Trip, Executive A Confided in

50.

From February 4-7, 2011, Executive A and Munakash traveled together to
9

Case 2:16-cv-00833 Document 1 Filed 02/05/16 Page 10 of 20 Page ID #:10

1

the Super Bowl. During the trip, Executive A disclosed to Munakash that there were

2

several groups interested in pursuing an acquisition of, or deal with, GSIC.

3

51.

Executive A confided in Munakash that he was particularly focused on a

4

meeting in New York City the following Thursday, February 10, during which he

5

expected one of the private equity firms to make an offer to buy GSIC and take it

6

private.

7

52.

Further, Executive A explained to Munakash that even if that deal did not

8

work out, another company had expressed interest in acquiring GSIC. Munakash

9

probed further about these potential deals and again asked what they would mean for

10
11
12

Executive A’s career.
53.

interest of potential buyers and the upcoming February 10th meeting, was nonpublic.
3.

13

Munakash Tipped Rodriguez and Winters By Disclosing the
Information Executive A Had Shared with Him in Confidence

14
15

The information concerning GSIC’s efforts to find a buyer, as well as the

54.

Based on information and belief, on February 8, immediately upon

16

returning from the Super Bowl trip, Munakash provided material nonpublic

17

information to his broker, Winters, and his mentee/employee, Rodriguez. Munakash

18

disclosed the information about potential transactions that Executive A had confided,

19

including that a formal offer to acquire GSIC may then have been imminent.

20

Munakash told Rodriguez and Winters that he was investing based on that information.

21

55.

Munakash also recommended that Rodriquez purchase GSIC stock.

22

Rodriguez chose to invest based on Munakash’s recommendation and the information

23

Munakash provided. In providing Rodriguez with inside information about GSIC,

24

Munakash sought to provide a gift to his mentee/employee, and stood to garner

25

additional goodwill, loyalty and effort from Rodriguez.

26

56.

Rodriguez knew that Munakash and Executive A were friends and that

27

Executive A was an insider at GSIC. Prior to the February 2011 Super Bowl trip,

28

Munakash told Rodriguez that Executive A had invited Munakash to the Super Bowl
10

Case 2:16-cv-00833 Document 1 Filed 02/05/16 Page 11 of 20 Page ID #:11

1

weekend and that he was excited to attend the Super Bowl events with Executive A.

2

Munakash’s description of the weekend made it clear that Executive A had access to

3

the lavish events because Executive A was a senior officer at GSIC.

4

57.

Munakash also shared the information with his broker, Winters. Winters

5

did not recall hearing of the stock before Munakash called him on the morning of

6

February 8 and told him about it. Winters based his decision to invest—both on his

7

own behalf and in certain accounts that he controlled on behalf of other brokerage

8

clients—on the information Munakash provided.
4.

9

Almost Simultaneously

10
11
12

Munakash, Rodriguez and Winters Purchased GSIC Stock

58.

On the morning of February 8, 2011, all three defendants purchased GSIC

stock (for the first time) in rapid succession:

13

a. At 10:14 am, Rodriguez purchased $14,000 worth of GSIC through the

14

online trading portal for his brokerage firm. Rodriguez, having never previously

15

purchased GSIC, funded this purchase through a margin loan. Purchasing on

16

margin means that Rodriguez borrowed money from a broker to buy GSIC

17

stock.

18

b. At 10:24 am, Munakash called his registered representative, Winters. The

19

two spoke for twenty-four minutes. During that call, Munakash told Winters

20

about his trip to the Super Bowl.

21

c. At the end of his call with Munakash, Winters placed Munakash’s GSIC

22

order. Less than three minutes after the call ended Winters also purchased GSIC

23

for two of his discretionary client accounts.

24

d. Specifically, at 10:47 am Winters placed an order in Munakash’s account,

25

at Munakash’s direction, for 8,000 shares of GSIC for $177,000, nearly all on

26

margin.

27
28

e. At 10:50 am and 10:51 am, respectively, Winters sold blue chip stocks in
two clients’ accounts—for which he had discretionary trading authority—to
11

Case 2:16-cv-00833 Document 1 Filed 02/05/16 Page 12 of 20 Page ID #:12

1

fund the purchase of 2,000 shares of GSIC for $44,000 in each of the two client

2

accounts. Aside from information he “might have” quickly looked up on Yahoo

3

Finance or Wedbush’s site, Winters made these purchases and sales despite

4

knowing nothing about GSIC except what Munakash had told him, and despite

5

considering Munakash to be a gambler whose investment decisions were often

6

risky and unprofitable.
f. At 6:43 am the morning of February 9, Winters bought 600 shares of

7
8

GSIC for $13,000 in his personal trading account.

9

g. On the morning of February 10, the day of GSIC’s meeting with the

10

private equity fund in New York City that Executive A had discussed with

11

Munakash, Munakash called Winters and placed an order for another 4,000

12

shares of GSIC for $81,000, again on margin.

13

h. This purchase brought Munakash’s total investment in GSIC to over

14

$256,000. This position then represented more than thirty-five percent of his

15

portfolio holdings.
i. Rodriguez also shared the information he learned from Munakash with his

16
17

close relative, Trader A. Using that information, Trader A placed an order for

18

$31,000 of GSIC on February 10, 2011. After briefly selling out of his position

19

in GSIC, Trader A then purchased twice the amount of GSIC on February 22

20

and 23, 2011.

21

59.

Following the Super Bowl trip, Executive A and Munakash continued to

22

communicate regularly by phone and text. Munakash never disclosed his purchase of

23

GSIC stock to Executive A.

24

5.

Material Nonpublic Information from Executive A

25
26

In Late February 2011, Munakash Again Misappropriated

60.

On February 15, Executive A’s wife emailed Munakash’s wife and the

27

wife of another couple with whom Executive A was close, and invited them to a small

28

gathering for Executive A’s birthday. Executive A’s wife explained that Executive A
12

Case 2:16-cv-00833 Document 1 Filed 02/05/16 Page 13 of 20 Page ID #:13

1

had originally not wanted to do anything for his birthday but had just told her that “he

2

would like to go to dinner with you guys and your hubbys [sic].”

3

61.

On February 28, the three couples celebrated Executive A’s birthday

4

together. During the dinner, Executive A spoke to Munakash about the continued

5

stress and challenges of his new job and again confided in him about the status of

6

potential transactions to acquire GSIC.

7

62.

Dinner began at around 7:00 pm. Just before 8:00 pm, Executive A

8

excused himself from the table to take a call from another senior executive at GSIC.

9

Upon his return, Executive A joked to Munakash and the others at the table that if all

10

turned out as planned, he wouldn’t have to take business calls from the other executive

11

at future birthday dinners.

12
13
14

63.

Later in the evening, Executive A and Munakash took a break from the

dinner table to get a drink at the bar.
64.

At this time, Munakash probed Executive A for more information about

15

the earlier phone conversation with the other GSIC senior executive that interrupted

16

the birthday dinner. By this time, Munakash—like Rodriguez and Winters—was

17

aware that GSIC’s stock price had declined since their initial purchase, and that no

18

announcement of a deal had been made.

19

65.

Executive A confided in Munakash that he was disappointed that the

20

GSIC Board of Directors was now going to lead negotiations with the other company

21

that was interested in acquiring GSIC. Executive A explained that, given the Board’s

22

involvement, he was now tasked with trying to keep the private equity firms interested

23

in GSIC even though the other acquisition offer was the preferred deal.

24
25
26
27
28

66.

This information concerning GSIC’s efforts to find a buyer and the status

of negotiations was nonpublic.
67.

Munakash again misappropriated this material nonpublic information. He

and Rodriguez soon traded on it.
68.

Between 7:08 pm and 9:21 pm—both before and after Executive A
13

Case 2:16-cv-00833 Document 1 Filed 02/05/16 Page 14 of 20 Page ID #:14

1

excused himself from the dinner table to take the call—Munakash and Rodriguez

2

exchanged seven text messages.

3

69.

The next morning, March 1, Rodriguez and Munakash both purchased

4

more GSIC stock, even though the stock had fallen in price since they first purchased it

5

on February 8.

10

At 10:45 am on March 1, Rodriguez placed an order for an additional

$9,000 of GSIC, using a margin loan.
71.

Just after noon the same day, Munakash purchased 10,000 shares of GSIC

for more than $198,000 in his parents’ trading account, using a margin loan.
72.

Munakash’s parents did not like incurring debt and rarely used margin in

11

their trading account. Notwithstanding their aversion to debt, the GSIC investment,

12

bought on margin, then represented more than twenty-five percent of the total value in

13

Munakash’s parents’ account.

14

16

73.

increasing his total investment in GSIC to more than $39,000, all purchased on margin.
E.

Winters’ Statements To Client A Show That Winters Traded On the
Material Nonpublic Information Munakash Provided

17
18

On March 9, Rodriguez purchased an additional $14,000 of GSIC,

74.

On February 10, Client A asked Winters about the investment in GSIC.

19

Winters responded via email that Winters “ha[d] a lot of confidence in th[e] stock” and

20

that if Client A called him, Winters would “discuss it” with him.

21

75.

On March 1, Client A emailed Winters again and asked if GSIC, whose

22

stock had declined in price since Winters originally purchased it for Client A, was still

23

a good investment. During a telephone call after Client A sent the email, Winters told

24

Client A that they needed to be patient with the investment because there was going to

25

be a management change at GSIC.

26

76.

Prior to the March 28 announcement regarding eBay’s acquisition of

27

GSIC, public discussions of GSIC did not include a potential management change.

28

Information concerning a potential management change, such as the information
14

1

Executive A disclosed in confidence to Munakash, would have been highly material to

2

a reasonable investor. Thus—particularly as a registered representative—Winters

3

knew or should have known that he was trading on material nonpublic information that

4

Munakash had obtained in breach of a duty.

intended acquisition of GSIC by eBay. After the announcement, GSIC’s share price
rose by more than fifty percent from the prior day’s closing price.
78.

a. Munakash, after exchanging several phone calls with Winters, sold his
position for a profit of more than $86,000.
b. Munakash also logged into his parents’ online trading account and sold

15
16

their position in GSIC for a profit of more than $92,000.
c. Rodriguez sold all of his GSIC holdings for a profit of more than $17,000

17
18

All Defendants immediately sold their shares of GSIC. Each made a

nearly fifty percent profit on their investment.

13
14

On March 28, at 10:05 am ET, eBay and GSIC jointly announced the

and Trader A sold out of his position for $26,000.

19

d. Winters sold the GSIC stock in his personal account for a profit of $4,100.

20

e. Winters also sold the position in one of his discretionary client accounts

21

for a profit of over $13,000.

22

f. Winters’ other client, Client A, noticed the spike in GSIC’s stock price

23

and instructed Winters’ assistant to sell his GSIC position for him, realizing a

24

profit of over $13,000.

Executive A Was Angry When He Discovered That Munakash

79.

In September 2011, Executive A, by then an executive at eBay, received

information from a regulator that listed the names of those who had traded in GSIC
15

Case 2:16-cv-00833 Document 1 Filed 02/05/16 Page 16 of 20 Page ID #:16

1

prior to the March 28, 2011 announcement. He reviewed the list and identified

2

Munakash’s name on it.

3

80.

Executive A immediately called Munakash. Executive A was both

4

shocked and furious that Munakash had traded in GSIC stock and was particularly

5

upset that Munakash traded without ever telling Executive A.

6
7

81.

Because Executive A felt that Munakash had betrayed his trust, he is no

longer friends with Munakash.

19

Strategic Business Development at GSIC.

20

85.

By both trading on and disclosing the material nonpublic information

21

regarding GSIC’s business transactions, Munakash misappropriated confidential

22

information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty of trust or confidence

23

he owed to Executive A.

material nonpublic information he learned from Executive A, with the intent to benefit

26

Rodriguez.

87.

Munakash knew, recklessly disregarded, or should have known that

Rodriguez would trade on the basis of the material nonpublic information and/or tip
