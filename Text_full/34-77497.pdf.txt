FOR COMMENT

Respondent.

Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
(“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103, that the
Division of Enforcement has submitted to the Commission a proposed plan (“Distribution Plan”) for
the distribution of monies placed into a Fair Fund in the above-captioned matter.
On December 1, 2005, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Ceaseand-Desist Order Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940
and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Order”) against Respondent
American Express Financial Corporation (“AEFC” or “Respondent”). 1 The Order found that
AEFC allowed market timing in certain of its mutual funds and variable annuity products from
January 1, 2002 through October 2003 that was contrary to fund prospectuses and not disclosed to
shareholders and AEFC directors. The Order required Respondent to pay disgorgement of
$10,000,000 and a civil money penalty of $5,000,000 and established a Fair Fund in the total
amount of $15,000,000 for a distribution to harmed investors pursuant to Section 308(a) of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

THE DISTRIBUTION PLAN
The Distribution Plan provides for distribution of the Fair Fund established in this matter,
which contains $15,000,000 million in disgorgement and civil penalties paid by Respondent, plus
accumulated interest, to eligible investors. Eligible investors are those investors who suffered
losses to their holdings in AEFC funds as a result of market-timing activity between January 1,
2002 and September 30, 2003. As proposed in the Distribution Plan, if approved, eligible investors
will receive a share of the Fair Fund as calculated by the Fund Administrator. The calculation will
be based on records obtained from AEFC and certain other entities that are shareholders of record.
Accordingly, eligible investors do not need to submit a claim in order to be considered for a
distribution, and no claims procedure will be implemented.
By the Commission.
