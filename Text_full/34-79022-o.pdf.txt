UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
October 3, 2016

In the Matter of
Avatar Ventures Corp.

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that the public interest and the
protection of investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of Avatar Ventures Corp.
(CIK No. 0001416299) because of recent unusual and unexplained market activity in the
company’s stock taking place during a suspicious promotional campaign, and because of
concerns about the adequacy and accuracy of publicly available information. Avatar Ventures
Corp. is a Nevada corporation with its principal executive offices in Carson City, Nevada, with
stock quoted on OTC Link (previously “Pinks Sheets”) operated by OTC Markets Group Inc.
under the ticker symbol ATAR.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on October 3, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on October 14, 2016.
By the Commission.

Secretary
