ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17160

In the Matter of
GEO GLOBAL GROUP LTD.
(F/K/A GEO GENESIS GROUP, LTD.)

ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings on March 8,
2016, alleging that Geo Global Group Ltd. (f/k/a Geo Genesis Group, Ltd.) has securities registered
with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has not
filed required periodic reports since it filed a Form 20-FR12G registration statement on November 19,
2008. Geo Global filed an answer on March 17, 2016, denying that it has securities registered with the
Commission. Instead, Geo Global stated that it filed a Form 20-F registration statement on November
19, 2008; filed an amended Form 20-F registration statement on June 10, 2009; and attempted to
withdraw the registration statement on September 20, 2010, prior to the registration statement’s
effectiveness. Answer at 2.
On March 28, 2016, I received a copy of an email from Geo Global’s counsel, Andrew J.
Befumo, to the Division of Enforcement, stating that Geo Global wished to settle the proceeding and
requesting a proposed offer of settlement. On April 5, 2016, Division counsel forwarded my office an
email from Mr. Befumo, announcing that Geo Global requested he withdraw as counsel. Division
counsel also represented that Mr. Befumo stated that Geo Global will not settle nor participate further
in the proceeding.
A telephonic prehearing conference was held today, attended by counsel for the Division, but
not by any representative of Geo Global. Counsel for the Division represented that Geo Global’s
November 19, 2008, Form 20-F registration statement became effective after sixty days, and Geo
Global’s attempts to withdraw its registration were ineffective.
Accordingly, I ORDER Geo Global to SHOW CAUSE by May 6, 2016, why the registration of
its securities should not be revoked by default due to its failure to appear at the scheduled prehearing
conference or otherwise defend this proceeding. If Geo Global fails to respond to this order, it will be
deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined against it, and the registration of its securities
will be revoked. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(1)-(2), .221(f).
