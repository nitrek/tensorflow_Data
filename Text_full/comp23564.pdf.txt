Defendant.

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) alleges:
SUMMARY OF THE ACTION

23
24

1.

This action arises from insider trading by Defendant Guolin Ma (“Ma” or

25 “Defendant”), a Chinese citizen, in the securities of OmniVision Technologies, Inc. (“OmniVision”),
26 a Santa Clara, California maker of optical semiconductor devices. Defendant obtained material non27 public information in the course of his work on a consulting engagement for two China-based private
28 equity firms (“PE Firm 1” and “PE Firm 2”; together, the “PE Firms”) that were pursuing an

Case 5:16-cv-03131 Document 1 Filed 06/09/16 Page 2 of 9

1 acquisition of OmniVision. Defendant used this information to purchase OmniVision stock in
2 advance of the August 14, 2014 announcement that a group of Chinese investment firms, including
3 PE Firm 2, had made a preliminary proposal to acquire OmniVision for $29 per share, an 18%
4 premium to OmniVision’s pre-offer price (the “Announcement”). The day of the Announcement,
5 OmniVision’s stock price rose 15%, from $24.60 to $28.29 per share, allowing Defendant to generate
6 $367,387 in illegal profits.
7

2.

Starting in or around early April 2014, Defendant, an optical physicist, was engaged as

8 a consultant by the PE Firms to advise and perform technical due diligence on a potential acquisition
9 of a company in the optical semiconductor industry. In the course of this consulting relationship,
10 Defendant obtained the material non-public information that PE Firm 2 and a Chinese state-owned
11 science and technology investment fund (the “Chinese Investment Fund”) were jointly pursuing the
12 acquisition of OmniVision.
13

3.

In a series of purchases from April 25, 2014, through May 14, 2014, while in

14 possession of this material non-public information, Defendant purchased 39,373 shares of
15 OmniVision stock in two U.S. brokerage accounts for a total price of $746,474. After the
16 Announcement, the value of Defendant’s OmniVision stock rose to $1,113,862, representing total
17 unrealized profits of $367,387.
18

4.

By engaging in insider trading as described in this Complaint, Defendant has violated

19 Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and
20 Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5].
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

The Commission brings this action pursuant Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the

23 Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e) and 27 of

investments and evaluating potential investments in the area of optical technology. Defendant was
aware that his consulting activities for PE Firm 1 might expose him to material non-public
information about PE Firm 1’s portfolio companies and other entities, and he understood that he
should keep such information confidential. In March 2014, Defendant entered into a written
confidentiality agreement with PE Firm 1 prohibiting him from trading on the basis of material nonpublic information learned through his consulting relationship with PE Firm 1.
16.

In early 2014, certain personnel from PE Firm 1, along with others, formed PE Firm 2

primarily to focus on semiconductor investments. During the period described in this Complaint, the
Defendant and certain PE Firm 1 personnel, including a director of both PE Firms (“the PE Firm
Director”), conducted PE Firm 2 business using the email and administrative resources of PE Firm 1,
and in internal and external correspondence often did not distinguish between the two PE Firms.
17.

Also in early 2014, the Chinese Investment Fund was considering making an

acquisition of a manufacturer of optical semiconductor products, such as imaging microchips for
digital cameras, in the United States or China. The PE Firms and the Chinese Investment Fund
discussed making a joint acquisition in that sector.
18.

According to the PE Firms, Defendant did not have a written consulting contract with

either firm and did not receive up-front monetary compensation for his services. The PE Firm
Director did, however, inform Defendant that there would be an opportunity for him to obtain carried
interest (a share of management profits) in PE Firm 2 if Defendant’s services proved valuable. The

1 PE Firm Director had also provided Defendant with at least one lucrative financial opportunity in the
2 past.

19.

On April 3, 2014, working in his capacity as a consultant for the PE Firms, Defendant

4 accompanied the President of the Chinese Investment Fund on a visit to OmniVision’s headquarters
5 in Santa Clara, California. Defendant relayed information about the meeting and the Chinese
6 Investment Fund President’s views on aspects of OmniVision’s business to the PE Firm Director,
7 who had been a co-founder of OmniVision.
8

20.

Defendant entertained the Chinese Investment Fund President during the remainder of

9 the President’s visit to the United States. Defendant discussed with the Chinese Investment Fund
10 President and his advisors the advantages and disadvantages of various potential acquisition targets.
11 Defendant advocated to the Chinese Investment Fund President that OmniVision was the best
12 acquisition target out of the possibilities they discussed.
13

21.

On April 10, 2014, representatives of the Chinese Investment Fund and the PE Firms,

14 including the PE Firm Director, met in Shanghai with OmniVision’s CEO and discussed those
15 entities’ interest in a going-private acquisition of OmniVision. Defendant was present at that
16 meeting.
17

22.

On or about April 11, 2014, a representative of PE Firm 2 instructed Defendant not to

18 trade in OmniVision stock and to keep information about the potential acquisition of OmniVision
19 confidential.
20

23.

On April 14, 2014, OmniVision contacted an investment bank to advise the company

21 on a potential going-private transaction. OmniVision management informed the company’s board of
22 directors of the Chinese Investment Fund’s interest on or around April 16, 2014.
23

24.

Between April 15 and April 20, 2014, Defendant received several documents via

24 email from representatives of the PE Firms indicating that the PE Firms were working on an
25 acquisition of OmniVision, including a draft timeline for the transaction and an “initial assessment”
26 that contemplated a buyout at a 30% premium to the price at which OmniVision shares were then
27 trading and relisting OmniVision in China.

By virtue of his consulting engagement and correspondence with representatives of the
