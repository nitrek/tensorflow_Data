ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-16463

In the Matter of
AEGIS CAPITAL, LLC,
CIRCLE ONE WEALTH MANAGEMENT, LLC,
DIANE W. LAMM,
STRATEGIC CONSULTING ADVISORS, LLC, AND
DAVID I. OSUNKWO

ORDER

On the request of Respondents Strategic Consulting Advisors, LLC, and David I.
Osunkwo request, I signed a subpoena requiring John Lakian to testify at the hearing in this
matter. The hearing is scheduled to commence on July 25, 2016. Today, my office received a
courtesy copy of Lakian’s motion to quash the subpoena. In the motion, Lakian’s counsel
represents that Lakian is “awaiting sentence before the Hon. Frederick Block, United States
District Judge for the Eastern District of New York,” and that counsel has “instructed Lakian to
invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege in response to any inquiries relating to the allegations
underlying the criminal case.”
Owing to the approaching hearing date, Respondents shall submit a response to the
motion to quash by 5:30 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, July 19, 2016. I will hear argument about the
motion to quash during the prehearing conference scheduled to take place at 1:30 p.m. EDT on
Wednesday July 20, 2016, which Lakian’s counsel is encouraged to attend.
