COMPLAINT
Plaintiff United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“Commission” or “SEC”), alleges:
SUMMARY
1.

Defendant Thomas W. Avent, Jr. is a tax partner with one of the

world’s largest accounting firms. Avent lives and works in Atlanta. He leads a
practice group that performs due diligence in connection with upcoming
mergers and acquisitions. Through his work, Avent learns secret, proprietary,
carefully guarded information about upcoming corporate acquisitions, including
tender offers for publicly-traded companies—some of the most valuable,

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 2 of 39

sensitive, nonpublic information that exists within the sphere of the stock
markets.
2.

In 2011 and 2012, Avent tipped his stock broker, Defendant

Raymond J. Pirrello, Jr., about upcoming acquisitions three separate times.
3.

Pirrello, in turn, passed the three tips on to his former colleague and

long-time friend, Defendant Lawrence Penna. Penna then arranged to buy
stocks or call options of all three target companies before the acquisitions were
announced to the public. As a result, Penna got an illegal jump on other
investors, and he and his family made over $111,000 in illicit insider-trading
profits.
4.

Pirrello compounded his misconduct by using the material

nonpublic information he illegally received from Avent to recommend the three
target companies to additional associates, who then used the information to buy
securities of the targets before the acquisitions were announced.
5.

Avent and Pirrello, and separately Pirrello and Penna,

communicated frequently by telephone, email, and text messages throughout
2011 and 2012.
6.

The Defendants exchanged text messages about some of their illegal

trades. In one such exchange, Pirrello asked, “How many did we get?” Penna
2
 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 3 of 39

answered, “2500.” Pirrello responded, “We should make 25K.” To which Penna
replied, “Only Bgt Stock – should I go back for more?” Later, after the public
announcement, Penna texted Pirrello, “A little over 15k. Not too bad. :)”
7.

In another example, Avent and Pirrello exchanged a series of text

messages after the public announcement of an acquisition that Avent had earlier
disclosed to Pirrello. After the announcement, Avent texted Pirrello, “Happy?”
Pirrello responded, “Price bad.” To which Avent replied, “Whatever.”
8.

More than text messages flowed between Avent and Pirrello. Avent

provided material nonpublic information to Pirrello, and Pirrello provided
pecuniary and other benefits to Avent. While the illegal tips and insider trading
were occurring, Pirrello paid Avent $50,000 in cash, Pirrello provided Avent
investment advice and serviced his brokerage account, and Pirrello arranged for
another one of his brokerage customers to buy an illiquid $250,000 investment
that Avent wanted to sell.
9.

In a similar vein, Pirrello provided material nonpublic information

to Penna and Penna provided pecuniary benefits to Pirrello. Within two weeks
after one of the acquisition announcements, Penna paid $7,000 towards Pirrello’s
American Express (“AMEX”) credit card bill. One week after another
announcement, Penna paid $14,500 towards Pirrello’s AMEX bill.

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 4 of 39

10.

Through their conduct, Avent, Pirrello, and Penna engaged in

fraudulent insider trading.
11.

Defendants Avent and Pirrello, directly and indirectly, have

engaged in and, unless enjoined, will continue to engage in transactions, acts,
practices, and courses of business which violate Sections 10(b) of the Securities
and Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5
thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5].
12.

Defendants Avent, Pirrello, and Penna, directly and indirectly, have

engaged in and, unless enjoined, will continue to engage in transactions, acts,
practices, and courses of business which violate Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act
[15 U.S.C. § 78n(e)] and Rule 14e-3 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.14e-3].
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
13.

The SEC brings this action pursuant to Sections 21(d) and 21A of the

Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u-1] seeking permanent injunctions,
disgorgement of trading profits, plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.
14.

This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), 21A,

and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), 78u-1, and 78aa]. The
Defendants have directly or indirectly made use of the means or
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or the facilities of a

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 5 of 39

national securities exchange in connection with the acts, practices, transactions,
and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.
15.

Venue in this district is proper under Section 27 of the Exchange Act

[15 U.S.C. § 78aa] and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), because acts, practices, transactions
and courses of business constituting the alleged securities law violations
occurred in substantial part within this district and because Defendant Avent
resides in this district.

At the time of the events described in this Complaint, Avent was

subject to CPA Firm’s Code of Conduct and to CPA Firm’s Insider Trading
Policy. Avent knew that he was subject to CPA Firm’s Code of Conduct and
CPA Firm’s Insider Trading Policy, and he understood both the Code of Conduct
and the Insider Trading Policy.
31.

CPA Firm’s Code of Conduct required that Avent “not disclose any

confidential or private information to third parties,” and “be alert to” “insider
trading.”
32.

CPA Firm’s Insider Trading Policy prohibited him from disclosing

material nonpublic information about planned acquisitions to people outside of
CPA Firm.
B.

Avent’s Account with Pirrello

33.

Avent opened an account with Securities Firm in approximately

2008. Pirrello was Avent’s stock broker on the account from the time when
Avent first opened the account. Avent knew that Pirrello had at least one other
customer who invested in publicly traded companies. Pirrello knew that Avent
was a CPA and an attorney. Pirrello also knew that Avent worked as CPA
Firm’s Southeast Area Partner-in-Charge of Mergers and Acquisitions.

9
 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 10 of 39

34.

In his Securities Firm account opening forms, Avent stated that his

investment objective was “Speculation” and that his “Focus is on generating
highest potential growth and/or income with a willingness to assume the
highest level of risk. Very Aggressive.”
35.

Pirrello gave Avent investment advice, and based on that advice

Avent traded stocks and options, sometimes trading on margin.
36.

Avent made money on some of the trades he placed in his Securities

Firm account. He lost money on other trades in that account. Avent expressed
anger about one substantial loss in that account, and blamed Pirrello for it.
Avent sent Pirrello several text messages and emails in which he demanded that
Pirrello pay Avent over $500,000 to make up for the loss. Avent, however,
continued to deposit more money into his account with Pirrello and to follow
Pirrello’s advice on new securities trades well into 2015.
37.

subject to Securities Firm’s Written Supervisory Policies and Procedures and to
Securities Firm’s Insider Trading Policy. Pirrello knew that he was subject to

Firm’s Insider Trading Policy, and he understood both the Written Supervisory
Policies and Procedures and the Insider Trading Policy.

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 11 of 39

38.

Securities Firm’s Written Supervisory Policies and Procedures

required “stringent avoidance of the misuse of inside information,” which it
defined as “material, nonpublic information,” and went on to state that
information is “likely to be material” if it relates to, among other things,
“proposals or agreements involving a merger, acquisition, divestiture or
leveraged buyout.” Securities Firm’s Written Supervisory Policies and
Procedures also required that Pirrello “refrain from trading on inside
information.”
39.

Securities Firm’s Insider Trading Policy prohibited Pirrello from

“buying, selling or recommending the purchase or sale of a security for any
account while [he possessed] non-public material information relating to that
security or its issuer.”
C.

Pirrello and Penna

40.

Pirrello has known Penna since Pirrello was a teenager. Pirrello

worked for Penna when Pirrello first entered the securities business.
41.

During the SEC investigation that led to this Complaint, Pirrello and

Penna asserted their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and
refused to answer any questions about their advance knowledge of the
acquisitions of Radiant, Midas, and BrightPoint; any questions about whether
11
 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 12 of 39

they discussed those acquisitions; and any questions about whether they shared
trading profits.
D.

The Radiant Tender Offer

42.

In early May 2011, NCR contacted Radiant and expressed an interest

in acquiring it. On May 12, NCR sent a non-binding indication of interest to
Radiant, including a proposed price range of $24 to $26 per share. During the
last week of May, NCR signed a nondisclosure agreement. By June 21, NCR
increased its offer to $28 per share. From June 30 through July 11, NCR and
Radiant, and their financial and business advisers, negotiated the terms of the
planned transaction.
43.

In June 2011, NCR engaged CPA Firm to conduct tax due diligence

relating to its planned tender offer for Radiant (“NCR Acquisition
Engagement”). By June 23, Avent was working on the NCR Acquisition
Engagement. Between at least June 23 and July 11, 2011, Avent possessed
material nonpublic information about NCR’s planned tender offer for Radiant.
Through this engagement, Avent learned material nonpublic information in
sufficient detail to permit him to perform the required tax due diligence. In
particular, by June 23, Avent knew that: 1) NCR’s target was Radiant; 2) CPA
Firm was in the process of commenting on the non-disclosure agreement; 3) due
12
 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 13 of 39

diligence was to be completed in the next two weeks; and 4) NCR’s goal was to
finalize the acquisition agreement by July 11. On June 29, Avent received a
portion of the merger agreement. On July 8, Avent received and approved CPA
Firm’s tax due diligence report for the NCR acquisition of Radiant.
44.

That very same day, Friday, July 8, Avent tipped Pirrello by sharing

material nonpublic information about NCR’s planned tender offer for Radiant
with him. Pirrello then tipped the material nonpublic information to Penna, who
in turn used that information by directing his son to purchase Radiant securities
in a trust account held for Penna’s benefit at a different securities broker-dealer
than Pirrello’s employer. Penna’s son followed Penna’s directions and
purchased Radiant securities for Penna’s trust account. At the same time,
Penna’s son also purchased Radiant securities in his own brokerage account and
in the account of his mother (Penna’s ex-wife).
45.

Specifically, on July 8, the following communications and securities

transactions took place:
8:48 am (ET):

Avent called Pirrello - call lasted approximately
50 seconds

8:50 am:

Pirrello called Avent - call lasted approximately

3:48 pm:

Penna’s son bought more Radiant stock in a trust
account for the benefit of Penna (1,500 Radiant
shares at $21.93 and 500 Radiant shares at $21.91)

3:49 pm:

Penna’s son bought Radiant stock in a brokerage
account in his own name (1,300 Radiant shares at

3:50 pm:

Penna’s son bought Radiant stock in a brokerage
account held in the name of Penna’s ex-wife (400
Radiant shares at $21.95 and 600 Radiant shares
at $21.94)

46.

That evening, Pirrello and Penna exchanged the following text

messages:
5:27 pm (ET):

Pirrello: “How many did we get”

6:14 pm:

Penna: “2500”
14

 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 15 of 39

6:17 pm:

Pirrello: “We should make 25k”

6:19 pm:

Penna: “Only Bgt Stock – should I go back for
more?”

47.

After the ensuing weekend, NCR publicly announced, at 4:17 pm ET

on Monday, July 11, an agreement to acquire Radiant through a cash tender offer
of $28.00 per share (“Radiant Announcement”). The next day, Radiant stock
closed at $27.99 per share, a 30.5% increase from the previous day’s closing price
of $21.45.
48.

Less than 25 minutes after the Radiant Announcement, at 4:41 pm

ET, Pirrello called Penna.
49.

The morning of July 12, the day after the Radiant Announcement, at

9:32 am ET, Penna’s son sold the Radiant stock in Penna’s ex-wife’s account,
generating profits of approximately $6,016. Then, at 9:33 am ET, Penna’s son
sold the Radiant stock in the Penna trust account, generating profits of
approximately $15,153. At the same time, Penna’s son sold the Radiant stock in
his own account, generating profits of approximately $7,813.
50.

That evening, Pirrello and Penna exchanged the following text

messages:
9:28 pm (ET):

Penna: “A little over 15k. Not too bad. :)”
15

 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 16 of 39

9:31 pm:

Pirrello: “When you coming back things are a
little tight”

9:34 pm:

Penna: “Not for a while. I could Tsfr to you’re
a/c but if you want cash….. about 7/26. Your
call.”

9:37 pm:

Pirrello: “You can just make a payment to amex
for me the account number is [XXXX 5005]”

51.

Less than a week later, on July 18, Penna transferred $5,000 from a

bank account he controlled to Pirrello’s AMEX account.
52.

Then, four days later, on July 22, 2011, Penna transferred $2,500 from

a bank account he controlled to Pirrello’s AMEX account.
53.

In November 2011, Pirrello sent Avent a $50,000 personal check

made payable to “cash.” Avent deposited Pirrello’s check on November 18, 2011.
54.

In addition to Penna, Pirrello also used the information he received

from Avent to recommend Radiant to some of his colleagues and clients, who
purchased shares of Radiant stock and/or options before the public
announcement of the NCR tender offer for Radiant. These other traders earned a
total of approximately $44,405 due to their timely purchases of Radiant
securities.

E.

The Midas Tender Offer

55.

In August 2011, Midas publicly announced that it would evaluate a

range of “strategic and financial alternatives,” and had retained a financial
adviser to assist in the process. The market exhibited no material reaction to the
Midas announcement. On November 2, TBC submitted a non-binding indication
of interest to acquire Midas at $12 to 14 per share. On November 19, TBC was
granted access to detailed Midas financial and business due diligence materials.
On November 30, TBC and its financial and business representatives attended
meetings by Midas management. On January 12, 2012, TBC sent a non-binding
indication of interest to acquire Midas, at $12.25 to $14.00 per share.
56.

By mid-January, TBC engaged CPA Firm to perform tax due

diligence work relating to its planned tender offer for Midas (“TBC Acquisition
Engagement”).
57.

Avent began working on the TBC Acquisition Engagement on or

about January 14, 2012.
58.

Starting on at least January 14, Avent possessed material, nonpublic

information about TBC’s planned tender offer for Midas. Among other things,
by at least January 14, Avent knew that: 1) the acquisition was structured as an
“auction process” – i.e. there was more than one potential buyer interested in
17
 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 18 of 39

acquiring Midas and Midas could choose the best offer; 2) CPA Firm expected
that the due diligence period would last from 3 to 4 weeks; and 3) final bids were
due to Midas by mid-February.
59.

On January 22, Midas sent TBC a draft definitive agreement. On

January 24, 2012, Avent learned from CPA Firm’s Integration Advisory group
that an initial kick-off meeting had been held with a limited group of TBC
personnel, that the TBC Acquisition Engagement team should now have access
to an online data room, and that CPA Firm’s report was due to TBC on February
10, 2012. On February 8, Avent received and approved CPA Firm’s tax due
diligence report for the TBC Acquisition Engagement.
60.

Avent and Pirrello communicated multiple times from February 2

through February 27, 2012. During those communications, Avent disclosed
material nonpublic information to Pirrello about TBC’s impending acquisition of
Midas.
61.

For their part, Pirrello and Penna communicated multiple times

from February 3 through February 28, 2012. During those communications,
Pirrello disclosed the material nonpublic information about TBC’s impending
acquisition of Midas to Penna, who in turn used that information and directed
Penna’s son to purchase Midas securities in a trust account held for Penna’s
18
 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 19 of 39

The following communications then took place on February 27 and

February 28, 2012:
Monday, February 27:
7:15 pm (ET):

Pirrello text to Avent: “What happen to that thing”

7:19 pm:

Avent text to Pirrello: “Hear still going forward”

8:08 pm:

9:44 pm:

Penna’s son called Penna – call lasted 1-2 minutes

10:00 pm:

Penna’s son called Penna – call lasted 4-5 minutes

67.

After these communications on February 27 and February 28, the

following securities transactions took place on February 29 and March 1:
Wednesday, February 29:
2:49 pm:

Penna’s son bought Midas options in his brokerage
account (100 Midas $10 call options expiring March 17,
2012, at $0.50)

Thursday, March 1:
12:40 pm (ET):

Penna’s son bought Midas options in his brokerage
account (100 Midas $10 call options expiring March 17,
2012 at $0.35)

22
 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 23 of 39

68.

Instead of buying shares of Midas stock, Penna’s son bought call

options on Midas stock. A call option is an option to buy 100 shares of the
subject stock at a specified “strike” price (here $10 or $12.50 per share) on or
before an “expiration” date (here March 17 or June 16, 2012).
69.

If the price of Midas stock were to rise above the strike price before

the expiration date, the call options would enable the holder to buy shares of
stock from the seller of the option at the strike price and immediately resell the
shares for a profit at the higher market price. In addition, the call options
themselves would climb in value and could be sold at a profit. If, however, the
price of Midas stock stayed flat or declined, the call options would expire
without generating any profit for Penna and his son.
70.

From February 3 through March 1, 2012, the price of Midas stock

steadily fell, from a closing price of $9.64 on February 3 to a closing price of $9.04
on March 1. But as the price of Midas stock declined, Penna’s son bought 700
Midas call options—giving him the right to buy 70,000 shares of Midas stock—at
strike prices of $10.00 and $12.50. And 90% of those call options, 650 of them,
carried expiration dates of March 17, 2012. In other words, over 90% of his call
options would expire worthless, unless the price of Midas stock reversed course
and increased significantly in less than 3 weeks.

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 24 of 39

71.

On Tuesday, March 13, 2012, at 7:00 am ET, TBC and Midas

announced that they had entered into an agreement pursuant to which TBC
would acquire Midas through a cash tender offer at $11.50 per share ("Midas
Announcement"). That day, Midas stock closed at $11.44 per share, a 27.3%
increase from the closing price of $8.99 on March 12.
72.

Less than 20 minutes after the Midas Announcement, at 7:17 am ET,

Pirrello called Penna. The call lasted 1-2 minutes.
73.

A few hours after the Midas Announcement, Avent and Pirrello

exchanged the following text messages:
11:25 am (ET):

Avent text to Pirrello: “Happy?”

11:26 am:

Pirrello text to Avent: “Price bad”

11:21 am:

Avent text to Pirrello: “Whatever”

74.

The morning of the Midas Announcement, at 9:50 am ET, Penna’s

son sold the Midas call options in the Penna trust account, generating profits of
approximately $17,500. At 9:52 am ET and 12:59 pm ET, Penna’s son sold the
Midas call options in his own account, generating profits of approximately
$33,440.

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 25 of 39

75.

Within a week after the Midas Announcement, on March 20, 2012,

Penna transferred $14,000 from a bank account he controlled to Pirrello’s AMEX
account.
76.

In addition to Penna, Pirrello also used the information he received

from Avent to recommend Midas to several of his colleagues and clients, who
purchased thousands of shares of stock and/or options before the public
announcement of the TBC tender offer for Midas. These other traders earned a
total of approximately $78,200 due to their timely purchases of Midas securities.
F.

The BrightPoint Acquisition

77.

In 2012, multiple companies, including Ingram Micro and Tech

Data, expressed an interest in acquiring BrightPoint. During May 2012,
BrightPoint provided limited due diligence to both companies. On June 6, 2012,
BrightPoint sent Ingram Micro and Tech Data a draft definitive agreement. By
June 25, BrightPoint was negotiating deal terms with both companies. On June
29, BrightPoint reported to Tech Data that it was prepared to move forward with
another party.
78.

Also in June 2012, Tech Data engaged CPA Firm to perform tax due

diligence work for its planned acquisition of BrightPoint (“Tech Data Acquisition
Engagement”). Avent worked on the Tech Data Acquisition Engagement
25
 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 26 of 39

beginning as early as June 20, 2012. Through his work on the engagement, Avent
obtained material nonpublic information about Tech Data’s planned acquisition
of BrightPoint. On June 21, Avent learned that the tax due diligence work was to
begin “immediately.” In the early morning on June 29, 2012, the Principal of
CPA Firm’s financial due diligence team emailed the CPA Firm’s financial due
diligence report to Tech Data, copying Avent. Later that day, Avent approved
CPA Firm’s tax due diligence report for the Tech Data Acquisition Engagement.
79.

During communications on Friday, June 29, 2012, Avent disclosed

material nonpublic information about Tech Data’s planned acquisition of
BrightPoint to Pirrello. That same day, Pirrello disclosed material nonpublic
information to Penna, who in turn used the information to direct his son to
purchase BrightPoint securities in one of the Penna trust accounts at a different
securities broker-dealer than Pirrello’s employer. Penna’s son then purchased
BrightPoint securities.
80.

Specifically, the following communications and securities

transactions took place on June 29:
7:35 am (ET):

Avent called Pirrello - call lasted approximately 8
minutes, 35 seconds

7:44 am:

Pirrello called Penna – call lasted 1 minute or less

26
 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 27 of 39

9:10 am:

Penna called Pirrello – call lasted 1 minute or less

9:11 am:

Penna called Pirrello – call lasted 1 minute or less

9:56 am:

Penna called Penna’s son – call lasted approximately 6
minutes, 53 seconds

10:05 am:

Penna’s son bought BrightPoint options in a trust
account for the benefit of Penna (100 BrightPoint $5 call
options expiring August 18, 2012, at $0.65)

81.

After the ensuing weekend, at 12:07 am ET on Monday, July 2, 2012,

Ingram Micro announced an agreement to acquire BrightPoint for $9.00 per share
in cash (“BrightPoint Announcement”). The day of the BrightPoint
Announcement, BrightPoint stock closed at $9.01 per share, a 66.5% increase
from the closing price of $5.41 on June 29, the previous trading day.
82.

Early in the morning of the day of the BrightPoint Announcement,

Pirrello communicated with Penna and Penna communicated with Penna’s son:
6:43 am (ET):

Pirrello called Penna – call lasted 1 minute or less

6:46 am:

Penna called Pirrello – call lasted 1-2 minutes

7:50 am:

Penna’s son called Penna – call lasted 1-2 minutes

9:05 am:

Penna called Penna’s son – call lasted 1 minute or less

9:20 am:

Penna’s son called Penna - call lasted 1 minute or less

27
 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 28 of 39

83.

On June 29, 2012, when Penna’s son bought the BrightPoint call

options, BrightPoint stock closed at $5.41, above the $5.00 strike price of the call
options. As a result, the call options would increase in value only if the price of
BrightPoint stock rose even farther above the $5.00 strike price in the roughly
seven weeks remaining before the call options expired on August 18. If the stock
price did not increase during that time frame, he would earn no profits from the
sale or exercise of the options.
84.

Shortly after this string of calls, at 9:35 am ET on July 2, 2012,

Penna’s son sold the BrightPoint options in the Penna trust account, generating
profits of approximately $31,500.
85.

In addition to Penna, Pirrello also used the information he received

from Avent to recommend BrightPoint to several of his colleagues and clients,
who purchased thousands of shares of BrightPoint stock and/or options before
the public announcement of the acquisition of BrightPoint. These other traders
earned a total of approximately $94,000 due to their timely purchases of
BrightPoint securities.
86.

In September 2012, Pirrello helped Avent raise $250,000 in cash by

facilitating Avent’s sale of an illiquid investment. The investment was a
promissory note which Avent had acquired in February 2011 in a private
28
 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 29 of 39

placement. The promissory note was issued by a private company and sold to
Avent through Securities Firm. The promissory note was due on December 31,
2011; but as of September 2012, the issuer had failed to make payment on the
note. Avent had complained to Pirrello on several prior occasions that Avent
needed to raise cash. There was no public market for the promissory note, and
therefore it was difficult for Avent to sell. Pirrello found another one of his
customers who was willing to buy the promissory note from Avent for its face
value, $250,000.
G.

Defendants Acted in Breach of a Duty of Trust and Confidence

87.

Avent breached his duty of trust and confidence to CPA Firm when

he disclosed material, nonpublic information about the planned acquisitions of
Radiant, Midas, and BrightPoint to Pirrello.
88.

Avent has years of training and experience as an attorney and as a

CPA. He specializes in mergers and acquisitions. When Avent breached his
duty of trust and confidence by tipping his stock broker, Pirrello, about the
planned acquisitions of Radiant, Midas, and BrightPoint, Avent knew, or
recklessly disregarded, that it was reasonably foreseeable the information he
disclosed would be used in trades of Radiant, Midas, and BrightPoint securities.

29
 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 30 of 39

89.

Pirrello has years of experience working in the securities industry.

Based on his experience in the securities industry and on his communications
with Avent, Pirrello knew, or recklessly disregarded, that Avent was an adviser
to an offering company or the issuer with regard to the planned acquisitions of
Radiant, Midas, and BrightPoint, and that Avent had misappropriated the
information about those acquisitions from CPA Firm in breach of a duty of trust
and confidence. Pirrello also knew about the personal benefits that he was
providing to Avent. Based on his experience in the securities industry, Pirrello
knew the proprietary nature, sensitivity, and importance of nonpublic
information that a tender offer or other acquisition was planned for a publiclytraded company. Nevertheless, Pirrello passed the material nonpublic
information about the planned acquisitions of Radiant, Midas, and BrightPoint
on to Penna, when he knew, or recklessly disregarded, that it was reasonably
foreseeable that the material nonpublic information about the planned
acquisitions of Radiant, Midas, and BrightPoint would be used in trades of
Radiant, Midas, and BrightPoint securities.
90.

Penna has years of experience working in the securities industry.

Based on his experience, Penna knew, or recklessly disregarded, that Pirrello had
obtained information about the planned acquisitions of Radiant, Midas, and
30
 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 31 of 39

BrightPoint from an adviser to the offering company or the issuer, or from some
other insider, who had breached a duty of trust and confidence in disclosing it to
Pirrello. Penna also knew about the personal benefits that he was providing to
Pirrello. Based on his experience in the securities industry, Penna knew the
proprietary nature, sensitivity, and importance of nonpublic information that a
tender offer or other acquisition was planned for a publicly-traded company.
Penna traded on the basis of the material, nonpublic information he received
from Pirrello.
H.

Avent Continued to Invest through Pirrello into 2015

91.

Despite his displeasure over his prior trading losses, Avent

continued to invest through Pirrello well into 2015.
92.

On July 9, 2013, Avent deposited $15,000 into his Securities Firm

account to fund an approximately $14,000 investment in a penny stock, because
Pirrello was “convinced [the stock] was going to be very profitable.”
93.

On June 3, 2015, acting on Pirrello’s advice, Avent deposited $50,000

into his Securities Firm account to provide part of the funding for an
approximately $100,000 investment in a mobile internet service provider.

(Against Avent and Pirrello)
94.

Paragraphs 1 through 93 are realleged and incorporated by reference

as though fully set forth herein.
95.

Defendants Avent and Pirrello, in connection with the purchase and

sale of Radiant, Midas, and BrightPoint securities, by use of the means and
instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails, directly and indirectly:
used or employed devices, schemes, and artifices to defraud; made untrue
statements of material facts and omitted to state material facts necessary in order
to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; and/or engaged in acts, practices, and courses of
business which had operated as a fraud and deceit upon purchasers and sellers
of such securities and upon CPA Firm and its clients.
96.

Avent knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that information

regarding the planned acquisitions for Radiant, Midas, and BrightPoint was
confidential, material, and nonpublic. Avent breached the duty of trust and
confidence which he owed to CPA Firm by disclosing such material nonpublic
information to Pirrello, who he either knew, or was reckless in not knowing,
would recommend that another use that information to purchase Radiant, Midas,

32
 

Case 1:16-cv-02459-SCJ Document 1 Filed 07/07/16 Page 33 of 39

and BrightPoint securities. Avent received a personal benefit from his disclosure
to Pirrello.
97.

Pirrello knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that information

regarding the planned acquisitions for Radiant, Midas, and BrightPoint was
confidential, material, and nonpublic and that Avent had disclosed such material
nonpublic information in breach of a duty of trust and confidence. Pirrello
breached the duty of trust and confidence which he owed to CPA Firm by
disclosing material nonpublic information to Penna, who he either knew, or was
reckless in not knowing, would recommend that another use that information to
purchase Radiant, Midas, and BrightPoint securities.
98.

Avent and Pirrello acted with scienter.

99.

By reason of the foregoing, Avent and Pirrello have violated and,

unless enjoined, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5].
CLAIM TWO

Radiant
101.

By the end of June 2011, NCR had taken substantial steps to

commence a tender offer of the securities of Radiant, including, among other
things: 1) retaining financial and business advisers; 2) discussing pricing terms
with Radiant; 3) signing a nondisclosure agreement; 4) starting to conduct due
diligence on the planned tender offer; and 5) starting to negotiate the terms of the
planned tender offer with Radiant.
102.

At the time Penna purchased Radiant securities, Penna was in

possession of material information regarding the tender offer for Radiant
securities by NCR, which he knew or had reason to know was nonpublic, and
which he knew or had reason to know was acquired directly or indirectly from
an officer, director, partner, or employee or other person acting on behalf of the
offering person or the issuer.
103.

Avent communicated material nonpublic information to Pirrello

relating to the Radiant tender offer, when Avent knew or had reason to know
that such information came from an officer, director, partner, or employee or
other person acting on behalf of the offering person or the issuer, and it was
reasonably foreseeable that such communication was likely to result in Pirrello
purchasing, or Pirrello causing another person to purchase, Radiant securities in

relating to the Midas tender offer, when Avent knew or had reason to know that
such information came from an officer, director, partner, or employee or other
