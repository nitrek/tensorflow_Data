Executive Summary
¾ The main focus of this report is the health and well-being of staff working in the National
Health Service (NHS) in England. We particularly looked at whether the health and wellbeing, presenteeism and supervisor interest for health and well-being are associated with
Human Resource Management (HRM) practices of the NHS. Some of the HRM
indicators we looked at include appraisal and well structured team work.
¾	 We have also looked at the association between health and well-being, presenteeism and
supervisor interest for health and well-being and four outcome variables namely job
satisfaction, intention to leave, injury rate and work-related stress.
¾	 In section 1 we describe how the overall report is laid out. In section 2 we discuss the
research design which includes details of hierarchical linear modelling analysis; the
research framework and details of variables we used from the 2009 NHS Staff Survey. In
all of our analysis we used the characteristics of employees (e.g. ethnic background,
gender, age and health status), job characteristics, economic status of employees and
characteristics of organizations as control variables.
¾	 In section 4, we discuss the research findings. The answer to the research question ‘Does
the HRM policy of the NHS predict employee health and well-being, presenteeism and
supervisor interest for health?’ is affirmative. Overall, feeling valued by colleagues is the
strongest indicator of all four outcome variables.
¾	 With the exception of work pressure, all of the HRM policy indicators are positively and
significantly related with general health and well-being, health and well-being in the last
four weeks and supervisor interest for health. Moreover, with the exception of work
pressure, all of the HRM policy indicator variables are negatively and significantly
related to presenteeism and its construct namely working while feeling unwell.
¾	 Relative to the other two appraisal variables, quality of appraisal best predicts all four
outcome variables mentioned above.
¾	 Likewise, the finding for the one of our objectives: ‘Does employee health and wellbeing, presenteeism and supervisor interest for health and well-being predict work-related
stress, injury rate, job satisfaction and intention to leave?’ is as follows. Job satisfaction is
best predicted by supervisor interest for health. Intention to leave is best predicted by
presenteeism due to pressure from supervisors. General health and well-being has the
strongest negative relationship with injury rate and work-related stress. Presenteeism best
4

predicts work-related stress while its construct has the strongest positive relationship with
injury rate. Section 5 concludes the study with a few recommendations.

1. Introduction
1.1.	

This report focuses on the link between Human Resource Management (HRM)
policies and the health and well-being of the National Health Service (NHS) staff in
England.

1.2.	

In section 2 we briefly highlight the definition of health and well-being and
contextualise it within the workplace and the NHS respectively. We briefly touch on
the benefits and antecedents of health and well-being at the workplace. Moreover, we
discuss HRM policies that could enhance health and well-being.

1.3.	

In section 3 we present the Research Design which includes the aim of the study,
source of data and methodology.

1.4.	

In sections 4, we present the link between human resource management (HRM)
policies and health and well-being of NHS staff. This section has six subsections due
to the different research question and themes we have attempted to address. Overall,
the section provides answers to the following research questions.
¾ Does HRM policy of the NHS predict employee health and well-being and
presenteeism?
¾ Does HRM policy of the NHS predict supervisor’s interest for the health of
employees?’
¾ Do employee health and well-being and presenteeism predict work-related stress,
injury rate, job satisfaction and intention to leave?
¾ Does supervisor’s interest for the health of employees predict work-related stress,
injury rate, job satisfaction and intention to leave?

1.5.	

Section 5 wraps up the report with brief conclusion and recommendation. As this
study is based on cross-sectional data, the findings cannot lead to inferences about
causality. Instead, they lay the foundation for further research in the topic.

2. Health and Well­being: Definition and Outcomes
2.1.	

In this section we conceptualise health and well-being in general and within the
workplace and the NHS in particular.

6

2.2.	

We believe this short review will
provide a good rational for the research
we have conducted herewith.

Definitions of Health & Well­being and
its Consequences
1. Person-related dimension

The Definition of Health and Well­being

2.3.	

2.4.

The definitions and measures of health
and well-being vary tremendously.	
Health
‘encompass[es]
both
physiological
and
psychological
symptomology within a more medical
context’ (Danna and Griffin, 1999, pg.
364). 


1.a. Physical symptomatology and
epidemiological rates of physical
illnesses and diseases.
1.b. Mental, psychological, or emotional
aspects of workers as indicated by
emotional states and epidemiological
rates of mental illnesses and diseases
2. Societal dimension (e.g. the consequences
of alcohol abuse). 

Source: (Danna and Griffin, 1999)


2.5.	

The World Health Organization provides a broader definition of health as a ‘state of
complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of
disease or infirmity’ (World Health Organization, 1998).

2.6.	

Danna and Griffin (1999) view well-being as concept that covers a broader range of
variables as compared to health. Well-being measures need to be context-free and
encompass both life- and work-related experiences.

2.7.	

Overall, well-being is a broad concept that encompasses aspects of the ‘whole person’
(Warr, 1990). It is often as a continuous construct ranging from feeling good to bad.

The Definition of Health and Well­being at the Workplace

2.8.	

Health and well-being at work is a widely researched topic and several, seemingly
disjointed bodies of literature exist under a wide range of topic areas(Danna and
Griffin, 1999).

2.9.	

In general there are certain commonalities in the existing measures of health and
well-being in that they focus on two specifics aspects; person-related and societal
dimensions. The person-related measures tend to address physical and emotional
factors relating to overall health and well-being. The details of this perspective will be
uncovered in the following paragraphs and the box below depicts the summary of this
concept (Danna and Griffin, 1999).

7

2.10.
 Although well-being is
generally viewed as a
continuum between feeling
good or bad, Warr (1999)
suggests that it well-being
can be conceptualised as a
three-dimensional construct,
with
subdimensions
referring
to
displeasure/pleasure,
anxiety/comfort
and
depression/enthusiasm.

Work­related antecedents of health and well­being
¾ Health and safety and other perils 
¾ Relationships at work (with supervisor and
colleagues)
¾ Role in organisation (ability to make a difference;
job satisfaction)
¾ Career development (availability  of training; good
quality appraisal and personal development plan)
¾ Work‐life balance 
¾ Organisational climate (e.g. job design and work
pressure)

What are the Antecedents and Consequences of Poor Health and Well­being at work?

2.11.	 Poor health and well-being at work leads to increased absenteeism and can have
adverse effects on significant individual, organizational, economic and societal
consequences (Boorman, 2009).
2.12.	 Indeed, the exposure to work-related hazards varies across occupations and industries
(Hassan et al., 2009). Encouraging evidence indicates that there is a marked decrease
in work-related injuries in industrialised countries, due to a general change in the
nature of jobs. Nevertheless, policy makers and workers are increasingly concerned
with improving the quality of jobs overall. (Hassan et al., 2009).
2.13.	 Employees’ overall well-being will be affected by factors such as physical security,
the extent to which their position is socially valued and the extent to which they are
given opportunities to use their skills in their job (Hassan et al., 2009). However, jobspecific well-being is not influenced only by these key job-features. Factors at the
individual level, such as demographic variables or personality, will also have an
effect on employees’ wellbeing (Warr, 1999).
2.14.	 Hassan and his colleagues have reported measurable degrees and effects of workrelated injuries. They report that ‘during 2007/08 an estimated 2.1 million people
suffered from an illness that they believed was caused or made worse by their current
or past work; 229 workers suffered fatal injuries at work; and 299,000 self-reported
injuries occurred… 34 million working days were lost overall (1.4 days per worker),

8

28 million due to work-related ill-health and 6 million due to workplace injury’
(Hassan et al., 2009, pg. 7).
2.15.	 The Health and Safety Executive (2009) estimates the annual costs to individuals of
workplace accidents and work-related ill-health to be between £10.1 and £14.7 billion
in Great Britain. These costs include loss of income, extra expenditure of dealing with
injury or ill-health, subjective costs of pain, grief and suffering (Pathak, 2008).
2.16.	 Likewise, in 2000/2001 alone, the cost of work-related injury and ill health for
individuals was estimated to be between 10.1 and 14.7 billion. The cost for employers
was between 3.9 and 7.8 billion; and to society 20 to 31.8 billion (Health and Safety
Executive, 2004).
2.17.	 Hassan and colleagues (2009) have demonstrated the antecedents and consequences
of health and well-being at work and their interlinked nature (see figure 1 below).
The figure clearly demonstrates that health at work cannot be understood only in
terms of work-related antecedents. The relationships between health and work are not
uni-factorial: the deterioration of workers’ health may be caused by work and nonwork-related factors.
2.18.	 The authors describe health at work in terms of physical, physiological, mental and
psychological ailments and wellbeing in the workplace as work/job-related
satisfaction. There is lifestyle and work related antecedents of health and well-being
which are also interlinked.

9

Figure 1: A conceptual framework of health and well-being at work

Source: Hassan et al. (2009) adopted from Danna and Griffin (1999).

2.19.	 The work-related antecedents are divided into two separate strands. The first
antecedent stems from the work setting (e.g. health and safety hazards and other
perils). The second one is occupational stresses which include factors intrinsic to the
job; role in organization; relationships at work; career development; organizational
structure and climate; home/work interface and other factors.
2.20.	 The individual consequences of health and wellbeing in the workplace include
physical, psychological and behavioral consequences.
The organizational
consequences include health insurance costs, compensable disorders/lawsuits,
productivity decline, increased risk of injury, absenteeism as well as presenteeism.
Social exclusion, anti-social behaviours, high unemployment rates and payments for
unemployment benefits are some of the societal consequences of poor health and
well-being at work.

Health and Well­being in the NHS

2.21.	 In line with other organizations, healthcare providers are focusing on selecting and
employing managerial policies and practices that will optimise productivity and
organizational effectiveness (West et al., 2006). Light stipulates that ‘[h]ealth care is
10

a template on which different stakeholders project their values, ambitions, fears and
institutional reforms’ (2001 ,pg. 1168).

2.22.	 The NHS employs a large number of employees over a wide range of professions,
including nurses, allied health professionals, doctors, catering etc. (Pearson et al.,
2004).
2.23.	 The Department of Health and NHS organizations have a long-term goal of
promoting and improving employees’ health and wellbeing in the NHS (Boorman,
2009).
2.24.	 Indeed, the Boorman review (2009) recommends that all NHS organizations provide
staff health and well-being services that focus on both work and non-work factors that
are linked to ill-health, are in accordance to wider public health policies and
initiatives, and are viewed as a motivating factor for working in the.
2.25.	 The review has identified the crucial importance of NHS staff health and well-being
in terms of several outcomes, such as the capacity of staff to deliver improvements in
patient care, as outlined in the NHS Constitution. Thus, the NHS is crucial to the
delivery of the improvements in patient care envisaged in the NHS Constitution.
2.26.	 The review also recommends that all NHS leaders and managers are developed and
equipped to recognize the link between staff health and well-being and organizational
performance. Additionally, it is recommended that managers are evaluated on the
positive or negative impact they have on employee health and well-being.
2.27.	 Due to the large number of organizations in the NHS (450) there are evident
inconsistencies in the extent to which they support staff and promote their health and
well-being at work. Compared to public sector figures, the NHS in England appears
to have a higher number of working days lost per staff per year, as well as longer
individual sickness absences. (Hassan et al., 2009).
2.28.	 On the whole, it is recognized that the NHS faces major challenges recruiting,
motivating and retaining employees in the current unstable period that is
characterized by growth and significant changes (Pearson et al., 2004).

3. Research Design
Aim and Objective of the Study

3.1.	

This report focuses on the link between HRM policies and the health and well-being
of the NHS staff.

3.2.	

The particular objective of this analysis is to investigate the relationship between the
predictor and outcome variables amongst the overall NHS staff as well as across the
390 trusts. The specific research questions are:
¾ Does HRM policy of the NHS predict employee health and well-being and
presenteeism?
¾ Does HRM policy of the NHS predict supervisor’s interest for the health and
well-being of employees?’
¾ Does employee health and well-being and presenteeism predict work-related
stress, injury rate, job satisfaction and intention to leave?
¾ Does supervisor’s interest for the health of employees predict work-related stress,
injury rate, job satisfaction and intention to leave?

3.3.	

We believe the specific research questions laid out above would enable us to
understand the association between HRM policies and employee health and wellbeing; HRM policies and supervisor interest for health and well-being and wellbeing; employee health and well-being and its association with work-related stress,
injury rate and organisational outcomes (i.e. job satisfaction and intention to leave).
The last two research questions laid out in the paragraph above will enable us to
understand whether supervisor’s interest for the health of employees predict health
outcomes such as work-related stress and injury rate as well as job satisfaction and
intention to leave.

The Conceptualisation of the Research Objectives

3.4.	

In figure 2 below, we present the research framework we have followed while
conducting the analysis.

3.5.	

We have adopted this framework from Hassan et al. (2009) in the bid to achieve our
research objectives and have logical themes.

3.6.	

We are not in any way generalising that some of the HRM variables we have
incorporated in the analysis are interlinked. However, within the sample we are
12

investigating, this type of scenario has unfolded in only a few cases (See appendix 1
for detail). Conceptually however, we expect that HRM policies to be interlinked
somehow. For instance, working in a well structured team and being valued by
colleagues normally go hand in hand. The same principle applies for work pressure
and supervisor support. We expect these two to be correlated negatively but our
results show that the correlation is not strong (See appendix 1).
3.7.	

In order to answer the question ‘Does HRM policy of the NHS predict employee
health and well-being and presenteeism?’ we analysed appraisal, team work and
work-related factors as predictors of employee health and well-being presenteeism.
The outcome variables we have looked at are general health and well-being, health
and well-being in the last 4 weeks, presenteeism as well as working while feeling
unwell. Figure 2 illustrates the analysis described thus far. Arrow A demonstrates the
direction of the prediction.

3.8.	

In order to answer the question ‘Does HRM policy of the NHS predict supervisor
interest for health?’ we analysed appraisal, team work and work-related factors as
predictors of employee health and well-being. The outcome variables we have looked
at are general health and well-being, health and well-being in the last 4 weeks,
presenteeism as well as working while feeling unwell. Figure 2 illustrates the analysis
described thus far. Arrow C demonstrates the direction of the prediction.

3.9.	

In order to answer the question ‘Does employee health and well-being and
presenteeism predict work-related stress, injury rate, job satisfaction and intention to
leave?’ we analysed health and well-being variables as predictors of work-related
stress, injury rate, job satisfaction and intention to leave. Figure 2 illustrates the
analysis described herewith. Arrow B demonstrates the direction of the prediction.

3.10.	 In order to answer the question ‘Does supervisor interest for health and well-being
and well-being and presenteeism predict work-related stress, injury rate, job
satisfaction and intention to leave?’ we analysed supervisor interest for health and
well-being and well-being as predictor of work-related stress and injury rate. Figure 2
illustrates the analysis described. Arrow D demonstrates the direction of the
prediction.

Research Method and Source of Data

3.11.	 We analyzed the 2009 NHS Staff Survey which includes over 150,000 staff across all
English NHS trusts.
3.12.	 We conducted hierarchical linear modelling in which the health and well-being
variables and its constructs were used either as predictors or outcome variables (see
figure 2). This was an individual level analysis whereby the sample was also
clustered within 390 trusts.
3.13.	 In instances where the outcome variable is dichotomous/binary, we conducted logistic
multilevel modelling.
3.14.	 We conducted all of the analysis in SPSS, except for the logistic multilevel models.
For these models, we used a statistical package called STATA.

14

3.15.	 HRM practices of the NHS we have incorporated in our analysis are indicated in
above figure 2. Here, we would like to give a little bit more detail about the HRM
variables. These variables have been used only as predictors:
i.	

Three appraisal variables
¾
¾
¾

‘% having appraisal in the last 12 months’

‘% having a well-structured appraisal in the last 12 months’

‘% agreeing personal development plan (PDP) in the last 12 months’ 


ii.	

Well-structured team work

iii.	

Seven work related key scores which are listed below. Indeed, one can see that some of these
factors are indirectly related to work related factors. For instance, feeling valued by
colleagues can be a result of each individual employee’s effort and the predisposition to think
positively as well as the result of effective team work, job design, role clarity and supervisory
support.

listed in (i) and (ii) below have been used both as outcome and predictor variables.
The last two have only been used as outcome variables.

3.17.	 Supervisor interest for health and well-being, job satisfaction and intention to leave
are also included in our analysis.
3.18.	 The control variables included in all of the multilevel models are listed below.
i.	

Characteristics of employees: Ethnic background, gender, age and health status

ii.	

Job characteristics and economic status: Job tenure, hours worked (i.e. full-time vs. parttime) managerial status and Occupational group (i.e. Nurses, Central Functions &
15

Administrative staff, Allied Health Professionals (AHPs), Clinical, Scientific &

Technical Support, Medical/ Dental, Management, Paramedic & Ambulance Services and 

Social Care Services. 

iii.	

Characteristics of organization: Size of trust, location of trust (i.e. London vs. other
regions of the UK) and trust type (i.e. Acute, Primary Care Trusts (PCTs), Mental Health
and Ambulance).

4. Results and Discussion
4.1.	

The 2009 NHS staff survey is a rich data set which consists of 156,951 respondents,
20% of which are male respondents.

4.2.	

The great majority of the respondents (i.e. 98.5%) are between the ages of 21 and 65.
Overall, the white ethnic group is the majority (87%) and from this ‘British White’
makes up 83%.

4.3.	

Only about 13% of the respondents are ethnic minorities, Indians and Black Africans
being the largest groups (3.2% and 2.7% respectively).

4.4.	

The diverse professions of the NHS staff are regrouped into eight major occupational
groups (see table 1 below). The table shows that staffs working in central functions
and administration are highly represented in the sample, closely being followed by
nurses.

In the next few sections, we will discuss the results of the multilevel and logistic
hierarchical linear modelling. The analysis is presented in line with the research

16

framework we have described above (see figure 2). We believe that the thematic
arrangement of the sections will make it easy to follow for the reader.
4.6.	

We present the full details of these 

analyses in the appendices. 


Does the HRM Policy of the NHS Predict Employee
Health and Well­being and Presenteeism?

Summary of Analysis
¾	 With the exception of work pressure,
all  of the HRM  policy indicator
variables  are  positively  and
significantly  related  with  general
health  and  well‐being as  well as
health and well‐being in the last four
weeks. Work pressure has a negative
and  significant relationship  with
these outcome variables. 
¾ With the exception of work pressure,
all  of	 the HRM  policy indicator
variables  are
negatively  and 
significantly related to presenteeism
and  its construct  namely working
while feeling  unwell.  Work pressure
has a positive  and  significant
relationship with  these  outcome
variables.
¾ Relative  to  the other  two appraisal
variables,  quality  of appraisal  best
predicts all  four  outcome variables
mentioned above. 
¾	 Overall, feeling valued by colleagues
is  the  strongest  indicator of all four
outcome  variables.  This  is  followed 

by  satisfaction  with quality of  work,

although  this is  not  an effective

predictor of  the  presenteesim
variable  best  predictor  is  quality
appraisal 

4.7.	

In the first two columns of table 2
below, we present the results of HRM
practices of the NHS and their
association with health and wellbeing variables.
The last two
columns refer to the association
between
HRM
policies
and
presenteeism. The summary of these
results are presented in the box at the
right hand side of this page.

4.8.	

The table shows that all three
appraisal indicators are positively and
significantly related to general health
and well-being as well as health and
wellbeing in the last 4 weeks. We
can see that relative to the other two
appraisal variables, good quality
appraisal best predicts general health
and well-being as well as health and
well-being in the last 4 weeks.

4.9.	

Positive and significant results were 

obtained for ‘working in well-

structured team’, confirming the fact

that harmony and good working 

relationships can enhance employees’ health and well-being. 


4.10.	 All but one work-related factor have a positive relationship with general health and
well-being as well as health and well-being in the last 4 weeks.
4.11.	 Indeed, various factors are related to the health and well-being of workers: workrelated, lifestyle and socio-economic factors (Hassan et al., 2009). The negative
association we observe between work pressure and the health and well-being
17

variables is what we might expect. As workers are subjected to increased levels of
stress, their minds and bodies are stretched and they are less likely to make health
lifestyle choices. As a result, their immune systems may become weaker, increasing
the probability of contacting new disease (e.g. cold, musculoskeletal illness, repetitive
strain injury and headache) or worsening a pre-existing illnesses.
4.12.	 Table 2 indicates that feeling valued by colleagues is the strongest predictor of
employees general health and well-being as well as their health and well-being in the
last four weeks.
4.13.	 We can see from the table that the association between supervisor support and these
health and well-being variables is positive but not as strong when compared with the
results with feeling valued by colleagues. This is perhaps because employees tend to
relate and open up more to the colleagues they work most closely with, but to whom
they do not report.
4.14.	 Table 2 also demonstrates the association between HRM practices and presenteeism
as well as one of its constructs, namely working while feeling unwell. The results are
negative and significant across the board for all outputs except work pressure. Indeed
this is what we normally expect. Amongst other factors, it is work pressure that
makes people attend work when sickness absenteeism is justifiable (Hemp, 2004).
4.15.	 On the whole, the odds ratios indicate that all three appraisal variables are negatively
and significantly related to presenteeism and its construct. Again, quality appraisal
strongly predicts presenteeism and its construct when compared with the other two
appraisal variables.

4.16.	 Similar results were obtained for ‘working in well structured team’. Presenteeism and

4.17.	 Feeling valued by colleagues has the strongest negative association with
presenteeism. Employees who are valued by their colleagues are perceived as citizens
of the organisation whose health and well-being really matters. Therefore, the
pressure they feel from colleagues to show up at work will not be high because
priority would be that placed on their health and well-being.

Does the HRM Policy of the NHS Predict Supervisor’s Interest for the Health and Well­being of
Employees?

4.18.	 In table 3 we present the 

results of the association
between HRM Practices

and Supervisor interest
for the Health of NHS
staff. S
	 upervisor interest
is a crucial element for
maintaining the health
and
well-being
of
employees. The summary
of these results are
presented in the box at the
right hand side of this
page.

Summary of Analysis

¾ With the exception of work pressure, all of the HRM
policy indicator  variables  are  positively and
significantly  related  with supervisor  interest  for
health. Work pressure has a negative and significant
relationship with this outcome variable. 
¾ Relative to the other two appraisal variables, quality
of  appraisal  best predicts  all four outcome variables
mentioned above.
¾ Overall,  feeling valued  by colleagues is  the strongest
indicator of supervisor interest for health. 

4.19.	 All of the variables listed in table 3 have a positive and significant relationship with
supervisor interest for health with the exception of work pressure.
4.20.	 All of the appraisal variables are positively and significantly linked with supervisor
interest for health and well-being, quality of appraisal being the strongest predictor.
When there is quality appraisal, employees would be more likely to discuss the
antecedents of their health and well-being more openly.
4.21.	 In the 2009 NHS staff survey, supervisor interest for health and well-being is
captured by a question ‘My immediate manager takes a personal interest in my health
and well-being’. Indeed, ‘interest’ could mean anything from enquiring about the
health and well-being of an employee through an impersonal e-mail and the usual
‘Are you alright?’ to discussing what is affecting an employees’ health and wellbeing at work or outside and finding a remedy for it. Line managers cannot always
be doctors or counsellors and have the best the solution at their fingertips.
Nonetheless, advising their employees what help is available when they are struggling
with health and well-being issues is one area they should all be acquainted with.
Moreover, it shows that they have interest in their employees’ health and well-being
when they try to rectify issues such as bullying and harassment through their own best
conducts as well as by discouraging employees who resort to these disruptive
behaviours.

Does Employee Health and Well­being, Supervisor Interest for Health and Well­being and Presenteeism Predict Job Satisfaction, Intention to
Leave, Work­related Stress and Injury rate?

4.22.	 In table 4 below we present the findings from the analysis we have conducted by using general health and well-being,
health and well-being in the last four months, supervisor interest for health and well-being, presenteeism and one of its
constructs called ‘working while feeling unwell’ as predictors of four outcome variables.
4.23.	 Two individual/organisational outcome variables are considered, namely job satisfaction and intention to leave. The other
two outcome variables are the health indicators ‘work-related stress’ and ‘injury rate’.
4.24.	 The results show that job satisfaction has a positive relationship with both general health and well-being and health and
well-being in the last 4 weeks. When we look at presenteeism and its construct however, the relationship job satisfaction
has with the construct of presenteeism is a positive one. This is a surprising result as we normally expect people who go to
work despite ill health are more likely to feel dissatisfied with their jobs. Indeed, this presenteeism construct is

general in nature as it only asks about 

the presence of employees at work

despite ill health1. It does not refer to

‘pressure’ per se. Perhaps that is why we 

observe this unexpected result.

Summary of Analysis
Job satisfaction is best predicted by
supervisor interest for health.
Intention to leave is best predicted by
presenteeism.
General health and wellbeing has the
strongest negative relationship with both
injury rate and work-related stress.
Presenteeism best predicts work-related
stress while its construct has the strongest
positive relationship with injury rate.

4.26.	 On another level, we observe that

intention to leave has a negative 

association with general health and well-

being as well as health and well-being in 

the last 4 weeks. A similar relationship holds for supervisor interest for health.


4.27.	 When we look at presenteeism and its construct, the relationship intention to leave
has with the construct of presenteeism is negative. This is a surprising result as we
normally expect people who tend to be present at work despite feeling unwell to be
more likely to want to leave their jobs. One reason for this might be the fact that
people who are motivated and engaged can go to work even when they are not well
(e.g. careerism). We need to bear in mind that this presenteeism construct is a general
question and does not refer to pressure stemming from colleagues and supervisors.
4.28.	 Injury rate and work-related stress have a negative association with general health and
well-being. This is indeed what we normally expect because as general health and
well-being declines the susceptibility for injury increases. Employees who are unwell
may lose their usual levels of concentration and vigour. The same holds for workrelated stress as indeed general health and well-being usually goes hand in hand with
good mental health.
4.29.	 Surprisingly, the association we observe between health and well-being within the
last 4 weeks and injury rate as well as work-related stress is positive. This might be
due to the fact that respondents might not really perceive the injuries and workrelated stress they experience in a short span of time (i.e. a month) as significant.
4.30.	 Supervisor interest for health and well-being has a negative relationship with both
injury rate and work-related stress. On the other hand, presenteeism and its construct
have a positive relationship with both of these outcome variables.

1

The exact wording of the question is ‘In the last three months have you ever come to work despite not feeling well enough to perform your

duties?’

4.31.	 General health and well-being has the strongest negative association with both injury
rate and work-related health.
4.32.	 Presenteeism best predicts work-related stress while its construct has the strongest
positive relationship with injury rate.

5. Conclusion

Summary of the Concluding Remarks
Before planning and implementing health and
wellbeing enhancing policies, the HRM practices of the
NHS should pay particular attention to variations of
work culture that are prevalent among various
occupational groups
We recommend that such polices should be piloted
extensively.
Longitudinal and qualitative studies should be
undertaken in order to broaden our understanding of the
health and wellbeing of the NHS staff.

5.1.	

On the whole, we feel this
¾
research
is
informative
especially in the NHS context.
¾
It
supports
what
is
recommended by the Boorman
review (2009) especially in
terms of exploring health and
well-being and presenteeism in the NHS.

5.2.	

On the whole, the analysis we have conducted indicates that the HRM policies of the
NHS are related to employees’ health and well-being, presenteeism and supervisor
interest for health and well-being. For example, having appraisal and being able to
work in a well structured team are associated with these outcome variables.

5.3.	

Moreover, we have observed that health and well-being, presenteeism and supervisor
interest for health and well-being can predict job satisfaction and intention to leave
which are by and large the indirect measures of productivity. Indeed, less productivity
means a decline in patient care which is the one of the cores of the NHS pledges.

5.3.1.	 In addition, we have observed that health and well-being, presenteeism and
supervisor interest for health and well-being can predict injury rate and work-related
stress. This implies that HRM policies which promote the health and well-being of
NHS staff in one way or another can indeed curtail injury rate and work-related
stress. Apart from the damage it brings to employees’ welfare, injury rates increase
sickness absence, damage productivity and incur higher medical legal fees for the
NHS.
5.4.	

The direction of causality cannot be inferred as this is a cross sectional study.
Longitudinal and qualitative studies that explore the health and well-being of NHS
staff and how these interlink with HRM policies are essential.

5.5.	

Studies that explore the meaning of some ambiguous terms are essential. For instance,
supervisor interest for health and well-being can be ambiguous as the term ‘interest’
can mean different things for different employees.
