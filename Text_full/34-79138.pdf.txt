In the Matter of the Application of
MARK E. LACCETTI, CPA

ORDER TERMINATING
AUTOMATIC STAY

For Review of Disciplinary Action Taken by the
PCAOB

On September 2, 2016, the Commission sustained disciplinary action taken by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) against Mark E. Laccetti.1 The PCAOB
found that Laccetti violated its rules in connection with the audit of a foreign issuer’s
consolidated financial statements, barred him from associating with a registered public
accounting firm (with the right to petition the PCAOB to associate with such a firm after two
years), and ordered him to pay an $85,000 civil money penalty. Laccetti’s application for
Commission review triggered an automatic stay of the PCAOB’s sanctions and prevented the
PCAOB from reporting the sanctions to the public.2 The PCAOB now requests that the
Commission terminate the automatic stay. Laccetti opposes the motion, arguing that he should
“be entitled to maintain the status quo at least until the time to appeal [the Commission’s
decision] has run.” We find that, because an application for Commission review triggers the stay
and the Commission has completed its review, it is appropriate to lift the automatic stay.

See 15 U.S.C. § 7215(d)(1)(C), (e)(1) (stating that the PCAOB shall report a disciplinary
sanction to the public once any stay on the imposition of such sanction has been lifted and that an
application for Commission review of PCAOB disciplinary action shall operate as a stay of such
action “unless and until the Commission orders . . . that no such stay shall continue to operate”).

2
A.

The basis for the automatic stay is Commission review of PCAOB disciplinary
action.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) provides for the Commission to
have “oversight and enforcement authority over the Board” and for “review by the Commission
of final disciplinary sanctions imposed by the Board.”3 Section 105(e) of Sarbanes-Oxley
“govern[s] the extent to which application for . . . review of any final disciplinary action of the
Board operates as a stay of such action.”4 And Section 105(e) provides that an application for
Commission review shall operate as a stay, until the Commission orders that no such stay shall
continue to operate.5 Because the Commission’s review of the PCAOB’s disciplinary action
triggers the stay and the Commission’s review has concluded, there is no longer a purpose for the
automatic stay. Once the Commission found that the PCAOB’s decision met the standards
required by Sarbanes-Oxley, the public and the PCAOB became entitled to the prompt execution
of the PCAOB’s order.6 The Commission’s consistent practice has been to lift the automatic stay
after affirming a PCAOB disciplinary action.7 Should Laccetti decide to seek appellate review
of the Commission’s decision, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides a separate means
for seeking a stay of that decision that Laccetti is free to pursue.8
Laccetti contends that keeping the automatic stay in place until the time for him to appeal
has run would “maintain the status quo” and be “consistent with the principle that, for some

particularly with respect to the issuance of rules or the imposition of sanctions (both of which are
subject to Commission approval and alteration)”).

appropriate circumstances, lift a stay under Section 105(e) prior to the completion of its review, a
situation not at issue here.

procedure for seeking a stay of Commission orders pending judicial review).

purposes, an order or judgment is not final until the time to appeal has run.” But the
Commission’s orders necessarily become final before the time to appeal has run because, under
the Exchange Act, an aggrieved party cannot appeal a Commission decision until after it
becomes final.9 And in any case finality is not determinative. Staying a valid administrative
judgment is an extraordinary remedy.10 As such, Sarbanes-Oxley provides the Commission with
broad discretion to lift the automatic stay “summarily.”11 It is appropriate to lift the stay after the
Commission has completed the review that triggered the stay and found that the PCAOB’s action
satisfied Sarbanes-Oxley’s requirements. Because the Commission determined that the PCAOB
imposed the sanctions properly and that decision is public, there is no longer any reason to
prevent the PCAOB from reporting its decision to the public or from enforcing those sanctions.
B.

Laccetti provides no justification for maintaining the automatic stay after the
Commission’s review of the PCAOB’s disciplinary action has concluded.

Laccetti provides two main arguments for not lifting the stay until the time to appeal has
run. We find neither of them persuasive.
First, Laccetti claims that he would be irreparably harmed by lifting the automatic stay
because that would allow the PCAOB to publicly report its sanctions, thus “signaling that the
[PCAOB’s] findings and sanctions are final and conclusive, when they may yet be overturned by
a court of appeals.”12 But disciplinary decisions are routinely reported to the public despite the
possibility of further review.13 And the PCAOB’s findings and sanctions in this proceeding are

2008) (stating that, because “Sathianathan did not file a motion for reconsideration, the
challenged SEC action was final”); 17 C.F.R. § 201.470 (stating that a “motion for
reconsideration shall be filed within 10 days after service of the order complained of”).
10

See, e.g., Cuomo v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 772 F.2d 972, 978 (D.C. Cir.
1985) (describing a stay pending appeal as an “extraordinary remedy”); Busboom Grain Co., Inc.
v. ICC, 830 F.2d 74, 75 (7th Cir. 1987) (stating that “[a] strong presumption of regularity
supports any order of an administrative agency; a stay pending judicial review is a rare event and
depends on a demonstration that the administrative process misfired”).

15 U.S.C. § 7215(e)(1) (stating that the Commission may end the automatic stay
“summarily”); see also 17 C.F.R. § 201.401(e)(2) (stating that “[t]he Commission may lift a stay
summarily, without notice and opportunity for hearing”).
12

See 15 U.S.C. § 72l5(d)(1) (stating that the PCAOB shall report any disciplinary
sanctions to the Commission, state or foreign regulatory authorities, and “the public (once any
stay on the imposition of such sanction has been lifted)”).
13

See, e.g., Gen. Bond & Share Co., Administrative Procedure File No. 3-7666, 1992 SEC
LEXIS 3490, at *3 (May 15, 1992) (denying stay of publication of NASD decision while on
appeal because “to grant that extraordinary relief . . . would be disfavored” and because “[t]o
keep the public unaware of NASD determinations at this stage would frustrate the public interest
that the Securities Exchange Act was designed to foster”).

already public. Laccetti filed his application for review with the Commission approximately 19
months ago, and the Commission’s review of PCAOB disciplinary actions are public
proceedings.14 In fact, Laccetti attached the PCAOB’s final decision to his application for
review, both of which have been available on the Commission’s website.15 The Commission’s
decision sustaining the PCAOB’s findings and sanctions is also public. Once the Commission’s
review that triggered the automatic stay is complete, allowing the PCAOB to report to the public
sanctions that have already been reported publicly does not create any irreparable harm.
Second, Laccetti claims that terminating the stay has “no practical impact in terms of the
public interest or the protection of investors.” According to him, lifting the stay is not necessary
because he “undisputedly does not perform audits for public companies anymore, and has no
intention to do so in the future,” and maintaining the stay will not impede the PCAOB’s “ability
to ultimately collect the civil penalty.” Laccetti adds that the PCAOB is “not sufficiently
‘aggrieved’ by the stay” to seek its termination16 and offers no justification for why “it is
suddenly so pressing to lift the stay now instead of in a mere 60 days.” But the PCAOB states
that its decision, which the Commission has now sustained, discussed the importance of the civil
money penalty, in tandem with the associational bar, to “protect against Laccetti’s demonstrated
capacity for the conduct at issue here,” to “impress on him the seriousness of his violations,” and
to “encourage more rigorous compliance by him and others” with certain fundamental auditing
principles.17 And the automatic stay did not only prevent the PCAOB from enforcing the
sanctions; it also prevented the PCAOB from reporting its decision to the public. We agree with
the PCAOB that Laccetti “ignores the important benefits to the public that would flow from the
Board’s reporting of its decision on its own website, where members of the public interested in
the PCAOB’s activities would naturally look for such matters.” The PCAOB decision would
inform the public of “precisely what conduct the Board considers to merit discipline, what issues
were litigated, and how its enforcement program performed.” Laccetti has not established that
the PCAOB should continue to be prevented from reporting its decision following the
completion of Commission review.
