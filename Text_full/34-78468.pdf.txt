In the Matter of
BRIAN W. BOPPRE

ORDER DENYING REQUEST TO VACATE BARS
Brian W. Boppre seeks to vacate an administrative order, dated December 16, 2011 (the
"Order"), to the extent that it bars him from association with any nationally recognized statistical
rating organization ("NRSRO") or municipal advisor.1
The Order barred Boppre from "association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser,
municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent;" from "serving or acting as an employee, officer,
director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser or depositor of, or principal
underwriter for, a registered investment company or affiliated person of such investment adviser,
depositor or principal underwriter;" and from "participating in any offering of a penny stock,
including: acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in
activities with a broker, dealer or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny
stock, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock. . . ." It did
not, however, bar him from association with an NRSRO or a municipal advisor. Accordingly,
Brian W. Boppre's request to vacate NRSRO and municipal advisor bars is denied.
By the Commission.
