FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Background
17.

Between June 2012 and June 2014, Whelehan and Tsai worked at Broker-Dealer

A. During this time, they became romantically involved, and in October 2014,they began living
together in a Manhattan apartment. In June 2014, they both left Broker-Dealer A,and,
thereafter, Whelehan worked at Investment Adviser A and Tsai worked at Investment Adviser B.
Whelehan Obtained Confidential Information About Apollds Planned ADT Acquisition.
18.

On December 17, 2015, Apollo approached Investment Adviser A about its

cazporate parent making an equity investment in funds advised by Apollo so that one of its
portfolio companies could acquire ADT. Once Investment Adviser A agreed to consider this
transaction, Apollo and Investment Adviser A executed an NDA related to the planned. ADT
acquisition. On December 21, 2015, Investment Adviser A signed and returned the NDA to
Apollo and received access to Apollo's dataroom, which contained confidential documentation
pertaining to this acquisition.
19.

Investment Adviser A performed due diligence on the ADT transaction between

December 21, 2015 and the Announcement. During this time, Investment Adviser A's deal
team, which included Whelehan, met numerous times with Apollo and its advisers to discuss the
transaction and to conduct due diligence. On January 5 and 7, 2016, Whelehan and others at
Investment Adviser A met with Apollo staffto discuss the planned acquisition.
20.

As of December 21, 2015, Whelehan also had fu11 access to Apollo's dataroom,

which included management presentations for Apollo, Apollo's internal financial models,
Investment Adviser A's internal business analysis modets,the approximate acquisition price, and
presentations for Investment Adviser A's corporate parent.

Case 1:16-cv-07398 Document 1 Filed 09/22/16 Page 6 of 10

21.

Whelehan understood that the information abo~~t Apollo's affiliates' acquisition

of ADT was highly confidential and that he was prohibited from misusing this information, by
among other things, communicating it to anyone outside of work. As part of his employment,
Whelehan had agreed not to disclose any such information. He was subject to Investment
Adviser A's compliance policies which, in part, stated:"[e]mployee has a duty to preserve and
protect the security and confidentiality of Classified Information in his/her knowledge,
possession, ox control and shall be aware of hislher obligation of confidentiality as set out in the
terms of his/her employment and/or engagement." Investment Adviser A's compliance policies
further state: "Employees in possession of price sensitive information are not allowed to
communicate the price sensitive information to anyone, including their family or friends, ifthey
know that such persons will or are likely to deal in that Security. It does not matter whether such
persons actually deal."
22.

As of December 2015, Whelehan also had received training on those compliance

policies, including training on insider trading prohibitions. On December 18, 2015, shortly
before Whelehan was granted access to Apollo's dataroom, Investment Adviser A specifically
notified Whelehan about the NDA,thereby highlighting to him the importance of keeping
confidential the information he learned about the ADT acquisition.
Whelehan Breached His Duty To Investment Adviser A By Tipping Tsai.
23.

Notwithstanding his duty to keep Investment Adviser A's information

canfidential, Whelehan tipped Tsai about Apollo's affiliates' planned acquisition of ADT,
including the approximate acquisition price. For example, on December 22, 2015, one day after
WYzelehan obtained. access to Apollo's dataroom regarding the ADT acquisition, Whelehan sent

Case 1:16-cv-07398 Document 1 Filed 09/22/16 Page 7 of 10

an email using his work email address to Tsai's work email address, writing in part: "one of
Apollo's portfolio companies would be buying out ADT."
24.

Whelehan and Tsai both understood that he told her material, nonpublic

information about ADT so that she could trade in advance ofthe Announcement to obtain illicit
insider trading profits. Indeed, after Tsai had purchased ADT stock, in a February 3, 20I6 email
exchange, she complained. to Whelehan about ADT's stock price having dropped below her $29
per share purchase price: "So when is it[ADT's stock pricel going to BOUNCE. I wish I had
bought it now man. $26'!" He responded.,"I told you to average down" and she replied,"I put
too much $ in to buy more."
25.

As a result of his tip, Whelehan received a personal benefit in the form ova gift to

his closest personal friend, his live-in girlfriend and romantic partner, Tsai.
Tsars Insider Trading
Zb.

When. Whelehan tipped Tsai, Tsai knew that the information he communicated to

her about the ADT acquisition had been obtained improperly, in breach of Whelehan's duty to
his employer,a nd that Wheiehan conveyed this information to her as a gift, intending that she
profit by purchasing ADT securities before the Announcement. At the time, Tsai knew that:(i)
Whelehan worked at Investment Adviser A as part of a team considering whether to recommend
an investment in the ADT acquisition;(ii} this information was highly confidential; and {iii)
Whelehan was prohibited from communicating this information to anyone outside of work.
27.

Based on the information she received from Whelehan, on January 22, 2016, Tsai

purchased 1,500 shares of ADT stock at $29.00 per share.

7

Case 1:16-cv-07398 Document 1 Filed 09/22/16 Page 8 of 10

28.

Also based on the information she received from Whelehan, Tsai recommended to

a close relative to purchase ADT stock. Thereafter, on January 22, 216,Tsai's close relative
purchased 343 shares of ADT stock at $29.13 per share.
29.

On February 16, 2016, Apollo announced that it would acquire ADT for $42.00

per share. Immediately thereafter, the price of ADT stock increased approximately 48 percent,
from $26.87 per share at the close ofthe previous trading day, to $39.64 per share on Tuesday,
~ebritazy 16, 2016.
30.

Consequently, Tsai and her close relative generated ilFicit profits of approximately

$19,500.00 and $4,414.41, respectively.
Tsai Lied When Confronted About Her Insider Trading.
31.

On February 19, 2016, the chief compliance officer (~`CCO"} of Tsai's employer,

Investment Adviser B, asked Tsai about her 3anuary 22, 2016 ADT stock purchase. Initially,
Tsai lied, saying that she bought it only because she thought ADT was a good company.
However, after the CCO confronted her with her emails showing that Whelehan had tipped her,
she admitted that she bought ADT stock because Whelehan had told her about Apollo's planned
acquisition of ADT. After she was caught lying, Tsai also admitted to the CCO that she knew
that her actions were wrong.
