INITIAL DECISION MAKING FINDINGS
AND IMPOSING SANCTION BY DEFAULT
September 16, 2016

Jonathan S. Polish and Daniel J. Hayes for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission
James A. McGurk for Respondent Stephan von Hase

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision bars Stephan von Hase from the securities industry. He was previously
enjoined against violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Procedural Background
The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on May 13, 2016, pursuant to Sections 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers
Act). The proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on SEC v. Benger, No. 1:09-cv-00676 (N.D.
Ill.), appeal docketed, No. 16-1886 (7th Cir. Apr. 22, 2016), in which von Hase was enjoined
against violations of the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act of 1933
(Securities Act) and against violations of the registration provisions of the Exchange Act.
Two prehearing conferences, at which von Hase appeared through counsel, were held, on
June 7 and 28, 2016; at the conferences, the due date for von Hase’s Answer to the OIP was
postponed, first to June 27, and then to July 12, 2016. Stephan von Hase, Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release Nos. 3901, 3956; 2016 SEC LEXIS 2023 (June 7, 2016), 2016 SEC LEXIS 2292 (June 29,
2016). Contingent on von Hase’s filing an Answer, the Division was granted leave to file a motion
for summary disposition pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250. Id. No Answer was filed, and von Hase
was ordered to show cause, by July 22, 2016, why he should not be deemed to be in default and the
proceeding determined against him. Stephan von Hase, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3992,
2016 SEC LEXIS 2461 (July 15, 2016). Again contingent on an Answer, the Division was invited

to file a motion for summary disposition by July 29; absent an Answer, it was invited to file a
motion for default, specifying the sanctions it seeks, by that date. Id. at *1 n.1. The Division filed
such a motion, in the alternative, on July 29, requesting that von Hase be barred from association
with a broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer,1 or transfer agent.
To date, von Hase has not filed an Answer, a response to the Order to Show Cause, or an
opposition to the Division’s July 29 motion. Thus, he has failed to answer or otherwise to defend the
proceeding within the meaning of 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a)(2). Accordingly, von Hase is in default, and
the undersigned finds that the allegations in the OIP are true as to him. See OIP at 5; 17 C.F.R. §§
201.155(a), .220(f).
B. Procedural Issues
1. Official Notice
Official notice pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.323 is taken of the docket report and the court’s
orders in SEC v. Benger, of the Commission’s public official records, and of Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), records as well. See Joseph S. Amundsen, Exchange Act
Release No. 69406, 2013 SEC LEXIS 1148, at *1 n.1 (Apr. 18, 2013), pet. for review denied, 575
F. App’x 1 (D.C. Cir. 2014).
2. Pending Appeal
The pendency of an appeal does not preclude the Commission from action based on an
injunction. See Joseph P. Galluzzi, Exchange Act Release No. 46405, 2002 SEC LEXIS 3423, at
*10 n.21 (Aug. 23, 2002); Charles Phillip Elliott, Exchange Act Release No. 31202, 1992 SEC
LEXIS 2334, at *11 (Sept. 17, 1992). If von Hase is successful in overturning his injunction, he can
request the Commission to vacate any sanctions ordered in this proceeding (or to dismiss the
proceeding, if it is still pending).2
1

The motion uses the term “municipal advisor,” rather than “municipal securities dealer.” Motion
at 18. The undersigned has construed this to be a typographical error in that the Division’s request
for a collateral bar is otherwise tailored to comply with the ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the D.C. Circuit regarding retroactive application of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which authorized collateral bars. See Koch v. SEC, 793 F.3d
147, 157-58 (D.C. Cir. 2015), pet. for rehearing en banc denied, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 16375
(Sept. 14, 2015), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 1492 (2016).

.
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
Von Hase and his entity CTA Worldwide Services, S.A. (CTA), were enjoined in SEC v.
Benger, from committing violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, of Exchange
Act Section 15(a), and of Securities Act Section 17(a); the court also imposed a penny stock bar on
them and ordered them, jointly and severally, to pay disgorgement of $3,031,999.45 plus
prejudgment interest of $759,151.46 for a total of $3,791,150.91 and to pay a civil penalty of
$400,000. SEC v. Benger, ECF No. 565 at 1-3. The judgment was entered by default, following
extensive litigation of the case and delaying tactics by von Hase between 2009 and 2015. Id., ECF
No. 557 at 4-5, 23-24; docket report, passim.
As discussed infra, the following additional facts are established as alleged in the OIP: Von
Hase is a German citizen and was sole owner of CTA. Through CTA, he was the distribution agent
for several of the penny stocks sold through the boiler room operation that he owned and operated.
He was also the president of Chicago-based Marblehead Financial Group, Inc., an investment
adviser registered with the State of Illinois. Prior to his association with Marblehead and CTA, he
was associated with various securities and commodities firms. He is not currently associated with a
registered broker-dealer.
Von Hase and others conceived, structured, and carried out an elaborate boiler room scheme
that enriched themselves and their boiler room operatives while defrauding investors. They
concealed their involvement in the operation and insulated themselves from the fallout when the
defrauded investors learned that most of their investment proceeds were being siphoned to von Hase
and others involved in the boiler room operation. Specifically, in 2008, von Hase purchased a
boiler room operation for which he agreed to pay $2.5 million over a period of time. He also served
as a “distribution agent” in the scheme, which involved the offer and sale of “Regulation S” stock in
several penny stock issuers.3 All but one of the issuers were based in the United States and, with
limited exceptions, the stock of each was quoted through the OTC Bulletin Board or “Pink Sheets”
in the United States. During the relevant period, the stock of most if not all of the issuers traded at
under $5 per share and otherwise met the definition of a “penny stock” under the federal securities
laws.
As the distribution agent, von Hase helped plan and facilitate the penny stock offerings. He
helped prepare, distribute, and process the three contract documents used in the offerings: an
escrow agreement, a distribution agreement, and a share purchase agreement (SPA). After
identifying penny stock companies willing to participate in Regulation S stock offerings, von Hase
provided the companies with distribution agreements. In the agreements, von Hase offered to
deploy his overseas boiler room sales force to sell the company’s shares to foreign investors in
exchange for sales commissions exceeding 60%.
18, 2012) (vacating bar issued in follow-on administrative proceeding where court of appeals, after
Commission had issued bar order, vacated criminal conviction that was basis for proceeding).
3

“Regulation S” provides an exemption from registration with the Commission for securities
offerings in which (among other things) all investors are located outside the United States. Stock
sold under this exemption is sometimes referred to as “Regulation S stock.”
3

Von Hase hid from investors his involvement in the offerings and his commissions. In an
email, von Hase reminded one issuer that the investor “does not know any think [sic] about CTA or
myself, please keep it so.” Although the distribution agreement spelled out the identity and
responsibilities of von Hase, and detailed his exorbitant commissions, neither the distribution
agreement nor the information in it was ever disclosed to investors. To the contrary, the only
document provided to investors – the SPA – falsely represented that investors would be charged
only a nominal fee (no more than 1%) and that the rest of their investment money would go to the
issuers.
Von Hase hired a network of sales agents located outside the United States to solicit
investments in the issuers’ stock from overseas investors. These boiler room operators preyed
largely upon less sophisticated foreign investors, including elderly Europeans, employing high
pressure sales tactics and myriad misrepresentations to induce the purchase of the restricted stocks.
Some of the boiler rooms retained by von Hase were on the United Kingdom’s Financial
Services Authority warning list of firms that were suspected of boiler room activity and were not
authorized to do business in the U.K. During their cold call sales pitches, some of the agents falsely
claimed to work for legitimate U.K.-based brokerage firms.
Von Hase took pains to maintain his and the offshore boiler room agents’ anonymity. The
agents used aliases in their dealings with investors and routinely told prospective investors that they
worked for companies that either did not exist or that existed but with which the agents had no
affiliation. The agents maintained offshore bank accounts located in countries known for their
strong bank secrecy laws. Von Hase tried to recruit new agents through internet postings, assuring
at least one potential agent that he would help both to establish leads and to set up the technology
needed to obscure the location from which the agent’s calls were originating.
Von Hase had regular contact with the overseas sales agents. He supplied them with
information about the issuers to be used in their sales pitches to investors.
An individual who agreed to invest in the Regulation S stock was sent an SPA documenting
the purchase. In most cases, the SPA directed the investor to send his or her investment funds and
portions of the signed SPA to a designated escrow agent. The SPAs were generally the only
documents provided to investors in connection with their purchases. Von Hase used U.S.-based
escrow agents, including an American law firm, which gave investors an added measure of security
and comfort about their overseas investment. The escrow agents received and processed investors’
signed SPAs; received investor funds into escrow accounts in the United States; disbursed investor
funds to the issuers and others receiving sales commissions; and sent share certificates to investors
to finalize their purchases of stock. The escrow agents received commission payments for this.
The purchase and sale of each Regulation S stock transaction occurred in the United States,
where the escrow agents and all but one of the issuers were located. Pursuant to the language in the
distribution and escrow agreements, the escrow agent disbursed more than 60% of the investor
proceeds to itself, the boiler room operators, and von Hase, while remitting less than 40% of the
proceeds to the issuers. This distribution of the investor proceeds was hidden from the defrauded
investors, who instead were led to believe by the SPAs and the boiler room agents that all of their
investments would go to the issuer, less a nominal transaction fee.
4

Von Hase raised at least $16.7 million from investors through these penny stock offerings.
Of that amount, von Hase received, either directly or indirectly through CTA, over $6 million in
commissions.
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Von Hase has been enjoined “from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in
connection with . . . the purchase or sale of any security within the meaning of Sections 15(b)(4)(C)
and 15(b)(6)(A)(iii) of the Exchange Act and Sections 203(e)(4) and 203(f) of the Advisers Act.
IV. SANCTION
As the Division requests, a collateral bar will be ordered.
A. Sanction Considerations
The Commission determines sanctions pursuant to a public interest standard. See 15 U.S.C.
§§ 78o(b)(6), 80b-3(f). The Commission considers factors including:
the egregiousness of the defendant’s actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of the
infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the defendant’s assurances
against future violations, the defendant’s recognition of the wrongful nature of his
conduct, and the likelihood that the defendant’s occupation will present opportunities
for future violations.
Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979) (quoting SEC v. Blatt, 583 F.2d 1325, 1334
n.29 (5th Cir. 1978)), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981). The Commission also considers
the age of the violation and the degree of harm to investors and the marketplace resulting from the
violation. Marshall E. Melton, 2003 SEC LEXIS 1767, at *5. Additionally, the Commission
considers the extent to which the sanction will have a deterrent effect. Schield Mgmt. Co.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53201, 2006 SEC LEXIS 195, at *35 & n.46 (Jan. 31, 2006). The public
interest requires a severe sanction when a respondent’s past misconduct involves fraud because
opportunities for dishonesty recur constantly in the securities business. See Vladimir Boris
Bugarski, Exchange Act Release No. 66842, 2012 SEC LEXIS 1267, at *18 n.26 (Apr. 20, 2012);
Richard C. Spangler, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 12104, 1976 SEC LEXIS 2418, at *34 (Feb.
12, 1976).
B. Sanction
As described in the Findings of Fact, von Hase’s conduct was egregious and recurrent, with
several issuers, and involved a high degree of scienter. His occupation, if he were allowed to
continue it in the future, would present opportunities for future violations. Absent a bar, he could
resume engaging in the securities industry. The violations are neither recent nor distant in time.
Von Hase has not recognized the wrongful nature of his conduct. The more than $3 million in
disgorgement that he was ordered to pay is a measure of the direct harm to the marketplace.
Further, as the Commission has often emphasized, the public interest determination extends beyond
consideration of the particular investors affected by a respondent’s conduct to the public-at-large,
5

the welfare of investors as a class, and standards of conduct in the securities business generally. See
Christopher A. Lowry, Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 2052, 2002 SEC LEXIS 2346, at
*20 (Aug. 30, 2002), aff’d, 340 F.3d 501 (8th Cir. 2003); Arthur Lipper Corp., Exchange Act Release
No. 11773, 1975 SEC LEXIS 527, at *52 (Oct. 24, 1975). An injunction involving dishonesty
requires a bar, and because of the Commission’s obligation to ensure honest securities markets, an
industry-wide bar is appropriate.
The Commission considers an antifraud injunction to be especially serious and to subject a
respondent to the severest of sanctions. Marshall E. Melton, 2003 SEC LEXIS 1767, at *29-30.
Indeed, from 1995 to the present, there have been over thirty-five litigated follow-on proceedings
based on antifraud injunctions in which the Commission issued opinions, and all of the respondents
were barred4 – thirty-four unqualified bars and three bars with the right to reapply after five years. 5
Further, in every such case that followed the statutory provision of collateral bars, the Commission
imposed a collateral bar rather than an industry specific bar, reasoning that the antifraud provisions
of the securities laws apply broadly to all securities-related professionals and violations demonstrate
unfitness for future participation in the securities industry, even if the disqualifying conduct is not
related to the professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she engaged in
the misconduct underlying the proceeding. See John W. Lawton, Advisers Act Release No. 3513,
2012 SEC LEXIS 3855, at *42-43 (Dec. 13, 2012), vacated in part on other grounds, Advisers Act
Release No. 4402, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1926 (May 27, 2016).
V. ORDER
IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, STEPHAN VON HASE IS BARRED from
associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or transfer
agent.
This Initial Decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Rule 360 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, a
party may file a petition for review of this Initial Decision within twenty-one days after service of
the Initial Decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten
days of the Initial Decision, pursuant to Rule 111 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.111. If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a party shall have
twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the undersigned’s order resolving such
4

In the cases authorized before the effective date of the Dodd-Frank Act, which authorized
collateral bars, the Commission imposed industry-specific bars, such as a bar from association with
an investment adviser on a respondent who had been associated with an investment adviser at the
time of his violation.
5

Those three were Richard J. Puccio, Exchange Act Release No. 37849, 1996 SEC LEXIS 2987
(Oct. 22, 1996), Martin B. Sloate, Exchange Act Release No. 38373, 1997 SEC LEXIS 524 (Mar. 7,
1997), and Robert Radano, Advisers Act Release No. 2750, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1504 (June 30,
2008). The Commission’s opinions do not make clear the factors that distinguished these cases
from those in which unqualified bars were imposed, but there is little difference between a “bar”
and a “bar with the right to reapply in five years.”
6

motion to correct a manifest error of fact. The Initial Decision will not become final until the
Commission enters an order of finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a
party files a petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission
determines on its own initiative to review the Initial Decision as to a party. If any of these events
occur, the Initial Decision shall not become final as to that party. 6
