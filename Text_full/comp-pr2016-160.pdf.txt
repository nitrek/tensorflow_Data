follows:
SUMMARY OF THE ACTION

25
26

1.

This is an insider trading case involving the securities of Ardea

27

Biosciences, Inc. ("Ardea"), a California-based biotechnology company. In advance

Case 3:16-cv-02017-JAH-MDD Document 1 Filed 08/11/16 Page 2 of 13

1

Fefferman, who was Ardea's Senior Director ofInformation Technology, tipped his

2

brother-in-law Chad E. Wiegand material, nonpublic information concerning, among

3

other things, an agreement between Ardea and another company to license a cancer

4

drug and an acquisition of Ardea by AstraZeneca PLC ("AstraZeneca").

5

2.

Wiegand, a registered representative associated with a registered

6

broker-dealer ("Broker A"), passed the information about Ardea he received from

7

his brother-in-law to his friend and colleague, Akis C. Eracleous, who was also a

8

registered representative at Broker A. Eracleous shared the nonpublic information

9

about Ardea's 2009 licensing agreement and Ardea's 2012 merger with AstraZeneca

10

with his friend and business associate, Defendant Paul T. Rampoldi, a registered

11

representative at Broker A, and their mutual friend and brokerage customer,

12

Defendant William Scott Blythe III.

13

3.

Defendants Rampoldi and Blythe used the material, nonpublic

14

information they received from Eracleous to trade Ardea securities and to realize

15

illegal trading profits totaling approximately $90,000.

16

4.

By knowingly or recklessly engaging in the conduct described in this

17

complaint, Defendants Rampoldi and Blythe violated and, unless enjoined and

18

restrained, will continue to violate Section 1O(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of

19

1934 ("Exchange Act") [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R.

20

§ 240.10b-5].

21
22

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 21(d) and 21A

23

of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u-l] to enjoin such acts, practices,

24

and courses of business and to obtain disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil

25

money penalties, and such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and

26

appropriate.

27
28

6.

The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(e),

21A, and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(e), 78u-l, and 78aa].

Case 3:16-cv-02017-JAH-MDD Document 1 Filed 08/11/16 Page 3 of 13

1

7.

Venue in this district is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange

2

Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]. Among other things, certain of the acts, practices, and

3

courses of business constituting the violations of the federal securities laws alleged

4

herein occurred within the Southern District of California.
COMMONLY-USED TRADING TERMS

5

6

8.

A stock option, commonly referred to as an "option," gives its

7

purchaser-holder the option to buy or sell shares of an underlying stock at a specified

8

price (the "strike" price) at a later date. Options are generally sold in "contracts,"

9

which give the option holder the opportunity to buy or sell 100 shares of an

10
11

underlying stock.
9.

A "call" option gives the purchaser-holder of the option the right, but

12

not the obligation, to purchase a security at the specified strike price within a specific

13

time period. Generally, the buyer of a call option anticipates that the price of the

14

underlying security will increase during a specified amount of time.

12 judgments against them in the Commission's action. The Court entered judgments
13

and permanently enjoined each of them from future violations of Section lOeb) of the

14

Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R.

As Senior Director ofInformation Technology at Ardea, Fefferman

22

learned material, nonpublic information relating to Ardea and its business, products,

23

and potential corporate transactions, including the information discussed in more

24

detail in this complaint.

25

21.

At all times pertinent to this complaint, Fefferman was subject to a duty

26

Fefferman Tipped Wiegand, Who, in Turn, Tipped Eracleous, Who

22.

The April 28, 2009 Licensing Announcement

In or about March 2009, Fefferman became aware, through his position

7

at Ardea, that Ardea would soon publicly announce a global agreement with Bayer

8

HealthCare, LLC (the "Bayer announcement") concerning the licensing of an Ardea

9

developmental cancer treatment. Knowing that the announcement was likely to have

10

a positive impact on Ardea's stock price, Fefferman tipped this information about the

11

Bayer announcement to Wiegand so that Wiegand could trade on it. Fefferman told

12

Wiegand that the Bayer agreement was a big event at Ardea and that Ardea was

13

"going to get a lot of money." Wiegand in turn tipped the inside information about

14

the Bayer announcement in or about March 2009 to Eracleous, who, in turn, tipped

15

the information to Rampoldi and Blythe contemporaneously.

16

23.

From March 24, 2009, through April 9, 2009, after being tipped by

17

Eracleous, Rampoldi purchased or caused to be purchased 1,085 Ardea shares in his

18

personal brokerage account at Broker A and 1,500 Ardea shares in his sister's

19

account at Broker A. At the time of the purchases, Rampoldi knew or was reckless

20

in not knowing that this tip of material, nonpublic information to Eracleous came

21

from Wiegand and that Wiegand's brother-in-law Fefferman worked at Ardea.

22

24.

On April 23, 2009, after being tipped by Eracleous, Blythe purchased or

23

caused to be purchased 500 Ardea shares in his brokerage account at Broker B. At

24

the time of his purchase, Blythe knew or was reckless in not knowing that this tip of

25

material, nonpublic information to Eracleous came from Wiegand and that

26

Wiegand's brother-in-law Fefferman worked at Ardea.

27
28

25.

On April 27, 2009, shares of Ardea stock closed at $11.68 per share.

The next day, April 28, Ardea publicly announced the Bayer agreement. On April
6

Case 3:16-cv-02017-JAH-MDD Document 1 Filed 08/11/16 Page 7 of 13

1 28, following the announcement, shares of Ardea closed at $13.11 per share, an
2
3

increase of approximately 12% from the prior day's closing price.
26.

Following the Bayer announcement, Rampoldi sold the Ardea shares he

4

had purchased for himself and his sister in advance of the announcement on the basis

5

of material, nonpublic information, realizing $5,693 in illegal trading profits.

6

27.

Following the Bayer announcement, Blythe sold the Ardea shares he

7

had purchased for himself in advance of the announcement on the basis of material,

10

The Apri123, 2012 Acquisition Announcement
(a)

Fefferman, on Account of His Position at Ardea,

11

Became Aware of Material, Nonpublic Information

12

About a Possible Sale ofthe Company

13

28.

As early as September 2011, Ardea's management began contemplating

14

a possible sale of the company. From at least September 2011 through April 2012,

15

several companies expressed interest in acquiring Ardea and held discussions with

16

Ardea management and conducted due diligence.

17

29.

In February and March 2012, AstraZeneca made two non-binding

18

proposals to purchase Ardea starting at $24.17 per share. The offers were contingent

19

upon AstraZeneca's completion of further due diligence, which AstraZeneca

20

conducted at Ardea's San Diego offices from approximately March 19,2012,

21

through March 22, 2012.

22

30.

As the Senior Director ofInformation Technology at Ardea, Fefferman

23

was involved in facilitating the due diligence process beginning in late 2011.

24

Feffennan created electronic "data rooms" that contained proprietary information

25

about Ardea and its business operations and arranged for several different companies

26

to have access, including AstraZeneca. As work on a potential acquisition

27

progressed, Fefferman obtained additional material, nonpublic information,

28
7

Case 3:16-cv-02017-JAH-MDD Document 1 Filed 08/11/16 Page 8 of 13

1

including regarding the certainty of an acquisition, its timing, and the premium to be

2

paid for Ardea stock.

3

31.

On or about April15, 2012, AstraZeneca increased its offer to purchase

4

Ardea to a price of $30 per share, which reflected a substantial premium over the

5

trading price of Ardea stock at that time. Ardea's board of directors rejected the

6

AstraZeneca offer, but Ardea management continued negotiations with AstraZeneca

7

and other companies.

8
9

32.

On April 19, 2012, Ardea executives requested that AstraZeneca and

one other company submit final purchase offers by Friday, April 20, 2012.

10

AstraZeneca responded and submitted an offer of $32 per share, which Ardea's

11

board of directors accepted on April 20, 2012.

12

33.

Ardea and AstraZenecajointly announced the proposed acquisition

13

agreement before the opening of securities trading on Monday, April 23, 2012 (the

14

"acquisition announcement").

15

34.

On Friday, April 20, 2012, the last trading day before the acquisition

16

announcement, Ardea's stock price closed at $20.84 per share. On April 23, 2012,

17

following the acquisition announcement, Ardea's stock price closed at $31.62 per

18

share, an approximately 52% increase from the prior trading day's closing price.
(b)

19

Fefferman Tipped Wiegand About the Material,

20

Nonpublic Information Regarding the Ardea

21

Acquisition Negotiations

22

35.

Beginning in late 2011, F efferman told Wiegand that he believed Ardea

23

was going to be acquired based on the fact that he had given access to Ardea's data

24

rooms to several pharmaceutical companies conducting due diligence.

25

36.

During the weekend of April 14, 2012, Wiegand visited Fefferman's

26

home. During the visit, Fefferman told Wiegand that an Ardea acquisition would

27

occur soon. From approximately April 15, 2012, through April19, 2012, Fefferman

28

told Wiegand more details about the possible acquisition of Ardea.
8

Case 3:16-cv-02017-JAH-MDD Document 1 Filed 08/11/16 Page 9 of 13

1

37.

On or about Friday, April 20, 2012, at 11:52 a.m. Pacific time,

2

Fefferman called Wiegand. Fefferman told Wiegand during the call that he hoped

3

Wiegand had bought Ardea stock, and confirmed to Wiegand that the acquisition

4

was proceeding.
(c)

5

Blythe

6
7

Wiegand Tipped Eracleous, Who Tipped Rampoldi and

38.

Prior to April 16,2012, Wiegand told Eracleous that an Ardea

8

acquisition would be happening soon. Around April 17 or 18,2012, Wiegand told

9

Eracleous that it was time to begin buying Ardea securities. Erac1eous understood

10
11

Wiegand's statement to mean that the Ardea acquisition would occur soon.
39.

After receiving material, nonpublic acquisition announcement

12

information from Wiegand during the week of April 16,2012, Eracleous tipped the

13

information to Rampoldi and Blythe.

14

40.

On April 19, 2012, Eracleous exchanged text messages with Rampoldi

15

and called Blythe. Among other things, Eracleous and Rampoldi discussed the

16

material, nonpublic information relating to the sale of Ardea.

17

41.

During the morning of April 20, 2012, Eracleous and Rampoldi called

18

Blythe and asked him to purchase Ardea securities on behalf of all three of them.

19

Erac1eous, Rampoldi, and Blythe decided that, in order to avoid detection, Blythe

20

would fund the purchase of Ardea call option contracts in Blythe's brokerage

21

account at Broker B, and agreed to divide the illegal profits from the Ardea securities

22

trading by allotting fifty percent to Blythe and twenty-five percent each to Eracleous

23

and Rampoldi.

24

42.

25
26

During one or more telephone calls on the morning of April 20, 2012,

Rampoldi instructed Blythe on how to purchase 100 Ardea call option contracts.
43.

On April 20, 2012, at 12:58 p.m. Pacific time, soon after ending a call

27

with Erac1eous and Rampoldi, Blythe purchased 100 Ardea call option contracts in

28

his brokerage account at Broker B, costing approximately $5,400.
9

Case 3:16-cv-02017-JAH-MDD Document 1 Filed 08/11/16 Page 10 of 13

1

44.

At the time of Blythe's trades on April 20, 2012, Rampoldi and Blythe

2

knew or were reckless in not knowing that this tip of material, nonpublic information

3

to Eracleous came from Wiegand and that Wiegand's brother-in-law Fefferman

4

worked at Ardea.

5

45.

The very next trading day, April 23, 2012, AstraZeneca announced that

6

it was buying Ardea for $32 per share. Almost immediately, Blythe sold all of his

7

Ardea call option contracts and realized illegal trading profits of$83,493 for himself,

8

Rampoldi, and Eracleous. Following the sale, on April 24, 2012, Blythe transferred

9

$50,000 from his Broker B brokerage account to his personal bank account.

10

46.

From April 25 through 30,2012, Blythe withdrew a total of$43,000 in

11

cash from his bank account. In or around early May 2012, Eracleous, Rampoldi, and

12

Blythe met at Blythe's home where Blythe gave Eracleous and Rampoldi envelopes

13

each containing approximately $20,000 in cash, representing their shares of the

14

illegal Ardea trading profits.

15

47.

In May 2012, Fefferman and his wife, Wiegand, Eracleous, Rampoldi,

16

and Blythe went to a casino in California to celebrate their financial windfall from

17

the Ardea trading. During this trip, Blythe handed Wiegand an envelope containing

18

$2,000, to compensate him for the information Wiegand passed to Eracleous in

19

advance of the Ardea merger announcement.

20

(d)

21
22

EracIeous Shared His Cousin's Ardea Trading Profits
with Rampoldi

48.

On April 19, 2012, Eracleous, after receiving material, nonpublic

23

information from Wiegand about Ardea's acquisition, purchased 200 Ardea call

24

option contracts in the account of Eracleous's cousin, Eracles Panayioutou, who also

25

was the shared customer of Eracleous and Rampoldi.

26

49.

On April 23, 2012, after the acquisition armouncement, Eracleous sold

27

the 200 call option contracts in Panayioutou's account, realizing illegal trading

28

profits of$162,037. In or around July 2012, Panayioutou gave Eracleous $10,000 in
10

Case 3:16-cv-02017-JAH-MDD Document 1 Filed 08/11/16 Page 11 of 13

1

cash as compensation for making the Ardea trades. Eracleous gave $5,000 of those

2

profits to Rampoldi.

3

C.

Rampoldi and Blythe Each Violated the Federal Securities Laws

4

50.

As detailed above, the information about the two announcements

5

Eracleous tipped to Defendants Rampoldi and Blythe was material and nonpublic. A

6

reasonable investor would have viewed the information as being important to his

7

investment decision.

8
9

51.

As a corporate insider, Fefferman owed a duty to Ardea's shareholders.

In breach of this duty, for a personal benefit, Fefferman tipped the material,

10

nonpublic information about Ardea to his brother-in-law, Wiegand, knowing or

11

recklessly disregarding that Wiegand could be reasonably expected to trade on the

12

basis of that information.

13
14
15

52.

Defendants Rampoldi and Blythe knew or were reckless in not knowing

that the Ardea information tipped to them was material and nonpublic.
53.

Defendants Rampoldi and Blythe knew or should have known that the

16

information tipped to them had been transmitted improperly, in breach of a duty to

17

Ardea's shareholders and for personal benefit.

18

54.

Defendant Rampoldi, a securities industry professional, knew, or was

19

reckless in not knowing that neither he nor Defendant Blythe was permitted to trade

20

on the basis of the information tipped to them. Defendants Rampoldi and Blythe

21

knowingly or recklessly purchased Ardea securities while in possession, and on the

22

basis of, material, nonpublic information.

23

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

24

Violations of Section lO(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule lOb-5 Thereunder

25

56.

The information concerning the Bayer announcement and the

2

acquisition announcement that Fefferman tipped to Wiegand and that Wiegand and

3

others further tipped, as alleged above, was material and nonpublic.

4

57.

By engaging in the conduct described above, Defendants, directly or

5

indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, by use of the means

6

or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or the mails, or the facilities of a national

7

securities exchange:

8

a.

employed devices, schemes or artifices to defraud;

9

b.

made untrue statements of material facts or omitted to state material

10

facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the

11

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and/or

12

c.

engaged in acts, practices, or courses of business which operated or

13

would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with

14

the purchase or sale of any security.

15

58.

Members of the investing public who were trading in Ardea securities at

16

the same time as the Defendants were harmed by the Defendants' gaining of an

17

advantageous market position through insider trading.

18

59.

By engaging in the foregoing conduct, Defendants violated and, unless

19

enjoined, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.c.
