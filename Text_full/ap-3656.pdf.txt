In the Matter of
BENNETT GROUP FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC, and
DAWN J. BENNETT

ORDER ON RULE 235 MOTION

The Division of Enforcement has moved to admit the prior sworn testimony of Timothy
Augustin, John J. Koorey, and Bradley Mascho. For the reasons that follow, the Division’s
motion is GRANTED.
Background
After the Commission initiated this proceeding in September 2015, Respondents filed an
action in district court seeking to enjoin this proceeding. See Bennett v. SEC, No. 15-cv-3325,
2015 WL 9183445, at *1 (D. Md. Dec. 17, 2015). Among other arguments, Respondents
asserted that the manner in which the Commission’s administrative law judges are appointed
violates the Constitution’s Appointments Clause. Id. The district court dismissed for lack of
jurisdiction, id. at *1, 10, and Respondents appealed, see Bennett v. SEC, No. 15-2584 (4th Cir.).
Respondents subsequently informed my office and the Division of Enforcement that they would
not participate in the hearing in this matter.
On January 13, 2016, the Division filed its witness list, in which it asserted that
Respondents’ counsel had represented that neither Koorey nor Mascho would appear at the
hearing, “despite being subject to subpoenas.” List at 6. It added that it expected to offer
investigative testimony for some witnesses in lieu of live testimony. Id. at 7. I later issued an
order stating that if the Division were to offer investigative testimony, “it should be prepared to
address how admission of such prior sworn testimony is consistent with Commission Rule of
Practice 235.”1 Bennett Grp. Fin. Servs., LLC, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3507, 2016
SEC LEXIS 143 (ALJ Jan. 14, 2016).
The Division subsequently filed a motion to admit the prior sworn testimony of Augustin,
Koorey, and Mascho. In its motion, it asserted that Koorey and Mascho are “Bennett Group

insiders” and representatives of Bennett Group. Mot. at 2. It also asserted that at the time of his
testimony, Augustin was a principal and officer of the Bennett Group. Id.
The Division supported its motion with excerpts of its witnesses’ investigative testimony.
During his testimony, Koorey agreed that from May 2006 to November 2012, he was
“essentially the chief operations person at Bennett Group.” Mot. Ex. B at 29. He returned to that
same position in 2014. Id. at 41-44. Mascho testified that, as of the time of his testimony, he
was “a minority owner in” the Bennett Group and was a registered representative, financial
adviser, and Bennett Group’s managing director of research. Mot. Ex. C at 9. Augustin testified
that he was Bennett Group’s COO. Mot. Ex. E at 38. He was also a financial adviser and a
minority owner of the Bennett Group. Id. at 39, 53.
The hearing in this proceeding took place on January 27, 2016. Neither Respondents nor
their counsel appeared at the hearing. Tr. 9-10. As a result, I found Respondents in default. Tr.
10. During the hearing I asked Division counsel “how [Rule] 235 works with [respect to]
corporate insiders.” Tr. 13. I also remarked that Rule 235(a)(4) resembles Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 32(a)(4), subparagraph (D) of which contains an implicit reasonable diligence
requirement.2 Tr. 15. In light of that requirement, I asked whether the Division’s ability to rely
on Rule of Practice 235(a)(4) was limited because it did not attempt to enforce the subpoenas I
issued to its witnesses. Tr. 15. Among other things, Division counsel responded to my questions
by explaining that Koorey and Mascho are represented by Respondents’ counsel, who told the
Division that Koorey and Mascho would not appear. Tr. 14-16; see Renewed Mot. at 3 n.1.
The Division subsequently filed a renewed motion. In it, the Division first argues that
Rule 235 does not apply because all three witnesses are an “officer, director, managing agent, or
designee” of Respondent Bennett Group. Renewed Mot. at 4-6 (relying on Fed. R. Civ. P.
32(a)(3)). Alternatively, the Division argues that the witnesses’ investigative testimony should
be admitted because the testimony qualifies under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(D) as a
statement made by a party’s agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship
and while it existed. Id. at 6-7. Finally, the Division argues that if Rule 235 were to apply, the
witnesses’ testimony would be admissible under Rule 235(a)(4) or (5). Id. at 7-8.
The renewed motion is principally supported by three exhibits, comprising relevant
portions of the witnesses’ testimony. Exhibit C contains Mascho’s testimony during which he
explained that he, Bennett, and Augustin were Bennett Group’s three officers. Renewed Mot.
Ex. C at 206.

Rule 32(a)(4)(D) permits a party to “use” a witness’s deposition if “the party offering the
deposition could not procure the witness’s attendance by subpoena.” Courts have held that the
rule implicitly requires reasonable diligence in attempting to secure a witness’s presence before a
party may rely on the rule. See Williams v. Johnson, 278 F.R.D. 1, 5 (D.D.C. 2011), aff’d, 776
F.3d 865 (D.C. Cir. 2015).

Discussion
The Commission’s Rules of Practice do not bar the admission of hearsay and instead
provide for the exclusion of “evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious.” 17
C.F.R. § 201.320; see Del Mar Fin. Servs., Inc., Securities Act of 1933 Release No. 8314, 2003
WL 22425516, at *8 (Oct. 24, 2003). Rule 235 provides an exception to the general rule that
relevant evidence is admissible. 17 C.F.R. § 201.235. It bars the admission of a non-party’s
prior sworn statement unless one of five exceptions applies. As is relevant to this order, a nonparty’s prior sworn statement may be admitted if:
(4) the party offering the prior sworn statement has been unable to
procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or,
(5) in the discretion of the Commission or the hearing officer, it
would be desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the prior
sworn statement to be used.3
17 C.F.R. § 201.235(a)(4), (5).
As noted, the Division argues that Rule 235 does not apply and that even if it does, the
subject testimony is admissible under Rule 235(a)(4) or (5). Renewed Mot. at 4-8. By
voluntarily failing to appear at the hearing or respond to the Division’s motion, Respondents
have waived the opportunity to object to the admission of the Division’s evidence.4 I therefore
admit the prior sworn testimony of Augustin, Koorey, and Mascho.
Moreover, even absent waiver, I would admit the statements at issue. Rule 235 appears
to have been modeled on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 32(a). Compare Rule 235(a), with Fed
R. Civ. P. 32(a)(4). Although the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply in the
Commission’s administrative proceedings, it is appropriate to look to those rules for guidance,
especially if the Commission rule at issue is modeled after a rule of civil procedure.5

Rule 32 permits a party to “use for any purpose the deposition of . . . anyone who, when
deposed, was [an adverse] party’s officer, director, managing agent, or designee under Rule
30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4).” Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(3); see 7 James Wm. Moore, Moore’s Federal
Practice, § 32.21[2][a] (3d ed. 2015). At the time he was deposed, Augustin was Bennett
Group’s COO and one of its three officers. Mot. Ex. E at 38; Renewed Mot. Ex. C at 206.
Mascho was also an officer. Renewed Mot. Ex. C at 206. Because they were each an officer of
Bennett Group, Augustin and Mascho fall within the ambit of Rule 32(a)(3). Using Rule
32(a)(3) as a guide, I find that it is appropriate to admit the statements of Augustin and Mascho.
See Moore, supra, at § 32.21[2][a].
Because Koorey is not an officer or director, the question is whether he could be
considered a “managing agent.” See Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(3). Determining whether a witness is
a managing agent is largely a fact-specific endeavor6 which is dependent on a number of factors.7
There is little doubt that Koorey’s interests align with those of the Bennett Group. He is
employed by it and is represented by the same counsel who represent the Bennett Group.
Indeed, it was Bennett Group’s counsel who informed the Division that Koorey would not
appear at the hearing. And he functions as the “chief operations person” or “operations
manager.” Mot. Ex. B at 29, 44. But what being the chief operations person or manager means
is not clear. Additionally, it would appear that Augustin and Bennett are persons who were in
higher authority regarding the matters at issue. In fact, Koorey was ignorant as to a number of
relevant matters. See id. at 121-22. Weighing these factors as a whole, there is not enough
evidence to support the conclusion that Koorey is a managing agent.8 As a result, Rule 235
applies.
Rule 235(a)(5) permits me to admit prior sworn testimony if doing so would be “in the
interests of justice.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.235(a)(5). Respondents decided that it was in their best
interest not to appear at the hearing in this matter. Given that Koorey’s interests align with
Respondents and that he is represented by their counsel, it is plain that Koorey’s decision not to
the relevant Commission rule was “modeled” on the civil rule); Robert M. Ryerson, Exchange
Act Release No. 57839, 2008 WL 2117161, at *5 (May 20, 2008).

F.R.D. 521, 523 (D. Utah 2003).

In Bays Exploration., Inc. v. Pensa, Inc., the court concluded that an operations manager
qualified as a managing agent. No. 07-754, 2012 WL 122313, at *2 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 12, 2012).
The evidence in that case, however, revealed that the witness had “direct involvement in major
decisions made by the company, . . . had decision-making authority[,] and was directly involved
in decisions regarding [the company’s] operations.” Id. The Division has not pointed to
evidence of this nature regarding Koorey.

appear furthers Respondents’ interests and was influenced by his connection to Respondents.
Respondents are not in a position to complain about the use of the prior sworn testimony of a
witness whose absence they influenced, despite his being subject to a subpoena. Allowing
Respondents to benefit from Koorey’s absence would not serve the interests of justice. I
therefore hold that it is in the interest of justice to admit Koorey’s prior sworn testimony. 9

I have given “due regard . . . to the presumption that witnesses will testify orally in an
open hearing.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.235(a)(5). In light of Respondent’s litigation decisions, the
interests of justice related to admitting Koorey’s testimony outweigh the presumption in favor of
live testimony.
