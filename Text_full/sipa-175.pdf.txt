SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission is approving a proposed rule change
filed by SIPC, adding SIPC Rule 600, 17 CFR 300.600.

I.

Background
On April 17, 2015, SIPC filed a proposed rule change with the Commission under section

3(e)(2)(A) of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (“SIPA”), 1 and subsequently filed
amendments to the proposed rule change on June 23, 2015, July 24, 2015, and September 29,
2015. The proposed rule change would add SIPC Rule 600 (“Rule 600”), entitled “Rules
Relating to Supplemental Report of SIPC Membership.” Notice requesting comment on the
proposed rule change, as amended, was published in the Federal Register on November 4, 2015. 2
The Commission received one comment on the proposal. 3 The Commission is approving the
proposed rule change under section 3(e)(2) of SIPA. 4
II.

Proposed Rule Change
Pursuant to SIPA and SIPC Bylaws, broker-dealers that are SIPC members pay semi-

annual assessments to SIPC at the mid-point and at the end of their fiscal year. 5 The assessment
payments are the main source of funding for the SIPC Fund. The amount of the assessment a
broker-dealer must pay is based on the firm’s revenues from its securities business. 6
Consequently, in relation to the payment of the assessments, a broker-dealer must file with SIPC

a Form SIPC-6 (General Assessment Payment Form) with the mid-year assessment and a Form
SIPC-7 (General Assessment Reconciliation Form) with the year-end assessment. These forms
show the broker-dealer’s calculation of the assessment amount based on its revenues from its
securities business. 7
Broker-dealers that limit their business to certain specified activities or conduct their
business outside of the United States are exempt from being members of SIPC. 8 Consequently,
these broker-dealers do not pay a SIPC assessment. However, they must file a Form SIPC-3,
which is a certification by the broker-dealer that it is excluded from SIPC membership under
SIPA.
In 1972, as a result of significant discrepancies between the assessment information
reported to SIPC on the Forms SIPC-6 and SIPC-7 and information supplied in reports filed with
the Commission on which the calculation of the assessment was based, the Commission
amended Rule 17a-5 9 (the broker-dealer reporting rule). 10 As amended, the rule generally
requires broker-dealers to file with the Commission a SIPC supplemental report. 11 The SIPC
supplemental report includes a schedule of assessment payments or a statement that the brokerdealer qualified for exclusion from membership in SIPC. The SIPC supplemental report also
must include a report of an independent public accountant, who must be engaged to perform

Form SIPC-7 provides that the broker-dealer may deduct from the end of fiscal year
assessment the amount paid mid-year with the filing of the Form SIPC-6.

certain procedures specified in Rule 17a-5 with respect to the information provided in the
report. 12
On July 30, 2013, the Commission amended Rule 17a-5. 13 As part of this rulemaking,
the Commission determined that because Forms SIPC-3, SIPC-6, and SIPC-7 are used solely by
SIPC for purposes of levying its assessments, the SIPC supplemental report should be filed only
with SIPC. The Commission also determined that SIPC should prescribe the form and content of
the SIPC supplemental report. Accordingly, the Commission amended paragraph (e)(4) of Rule
17a-5 to provide that a broker-dealer must file a SIPC supplemental report with SIPC that
contains such information and is in such format as determined by SIPC by rule and approved by
the Commission.14
The rule change approved by the Commission adds SIPC Rule 600, entitled “Rules
Relating to Supplemental Report of SIPC Membership.” 15 The purpose of Rule 600 is to replace
the requirements currently in Rule 17a-5 prescribing the information that must be included in,
and the format of, the SIPC supplemental report. 16 The requirements of Rule 600 are modeled

The items that must be included in the report and the procedures to be performed by the
accountant are listed in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii)(A), (B), and (C) of Rule 17a-5.

16

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(e)(4)(ii). Rule 17a-5 provides that broker-dealers are required to
file the SIPC supplemental reports pursuant to the requirements in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of
the rule until the earlier of the Commission approving a rule adopted by SIPC or two
years from the effective date of the amendment (that is, by June 14, 2016). See 17 CFR
240.17a-5(e)(4)(ii). Consequently, if, after two years from the effective date no such
SIPC rule has been approved, broker-dealers would no longer be required to file the
reports.

on the requirements of Rule 17a-5. 17 For example, Rule 600 requires that the SIPC supplemental
report include, among other things, a copy of the Form SIPC-7 filed or a schedule of assessment
payments showing any overpayments applied and overpayments carried forward, including
payment dates and amounts; or, if exclusion from membership was claimed, a statement that the
broker-dealer qualified for exclusion from membership under SIPA and the date the Form SIPC3 was filed with SIPC. 18 Further, Rule 600 requires that the SIPC supplemental report include a
report of an independent public accountant who is engaged to perform the following agreed-upon
procedures:
•

•

Compare assessment payments made in accordance with Form SIPC-6 and applied to
the general assessment calculation on Form SIPC-7 with respective cash
disbursements record entries;
For all or any portion of a fiscal year, compare amounts reflected in the audited
financial statements required by Commission rule with amounts reported in Form
SIPC-7;

•

Compare adjustments reported in Form SIPC-7 with supporting schedules and
working papers supporting the adjustments;

•

Verify the arithmetical accuracy of the calculations reflected in Form SIPC-7 and in
the schedules and working papers supporting any adjustments; and

•

Compare the amount of any overpayment applied with the Form SIPC-7 on which it
was computed; or

•

If exclusion from membership is claimed, compare the income or loss reported in the
audited financial statements required by Commission rule with Form SIPC-3. 19

18

Compare Rule 600(b)(i) and (ii), with 17 CFR 240.17a-5(e)(4)(ii).

19

Compare Rule 600(b)(iii), with 17 CFR 240.17a-5(e)(4)(ii). Consistent with
requirements in Rule 17a-5 regarding the independent public accountant that is engaged
to prepare reports covering the annual reports of a broker-dealer, Rule 600 provides that
the independent public accountant who is engaged to perform the enumerated agreedupon procedures must be independent in accordance with the provisions of 17 CFR
210.2-01 and that the accountant must be engaged to perform the enumerated agreed5

Rule 600 also incorporates prior relief by providing that a SIPC member broker-dealer
is exempt from filing the supplemental report if the broker-dealer reports $500,000 or less in
total revenue in its “annual audited statement of income” filed with the Commission.20
Finally, Rule 600 provides that a broker-dealer must file the supplemental report within
60 days after the end of its fiscal year.

Discussion and Commission Action
Section 3(e)(2)(A) of SIPA provides that the SIPC Board of Directors must file with the

Commission any proposed amendment to a SIPC Rule. 21 Section 3(e)(2)(B) of SIPA provides
that within thirty-five days of the date of publication of the notice of filing of a proposed rule
change in the Federal Register, or within such longer period (1) as the Commission may
designate of not more than ninety days after such date if it finds such longer period to be
appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (2) as to which SIPC consents, the
Commission shall: (i) by order approve such proposed rule change or (ii) institute proceedings to
determine whether such proposed rule change should be disapproved. 22 Further, section
3(e)(2)(D) of SIPA provides that the Commission shall approve a proposed rule change if it finds

upon procedures in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board. See Rule 600(b)(iii); 17 CFR 240.17a-5(f)(1) and (g).

15 U.S.C. 78ccc(e)(2)(B). SIPC has agreed to two 60-day extensions; consequently, the
Commission must act no later than April 7, 2016. See e-mails from Hemant Sharma,
Associate General Counsel, SIPC, to Randall W. Roy, Deputy Associate Director,
Commission, dated December 3, 2015 and February 1, 2016.

that the proposed rule change is in the public interest and is consistent with the purposes of
SIPA. 23
The Commission finds, pursuant to section 3(e)(2)(D) of SIPA, that the proposed rule
change is in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of SIPA. First, as noted above,
paragraph (e)(4) of Rule 17a-5 provides that the broker-dealer must file with SIPC a report on
the SIPC annual general assessment reconciliation or exclusion from membership forms that
contains such information and is in such format as determined by SIPC by rule and approved by
the Commission. SIPC uses broker-dealers’ SIPC supplemental reports to evaluate whether
broker-dealers calculate their SIPC assessments correctly. These assessments are the main
source of funding for the SIPC Fund. The Commission determined that because Forms SIPC-3,
SIPC-6, and SIPC-7 are used solely by SIPC for purposes of levying its assessments, SIPC
should prescribe by rule the form and content of the SIPC supplemental report. Rule 600
prescribes the form and content of the report, in accordance with paragraph (e)(4) of Rule 17a-5.
Second, Rule 600 is modelled on existing requirements in Rule 17a-5 prescribing the information
that must be included in, and the format of, the SIPC supplemental report. Accordingly, the
Commission finds that Rule 600 is in the public interest and is consistent with the purposes of
SIPA.
IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED BY THE COMMISSION, pursuant to section 3(e)(2) of
SIPA, that the above-mentioned proposed rule change is approved. In accordance with section
3(e)(2) of SIPA, the approved rule change shall be given the force and effect as if promulgated
by the Commission.
