INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement, Securities and
Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Jason S. Patil, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registration of the registered securities of Respondent
Sino Oil & Gas Pipe Holdings Ltd.1 The revocation is based on Sino Oil’s failure to timely file
required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On September 18, 2014, the Commission initiated this proceeding with an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The OIP alleges that Sino Oil has a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant
to Exchange Act Section 12(g) and has repeatedly failed to file timely periodic reports with the
Commission, in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13
thereunder. On February 1, 2016, the Division of Enforcement submitted a return of service

Corridor Ventures II Acquisition Corp., Initial Decision Release No. 700, 2014 SEC LEXIS
4020 (ALJ Oct. 24, 2014), finality order, Exchange Act Release No. 73903, 2014 SEC LEXIS
4913 (Dec. 22, 2014).

certificate from the Chinese Ministry of Justice. The return of service, dated January 12, 2016,
shows that Chinese authorities attempted to serve Sino Oil at the address listed on its last filing
with the Commission, but that the attempt was unsuccessful because there was “[n]o such
company at the address provided in the request.”
I find that Sino Oil was served in accordance with Commission Rule of Practice
141(a)(2)(iv) by January 12, 2016. 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(iv). Rule 141(a)(2)(iv) allows for
service upon persons in a foreign country by any method specified in Rule 141(a)(2) or by any
other method reasonably calculated to give notice, provided that the method of service is not
prohibited by the law of the foreign country. Id. Here, attempted service was made at the
address provided by Sino Oil on its most recent filing with the Commission. Had the address
Sino Oil provided been in the United States or in another country that does not prohibit service
by mail, attempted, but unsuccessful, service would have been considered sufficient pursuant to
17 C.F.R. § 141(a)(2)(ii). I find that the attempted service at the address Sino Oil provided to the
Commission was reasonably calculated to give notice to Sino Oil based on the same reasoning
behind Commission Rule of Practice 141(a)(2)(ii), even though the company could not be found
at that address. Because the Chinese Ministry of Justice carried out the attempted service under
the Hague Convention standards applicable to it, the service was not prohibited by the law of the
foreign country, and for that reason complied with Rule 141(a)(2)(iv).
Accordingly, Sino Oil’s answer was due within ten days of service of the OIP, or by
January 22, 2016. OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). As of today, Sino Oil has not filed an
answer.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Sino Oil is in default for failing to file an answer or otherwise defend the proceeding.2
See OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, as authorized by Rule 155(a), I
find the following allegations in the OIP to be true.
Sino Oil, Central Index Key No. 1485536, is a struck off British Virgin Islands
corporation located in Jin Zhong City, China, with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). Sino Oil is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 20-F for
the period ended April 30, 2011.
In addition to its repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, Sino Oil failed to heed
delinquency letters sent to it by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance requesting
compliance with its periodic filing obligations or, through its failure to maintain a valid address
on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive such letters.

2

Given that Sino Oil could not be found at the address the Commission has for it, issuing an
order to show cause to that same address would have been an exercise in futility and I declined to
do so.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1 requires issuers of securities registered
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current and accurate
information in periodic reports. Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual reports.
See 17 C.F.R. § 240.13a-1. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and may not be
subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied, Exchange Act
Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not required to establish
violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1. See SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732,
740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978). Sino Oil failed to
file timely periodic reports and therefore failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and
Rule 13a-1.
SANCTIONS
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an opportunity for hearing,
that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the Exchange Act or
rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect investors, the
Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s violations, the
isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved, the extent of the
issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and the credibility of
its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Sino Oil’s failure to file required periodic reports is serious because it violates a central
provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is “to supply investors with
current and accurate financial information about an issuer so that they may make sound
[investment] decisions.” Id. at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that
Congress fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate
misrepresentations in the sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st
Cir. 1977). Sino Oil’s violations are also recurrent in that it repeatedly failed to file periodic
reports. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC
LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21, 2009) (respondent failed to file seven required periodic reports due
over a two-year period); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS
1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008) (respondent’s failure to make eight filings over an eighteenmonth period considered recurrent). Sino Oil is also culpable because it failed to heed
delinquency letters sent to it by the Division of Corporation Finance or, through its failure to
maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not
receive such letters. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC
LEXIS 3451, at *37 n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that scienter is not necessary to establish
grounds for revocation). Sino Oil has not answered the OIP or otherwise participated in the
proceeding to address whether it has made any efforts to remedy its past violations, and has
made no assurances against further violations.

For the reasons described above, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of
investors to revoke the registration of each class of Sino Oil’s registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registration of each class of registered securities of Sino Oil & Gas Pipe Holdings Ltd. is
hereby REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, a party may file a petition
for review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of the initial decision. A
party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial
decision, pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of
fact is filed by a party, that party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the
date of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion
to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become
final as to that party.
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
