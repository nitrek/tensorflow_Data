PREFACE
I am pleased to present the HumanResources Policies and Procedures Manual of The Cooperative University College of Kenya (CUCK). It comprehensively articulates policies and
procedures, as well as benefits, resources and services available to all employees of the
University College across all campuses.
This Manual aims to increase efficiency, equitable
treatment, and understanding of human resources
policies as well as to ensure consistency in human
resources administration of all CUCK staff.
The timeliness of this Manual is significant. It is a
considerable achievement as we start the new
phase for CUCK of attaining fully fledged status
as a premier Cooperative University in the
country.
PROF. (ENG.) DOUGLAS SHITANDA
PRINCIPAL, CUCK
Secondly, the Manual is the first concrete harmonization of responsibilities, regulations, rights
and guidelines which relate to employment, working conditions and staff development at
CUCK. The policies and procedures stated in this
CUCK and

Manual seek to integrate the values of

to uphold the identity of our institution.

In this manual, the previous Terms and Conditions of Service for CUCK employees have been
reviewed to serve three purposes:
i)

To ensure that CUCK complies with the Kenyan Labour Laws;

ii)

To ensure that CUCK adopts best practice in the management of its staff;

iii)

To consolidate the numerous isolated Human Resources Policies for ease of reference.

The University College recognizes that all its employees are unique and are part of the
continuous successful realization of its mission and vision. For this reason, I believe that through
the use of this Manual, CUCK will promote among its staff, dedication to research, quality
education and community service that are its hallmarks. This Manual also seeks to ensure that all

CUCK staff and campus workplaces mirror the goals and values that the University College has
embraced.
This Manual is a milestone in the building of a solid institutional capacity to address the
changing conditions of the labour market. As such, it is subject to continuous improvement in
response to new challenges.
This Manual shall also be read together with other policies or procedures that may be introduced
by the University College Council and the University College Management Board from time to
time.I am grateful to the Human Resource Departmentfor spearheading this task which we have
completed and present as a useful tool to the CUCK Community.

The University College recognizes that natural justice is the minimum standard of
fairness to be applied in the investigation and adjudication of a dispute.

Sexual harassment complaints can be handled through a variety of mechanisms.
The University College recognizes that, as a highly sensitive and complex matter,
sexual harassment is best dealt with informally through discussion between the
parties or with some assistance from an independent third party, so as to minimize
its damaging and disruptive effects. An informal resolution is not always possible
and it may be necessary to resort for formal procedures to resolve the complaint.

iii.

The University College encourages individuals who experience sexual harassment
to inform the alleged harasser that the behavior is unwelcome, unacceptable and
contrary to policy, and ask that the behavior stop. Individuals should also keep
notes documenting incidents of the behavior, time, place and any witness.

If it is not possible to confront the alleged harasser, or if this course of action fails
to stop the behavior, then the matter should be brought to the attention of the
Harassment Grievance Office, manager or supervisor for advice.

v.

The role of the Harassment Grievance Officer, manager or supervisor as a first
time line of contact, is to serve in an unbiased/impartial capacity to listen to the

complaint, offer support, provide advice on procedures and refer to the Grievance
Committee when appropriate.
vi.

The complaint may be resolved informally between the complainant and the
alleged harasser – through discussion, an apology and a commitment to stop the
behavior. In this case, the Harassment Grievance Officer (or manager, supervisor)
assisting an informal resolution will establish a follow up date to ensure the
behavior does not recur, otherwise no further action is necessary,

In the event that the complaint cannot be resolved informally, the complainant may lay a formal
complaint. In this case, the complainant is required to prepare and sign a formal written
complaint to the Harassment Grievance Officer. The complainant should have as much of the
following information as possible:

a. The name, department and position of the person or person allegedly causing the
harassment;
b. A description of the incident(s), including the date(s), location(s) and the presence
of any witnesses;
c. The alleged effect of the incident(s) on the complainant’s position, salary,
benefits, promotional opportunities, job performance, job satisfaction or other
terms or conditions of employment;
