ORDER OF SUSPENSION
OF TRADING

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that the public interest and the
protection of investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of Pineapple Express, Inc.
(CIK No. 1654672) because of recent, unusual and unexplained market activity in the company’s
stock that raises concerns about the adequacy of publicly-available information regarding the
company. Pineapple Express, Inc. is a Wyoming corporation with its principal place of business
listed as Los Angeles, California, with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously “Pink Sheets”)
operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the ticker symbol PNPL.
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors
require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT, on April 28, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT, on May 11, 2016.
By the Commission.
