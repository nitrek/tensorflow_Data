Chair
Securities and Exchange Commission
Re: “Disclosure Update and Simplification,” Proposed Rule
File No. S7-15-16
RIN 3235-AL82

Dear Chair,
We oppose the proposed rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC,
Commission, or Agency) titled “Disclosure Update and Simplification.” This enormously
complex tangle of jolting alterations that is speeding through the Agency poses serious
dangers. The Commission must withdraw this proposal and approach disclosure from the
vantage point of what best serves investors.
Disclosure forms the foundation of market integrity, of how investors decide how to allocate
their savings, and how the SEC can detect misconduct.1 Changes to this foundation threaten
the entire market. Changes cannot be made without extreme care.
Yet the SEC proposes a major devaluation of this disclosure framework and couches its
proposal in the comforting phrase “disclosure simplification.” On its face, the rulemaking
may appear to be a series of innocuous changes. In fact, these proposals portend vast and
dangerous consequences for investors and the market generally.
The recent revelations that Wells Fargo signed up customers for accounts without their
consent serves as an obvious object lesson about the need for more, not less disclosure, and
for better enforcement of existing disclosure rules. According to the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Los
Angeles (LA) City Attorney, Wells Fargo engaged in fraudulent cross-selling practices that
were described respectively as “improper, ”2 “unsafe or unsound,”3 and “an ambitious and

strictly enforced sales quota system” in which “those failing to meet sales quotas are
approached by management, and often reprimanded and/or told to ‘do whatever it takes’ to
meet their individual sales quotas.”4 By Wells Fargo’s own analysis, as noted in the CFPB
consent order, “employees opened 1,534,280 deposit accounts that may not have been
authorized and that may have been funded through simulated funding, or transferring funds
from consumers’ existing accounts without their knowledge or consent.” Employees also
“submitted applications for 565,443 credit-card accounts that may not have been authorized
by using consumers’ information without their knowledge or consent.” 5 The CFPB’s consent
order covers January 1, 2011, to present. Public Citizen analyzed Wells Fargo’s annual
disclosure on cross sells and found that this figure rose even more markedly from 1998 to
2011 than from 2011 to present. Anecdotal reports suggest that the company was using
fraudulent methods prior to 2011 to boost its cross-sell numbers. Former Wells Fargo
Branch Manager Susan Fischer recently told CNN: “These practices were going on way
before 2011.”6 According to CNN, “Fischer said she remembers her district manager
instructing her in 2007 to make the employees reporting to her open unauthorized accounts.”7
We attach our report.
As Wells Fargo reported steadily rising figures, here are simply a few of the inconvenient
items that are obviously material to how an investor values this stock that the SEC failed to
ensure that Wells Fargo disclose.

In 2009, Wells Fargo executives recognized that certain ambitious sales programs –
such as “Jump into January” – were leading to the creation of fraudulent accounts.
This was not disclosed.8
In February 2011, Chairman and CEO John Stumpf reportedly received an email
from a 22-year veteran of the company explaining how the appearance of growth in
new accounts could be faked; this employee was subsequently terminated. This was
never disclosed.9
In 2011, employee satisfaction surveys reportedly found that bank employees were
uncomfortable with instructions from management to push customers to buy
products. 10 This was not disclosed.

In 2012, the community banking unit began to investigate suspicious practices in
areas with high levels of customer complaints, such as Southern California. These
investigations reportedly led to the firing of 200 employees in February 2013.11 This
was not disclosed.
In 2013, 2014, the board and management took action in response to these signals and
at the request of regulators— including increasing risk management standards in the
community banking divisions, modifying some sales goals, and conducting an
internal investigation by Accenture and Skadden, Arps on which the board was
reportedly updated. This was not disclosed.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau began its investigation in 2013. This was
not disclosed.
Wells Fargo employees delivered petitions with more than 10,000 signatures to the
board at both the 2014 and 2015 annual meetings that urged the board to recognize
the link between Wells Fargo’s high-pressure sales quotas and the fraudulent opening
of accounts without customer permission. These petitions called on Wells Fargo to
cease using these high-pressure quotas. This was not disclosed.
The New York Times reports that even after the company began to recognize the
problem and provide ethics training that warned against creating false accounts, the
continued sales pressure from management overwhelmed the ethical training. When
employees either refused to sell customers products they did not want, or reported
fraudulent account creation to the Wells Fargo ethics line, they were subject to
discipline including termination. This was not disclosed.

We believe a proposal by the SEC to relax disclosure requirements across a broad swath of
operating areas is unacceptable when faced with the obvious need, as highlighted by Wells
Fargo, to move in the opposite direction and tighten disclosure requirements as corporations
seek to skirt them.
Unsound basis
The Agency’s proposed rulemaking rests on two false premises.
The first is that investors are burdened with too much information from the companies in
which they invest. The Agency explains that their objective is to “streamline disclosures for
investors.”12 We are unaware of this burden, or of any demand, serious or otherwise,
expressed in the investment community for less disclosure. On the contrary, investors
consistently ask for more information. One clear example is political spending, as evidenced
by a petition calling for this transparency with more than 1.2 million investor and public
comments. Investors are not “buried,” by too much disclosure. Analysts, Bloomberg
technology, and journalists, have long found needles in haystacks; search engines have now

revolutionized analysis of data.13 Moreover, to the extent that some documents appear large,
many of these disclosures are volunteered by issuers. For example, the JP Morgan annual
report for 2015 (issued in the spring of 2016) spans 320 pagers. JPMorgan might have spared
readers the first 64 pages altogether, which are a celebration of the company’s fine
achievements. These 64 pages are almost identical to the introduction in the previous annual
reports. Of these 64 pages, 50 consist of a letter from CEO and Chairman James Dimon. A
standard chair’s report is 1 or 2 pages. And these 50 pages are almost identical each year. By
contrast, there is almost no discussion of the company’s swaps book, the mismanagement of
which during the London Whale episode sent the stock price down nearly 30 percent. 14
In fact, disclosure discrepancy forms the core for crashes:
 The crash in 1929 followed revolutions of watered stock and hidden debt. For
example, First National Citibank (progenitor of today’s Citigroup) sold as equity a
stake in Cuban sugar plantations that were actually non-performing loans
 In the S&L crisis, senior managers cooked their disclosures. Texas thrifts concocted a
daisy chain, temporarily parking bad assets at the lasted thrift the federal supervisor
inspected until the supervisor came and finished their inspection.
 The Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Healthsouth, Parmalot, etc. scandals at the turn of the
millennium all built on non-disclosure. For example, Enron created special
investment entities it claimed it did not control because they had outside investors,
although the outside investor turned out to be insider Andrew Fastow. 15
 The crash of 08 depended on moving liabilities out of view, “off balance sheet,” to
use industry’s misdirecting euphemism. Chief among these liabilities were mortgage
securitizations. However, these securitizations contained clauses requiring the bank to
repurchase them should a certain volume of underlying mortgages fail, which they
did. Had these liabilities been disclosed, that is, had they be on the balance sheet,
investors might have slowed the mortgage securitization frenzy. 16

In the absence of true investor demand, the SEC is paradoxically jumping this initiative to the
head of a queue that remains log-jammed with dormant, vital, mandated requirements from
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. After soliciting
comments to broad disclosure questions in their S-K concept release just months ago as a
part of the agency’s “disclosure effectiveness review” process, it seems unlikely that SEC
could have digested the many thoughtful responses it received before it published this
proposal to change disclosure rules. In fact, the “Disclosure Update and Simplification”

13

One wonders if this new search technology and analytics is what has prompted industry to seek less
disclosure, since burying investors in unnecessary information doesn’t hide the bad stuff as readily.

proposal that we presently review came out before the S-K comment deadline, making it
certain that a set of the comments were not reviewed prior to its release.17
The second false premise is the idea that materiality (the standard upon which corporations
base their disclosure decisions) is overbroad and should be narrowed to only “financial
materiality.”
Materiality applies to the notes in financial statements, namely, the description by
management of specific items that are part of the aggregate quantifications in the financial
statements, either the income statement or balance sheet. (For example, certain revenue and
expense results at a fast food chain may be different than expected, and management may
explain that restaurants in a region of the country suffered food poisoning from bad
chicken.18)
Currently, as described by the Financial Accountings Standards Board (FASB), materiality
means information that “could” influence investor decisions. 19 FASB now proposes to
change the definition of materiality from what “could” influence an investor, to what
“would” influence the investor.2021 FASB further proposes to declare that materiality is a
legal concept.22 This makes a firm’s legal officer the pivotal arbiter of the issue. Currently,
an independent auditor might take a contest over whether an item should be discussed in the
notes to the firm’s board audit committee. With this dynamic in force, the company’s
financial officer might tend to accept the auditor’s recommendation instead of facing board
arbitration. Under the new FASB rubric, a dispute between the auditor and in-house finance

available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/concept/2016/33-10064.pdf ;
18
One imagines that the accounting industry might have developed a manual that establishes numerical metrics.
The question of materiality is undoubtedly informed by the hundreds of independent auditor hours expended
each year at many thousands of public companies, a ritual that has taken place for many decades. Further, the
stock market provides a minute-by-minute evaluation of information that changes stock prices. Given this one
might hope that a concept so basic as materiality would enjoy a more muscular description than what seems
little beyond a tautology, namely, that which could change an investor’s view.
19

The SEC was created to buffer investors from the unscrupulous huckster in the private sector; so trusting the
private sector to set standards (via FASB) could mean that hucksters have taken over or at least are influencing
that standard setting process. P. 51611

These venues include the law, facts, and markets, which can be influence by emotion. Information contained
in print may have a different impact than video. For example, it may be immaterial that a CEO is arrested for
DUI. However, if this arrest is captured on video, this may lead to a different impression of the same
information. See discussion, available at: http://www.theconglomerate.org/2010/10/is-your-ceo-being-arrestedfor-dwidui-material.html. In another case, a CEO was caught on a surveillance camera abusing his dog. This
became public, and the company was forced to issue a statement condemning its CEO. See San Diego Union,

official will be settled by the in-house counsel. With this dynamic, the company’s auditor is
less likely to contest the omission of what she might consider material information. In short,
the FASB proposal will result in less information.
This forthcoming definition of materiality should be stopped in its tracks. A number of
investor organizations have called on FASB to stop this effort. The SEC’s own Investor
Advisory Committee similarly warned against debasing the definition of materiality. 23
Regrettably, the SEC seems to be moving in the same direction as FASB. Many of the
changes proposed in the “disclosure simplification” that the agency is seeking comment on
here would do away with SEC rules in favor of US GAAP, or generally accepted accounting
principles disclosures, and would narrow the definition of materiality to that which is
financially relevant. This could frustrate the investor demand for new information in many
areas such as political spending disclosure. Corporate political expenditures may not be
massive in aggregate amounts, but they are still risky because they involve politics and could
embroil the company in reputational issues and ultimately hurt the bottom line.
On top of these two false premises nests a warren of indecipherable statutory, accounting,
and legal terms masking some decidedly dangerous changes. SEC Commissioner Kara Stein
emphasized this inscrutability:24
Despite its 500 plus page length, this proposal may be framed in such a hyper-technical way
that it fails to provide a bonafide opportunity for a wide variety of commenters to truly access
and understand what is being proposed and what we are seeking comment on. Any
rulemaking release on a technical subject matter can and should, be made accessible to all of
the stakeholders who will be impacted if the proposal is adopted. Unfortunately, the release
before the Commission today may exclude commenters from the dialogue and limit access to
our rulemaking process to specialized experts. For example, how can non-experts compare
distinctions between Rule 4-08(m)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-X and Accounting Standards
Codification 860-30-50-7 without more information? How are investors to weigh in if they
can’t make heads or tails of the subject matter?

Only an attorney schooled in economics, business history, and accounting, and blessed with
an encyclopedic understanding of SEC statutes, experience with the history of GAAP, IFRS
and other standard setting wars, and afforded significant time for reading, study, review and
consultation, could possibly proffer a thorough, definitive comment. And yet, the perils of

24
Stein’s continues: “How are investors to weigh in if they can’t make heads or tails of the subject matter? I
requested the release provide greater clarity and context for these topics and others. This was not adequately
done. It is bitterly ironic that a release on disclosure effectiveness fails to present information in a clear, concise,
and understandable way to the public. How can we require issuers to provide information in plain English, yet
fail to meet this standard ourselves? Moreover, how are we to fulfill our mission of investor protection if we
effectively exclude commenters from engaging on rulemakings that will impact the disclosure they receive?
How are we to be the investor’s advocate, if we do not provide investors with bonafide opportunities to engage?
See: https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/stein-statement-open-meeting-071316-disclosure-update.html

not commenting on this rule could lead to a disastrous narrowing of the key standard upon
which many investors seek increased disclosures.
Selected Specific Problems
We highlight only a few of the specific dangers beyond our general concerns regarding
narrowing disclosure and the definition of materiality:
1. Repurchase agreements.
The Agency proposes to delete Rule 4-08(m)(1)(ii). (The Agency does not explain what this
rule does in the preamble, simply the reasons it proposes to delete it.)25 This rule requires that
firms that borrow money through the repurchase agreement (repo) market should declare the
details of these liabilities if they exceed 10 percent of the assets of the firm. This 10%
dependence level is important both to investors in the borrowing firm, and to counterparties
as they make credit decisions. The financial crisis demonstrated that firms such as Lehman
had grown addicted to repo, and had manipulated tax and other rules to enable its
dependency. In fact, repo disclosure should be enhanced, not deleted.26 The Agency makes
no reference to these issues; instead, the basic reason that the SEC proposes to eliminate this
requirement is that U.S. GAAP provides for similar or overlapping reporting. Similar,
overlapping standards are not the same standards, just as two photographs of a building from
different angles or distances may be similar or overlapping, but are not the same. A
photograph from 50 feet is similar but not the same as one from 500 feet.
GAAP, or generally accepted accounting principles, it must be noted, are not generally
25

26

Here is the rule:
(A) If, as of the most recent balance sheet date, the carrying amount (or market value, if higher than
the carrying amount) of securities or other assets sold under repurchase agreements, other than
securities or assets specified in paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, exceeds 10% of total assets,
disclose in an appropriately captioned footnote containing a tabular presentation, segregated as to type
of such securities or assets sold under agreements to repurchase (e.g., U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S.
Government agency obligations and loans), the following information as of the balance sheet date for
each such agreement or group of agreements (other than agreements involving securities or assets
specified in paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(B) of this section) maturing (1) overnight; (2) term up to 30 days; (3)
term of 30 to 90 days; (4) term over 90 days and (5) demand:
(i) The carrying amount and market value of the assets sold under agreement to repurchase, including
accrued interest plus any cash or other assets on deposit under the repurchase agreements; and
(ii) The repurchase liability associated with such transaction or group of transactions and the interest
rate(s) thereon.
(B) For purposes of paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(A) of this section only, do not include securities or other
assets for which unrealized changes in market value are reported in current income or which have been
obtained under reverse repurchase agreements.

See, e.g., Steven Smalt and J. Marshall Mc Comb II, An Examination of Repurchase Agreements, Journal of
Finance and Accountancy, Volume 19, March 2015 available at http://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/152156.pdf
(outlining the accounting loophole that Lehman Brothers took advantage of in effecting its infamous “Repo
105” transactions. These accounting manoeuvers allowed Lehman Brothers to temporarily remove billions of
dollars of assets from its balance sheet, thereby hiding the true extent of its leverage.)

accepted. Nor is the publication freely available. One edition spans 7,692 pages across four
volumes.27 U.S. GAAP differs from accounting standards in other countries (an acute
problem given that many public companies operate in multiple nations). And it can change,
regardless of what the SEC does. As with many other proposals, the Agency is ceding its
responsibility to safeguard disclosure to private sector organizations, in this case GAAP and
FASB. The SEC should instead oblige its mandate.
2. Pro forma business combination
The agency proposes28 to delete pro forma (forward looking, with results combined for as yet
separately operating units) financial information in interim filings for business combinations,
as provided in Rule 8-03(b)(4). Annually, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett lectures
on the accounting manipulations of those who merge companies, where promises are
highlighted and problems not disclosed.29 More than half of all mergers fail.30 If financial
reporting were accurate and frequent, accountants would be better positioned to recognize
problems as they occur, and ideally, advise merger-inclined executives that the marriage
may not be such a good idea; delayed reporting can allow hope to replace harsh, immediate
reality. Requiring pro forma projections on an interim basis results in some discipline;
eliminating this will permit even more whitewashing.
3. Executive compensation
The Agency proposes31 to delete its requirement that executive compensation be
disaggregated. Disaggregation allows investors to see what in the pay package is cash, stock,
options, etc. The reason for the deletion is that the Agency notes that the major stock
exchanges require such disaggregation as a listing requirement. As with GAAP, the agencies
can change their listing standards. Wells Fargo faces scrutiny now because it failed to
identify that bonus figures were tied to cross selling quotas that, in turn, proved illusory. Had
it been clear to investors that the millions in bonuses for Named Executive Officers stemmed
from line salespeople (paid $25,000 a year) to open eight accounts for each customer,32 or be
fired, or cheat and try not to get caught, then this runaway fraud might have lasted two years,
instead of a possible two decades.33 As with the other changes we mentioned, this is

presented as a modest change—but the consequences for information provided could be
costly. Already, CEO pay is high and the metrics by which it is judged are opaque.
Obscuring the information makes matters worse.
4. Bright Lines
The Commission proposes eliminating various bright line disclosure rules. In addition
to the repo changed noted above, the Commission would eliminate disclosure of material
restrictions on dividends, and the names of major customers. If Walmart is the major
customer of a supplier, that’s crucial to investors in that supplier. Among other problems,
eliminating bright line rules will disable investor ability to compare companies who may
decide differently as to whether and how information must be disclosed.

Economic Analysis
Following the Agency’s breathtaking list of major changes comes what is labelled
“Economic Analysis.” We believe this term is generous, since this analysis is devoid of any
hint of enumerated dollar costs or benefits. The economic analysis turns on the argument
“We believe…,” which is a shallow basis for what conventionally purports to be something
based on numbers. Better would be: “Measurable results demonstrate that …” The analysis is
also devoid of the phrase “impact on investors, ” or any dollar amount of what missing
information will cost the company’s owners, or, for that matter, the benefit of not reading
information because it’s newly deleted.
What is the economic impact of reduced disclosure? As noted above, 1.2 million investors
have petitioned the Agency because of incomplete disclosure on political spending. Firms
disclose lobby expenses, and contributions from political action committees, but they also
contribute vicariously, through opaque middle-man organizations such as the Chamber of
Commerce, or even think tanks. Public Citizen sponsors Chamber Watch, which documents
the wide ranging lobby efforts on behalf of large businesses. This lobbying by the Chamber
is not pro bono; it is paid for and one can make an educated, cynical guess where the money
comes from by the nature of the policy.34 The very fact that this money is dark suggests that
companies understand that if their shareholders found out, some of them might be unhappy
and may revalue the stock by selling it.

Conclusion

34

The Chamber’s congressional testimony invariably begins with a paean to small business, then sets out
promoting a policy of exclusive interest to large business.

If the Agency is truly interested in addressing disclosure, it should begin with a series of
national listening sessions with investors to collect suggestions. It should also read the
comments to the S-K release, which almost universally demand more disclosure. It may then
relay the suggestions and comments to issuers (selected as those recognized by investors for
good governance) to examine what they can and cannot do to accommodate investor
interests.
Meanwhile, this proposal should be withdrawn.

Introduction
“Cross-sell is the result of serving our customers extraordinarily well, understanding their
financial needs and goals over their lifetimes, and ensuring we innovate our products, services,
and channels so that we earn more of their business and help them succeed financially.”
-John G. Stumpf, Chairman and CEO, Wells Fargo, The Vision & Values of Wells Fargo35
Cross-selling amounts to selling a new product to an existing customer. For example, if a customer
only has a savings account with Wells Fargo, an employee may try to “cross-sell” that customer a
checking, credit card, or other type of account.
According to Wells Fargo’s Chairman and CEO, John G. Stumpf, cross-selling “is the result of serving
our customers extraordinarily well, understanding their financial needs and goals over their
lifetimes, and ensuring we innovate our products, services, and channels so that we earn more of
their business and help them succeed financially.”36
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC), and the Los Angeles (LA) City Attorney found the exact opposite – fining Wells Fargo $185
million for engaging in fraudulent cross-selling practices. The CFPB described these as “Improper
Sales Practices;”37 the OCC described these as “unsafe or unsound practices in the Bank’s risk
management and oversight of the Bank’s sales practices;”38 and the Los Angeles City Attorney wrote
in its complaint that Wells Fargo imposed “an ambitious and strictly enforced sales quota system”
in which “those failing to meet sales quotas are approached by management, and often
reprimanded and/or told to ‘do whatever it takes’ to meet their individual sales quotas.” The Los
Angeles City Attorney also wrote: “Managers constantly hound, berate, demean and threaten
employees to meet these unreachable quotas.”39
By Wells Fargo’s own analysis, as noted in the CFPB consent order, “employees opened 1,534,280
deposit accounts that may not have been authorized and that may have been funded through
simulated funding, or transferring funds from consumers’ existing accounts without their
knowledge or consent.” Employees also “submitted applications for 565,443 credit-card accounts

The CFPB’s consent order covers January 1, 2011, to present. As this report shows, Wells Fargo’s
proliferation in accounts per customer rose even more markedly from 1998 to 2011 than from
2011 to present. Anecdotal reports suggest that the company was using fraudulent methods prior
to 2011 to boost its cross-sell numbers. When asked for comment, the CFPB told Public Citizen “our
investigation found that the great majority of unlawful activity occurred from January 1, 2011, to
present.”41 Still, the question remains: How much fraud did Wells Fargo commit prior to the time
period for which it was fined by the CFPB earlier this month?
The OCC has ordered Wells Fargo to conduct a review of its sales practices and report the results to
the government. When asked for comment, the OCC stated the “order does not specify a timeframe
for the enterprise-wide risk review of sales practices required by article IV of our order against
Wells Fargo nor does the order specify a specific time period for reimbursements.”42 This indicates
that the OCC’s ordered review is not limited to January 1, 2011, to present.

Wells Fargo’s Emphasis on Cross-Selling Began at Least as Early as 1998
Public Citizen reviewed Wells Fargo’s annual reports dating back to 1998 and found that the desire
to sell more products, specifically eight products per household, has a long history at the bank.43
According to The Wall Street Journal, former Norwest Corp. CEO Richard Kovacevish introduced the
concept of “cross-selling” to that bank in the late 1980s. Norwest Corp. would merge with Wells
Fargo & Co. in 1998.44
In 1999, according to its annual report, Wells Fargo was: “Going for gr-eight product packages,”45
establishing the long-held, and now infamous, goal of eight products per household.

In 2000, after reporting a 3.7 cross-sell ratio, Wells Fargo stated: “We’re headed in the right
direction but not fast enough. If we sell one new product to every customer every year we can get to
eight products per banking household in about five years.”47
In 2010, Wells said: “If anyone tells you it’s easy to earn more business from current customers in
financial services, don’t believe them. We should know. We’ve been at it almost a quarter century.
We’ve been called, true or not, the “king of crossSource: Wells Fargo Annual Report, 2003
sell.”48
It does not appear that Wells’ race for eight was always on the up and up, however.
Former Wells Fargo Branch Manager Susan Fischer recently told CNN: “These practices were going
on way before 2011.”49 According to CNN, “Fischer said she remembers her district manager
instructing her in 2007 to make the employees reporting to her open unauthorized accounts.”50

18 Years of Cross-Sell Numbers Based on Wells Fargo Annual Reports
In 1998, Wells Fargo’s retail banking cross-sell ratio was 3.2 products per household.51 For the next
10 years, Wells Fargo increased the ratio each year.52 The streak ended in 2010 when the ratio
dropped to 5.7 from 5.95.53 This drop occurred because that year, Wells combined its cross-sell
ratio with that of the recently acquired Wachovia Bank, which had a substantially lower cross-sell
ratio. [See Figure 2]

*The y-axis does not begin at 0 in order to clearly show changes. The earliest cross-sell number reported by Wells Fargo
was 3.2 in 1998. Cross-sell increases or decreases are typically noticeable by changes in the first or second decimal place.
Even small increases are significant, as Wells Fargo points out many times in its annual reports. [See Appendix]

Wells Fargo touted its cross-sell numbers throughout the past 18 years. In its 2004 annual report,
for instance, Wells Fargo declared “Cross-selling: our most important customer-related measure.”55
In its 2011 annual report, Wells Fargo reported an eye-popping cross-sell ratio in its “top region” of
7.38 products56 – very close to the long-held goal of eight per household.
In the 2012 through 2015 annual reports, Wells began to describe its cross-sell numbers slightly
differently, comparing quarterly and November numbers to previous quarters and Novembers.57

Conclusion
Wells Fargo has told the media that it is reviewing its cross-selling practices to as early as 2009.58
But the question remains, why not look back even further? Wells Fargo was aggressively pushing
cross-selling a decade prior to 2009.
As early as 2000, after Wells Fargo had increased its cross-sell ratio to 3.7, Wells Fargo pointed out:
“We’re headed in the right direction but not fast enough. If we sell one new product to every
customer every year we can get to eight products per banking household in about five years.” 59
Wells Fargo did not meet that five year goal. A former Wells Fargo branch manager, “remembers
her district manager instructing her in 2007 to make the employees reporting to her open
unauthorized accounts.”60
According to the Los Angeles City Attorney, the pressure was immense, alleging in its complaint
Wells Fargo “strictly enforced” its sales quotas. “Daily sales for each branch, and each sales
employee, are reported and discussed by Well Fargo’s District Managers four times a day, at 11:00
a.m., 1:00 p.m., 3:00 p.m., and 5:00 p.m., alleged the Los Angeles City Attorney.”61
According to a recent survey by consulting firm A.T. Kearney, “On average, bank customers had 2.71
products at their primary bank.”62 If the 2.71 report is correct, that would indicate that Wells Fargo
has had higher cross-sell numbers than the present day average since at least 1998. Recently, Wells
Fargo reported a “retail banking cross-sell of 6.27 products per household.” 63
Wells Fargo never reached its goal of eight products per household. But even if it had, there is
evidence that the goal post would have been moved: “Even when we get to eight, we’re only
halfway home. The average banking household has about 16. I’m often asked why we set a crosssell goal of eight. The answer is, it rhymed with ‘great.’ Perhaps our new cheer should be: ‘Let’s go
again, for ten!’”64
Well Fargo’s management’s never-ending quest for higher cross-sell numbers and the pressurecooker atmosphere it created produced fertile ground for fraudulent activities. When the rampant
fraud first began remains to be seen. But Wells Fargo’s cross-sell data indicates the decade
preceding the beginning of the CFPB settlement in 2011 requires further scrutiny.

“When Norwest and Wells Fargo merged in November 1998 our combined cross-sell was about 3.3
products per retail banking household. At year-end 2000, it was about 3.7. To get to our goal of eight

new product to every customer every year we can get to eight products per banking household
in about five years.”

“We now sell an average of 3.8 products to every banking household compared with 3.3 when Norwest
