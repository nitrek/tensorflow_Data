In the Matter of
ORDER POSTPONING HEARING
BLUFOREST, INC.

On September 20, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondents pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. A hearing is scheduled for October 11, 2016.
On September 30, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a motion to postpone the
hearing, requesting that a prehearing conference be scheduled as an alternative. The motion
states that confirmation of delivery of the OIP to Respondent—located in Ecuador—has not yet
been received.
I ORDER the Division to file a declaration of service by October 26, 2016, regarding
whether Respondent has been served with the OIP in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2).
I FURTHER ORDER that the October 11, 2016, hearing is POSTPONED. A telephonic
prehearing conference will be held on a date to be determined in a later order, unless the
proceeding is resolved before such order issues.
