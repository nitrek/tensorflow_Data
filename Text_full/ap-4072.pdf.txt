ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE

SAND INTERNATIONAL, INC.
13 Stusa Street, Lvov Region
Zvirka, Ukraine, 8000

On July 27, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act of 1933. Respondent Sand
International, Inc., was served with the OIP on August 1, 2016, and has not, as of the date of this
order, filed an answer. The Registration Statement of Sand Int’l, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 4050, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2719 (ALJ Aug. 8, 2016); OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.
The Division of Enforcement filed a motion for default on August 12, 2016. Sand did not
participate in the hearing on August 16, 2016, at which the Division described exhibits A-H,
attached to the motion, which support the allegations set out in the OIP. Sand has not made any
filings in this proceeding.
Sand is in default. Out of deference to the Commission’s directives,1 however, I ORDER
Sand to SHOW CAUSE by September 9, 2016, why a stop order suspending the effectiveness of its
registration statement should not be issued by default for its failure to timely file an answer, appear
at the hearing, or otherwise defend this proceeding. A failure to respond to the motion for default
and this order will be additional support for issuance of a stop order. 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(1)(2), .220(f), .310; OIP at 2.

*9 (Aug. 26, 2015) (“[W]e generally consider it a prudent practice for a law judge who is
considering the issuance of a default order against a respondent to first order that respondent show
cause why a default is not warranted. . . . We reiterate our encouragement of such practice, which
we believe furthers fairness in our administrative proceedings and efficiency by facilitating
resolution of default-related issues at the hearing level, when they can be most expeditiously
addressed.” (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted)).
