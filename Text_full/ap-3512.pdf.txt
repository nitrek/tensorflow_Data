In the Matter of
ORDER SEALING EXHIBITS
GEORGE BUSSANICH, JR.
On August 10, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission instituted proceedings
against Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
On December 2, 2015, the Division of Enforcement filed its motion for sanctions,
attaching sixteen exhibits. Exhibits 4, 8-9, and 15-16 contain personally identifiable information,
including, but not necessarily limited to, full social security numbers, full home addresses, full
birthdates, and driver’s license numbers. The harm resulting from the disclosure of this
information outweighs the benefits. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.322(b). I therefore SEAL Division
exhibits 4, 8, 9, 15, and 16, and ORDER the Division to file, by January 29, redacted versions of
these exhibits with all personally identifiable information removed.1 The unredacted versions of
these exhibits may be disclosed only to the parties to this proceeding, legal counsel, and any trial
teams, including experts and contractors; the undersigned; the Commission, and its employees,
staff, and agents.
SO ORDERED.
