Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s

Division of Enforcement has submitted to the Commission a proposed plan for the distribution of

On September 13, 2004, the Commission issued an Order instituting administrative and ceaseand-desist proceedings against PA Fund Management LLC, PEA Capital LLC, and PA
Distributors LLC (“Respondents”) in this matter (the “Order”). Pursuant to the Order, a Fair
Fund was established, comprised of disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties paid by the
Respondents, for distribution to investors harmed by market timing in certain mutual funds
formerly offered by the PIMCO Equity Funds: Multi-Manager Series (the “Equity Funds” or
“Funds’).
OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMENT
Pursuant to this Notice, all interested parties are advised that they may print a copy of the
proposed Distribution Plan from the Commission’s public website, http://www.sec.gov.
Interested parties may also obtain a written copy of the proposed Distribution Plan by submitting
a written request to Lorraine B. Echavarria, Assistant Regional Director, United States Securities
and Exchange Commission, 5670 Wilshire Blvd., 11th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90036. All
persons who desire to comment on the Distribution Plan may submit their comments, in writing,
no later than thirty (30) days from the date of this Notice:

1. by sending a letter to the Office of the Secretary, United States Securities and
Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549-1090;

DISTRIBUTION PLAN
The Fair Fund is comprised of $48,383,262 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties
paid by the Respondents, plus accumulated interest, less any federal, state, or local taxes on the
interest. The Distribution Plan, if approved, proposes the distribution of the monies based on
shareholders’ losses, defined as shareholder dilution and transactions costs, caused by market
timing in the Equity Funds from February 2002 to April 2003. Harmed shareholders will receive
their losses suffered and their proportionate share of advisory fees paid by the funds that suffered
losses and their proportionate share of interest earned on the Fair Fund. Upon termination of the
Fair Fund, any monies that remain in the Fair Fund will be transferred to the Commission for
remittance to the U.S. Treasury.
By the Commission.

Secretary
