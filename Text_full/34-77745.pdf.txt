which a registered investment adviser has custody (the “Examinations”) pursuant to Section
206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder (the “Custody Rule”).4 In particular,
Respondents engaged in improper professional conduct under Section 4C of the Exchange Act
and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) and (iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice when completing their

disciplinary or regulatory proceedings.
Other Relevant Entities
3.
SFX Financial Advisory Management Enterprises, Inc. (“SFX”) is a Delaware
corporation organized on March 25, 1992, and headquartered in Washington, D.C. SFX became
registered with the Commission as an investment adviser on September 21, 1992, but withdrew
its registration on September 12, 2012 due to its failure to maintain eligibility for registration
based on the amount of assets under management. SFX is currently registered in the District of
Columbia. Live Nation Worldwide, Inc., which is owned by Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.
(“Live Nation”) (NYSE: LYV), wholly-owns SFX. SFX assesses its clients fixed fees and fees
based on assets under management. In its most-recent Form ADV filing in March 2015, SFX
disclosed that it managed $14 million on a discretionary basis. On June 15, 2015, the
Commission issued an order finding (among other things) that SFX willfully violated Sections
206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rules 206(4)-2 and 206(4)-7 thereunder, and failed to
supervise Brian J. Ourand within the meaning of Section 203(e)(6) of the Advisers Act. See SFX
Financial Advisory Enterprises, Inc., et al., Advisers Act Rel. No. 4116 (June 15, 2015).
4.
Brian J. Ourand (“Ourand”), age 53, is a resident of Chicago, Illinois. In 1986,
Ourand began working at Professional Services Inc., which SFX acquired in 1999. From June
2003 to March 2007, Ourand served as SFX’s Vice President. Ourand served as SFX’s
President from March 2007 through August 2011. In August 2011, SFX terminated Ourand for
misappropriating client funds. On June 15, 2015, the Commission instituted an administrative
and cease-and-desist proceeding against Ourand alleging violations of Sections 206(1) and
206(2) of the Advisers Act. See Brian J. Ourand, Advisers Act Rel. No. 4115 (June 15, 2015).
Background
5.
SFX specializes in providing advisory and financial management services to high
net-worth individuals. Clients entered into agreements with SFX to receive, among other
services, investment advisory and bill-paying services. SFX had the power to withdraw from
and deposit client assets to both bank and brokerage accounts as part of its bill paying authority.

3

Consequently, SFX had custody over client assets.5 In particular, at least two individuals at SFX
had the authority to withdraw money from client accounts, including Ourand. Ourand was also
identified in SFX’s Form ADV as a control person.
6.
In 2004, SFX first engaged SPC to perform Examinations. SPC continued to
conduct those Examinations until SFX withdrew its Commission registration in 2012.
7.
From 2006 through 2011, Ourand misappropriated funds from client accounts.
During this time, Ourand wrote unauthorized checks from client bank accounts payable to “cash”
or himself, and wired unauthorized amounts to himself for his own personal use. He also wired
money using client credit cards for unauthorized amounts to others for their personal use.
8.
In October 2011, SFX informed Scolaro that Ourand had been terminated for
misappropriating client funds and that SFX had reimbursed the affected clients.
SPC’s Engagement and Examination Reports
9.
From 2010 to 2011, SPC completed three reports for SFX, which were filed with
the Commission on Forms ADV-E. In connection with its 2010 Examination, SPC completed
two reports filed on Forms ADV-E: on November 22, 2010, SPC filed a Form ADV-E with the
results of its 2010 Examination (the “2010 Report”), and on March 1, 2011, SPC filed a revised
report (the “2010 Revised Report”). In connection with its 2011 Examination, SPC completed a
report filed with the Commission on Form ADV-E on February 8, 2012 (the “2011 Report”).
10.
In the 2010 Report, SPC stated that it had “examined . . . management’s assertion
. . . that SFX . . . complied with certain provisions of rules 204-2(b) and 206(4)-2 of the
Investment Advisers Act . . .” SPC further stated that “Our examination was conducted in
accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants . . .” and then enumerated various tests SPC purportedly performed. SPC also
stated that “We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion . . . In
our opinion . . . Management’s assertion that SFX . . . complied with the requirements of
subparagraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4) of Rule 206(4)-2(a) . . . is fairly stated in all material
respects.” The 2010 Revised Report and 2011 Report contained similar language. Scolaro
signed each report on SPC’s behalf.
11.
Two of SPC’s reports regarding its Examinations of SFX contained untrue
statements of material facts. First, the 2010 Revised Report represented that SPC had confirmed
with SFX’s clients contributions to and withdrawals from client accounts, when it had not. The
2010 Revised Report also falsely stated that all of the testing procedures were performed for the
period ended November 11, 2010, when they were actually performed for the period ended July
31, 2010 (over three months earlier). Second, the 2011 Report included SPC’s unqualified
opinion that management’s assertion that SFX complied with the requirements of Advisers Act
Rule 206(4)-2(a)(1) as of May 31, 2011, relating to a qualified custodian maintaining client
funds and securities, was fairly stated, in all material respects. Before filing the 2011 Report,
5

Under Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-2(d)(2)(ii), an adviser has custody if it has the authority to withdraw client
assets maintained with a qualified custodian upon the adviser’s instruction to the custodian.

4

however, SPC and Scolaro knew that Ourand had misappropriated client funds. In light of the
misappropriation, all client funds were not maintained with a qualified custodian as of May 31,
2011.
SPC and Scolaro Engaged in Improper Professional Conduct in Performing the
Examinations of the Adviser
12.
Scolaro’s conduct in performing SFX’s 2010 through 2011 Examinations violated
the professional standards for certified public accountants set forth in American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants’ (“AICPA”) standards for attest engagements (AT § 101) and
compliance attestation (AT § 601).
Failure to Exercise Due Professional Care and Professional Skepticism
13.
AT § 101.39 provides that “[t]he fifth general standard is – The practitioner must
exercise due professional care in the planning and performance of the engagement and the
preparation of the report.” AT § 101.40 provides that “Due professional care imposes a
responsibility on each practitioner involved with the engagement to observe each of the
attestation standards.” AT § 601.38 provides that “[t]he practitioner should exercise (a) due care
in planning, performing, and evaluating the results of his or her examination procedures and (b)
the proper degree of professional skepticism to achieve reasonable assurance that material
noncompliance will be detected.” As a result of the failures described herein, for the 2010 and
2011 Examinations, Scolaro did not exercise due professional care or the proper degree of
professional skepticism in the planning and performance of the engagements.
14.
In planning the 2010 and 2011 Examinations, Scolaro did not adequately consider
fraud risk factors related to fraudulent reporting or misappropriation of assets, including (a)
deficiencies in the system of internal controls over compliance, (b) ineffective monitoring of
management as a result of domination of management by a small group without compensating
controls, and (c) significant unusual related party transactions. See AT § 601.33 (requiring the
consideration of factors similar to those in audit standard AU § 316.85 Consideration of Fraud in
a Financial Statement Audit). Scolaro failed to identify any specific attestation risks regarding
SFX’s compliance with the Custody Rule. There were, however, significant risks that Scolaro
should have identified. For example, at least two dominant individuals with significant influence
had full signatory power of client bank accounts relating to SFX’s bill-paying services and there
was inadequate segregation of duties within the bill-paying process, thereby creating inherently
significant risks of misappropriation from client accounts. Further, Scolaro failed to identify
Ourand as a person authorized to disburse funds from client accounts, thereby obstructing his
ability to fully assess the risks associated with significant unusual related party transactions.
Even after SFX informed SPC in October 2011 that SFX had terminated Ourand for
misappropriating client funds, Scolaro did not perform any further assessment of fraud risk
factors in conducting the 2011 Examination.
15.
For the 2010 and 2011 Examinations, Scolaro did not gain an adequate
understanding of SFX’s internal controls over compliance as they related to SFX’s compliance
with the Custody Rule. AT §§ 601.45, 601.46 (providing that an accountant conducting an
examination is required to perform procedures sufficient to obtain an adequate understanding of

5

internal controls over compliance). For example, Scolaro identified only one person at SFX who
could authorize payments from or write checks against client accounts – failing to identify
Ourand as a person with such authority. Further, Scolaro did not understand that there was
inadequate segregation of duties within SFX for disbursements from client accounts, with a
single person at SFX being allowed to authorize a transaction, have custody of documents
necessary to initiate a transaction (such as blank checks), and record the transaction in the
accounting system without compensating controls. Further, Scolaro made no additional effort to
understand SFX’s internal controls relating to its compliance with the Custody Rule in
connection with its 2011 Examination procedures despite learning, in October 2011, that SFX
had terminated Ourand for misappropriating client funds.
16.
Another factor to be considered by a practitioner in planning an attest engagement
is conditions that may require extension or modification of attest procedures. See AT § 101.45.
This guidance is supplemented by AT § 101.47, which provides that “. . . as the attest
engagement progresses, changed conditions may make it necessary to modify planned
procedures.”
17.
Scolaro did not document his consideration as to whether the 2011 Examination
procedures should be extended or modified after SFX informed Scolaro of Ourand’s
misappropriation. Scolaro did not document that the fraud had occurred or perform any
additional procedures after learning of Ourand’s misappropriation, including (for example)
evaluating the nature and magnitude of the misappropriation, how Ourand stole client funds, or
whether the misappropriation should affect the timing and extent of attestation procedures.
Failure to Obtain Sufficient Evidence
18.
AT § 101.51 provides that “[t]he second standard of fieldwork is – The
practitioner must obtain sufficient evidence to provide a reasonable basis for the conclusion that
is expressed in the report.” AT § 601.48 provides that “The practitioner should apply procedures
to provide reasonable assurance of detecting material noncompliance.” As described herein, for
the 2010 and 2011 Examinations, Scolaro failed to obtain sufficient evidence to provide a
reasonable basis for the conclusions expressed in the examination reports or to provide
reasonable assurance of detecting noncompliance because he failed to obtain sufficient evidence
through effectively designed sampling plans, independent confirmations with clients, or
alternative procedures that provide relevant and reliable evidence.
19.
For the 2010 Examination, Scolaro inadequately planned, performed and
evaluated samples. See AT § 601.48 and AU § 350, Audit Sampling. The sufficiency of audit
evidence is related to the design and size of an audit sample, among other factors. See AU
§ 350.05. In addition, sample items should be selected in such a way that the sample can be
expected to be representative of the population, and all items in the population should have an
opportunity to be selected. See AU § 350.24. Further, the practitioner should determine which
items, if any, should be individually examined and which items, if any, should be subject to
sampling. The practitioner should examine those items for which, in his judgment, acceptance of
some sampling risk is not justified. See AU § 350.21.

6

20.
In 2010, Scolaro used sampling procedures that were inadequate. In particular,
when confirmations of account balances were not returned by clients, Scolaro sampled client
accounts by selecting a single transaction for the entire period for each client (for a total of 26
sample items) and reviewing supporting documentation. Moreover, the single transaction
selected was the first transaction in the account in the calendar year regardless of amount, type
(credit or debit) or counterparty. The deficiencies in internal controls over SFX’s bill-paying
services and the absence of other effective substantive tests to verify account balances directly
with clients are factors that should have resulted in larger sample sizes. Further, Scolaro did not
separately evaluate or examine the significant unusual checks made to Ourand or to cash, which
a proper degree of professional skepticism should have dictated were high risk transactions.
21.
AT § 101.72 provides that “[t]he practitioner should not express an unqualified
conclusion unless the engagement has been conducted in accordance with the attestation
standards. Such standards will not have been complied with if the practitioner has been unable
to apply all the procedures that he or she considers necessary in the circumstances.” In its 2010
Revised Report, SPC provided an unqualified conclusion that SFX’s assertion that it was in
compliance with the Custody Rule was fairly stated. Moreover, the unqualified conclusion was
supported, in part by falsely stating that SPC had confirmed contributions to and withdrawals
from client accounts when, in fact, these procedures were not performed and SPC had not
performed adequate alternative procedures to obtain sufficient evidence to provide a reasonable
basis for these conclusions.
22.
AT § 601.63 provides that an examination report on an entity’s assertion about
compliance should be modified if there is material noncompliance with specified requirements.
Scolaro should have known that Ourand’s misappropriation was material to users of the reports.
See AT § 101.67. Accordingly, Scolaro had a responsibility to disclose in SPC’s reports this
material noncompliance. The 2011 Report, however, contained an unqualified opinion and made
no mention of Ourand’s misappropriation.
Failure to Prepare and Maintain Examination Documentation
23.
Scolaro failed to prepare and maintain attest documentation sufficient to enable
reviewers to understand the nature, timing and extent of attest procedures performed and the
information obtained. See AT § 101.103. SPC’s work papers for its 2010 and 2011
Examinations of SFX did not contain any explanation of why Scolaro used the sampling
approach that it did or how such approach provided sufficient evidence. Further, the work
papers did not document the existence of Ourand’s misappropriation, whether Scolaro obtained
information to understand the nature and extent of the fraud, or whether Scolaro considered if
examination procedures should be extended or modified after learning of Ourand’s
misappropriation. As a result, Scolaro failed to adequately document his Examinations of SFX
and significant conclusions reached.
Inadequate Training
24.
SPC and Scolaro did not assign an engagement team that “[had] adequate
technical training and proficiency to perform the attestation engagement.” See AT § 101.19. See
also AT § 601.40. Scolaro and the SPC senior accountant assigned to the engagements lacked

7

adequate knowledge and understanding of the Custody Rule, were not aware that the
Examination was to be conducted in accordance with the provisions of AT §§ 101 and 601, and
were not familiar with the guidance the Commission issued in 2009. See Commission Guidance
Regarding Independent Public Accountant Engagements Performed Pursuant to Rule 206(4)-2
Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Advisers Act Rel. No. 2969 (Dec. 30, 2009, effective
Mar. 12, 2010).
SPC Engaged in Improper Professional Conduct by Not Adhering to Professional
Quality Control Standards
25.
AT § 101.17 provides that “a firm of practitioners has a responsibility to adopt a
system of quality control in the conduct of a firm’s attest practice.” Although SPC established a
system of quality controls, the design and implementation of the firm’s policies and procedures
were ineffective, as discussed herein, in providing reasonable assurance that its personnel
complied with professional standards and applicable regulatory requirements in conducting the
2010 and 2011 Examinations, or that the reports issued by the firm were appropriate in the
circumstances.
26.
The AICPA Quality Control Standards (“QC”)6 provide that the firm should
establish policies and procedures requiring that the engagement partner has the appropriate
competence, capabilities, and authority to perform the role. See QC §10.33b. The firm should
establish policies and procedures to assign appropriate personnel with the necessary competence
and capabilities to perform engagements in accordance with professional standards and
applicable legal and regulatory requirements. See QC §10.34a. SPC maintained a policy
wherein a management committee was responsible for ensuring that personnel with the necessary
competence and capabilities were assigned to engagements. Nevertheless, SPC assigned the
Examinations to Scolaro even though he did not have adequate training and proficiency in
Custody Rule compliance requirements or the appropriate competence to perform the
engagements. Accordingly, SPC did not properly monitor compliance with procedures designed
to ensure that the appropriate personnel with the necessary competence and capabilities were
assigned to perform the Examinations.
27.
Firms should establish criteria against which engagements should be evaluated to
determine whether an engagement quality control review should be performed. See QC §10.38.
Engagement quality control reviews should be performed before release of the engagement
report to evaluate the significant judgments made by the engagement team and the related
conclusions reached in forming the overall conclusion on the engagement and in preparing the
engagement report. See QC §10.40 - .41. While SPC maintained policies regarding the
foregoing, these policies did not apply to attestation engagements, such as the SFX Examination,
unless unusual circumstances or risks were identified relating to the engagement. SPC did not
identify any unusual circumstances or risks relating to the 2010 and 2011 SFX engagements and,
consequently, the engagements were not subject to quality control reviews. SPC was negligent
in failing to identify unusual circumstances or risks relating to the 2011 engagement because it
6

The AICPA Quality Control Standards (SQCS No. 7) were revised effective January 1, 2012 (SQCS No.
8). The revision changed the numbering of some of the standards but did not change or expand SQCS No. 7 in any
significant respect. References herein to AICPA Quality Control Standards refer to sections in SQCS No. 8.

8

was aware of Ourand’s misappropriation. SPC’s policy was inadequate and not properly
implemented given that SPC did not conclude that Ourand’s misappropriation constituted an
unusual circumstance or risk – thereby not performing a control review – while SPC had direct
knowledge of fraud.
28.
Firms should establish policies and procedures to provide them with reasonable
assurance that appropriate consultation takes place on difficult or contentious issues. See QC
§10.37. This includes consultations on significant technical, ethical, and other matters. See QC
§10.A38. The nature and scope of consultations should be documented and agreed upon by both
the individual seeking consultation and the individual consulted. See QC §10.37c. SPC’s
policies require documentation of consultations and specify various situations that may require
consultations, including situations involving significant issues identified during the client
acceptance and continuance process. The discovery of Ourand’s misappropriation during SPC’s
2011 Examination of SFX was a significant issue, although SPC and Scolaro failed to identify it
as such, and no consultations were documented in connection with the 2011 Examination. SPC’s
policy was not properly implemented given that SPC did not conclude that Ourand’s
misappropriation was a significant issue – thereby not obtaining a consultation – while it had
knowledge of this conduct.
Violations
29.
As a result of the conduct described above, SPC and Scolaro willfully7 violated
Section 207 of the Advisers Act, which makes it “unlawful for any person willfully to make any
untrue statement of a material fact in any registration application or report filed with the
Commission . . . or willfully to omit to state in any such application or report any material fact
which is required to be stated therein.”
30.
As a result of the conduct described above, SPC and Scolaro engaged in improper
professional conduct as defined in Section 4C(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(iv) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
Findings
31.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that SPC and Scolaro engaged in
improper professional conduct pursuant to Section 4C(a)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule
102(e)(1)(ii) and (iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
32.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that SPC and Scolaro willfully
violated Section 207 of the Advisers Act.

7

A willful violation of the securities laws means merely “‘that the person charged with the duty knows what
he is doing.’” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977
(D.C. Cir. 1949)). There is no requirement that the actor “‘also be aware that he is violating one of the Rules or
Acts.’” Id. (quoting Gearhart & Otis, Inc. v. SEC, 348 F.2d 798, 803 (D.C. Cir. 1965)).

9

IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondents’ Offers.
Accordingly, pursuant to Section 4C of the Exchange Act, Section 203(k) of the Advisers
Act, and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) and (iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, it is hereby
ORDERED that:
A.
Respondents Scolaro and SPC shall cease and desist from committing or causing any
violations and any future violations of Section 207 of the Advisers Act.
B.
Respondent Scolaro is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the
Commission as an accountant.
C.
After five years from the date of this Order, Respondent Scolaro may request that
the Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the
Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as:
1. a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or review,
of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the
Commission. Such an application must satisfy the Commission that
Respondent Scolaro’s work in his practice before the Commission will be
reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company for
which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices
before the Commission in this capacity; and/or
2. an independent accountant. Such an application must satisfy the Commission
that:
(a) Respondent Scolaro, or the public accounting firm with which he is
associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (“Board”) in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and
such registration continues to be effective;
(b) Respondent Scolaro, or the registered public accounting firm with which he
is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not
identify any criticisms of or potential defects in his or the firm’s quality
control system that would indicate that he will not receive appropriate
supervision;
(c) Respondent Scolaro has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and
has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the
Board (other than reinstatement by the Commission); and
(d) Respondent Scolaro acknowledges his responsibility, as long as he appears

10

or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to
comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including,
but not limited to, all requirements relating to registration, inspections,
concurring partner reviews and quality control standards.
D.
The Commission will consider an application by Respondent Scolaro to resume
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and
he has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.
However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will
consider an application on its other merits. The Commission’s review may include consideration
of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to Respondent Scolaro’s
character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the
Commission.
E.
Respondent SPC is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the
Commission as an accountant.
F.
After one year from the date of this Order, Respondent SPC may request that the
Commission consider its reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the
Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as:
1. a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or review, of
any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission.
Such an application must satisfy the Commission that Respondent SPC work in
its practice before the Commission will be reviewed either by the independent
audit committee of the public company for which it works or in some other
acceptable manner, as long as it practices before the Commission in this
capacity; and/or
2. an independent accountant. Such an application must satisfy the Commission
that:
(a) Respondent SPC is registered with the Board in accordance with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective;
(b) Respondent SPC hired an independent CPA consultant (“consultant”),
who is not unacceptable to the staff of the Commission and is affiliated
with a public accounting firm registered with the Board, that has
conducted a review of SPC’s quality control system and submitted to the
staff of the Commission a report that describes the review conducted and
procedures performed, and represents that the review did not identify any
criticisms of or potential defects in the firm’s quality control system that
would indicate that any of SPC’s employees will not receive appropriate
supervision. SPC agrees to require the consultant, if and when retained, to
enter into an agreement that provides that for the period of review and for
a period of two years from completion of the review, the consultant shall

11

not enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or
other professional relationship with SPC, or any of its present or former
affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity.
The agreement will also provide that the consultant will require that any
firm with which he/she is affiliated or of which he/she is a member, and
any person engaged to assist the consultant in performance of his/her
duties under this Order shall not, without prior written consent of the staff,
enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other
professional relationship with SPC, or any of its present or former
affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity
as such for the period of the review and for a period of two years after the
review;
(c) Respondent SPC has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and has
complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the
Board (other than reinstatement by the Commission); and
(d) Respondent SPC acknowledges its responsibility, as long as it appears or
practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to comply
with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not
limited to, all requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring
partner reviews and quality control standards.
G.
The Commission will consider an application by Respondent SPC to resume
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that its state CPA license is current and
it has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.
However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission
will consider an application on its other merits. The Commission’s review may include
consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to
Respondent SPC’s character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or
practice before the Commission.

K.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall
be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents agree that in any Related Investor
Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction
of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondents’ payment of a
civil penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants
such a Penalty Offset, Respondents agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final
order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission’s counsel in this action and pay the
amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall
not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the
civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor
Action” means a private damages action brought against any or both of the Respondents by or on
behalf of one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order
instituted by the Commission in this proceeding.

V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in
Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and
admitted by Respondent Scolaro, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest,
civil penalty or other amounts due by Respondent Scolaro under this Order or any other
judgment, order, consent order, decree or settlement agreement entered in connection with this
proceeding, is a debt for the violation by Respondent Scolaro of the federal securities laws or any
regulation or order issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy
Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
By the Commission.
