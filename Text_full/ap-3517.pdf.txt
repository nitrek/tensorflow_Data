POSTPONEMENT ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
on December 30, 2015, and the hearing was scheduled to commence on January 26, 2016. The OIP
alleges that Respondent is a corporation with a class of securities registered with the Commission
pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and has repeatedly failed to file required periodic
reports. The Division of Enforcement (Division) is seeking to revoke the registration of
Respondent’s securities.
Respondent, a defaulted Nevada corporation located in China, has not yet been served
with the OIP. The Division is attempting to serve Respondent in China pursuant to the Hague
Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or
Commercial Matters, at “the most recent address shown on [its] most recent filing with the
Commission,” in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii), (iv).1 To allow time for service
of the OIP and an Answer, the hearing will be postponed sine die, and a prehearing conference
will be held by telephone on April 29, 2016, at 10:00 a.m. EDT, if the proceeding has not been
resolved by then.
IT IS SO ORDERED.

See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). If Respondent fails to file an Answer within the time
provided, it will be deemed to be in default, and the undersigned will enter an order revoking the
registration of its securities. See OIP at 2-3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
