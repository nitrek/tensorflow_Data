No. 3:16-cv-208

GEORGE A. MOORE III
and
JOSEPH R. DEROSA,
Defendants,
and
LISA A. DEROSA,
Relief Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF
Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), files its complaint
and alleges the following:
OVERVIEW
1.

This case involves violations of the antifraud and securities offering registration

provisions of the federal securities laws by George A. Moore III (“Moore”) and Joseph R.
DeRosa (“Joe DeRosa”) (collectively, “Defendants”) arising from an unregistered distribution of
Solarbrook Water and Power Corp. (“Solarbrook”) common stock that occurred in 2010.
2.

Beginning in or about May 2010 and continuing through in or about November

2010, Moore, the chief executive officer of Solarbrook, and Joe DeRosa, a purported media and
investor relations consultant doing business as OTC Capital Media, Inc. (“OTCCM”), conducted

Case 3:16-cv-00208 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 1 of 16

an unregistered offering of 10,000,020 shares of Solarbrook common stock. OTCCM was a
privately-held entity owned by Joe DeRosa’s wife, Relief Defendant Lisa A. DeRosa (“Lisa
DeRosa”), that Solarbrook purportedly engaged to provide business and consulting services. In
order to evade the securities transaction registration requirements of the federal securities laws,
Moore and Joe DeRosa created a backdated consulting agreement between Solarbrook and Lisa
DeRosa and a backdated convertible debenture that Moore caused Solarbrook to issue to
OTCCM.
3.

Acting in his wife’s name, Joe DeRosa exercised the backdated convertible

debenture and Solarbrook’s transfer agent issued a 10,000,020 share Solarbrook stock certificate,
dated July 7, 2010, in Lisa DeRosa’s name. The stock certificate bore a restrictive legend that
prevented the shares of Solarbrook stock represented by the certificate from being sold in the
public marketplace.
4.

Thereafter, Joe DeRosa and Moore made false and misleading statements, and

supplied falsified and forged documents that they had created, to Solarbrook’s transfer agent in
order to deceive the transfer agent into issuing a new 10,000,020 stock certificate without a
restrictive legend to Lisa DeRosa.
5.

Solarbrook’s transfer agent, in reliance upon the false and misleading statements

and documents from Joe DeRosa and Moore, issued an unrestricted Solarbrook stock certificate
for 10,000,020 shares in Lisa DeRosa’s name, thereby making the 10,000,020 shares of
Solarbrook stock represented by the stock certificate purportedly unrestricted in the public
marketplace.
6.

Joe DeRosa subsequently opened brokerage accounts in Lisa DeRosa’s name with

two registered broker-dealers to sell the Solarbrook stock. In order to deceive the broker-dealers

-2Case 3:16-cv-00208 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 2 of 16

into believing that the 10,000,020 shares of Solarbrook stock were freely tradeable and could be
sold pursuant to a valid exemption from the securities transaction registration requirements, Joe
DeRosa made false and misleading statements to the broker-dealers and provided the brokerdealers with false and misleading documents that he and Moore had created.
7.

On or about November 17, 2010, Joe DeRosa sold all 10,000,020 shares of

Solarbrook stock from an account in Lisa DeRosa’s name at one of the registered broker-dealers
in a public market transaction from which he and Lisa DeRosa realized gross proceeds of
$26,175. Joe DeRosa’s sale of this Solarbrook stock was not pursuant to an effective registration
statement, nor was it eligible for any safe harbor or other exemption from registration.

RELATED ENTITIES
15.

Solarbrook Water and Power Corporation was a North Carolina corporation with

-4Case 3:16-cv-00208 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 4 of 16

its headquarters located in Cary, North Carolina. Prior to December 2007, Solarbrook operated
under the name, “HydroFlo, Inc.” In 2006, HydroFlo and its then-CEO were charged with fraud
in an SEC enforcement action filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
North Carolina for, among other things, issuing false and misleading press releases regarding the
company’s purported involvement in the federal government’s Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.
In that matter, HydroFlo and its former CEO both consented to the entry of permanent
injunctions against future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5
thereunder, and the former CEO was barred from serving as an officer or director of a public
company and ordered to pay a $100,000 civil money penalty. Following the settlement of the
prior SEC enforcement action, HydroFlo changed its name to Solarbrook Water and Power
Corporation. In November 2006, Solarbrook filed a Form 15 with the Commission, suspending
its duty to file periodic reports with the Commission, and became a non-reporting company. On
April 4, 2012, Solarbrook was administratively dissolved by the State of North Carolina for
failure to file required annual reports.
16.

“OTC Capital Media, Inc.” was the trade name of “50/50 Ventures LLC”, a North

Carolina limited liability company those at all relevant times was owned by Lisa DeRosa, who
also served as OTCCM’s President. OTCCM purportedly was a consulting firm that provided
public and investor relations and business consulting and development services. Solarbrook was
OTCCM’s only client. Joe DeRosa was a principal at OTCCM and he conducted all of
OTCCM’s business affairs pursuant to an understanding with Lisa DeRosa who, among other
things, authorized Joe DeRosa to execute and sign documents in her name. On or about October
3, 2012, Articles of Dissolution of Limited Liability Company signed by Lisa DeRosa were filed
with the North Carolina Secretary of State and terminated the existence of 50/50 Ventures LLC

-5Case 3:16-cv-00208 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 5 of 16

and OTCCM.
FACTS
Unregistered Stock Offering
17.

Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act make it unlawful for any person,

directly or indirectly, to use the mails or other means of interstate commerce to sell or to offer to
sell a security for which a registration statement is not on file or in effect, absent an available
exemption. Rule 144 under the Securities Act [17 C.F.R. § 230.144] contains a series of
conditions that, if properly met, will provide a reselling shareholder a safe harbor from the
Securities Act’s registration requirements and allow resale of restricted shares of stock. Here,
the shares acquired by Lisa DeRosa were restricted because they were acquired directly or
indirectly from the issuer in a chain of transactions not involving a public offering. Rule 144 has
specific requirements that include a holding period for securities acquired from an issuer and
requires, among other things, that the acquirer of securities in a non-reporting company, such as
Solarbrook, hold the restricted shares for at least one year before the securities can be sold into
the public marketplace. At all relevant times, Solarbrook was a non-reporting company, having
suspended its duty to file periodic reports with the Commission in November 2006.
Accordingly, anyone who acquired Solarbrook securities directly from the company in an
unregistered transaction after November 2006 was required to have held the securities for over
one year before such securities could be resold in a public marketplace transaction.
18.

In 2007, Moore returned to Solarbrook to serve as its CEO. Within months of

becoming Solarbrook’s CEO, Moore closed both of Solarbrook’s offices and fired all of the
company’s employees because of the company’s lack of sales or revenues.
19.

In or about May 2010, Moore and Joe DeRosa executed a consulting agreement

purportedly between Lisa DeRosa and Solarbrook, which they backdated to January 2, 2009
-6Case 3:16-cv-00208 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 6 of 16

(“Backdated Consulting Agreement”). Moore signed the Backdated Consulting Agreement on
behalf of Solarbrook. Joe DeRosa signed Lisa DeRosa’s name to the Backdated Consulting
Agreement. Prior to May 2010, Solarbrook had no business or other relationship with Joe
DeRosa, Lisa DeRosa, or OTCCM.
20.

Pursuant to the Backdated Consulting Agreement, Lisa DeRosa was to provide

certain business consulting and other investor relations services to Solarbrook for a period of two
years, including “management of resources, strategic planning, corporate organization and
structure, financial matters in connection with the operation of the businesses of the company,
expansion of services, [and] acquisitions and business opportunities.” Lisa DeRosa never
performed any services for Solarbrook.
21.

Under the terms of the Backdated Consulting Agreement, as compensation for

services to be provided to Solarbrook by Lisa DeRosa, Solarbrook was obligated to issue
10,000,020 shares of common stock to Lisa DeRosa “immediately upon execution of the
agreement.”
22.

In or about May 2010, Moore caused Solarbrook to issue a convertible debenture

to OTCCM, which he backdated to January 2, 2009, in order to create the misleading appearance
that the debenture had been outstanding for over one year (“Backdated Convertible Debenture”).
The Backdated Convertible Debenture gave OTCCM the right to convert 333,334 shares of
Solarbrook preferred stock into 10,000,020 shares of Solarbrook common stock. At the time that
he caused Solarbrook to issue the Backdated Convertible Debenture, Moore knew or was
reckless in not knowing that Solarbrook had had no business or other relationship with Lisa
DeRosa or OTCCM prior to May 2010. Joe DeRosa knew or was reckless in not knowing that
the Backdated Convertible Debenture had not been issued on January 2, 2009, and that Moore

-7Case 3:16-cv-00208 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 7 of 16

had created the Backdated Convertible Debenture in or about May 2010 and had backdated the
debenture.
23.

Joe DeRosa, acting on behalf of Lisa DeRosa in her capacity as President of

OTCCM, exercised the conversion option under the Backdated Convertible Debenture in early
July 2010 and Solarbrook’s stock transfer agent issued a restricted stock certificate for
10,000,020 Solarbrook shares in Lisa DeRosa’s name, dated July 7, 2010.
24.

In or about late July 2010, in order to obtain an unrestricted stock certificate that

could be used to effectuate the public marketplace sale of the 10,000,020 shares, Joe DeRosa
sent to Solarbrook’s stock transfer agent, among other things, a form “Shareholder
Representation Letter to Remove Legend” that he had completed and signed in Lisa DeRosa’s
name, which falsely stated that Lisa DeRosa had held the shares represented by the
accompanying stock certificate for over one year, and an attorney opinion letter that Joe DeRosa
had forged on the letterhead of a law firm with offices located in Charlotte, North Carolina, dated
July 21, 2010. The forged attorney opinion letter falsely stated that, with regard to Lisa
DeRosa’s request for the restrictive legend to be removed from the 10,000,020 share Solarbrook
stock certificate in question, the attorney was of the opinion that “the seller will be allowed to
sell his [sic] shares subject to the limitation of Rule 144 on July 21st, 2010 so long as the
proposed sale is made in conformity with Rule 144.” As of July 21, 2010, Lisa DeRosa had not
held the Solarbrook shares for one year.
25.

In furtherance of Joe DeRosa’s fraudulent effort to obtain an unrestricted

10,000,020 share Solarbrook stock certificate from the transfer agent, Moore, in his capacity as
Solarbrook’s president and CEO, wrote a letter to the transfer agent, dated July 12, 2010,
(“Moore Transfer Agent Letter”) in which he falsely certified to the transfer agent that

-8Case 3:16-cv-00208 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 8 of 16

10,000,020 shares of Solarbrook stock represented by the restricted stock certificate issued in
Lisa DeRosa’s name had been “validly issued” and were “free trading.” Joe DeRosa knew or
was reckless in not knowing that the statements that Moore made in the Moore Transfer Agent
Letter were false and misleading and were made in order to fraudulently induce Solarbrook’s
transfer agent to issue an unrestricted 10,000,020 share Solarbrook stock certificate to Lisa
DeRosa.
26.

Based on Joe DeRosa’s and Moore’s fraudulent misrepresentations, the transfer

agent issued an unrestricted stock certificate for 10,000,020 Solarbrook shares, dated August 2,
2010, in Lisa DeRosa’s name.
27.

At some point in July or August 2010, Moore created a document entitled,

“Corporate Resolution – For Over 1 Million Shares,” dated July 12, 2010, which he signed as the
president and a director of Solarbrook (“Corporate Resolution”). In the Corporate Resolution,
Moore certified that Solarbrook’s board of directors had met with no fewer than two board
members present and had resolved that the unrestricted stock certificate that had been issued to
Lisa DeRosa for 10,000,020 shares of Solarbrook stock had been validly issued and that the
shares were “free trading.” Moore knew or was reckless in not knowing that the assertions in the
Corporate Resolution were false and misleading. Further, Moore provided the Corporate
Resolution to Joe DeRosa and knew or was reckless in not knowing that Joe DeRosa would use
the Corporate Resolution to mislead others in connection with their scheme to evade the
securities registration requirements.
28.

On or about August 22, 2010, Joe DeRosa opened a brokerage account in Lisa

DeRosa’s name at a registered broker-dealer (“Broker-Dealer A”) located in El Cajon,
California. Joe DeRosa sent the fraudulently procured unrestricted stock certificate to Broker-

-9Case 3:16-cv-00208 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 9 of 16

Dealer A, along with other false and fraudulent documents for the purpose of deceiving BrokerDealer A into believing that the Solarbrook shares were properly unrestricted and could be sold
into the public marketplace immediately. As part of that effort, Joe DeRosa submitted two
forged attorney opinion letters, both dated July 22, 2010, on the letterhead of the same Charlotte,
North Carolina law firm as the letter that Joe DeRosa had sent to Solarbrook’s transfer agent.
One of the forged attorney opinion letters falsely asserted that the 10,000,020 shares of
Solarbrook stock had been issued pursuant to a consulting agreement between Lisa DeRosa and a
shareholder of Solarbrook “on behalf of Solarbrook,” while the other letter falsely stated that the
same shares had been issued “via [sic] a consulting agreement” between Lisa DeRosa and
Solarbrook.
29.

Broker-Dealer A contacted the attorney who purportedly had signed the attorney

opinion letters that Joe DeRosa had forged. The attorney disavowed the letters and denied that
he had prepared or authorized either letter. When Broker-Dealer A confronted Joe DeRosa about
the falsified letters, Joe DeRosa admitted forging one of letters.
30.

In light of DeRosa’s admission that he had forged an attorney opinion letter,

Broker-Dealer A closed the account in Lisa DeRosa’s name and returned the Solarbrook share
certificate to Joe DeRosa.
31.

On or about September 2, 2010, Joe DeRosa opened a brokerage account in Lisa

DeRosa’s name with a registered broker-dealer (“Broker-Dealer B”), located in Altamonte
Springs, Florida, and deposited the same Solarbrook stock certificate into that account.
32.

Joe DeRosa submitted falsified documentation to Broker-Dealer B. In addition to

the unrestricted Solarbrook stock certificate that Joe DeRosa had procured from the transfer
agent by fraud, Joe DeRosa sent to Broker-Dealer B a copy of the false and misleading

- 10 Case 3:16-cv-00208 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 10 of 16

Corporate Resolution that Moore had created and signed. Joe DeRosa also sent to Broker-Dealer
B a false and misleading “Rule 144 Seller’s Letter,” dated September 9, 2010, that he had
completed and signed in Lisa DeRosa’s name, in which he falsely stated that Lisa DeRosa had
held the Solarbrook shares for more than one year.
33.

Based on the false and misleading information that Joe DeRosa submitted to

Broker-Dealer B, the firm allowed Joe DeRosa to deposit the 10,000,020 share Solarbrook stock
certificate into the account. Thereafter, on November 17, 2010, Joe DeRosa sold all 10,000,020
shares of Solarbrook stock from Lisa DeRosa’s account at Broker-Dealer B in an open market
transaction, for gross proceeds of $26,175. No registration statement was on file or in effect for
the sale of these shares, and the transaction was ineligible for any exemption from registration.
34.

Moore was a necessary participant and a substantial factor in the unregistered

offer and sale of the Solarbrook stock. Moore created and signed both the Backdated Consulting
Agreement with Lisa DeRosa and the Backdated Convertible Debenture, and he prepared and
signed the false and misleading Moore Transfer Agent Letter and the Corporate Resolution,
falsely representing that the stock had been validly issued and was “free trading”. At the time
that Moore made these false and misleading statements in documents and correspondence that he
sent to Solarbrook’s transfer agent and provided to Joe DeRosa, Moore knew or was reckless in
not knowing that Joe DeRosa would use Moore’s false and misleading statements to mislead
others in furtherance of the scheme to evade the securities registration requirements of the
federal securities laws and to sell the 10,000,020 shares of Solarbrook stock in the public
marketplace.
