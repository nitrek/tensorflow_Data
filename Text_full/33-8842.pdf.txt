The safe harbor provisions of Section 27A(c) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(c) of
the Exchange Act are not available for any forward looking statement that is “made with respect to
the business or operations of an issuer, if the issuer . . . during the 3-year period preceding the date

decree or order arising out of a governmental action that (I) prohibits future violations of the
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; (II) requires that the issuer cease and desist from
violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws; or (III) determines that the issuer violated
the antifraud provisions of the securities laws[.]” Section 27A(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Securities Act

extent otherwise specifically provided by rule, regulation, or order of the Commission.” Section

Based on the representations set forth in Respondents’ request, the Commission has
determined that, under the circumstances, the request for a waiver of the disqualifications resulting
from the entry of the Order is appropriate and should be granted.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 27A(b) of the Securities Act and
Section 21E(b) of the Exchange Act, that a waiver from the disqualification provisions of Section
27A(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Exchange Act as to
