ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17395
ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTION
203(f) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS
ACT OF 1940 AND NOTICE OF HEARING

In the Matter of
Anthony Tyrone Jones, Jr.,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to
Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) against Anthony Tyrone
Jones, Jr. (“Respondent” or “Jones”).
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A.

RESPONDENT

1.
Jones, age 45, of Jacksonville, Florida, has never been associated with a
registered investment adviser or a registered broker-dealer.
B.

RESPONDENT’S CRIMINAL CONVICTION

1.
On March 24, 2016, Jones pled guilty and was convicted of wire fraud in
the United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, in violation of Title 18, United States
Code, Section 1343. USA v. Anthony Tyrone Jones, Jr., Crim. No. 3:16-cr-27-J-34JBT, (M.D. Fla.
1

Mar. 24, 2016). He is currently incarcerated at the Baker County Detention Center in Macclenny,
Florida awaiting sentencing for his criminal conviction and will thereafter be transferred to a
federal correctional facility. Jones’s conviction for wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20
years imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
2.
In his plea agreement, Jones stipulates that from approximately August
2010 through February 2012 he made false representations to an individual. Jones told this
individual that he was an “investment adviser” and had prior experience assisting other
individuals with their investments, even helping one person become wealthy through his
investment advice. Jones recommended that the individual invest in a particular security and
advised her to allow him to purchase stock in that company and make other investments on her
behalf. On the basis of Jones’s representations, the individual provided him with $25,000 to
invest. In actuality, Jones had not previously acted as , an investment adviser. Instead of investing
his client’s money as promised, Jones simply used the funds for his own personal enjoyment.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it
necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be instituted
to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
B.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act; and
IV.
IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and before an
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.
If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly
notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against
him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as
provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f), and 310 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f), and 201.310.

2

This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent as provided for in the Commission’s
Rules of Practice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 210 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness
or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within
the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the
provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action.
By the Commission.
