OFFICE

The Honorable George Bush
President of the Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510

The Honorable Jim Wright
Speaker of the House
Washington, D.C. 20515

Gentlemen:
In fiscal 1986 the Securities and Exchange Commission increased investor pro.
tections and reduced unnecessary paperwork and other expenses, ultimately borne
by investors. Highlights include:
Record results or the highest levels in years were achieved by all Divisions (see
table on page 2). Over the past five years, through automation, paperwork reduction and other staff and Commission initiatives, the increase in the Commission's
results has compared favorably with the growth in the marketplace. For example,
since fiscal 1981:
• Enforcement

actions have been increased 61 %.

• Full disclosure filings by issuers have increased 35%. SEC reviews of these filings have increased 71 % .
• The number of registered broker-dealers has increased 57%. SEC broker-dealer
oversight examinations have increased 73% and Self-Regulatory Organization
inspections 83%.
• The number of registered investment companies and advisers has increased
86%. SEC inspections have increased 155% .
• Targeting problem areas has improved the quality of reviews, examinations,
inspections and enforcement actions.
• The number of shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange has increased
186 %, but the number of transactions has Increased only 53 % because of the
growth of large transactions by institutions and others. The number of investors has increased 46%.
• Complaints to the SEC have increased 55 %. Since 1982 all are reviewed. Most
involve brokerage back office matters. They are referred to the firms' compliance departments for investigation and written response, and are tracked by
the SEC through resolution. Others are referred to the SEC Enforcement Division. the Justice Department, Self-Requlatory Organizations (SROs) or state securities commissions for investigation and prosecution if warranted.

+ After a $4.8 million reduction from the $111.1 million appropriated due to Gramm-RudmanHollings, which was restored at the request of the President in fiscal 1987.
Budget: In fiscal 1986 the budget was reduced from the $111.1 million appropriated to $106.3 million ($4.8 million or 4.3%) due to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. At the request of the President the Commission's fiscal 1987 budget restored the Gramm-Rudman-Hollinqs
reduction plus $3.4 million. Since 1981, the Commission's budget has been increased 43 % to $114.5 million in fiscal 1987. In each of the last four fiscal years
registration, transfer and other fees have significantly exceeded the Commission's
budget, which has happened only once before in the past 52 years. In fiscal 1986,
fees exceeded the budget by 203 % or $109 million. The President has requested
a $31 million (27 %) increase in the Commission's fiscal 1988 budget to $145 million, which is presently pending before Congress. The increase is principally to
cover start-up costs of the operational electronic disclosure system ("Edgar") and
a 9% increase in authorized positions from 2,086 to 2,267 for enforcement and
related activities. The President requests and Congress legislates the Commission's
budget, personnel and fees. Fees and fines are remitted to the Treasury as received.

Enforcement actions increased 16% to 312 cases from 269 in
1985. They included 114 broker-dealer and other regulated entity cases, 69 securities offering violation cases, 49 false and misleading financial disclosure cases
and a record 34 insider trading cases. In fiscal 1986, court orders required violators to disgorge a record $38 million of illicit profits and to pay $4 million in fines.

Enforcement:

On November 14,1986, a record $100 million consent judgement was obtained
against Ivan Boesky. He was also barred from the securities industry, became a

2

cooperating witness in ongoing investigations by the SEC and the Justice Department and consented to a felony count which may result in up to five years imprisonment and $250,000 in fines.
While insider trading cases have received a great deal of publicity, they have only
amounted to 10% or less of enforcement actions in recent years; however, they
have increased significantly over prior years. During the past five years, 125 insider trading cases have been brought, as compared with 77 during the preceding
47 years. The large increase is due principally to the increase in corporate takeovers
and to improved surveillance and enforcement systems and techniques by the Enforcement Division. With the support of the business and financial community,
the investing public, the Administration and Congress, the SEC's ability to expose
and prosecute securities frauds has been significantly enhanced by electronic market surveillance systems, transaction audit trails, heavy fines and growing cooperation from abroad (see International Accords below).
The Ivan Boesky and many other cases demonstrate that it has become increasingly difficult for inside traders to hide - at home or abroad - and that those
who engage in such activities are assuming significant risks of imprisonment, heavy
fines and civil suits, disbarment from the legal profession and the securities industry - and public disgrace. Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has
been inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky and others have
been siphoning off the markets are now flowing through to legitimate investors
and traders.

International Accords: Starting with the Swiss Accord in 1982, the Commission has implemented additional cooperation agreements on enforcement matters with Canadian, Japanese and United Kingdom authorities. Others are in
prospect. The logical extension of these bilateral agreements will be multilateral
agreements with virtually all major markets.
At the Commission's initiative in 1986, the 30-nation International Organization
of Securities Commissions formed multinational committees to accelerate: cooperation on enforcement matters; the clearance and settlement of international securities transactions; access to each others' markets; and the growth of less developed
countries' markets.
The Corporation Finance Division is preparing for the Commission's consideration a proposal to permit so-called "world class" corporations to do investment
grade debt, exchange and rights offerings in certain participating countries under
prospectuses that comply with their domestic requirements, subject to certain minimum provisions.

International Unkages: Upon the recommendation of the Market Regulation
Division, the Commission approved linkage of the Midwest and Toronto stock exchanges, and the first transatlantic exchange of stock quotations by the National
Association of Securities Dealers and the London Stock Exchange. The Commission has previously approved linkages of the American and Toronto stock exchanges and the Boston and Montreal stock exchanges.
About 500 companies' shares are now actively trading in more than one country.
By the early 19905 we may well witness over a fivefold increase in the number

3

of companies with shares trading around the clock and the world through a gric
of international linkages of major markets and brokerage networks.
Program Trading: By telescoping into minutes and hours transactions previously executed over days and weeks, computerized hedging and arbitrage has increased market volatility in dollars, but not in percentage changes of the averages.
Stock index options and futures enable investors, underwriters and others to hedge
market risks at a fraction of the prior costs. Computerized arbitrage brings the
prices of options and futures into line with those of the underlying securities, which
increases the efficiency and liquidity of the markets.
To dampen the volatility on quarterly settlement dates when options and futures
expire, the Commission proposed that certain order imbalances be displayed on
the ticker tape during the last half hour of trading. The results have been encouraging. The Commission also encouraged and endorsed the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's and the Chicago Board Option Exchange's proposals to settle certain
stock index futures and options at opening instead of closing prices, and the CME's
proposal to increase its margin requirements. The Market Regulation Division is
monitoring these efforts and considering others to dampen interim and settlement
volatility.
Tender Offers: To address discriminatory tender offers, the "all holders, best
price" rule was adopted. It requires that tender offers be made to all holders of
a class of securities and that the best price paid to any be paid to all. The minimum offering period of issuer tender offers was conformed to that of third party
offers and withdrawal rights were extended throughout all offers. Legislation was
proposed to reduce from ten to two days the 13D disclosure of the acquisition
of a 5% interest in a company. The Corporation Finance Division is analyzing extensive responses received to a concept release on "unconventional" tender offers,
"poison pills" and companies "opting out" of certain tender offer rules upon share.
holder approval.
One-Share One- Vote: Public hearings were held on December 16 and 17, 1986
concerning the New York Stock Exchange's proposal to permit listed companies
to issue classes of common stock with different voting rights upon approval by
a majority of their independent directors and public shareholders. The Market Regu.
lation Division is analyzing the comments and alternatives.
Electronic Disclosures: The Commission's pilot electronic disclosure system
(known as "Edgar" for Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval) success.
fully completed its second full year of operation. Over 1,000 issuers have filed
over 15,000 documents on Edgar. The primary purpose of Edgar is to increase
the efficiency and fairness of the markets for the benefit of investors, issuers and
the economy by reducing from days and weeks to minutes and hours the public
dissemination of tirne-sensitive corporate information. This will increase the utili.
ty of such information to investors, accelerate issuers' access to the market and
increase their financing flexibility. Edgar will also assist the Corporation Finance
and Investment Management Divisions in improving the efficiency, breadth and
quality of their filing reviews and the Enforcement Division in its investigations.
Offers for the operational Edgar system have been received and are being evaluated. Comments on an advance rulemaking proposal for electronic disclosures
are under review.

Shareholder Communications: To facilitate issuers' communications with
their investors, under rules adopted by the Commission, broker-dealers began making available to issuers on January 1, 1986 the identity of their non-objecting shareholders. The Commission has issued similar rules for commercial banks under
the Shareholder Communications Act of 1985.
Certificate Immobilization: The Commission is encouraging voluntary immobilization of debt security certificates through the greater use of electronic bookentry systems and central depositories, which will save multimillions of dollars
of expenses ultimately borne by investors and reduce paperwork and other
problems. Ford Motor Credit Corporation successfully consummated the first public
offering of conventional corporate debt on a book-entry basis on October 21, 1986.
Also, with the Commission's support, the Government National Mortgage Association announced in December 1986, its intention to begin issuing securities on
a book-entry basis through the MBS Clearing Corporation by the third quarter of
1987. Upon the recommendation of the Market Regulation Division, the Commission approved the registration of the MBSCC as a clearing agency through July
1988. GNMA's initiative will accelerate the clearance and settlement of transactions and reduce GNMA fail rates, which have been running in excess of 30%.
Proxies: Proxies were improved and the costs reduced for the benefit of investors through the integration of disclosures, simplification of compensation plan
information and greater new registrant disclosures of accountant changes.
Economic Research: The Office of the Chief Economist released economic
studies concerning the adverse impact on share prices upon announcement of companies' intentions to adopt "poison pills"; the use of noninvestment grade debt
to provide 14% of tender offer financings during the first half of 1985; and the
negligible impact on stock prices of SEC enforcement of the ceiling test for those
oil and gas companies which use "full cost" accounting. The OCE and the Directorate of Economic and Policy Analysis also published studies finding that multiple listing reduces the cost of transactions in both listed and OTC stock options.
Investment Advisers/Financial
Planners: Upon the recommendation of
the Investment Management Division, the Commission endorsed the National Association of Securities Dealers' proposed pilot inspection program for the investment advisers of its members and their affiliates, which account for 43% of
registered investment advisers.
Litigation: In litigation involving the Office of the General Counsel, the Commission's positions were upheld in 86% of 81 decisions, including the insider trading misappropriation theory in U.S. v. Carpenter (cert. granted); the Commission's
authority to administratively discipline accountants in Davy v. SEC; antifraud provision applicability to government securities repurchase transactions in SEC v.
Drysdale Securities Corporation; the materiality of ongoing merger negotiations
prior to an agreement in principle in Levinson v. Basic; the applicability of Securities Act disclosure requirements to predecessor entities in SEC v. American Board
of Trade; and that tax offset rules do not mitigate tax shelter investors' rescissionary damages in Randall v. Loftsgaarden.
Functional Regulation: The Commission testified in support of the Bush Task
Group recommendation to consolidate within the SEC the securities reporting re-

5

quirements of 700 publicly owned banks and thrifts. This would permit more uniform disclosures and enforcement at lower cost. The 12,000 other publicly owned
companies, including 1,000 banks and thrift holding companies, presently file with
the SEC.
Small Business: In compliance with the Small Business Investment Incentive
Act's requirement to reduce state and federal regulatory burdens on small businesses, the Commission adopted and the North American Securities Administrators Association recommended to the states a uniform notification form for certain
financings exempt from registration under Regulation D. Also, the asset threshold
requiring registration of issuers' securities was raised from $3 to $5 million.
Annual Reports: The Corporation Finance Division approved a General Motors proposal to improve issuers' communications with their shareholders by provlding more readable annual reports at lower cost, without reducing the information
provided shareholders.
Government Securities: A study prepared in consultation with the Treasury
Department and the Federal Reserve Board formed a basis for the Government
Securities Act of 1986. The Act requires previously unregulated government securities dealers to register with the Commission. The Commission and the federal
bank regulators share inspection and enforcement responsibilities.
Accounting: Upon the recommendation
of the Office of the Chief Accountant,
the Commission requested the Financial Accounting Standards Board to address
issues related to market value changes in financial instruments, off-balance-sheet
financing and risk transfer instruments. Guidance was also provided public companies on reportinq the effects of the Tax Reform Act of 1986
Roundtables: Eight open roundtable discussions of the Commission and senior
staff were held with leading business, academic and other authorities on major
issues concerning the role of investment advisers and financial planners, index
arbitrage, takeover developments, disclosure of merger negotiations, surveillance
and enforcement programs, independent auditors and other matters.
Legislation: Commission representatives testified at 12 Congressional hearings
concerning civil RICO reform, tender offer regulation, SEC appropriations, SEC
oversight, bank accounting and financial reporting, disclosure of foreign investments, investment advisers and financial planners, insider trading, financial report.
ing and the role of the independent auditor, regulation of financial services and
other matters. The staff also assisted Congressional committees in drafting legislation and provided studies and other information in response to Congressional
requests.
The past year's results are a product of the ability and dedication of the staff
and Commissioners. The Commission also received excellent cooperation and sup.
port from the business and financial community, the investing public, the Justice
Department, the Self-Regulatory Organizations, the state securities commissions,
the Administration and Congress.

Enforcement Program
Key 1986 Results
The Commission brought 312 enforcement actions during fiscal year
1986, as compared with 269 in 1985. There were 30 cases in which insider
trading was the primary violation alleged, and an additional 4 cases where
insider trading was alleged in addition to other primary violations. The 34
actions represent the highest number of insider trading cases brought by
the Commission in a single year. There was also a substantial increase over
the preceding two years in the number of civil and criminal contempt actions. The enforcement program continued to be comprehensive, with actions involving false and misleading financial disclosure, fraudulent
securities offerings, and violations by broker-dealers and other regulated
entities comprising the majority of the cases.

In 1986 the Commission obtained court orders requiring defendants to
return illicit profits amounting to more than $38.2 million, either as disgorgement or restitution to defrauded investors. Disgorgement orders in
insider trading cases amounted to $29.7 million, compared to $2.1 million in 1985. The Commission also recovered $3.7 million during fiscal year
1986 in civil penalties under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984
(ITSA).
The Comrnissron referred or granted access to its files to the Department
of Justice or state prosecutorial authorities in 142 cases, as compared with
145 in 1985. There were 72 criminal indictments or informations obtained
during fiscal 1986 in Commission related cases, compared to 59 in 1985.
There were 71 criminal convictions in Commission related cases during fiscal year 1986, compared to 93 in 1985.
Introduction
The Commission's enforcement program seeks to preserve the integrity, efficiency and fairness of the securities markets by enforcing the Federal securities laws. These laws provide civil and administrative remedies
designed to rectify past violations and prevent future violations.
7

Most Commission enforcement actions are preceded by a private inve,
tigation to determine whether a violation of the securities laws has occurre
or is about to occur. Where necessary, the Commission may order a foi
mal investigation and thereby authorize the staff to issue subpoenas com
pelling testimony and the production of documents.
Depending on the results of an investigation, the Commission may autho
rize the staff to commence a civil action in a United States District Court
institute an administrative proceeding, or refer the matter to the Depart.
ment of Justice for criminal prosecution. Matters may also be referred to
state or local authorities or self-regulatory organizations for appropriate
action.
The Commission's primary civil remedy is a Federal court injunction
which directs the subject to comply with the law in the future. If it is violated, contempt of court proceedings may result in imprisonment or the imposition of fines. Courts may also issue orders providing other equitable
relief such as restitution, disgorgement of illicit profits, and other appropriate remedies.
The Commission is authorized to bring administrative proceedings
against regulated entities such as broker-dealers, investment companies,
or investment advisers, as well as persons associated with such entities.
Where the Commission finds that a regulated entity has willfully violated
the securities laws, it may impose remedial sanctions ranging from a censure to a revocation of the registration required for the entity to conduct
business. The Commission also may censure or limit the activities of associated persons, or suspend or bar such persons from association.
Issuers of securities are subject to administrative proceedings if they fail
to comply with the disclosure, proxy and tender offer provisions of the Exchange Act. Individuals causing such failures may also be named as respondents in such proceedings. Respondents may be ordered to comply with
applicable provisions upon specified terms and conditions, or to take steps
to effect compliance. Issuers may also be named as respondents in certain
proceedings authorized by the Securities Act. In addition, the Commission
may publish reports of investigation under Section 21(a) of the Exchange
Act.
Criminal sanctions for Federal securities law violations include fines and
imprisonment for up to five years for each violation. The Commission has
developed close working relationships with the Department of Justice and
U.S. Attorneys' offices to assist the investigation and prosecution of such
cases. The Commission also cooperates closely with state securities regulators and self-regulatory organizations, including the National Association
of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the various national securities exchanges.
Program Areas
The Commission investigates and brings enforcement actions to remedy a broad range of violations. Classified by primary violation, enforcement
activity during fiscal year 1986 included cases concerning corporate reporting and accounting; 1 insider trading;2 violations by regulated entities and
8

associated persons:" market manlpulation:" securities offerinqs:" changes
in corporate control:" related party transactlons:? civil and criminal contempt actions:" and delinquent filing cases against both issuers and individuals.?
Corporate Reporting and Accounting-Financial
disclosure cases continued to be a high priority in fiscal year 1986. The Commission brought
35 cases containing significant allegations of financial disclosure violations
against issuers or their employees, compared with 42 such cases in 1985
and 33 in 1984. The Commission also brought 15 cases alleging misconduct on the part of accounting firms or their partners or employees in fiscal year 1986, including one of the issuer disclosure cases set forth above. 10
There were 14 enforcement actions against accountants or accounting firms
in 1985 and 18 in 1984.
Typical financial disclosure cases involve the improper valuation of assets or liabilities; the improper recognition of revenue or income; the failure
to establish sufficient provisions for bad debts or other contingencies; or
the failure to provide adequate disclosure concerning the issuer's true financial position. Many of these cases also involve violations of the accounting
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Financial disclosure cases
are often complex and require more resources than other types of cases,
but effective prosecution of them is essential to preserving the integrity of
the disclosure system.
In one financial disclosure case, SEC v. Carter, II the Commission obtained
injunctive relief against three executive officers who allegedly caused an
issuer to overstate its net income by $44 million as a result of failing to
implement write-offs and reserve increases as recommended by the financial management of its subsidiaries. An action based on the same facts had
previously been brought against the issuer during 1985.12 The issuer, which
had restated its financial statements prior to the Commission's action, consented to the entry of a permanent injunction and agreed to maintain an
audit committee of its board of directors.
In an administrative proceeding, In the Matter of American Express Co., 13
the Commission found that the manner in which an issuer had accounted
for two reinsurance transactions engaged in by a wholly owned subsidiary
was not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
Commission accepted the issuer's offer of settlement in which it agreed,
among other things, to comply with the reporting provisions of the Exchange Act.
Financial disclosure cases are sometimes accompanied by allegations
of insider trading. In one injunctive action, 14 for example, the Commission
alleged that an issuer had failed to disclose substantial losses of trade credit
and had failed to write down its interest in a refinery. The Commission filed
a separate injunctive action against an officer of the issuer alleging that
he had sold stock while in possession of material, nonpubJic information
concerning the issuer's financial problems. IS
Financial disclosure cases may also involve misconduct on the part of
the independent accountants who examine and issue an opinion on the issuer's financial statements. One example is In the Matter of Seidman and
9

Seidman, 16 an administrative proceeding brought pursuant to Rule 2(e) of
the Commission's Rules of Practice against a national accounting firm. The
Commission concluded, in its Order, that the firm had failed to comply with
generally accepted auditing standards in connection with its examination
of an issuer's financial statements. The firm was censured and ordered to
comply with its undertakings to implement new procedures and policies
designed to prevent a recurrence of the practices found to be deficient.
In addition to financial disclosure cases, the Commission brought six
cases involving the misrepresentation or failure to disclose information concerning related party transactions, the compensation of officers, or other
matters during fiscal 1986. The Commission also brought 18 delinquent
filing actions against issuers during the fiscal year, compared with 19 in
1985 and 15 in 1984.
Insider Trading-Individuals who purchase or sell securities while in possession of material, nonpublic information relating to such securities, in
violation of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence,
undermine the expectation of fairness and honesty that is the basis of investor confidence in the nation's securities markets. The trading of standardized options contracts, coupled with tender offers and other
acquisitions, has increased opportunities for those with material nonpublie information to reap large profits.
The Commission's insider trading enforcement program achieved record
results in fiscal year 1986. The 30 cases brought during the year represented an increase of 50 percent over 1985, and included several of the most
significant insider trading cases ever brought by the Cornrnlssion.!" The
Commission obtained court orders requiring defendants to disgorge over
$29.7 million, compared to $2.1 million in 1985, with the amount recovered in four separate cases exceeding the highest amount recovered in
an insider trading case prior to fiscal year 1986. The Commission also obtained $3.7 million during fiscal year 1986 in civil penalties under lTSA.
In SEC v. Levine,I8 the Commission brought its largest insider trading
case up to September 30, 1986 against Dennis Levine, an investment
banker, two Panamanian companies allegedly under his control, and a Swiss
citizen who acted as a broker for Levine's trades through a Bahamian sub.
sidiary of a Swiss bank. The Commission alleged, among other things, that
Levine made $12.6 million by trading in the securities of at least 54 issuers
while in possession of material, nonpublic information about actual or proposed tender offers, mergers, and other business combinations.
Levine agreed to disgorge at least $11.6 million, including $10.6 million in his Bahamian bank account. Levine also consented to a permanent
injunction against future violations of the Federal securities laws, and to
the issuance of an administrative order barring him from the securities business. In a related criminal proceeding, Levine pleaded guilty to one count
of securities fraud, two counts of income tax evasion, and one count of
perjury.
Over the following five months, the Commission's continuing investigation of Levine's activities led to a series of cases against four individuals
who were participants in the scheme.'? Those individuals collectively were

ordered to pay $3.7 million in disgorgement and $875,000 in civil penal.
ties. The consent judgement of $100 million against Ivan F. Boesky was
filed after the close of fiscal 1986, on November 14, 1986 and is not in.
c1uded in the foregoing data.
In SEC v. The First Boston Corp., 20 the Commission alleged that a securities firm had engaged in unlawful trading, for its own account, while in possession of material, nonpublic information received from an investment
banking client. First Boston's corporate finance department allegedly
received confidential information from a corporation concerning a forthcoming announcement
of a $1.2 billion addition to the corporation's
property-casualty loss reserves. The corporate finance department allegedly
conveyed this information to a First Boston insurance analyst, who thereafter communicated the information to persons in its trading department.
Although the securities of the corporation were placed on the firm's restricted list, a First Boston trader sold stock for the firm's account.
Besides consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction against future
violations, First Boston agreed to disgorge profits of $132,138 derived from
the alleged trading violations, to pay a $264,276 penalty under ITSA, and
to review and modify its restricted list and "Chinese Wall" procedures.
The Commission obtained the largest civil penalty paid to date under
ITSA in SEC v. Keiz," a case in which it alleged that a financial analyst
conveyed nonpublic information concerning a proposed merger to his
father, who then shared that information with his broker and his father-inlaw. The father agreed to disgorge slightly over $1 million and pay a civil
penalty of $2.1 million. The Commission obtained an additional $1.3 million in disgorgement or penalties from the other three defendants in the
case.
The detection and prosecution of insider trading emanating from abroad
pose unique problems. The Commission's investigative subpoena power
is limited to persons and entities within the United States, and even when
foreign persons or firms are effectively served, foreign secrecy or blocking
laws may prohibit disclosure of the requested information.
Two cases initiated during 1981 and concluded during fiscal year 1986
illustrate differing approaches to transnational insider trading cases. In SEC
v. Bence Della Soizzera ltslisne, et al.,22 call options on the common stock
of St. Joe Minerals Corporation were purchased through the U.S. securities accounts of a Swiss bank, Banca Della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), on the
day before the announcement of a tender offer for all of the outstanding
shares of St. Joe. The Commission immediately filed an injunctive action
naming BSI and certain unknown purchasers as defendants, and obtained
a freeze of BSI assets at a New York bank. The Commission then sought
to determine the identities of the BSI customers who directed the trades.
When BSI declined to reveal its customers' identities, contending that such
disclosures would violate Swiss bank secrecy laws, the Commission obtained a U.S. court order compelling BSI to disclose its customers' identities.
On June 3, 1986, over four years after the Commission ascertained the
identity of the purchasers, the district court held that one of BSl's customers,
11

Giuseppe B. Tome, together with an Italian business associate, had engaged
in insider trading. The court ordered them to disgorge their insider trading
profits with interest. Tome, whose potential liability amounts to $5.8 million, was also held liable for the profits of his associate and certain still.
unknown investors who allegedly traded on his tips concerning the tender
offer.
In SEC v. Certain Unknown Purchasers of the Common Stock of, and Call
Options for the Common Stock of, Santa Fe International

Corporation,23 in-

itiated in October 1981, the Commission alleged that "unknown purchasers"
had unlawfully purchased the securities of Santa Fe International Corporation through Swiss bank accounts immediately prior to the announcement
of a merger. After filing the action against the unknown purchasers, the
Commission requested assistance under the 1977 Treaty on Mutual As.
sistance in Criminal Matters between the Swiss Confederation and the United States. The Commission received documents responsive to its request
three years after its original inquiry, following a prolonged process which
included a second request by the Commission and many appeals by the
defendants. During February 1986, all remaining defendants agreed to settle
the Commission's action and disgorge $7.8 mlllion in profits and interest.
Six of the eight defendants also consented to permanent injunctions against
future violations.
As the litigation in these cases progressed, Switzerland and the United
States entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in 1982. The
MOU mandated the establishment of a private agreement among all members of the Swiss Bankers' Association to provide assistance to the Commission in cases involving insider trading prior to tender offers or mergers.
Where certain criteria are met, the signatory banks may freeze profits from
the alleged unlawful trading and disclose the identity of a customer and
other information to the Commission without violating Swiss law. The Commission successfully used the MOU in the investigation preceding the filing of the Katz case described above.
Regulated Entities and Associated Persons- The enforcement program
area that accounts for the largest number of cases involves regulated entities such as broker-dealers, investment companies, investment advisers and
transfer agents. As the securities markets grow and more individuals come
into contact with the financial services industry, it becomes increasingly
important to ensure that regulated entities conduct their business with integrity and fairness. The Commission commenced
114 enforcement
proceedings involving regulated entities during fiscal year 1986. Nineteen
cases involved securities offering violations by regulated entities. Of the
other cases, 61 were brought against broker-dealers or persons associated
with broker-dealers, 30 primarily involved investment advisers, two primari1y involved investment companies, and two concerned transfer agents.
The broker-dealer cases involved, among other things, fraudulent sales
practices, violations of the net capital and customer reserve provisions, and
books and records violations. Among the cases brought by the Commission in this area was an administrative proceeding, In the Matter of Kidder
Peabody & Company,24 in which the Commission found that a broker-dealer
12

firm had wrongfully used customers' fully paid securities as collateral for
bank loans and government securities repurchase agreements. The Commission censured the firm, and ordered it to comply with its undertakings
to implement and maintain procedures designed to prevent a recurrence
of the violations.
In another administrative proceeding, In the Matter of Prudential Bache
Securities, Inc.,25 the Commission found that a broker-dealer had failed to
define adequately and implement firm-wide procedures for supervision and
compliance, thereby contributing to fraudulent sales practices by registered
representatives in two branch offices. As part of the settlement of the case,
the firm retained an independent consultant to review its supervisory and
compliance procedures and make recommendations to the firm. Separate
administrative proceedings were brought against individuals associated with
the firm.26
The Commission also brought an injunctive action against E. F. Hutton
Group, lnc., and two administrative proceedings against its broker-dealer
subsidlary.P ln the injunctive action, the Commission charged that annual
reports filed by the parent company were inaccurate because they failed
to disclose changes in net interest income resulting from bank overdrafting practices engaged in by the broker-dealer subsidiary. In one of the two
administrative proceedings, the Commission censured the firm and ordered
it to comply with its undertakings: (1) to engage an independent consultant to review its policies and procedures regarding customer securities and
money, (2) to adopt the recommendations of the consultant unless otherwise directed by the Commission, and (3) to refrain from opening any new
retail brokerage offices until the later of 120 days from the date of the Commission's Order or the date on which the consultant's recommendations
are adopted. In the second administrative proceeding, which addressed the
subsidiary's role as an investment adviser and distributor to registered investment companies, the Commission found that the firm had incorrectly
calculated distribution expenses and had failed to comply with dividend
calculation procedures set forth in its prospectus. The Commission ordered
the firm to pay the investment companies or their affected shareholders
$1 million, and to employ an independent consultant to review and make
recommendations relating to its administration and operation as an investment adviser.
In SEC v. The Spangler Group, Inc. and Mark Emerson Spangler, 28 the Commission alleged that, among other things, a Boston-based investment adviser made material misrepresentations
to prospective clients and the
Commission concerning his educational background and employment history, exaggerated his investment performance results, and forged an auditor's opinion regarding the financial condition of his company in order to
secure new clients. The Commission obtained a temporary restraining order
enjoining further antifraud violations and denying defendants access to
client funds and securities. Thereafter, orders were entered, by consent,
freezing all assets of the defendants, appointing a receiver to take control
.of and account for approximately $30 million of investors' funds, and per13

manently enjoining the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions
of the Investment Advisers Act. In an administrative proceeding based upon
the same facts,29 the Commission barred the individual from acting as, or
associating with, an investment adviser, brokerage firm, or investment company. The Commission revoked the registration of The Spangler Group.
During fiscal year 1986, the Commission revoked the registration of seven
firms, suspended eight and censured 15. This compares with three revocations, seven suspensions, and 16 censures in fiscal 1984.
Also during the year 58 individuals were barred, 20 suspended, and 11
censured, as compared to 47 bars, 49 suspensions, and four censures in
1985.
Securities Offering Violations-Some
issuers fail to register public offerings of their securities, although required to do so by the Securities Act.
Some purport to rely on exemptions to registration requirements which are
not available. Some violate antifraud provisions of the Federal securities
laws by making material misrepresentations
or omissions in connection
with a securities offering.
There were 69 cases principally involving offering violations by issuers
and other persons brought during fiscal year 1986, 49 in 1985 and 48 in
1984. (These figures do not include 19 cases principally involving offering
violations on the part of regulated entities, which are discussed above under the caption "Regulated Entities and Associated Persons.")
In one securities offering case, SEC v. Doerring & Associates, Inc.,30 the
Commission alleged that the defendants had misrepresented or failed to
disclose material facts ln the offer and sale of interests in real estate partnerships, and had misappropriated at least $3 million from such partnerships for their own use. The Commission obtained a temporary restraining
order against further violations of the registration and antifraud provisions,
and an order freezing approximately $10 million of investor's funds pending an appropriate judicial resolution.
The Commission made a special effort during fiscal year 1986 to curb
abuses arising from "blank check" offerings, in which an issuer raises funds
without identifying the type of business to which the proceeds of the offering will be applied. In some instances, undisclosed promoters may use such
offerings as a vehicle to raise funds for prearranged mergers and other pur.
poses. The Commission brought 21 administrative proceedings during flscal year 1986 to suspend the effectiveness of registration statements filed
in connection with blank check offerings.
Market Manipulation-The
Commission is charged with ensuring the integrity of trading on the national securities exchanges and in the over-thecounter markets. The Commission's staff, the exchanges and the NASD
engage in surveillance of these markets. The Commission brought 14 cases
involving market manipulation during fiscal year 1986, compared with
seven in 1985.
Among the cases brought by the Commission in this area was SEC v.
Worldwide Ventures COrp.,31 in which it alleged that the defendants had
manipulated the price of an issuer's common stock by issuing false statements about the issuer's financial condition and its business prospects, by
14

arranging transactions designed to artificially maintain or increase the price
of the stock, and by offering free stock to brokers as an inducement for
them to solicit customers to buy the issuer's stock. Allegedly as a result
of these activities, the price of the issuer's stock increased from 25 cents
per share to $3.50 per share, thereby allowing certain of the defendants
to sell their stock at a substantial profit.
Changes in Corporate Control-Sections
13 and 14 of the Exchange Act
govern proxy solicitations and the filing of reports by persons or groups
who make a tender offer or acquire beneficial ownership of more than five
percent of a class of equity securities registered with the Commission. These
requirements are intended to ensure that investors have the material information needed to make informed investment or voting decisions concerning potential changes in the control of a corporation. During fiscal year
1986, six enforcement actions were brought in this area, compared to five
in 1985 and 11 in 1984.
In one case, In the Matter of Revlon, Inc.,32 the Commission found that
a corporation which was the subject of a tender offer had failed to make
timely disclosure of negotiations to sell certain assets and to effect a leveraged buyout of the remaining assets. In another case, In the Matter of BF
Goodrich CO.,33 the Commission found that a proxy statement soliciting
shareholder approval of a provision designed to prevent "greenmail" payments was misleading in that it failed to disclose that the issuer had made
such a payment during the preceding year.
Other Developments
Transnational Securities Issues-As
noted above in the discussion of insider trading cases: the Commission's ability to detect and prosecute transnational securities violations has been enhanced by agreements reached
with Switzerland concerning assistance in such cases.
During fiscal year 1986, the Commission continued to discuss issues relating to transnational securities violations with officials of other governments.
On September 23, 1986, the Commission announced the signing of a
Memorandum of Understanding under which the Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the United Kingdom's Department of Trade and Industry established procedures governing assistance
in market oversight and investigations. This is the first accord negotiated
by the Commission which provides assistance for a broad range of matters
relating to market conduct and the regulation of investment and brokerage businesses. It is contemplated that the agreement will terminate upon
negotiation of a Treaty between the two countries.
On May 23, 1986, the Commission entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Japanese Ministry of Finance under which the parties
agreed to facilitate requests for surveillance and investigatory information
on a case-by-case-basis.
Members of the Commission and its staff participated in the July 1986
conference of the International Association of Securities Commissions, at
which 58 countries were represented. A significant result of the meeting
15

was the establishment of a committee, to be chaired by the Commission,
to promote greater cooperation in information exchanges concerning securities law enforcement.
Sources for Fwther Inquiry- The Commission publishes in the SEC Docket
litigation releases which describe its civil injunctive actions and criminal
proceedings involving securities. related violations. Among other things,
these releases report the identity of the defendants, the nature of the alleged violative conduct, and the disposition or status of the case. Commission orders that institute administrative proceedings or provide remedial
relief also are published in the SEC Docket.
Each of the enforcement actions brought during fiscal 1985 is listed in
the Appendix to this report. Appropriate references are made to the litigation releases and Commission orders published in the SEC Docket.

Full Disclosure System
Key 1986 Results
The full disclosure system is administered by the Division of Corporation Finance. The disclosure system is designed to provide investors with
full and accurate material information, foster investor confidence, contribute to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, facilitate capital formation, and inhibit fraud in the public trading, voting, purchase, and sale
of securities.

with other filings

In fiscal 1986, approximately 12,000 issuers made 76,708 full disclosure
filings with the Commission, an increase of 6.7 percent over fiscal 1985.
Of these, 1,688 were made by filers through the Edgar system. The number of registration statements filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) increased 29% to 7,356 from 5,696 filings in fiscal 1985. This
includes 2,181 and 1,587 filings, respectively, by issuers who had not previously offered securities to the public.
During the year, the staff fully reviewed financial statements of 3,818
different registrants. This included the review of 1,701 registration statements filed by new issuers, 1,340 registration statements filed by issuers
with existing public security holders, 236 registration statements relating
to mergers or acquisitions involving financial and business disclosures by
two or more companies (74 of which were filed by new issuers) and annual
reports of 1,741 issuers (17.1 percent of the reports filed). The staff also
fully reviewed annual meeting proxy statements of 1,629 issuers, 79 proxy

17

statements relating to going private transactions, 68 proxy contest filings
and 504 tender offer schedules.

Rulemaking
OperationalEdgar System- The Commission published for comment an
advance notice of proposed rulemaking on June 26, 1986 \0 assist it in
preparation of proposed rules for the operational Edgar system." The
release seeks comment on how to update the rules to take advantage of
the efficiencies of electronic filing and processing. It addresses several is.
sues including mandatory electronic filing, signatures, incorporation by
reference and exhibits.
Tender Offers-The Commission adopted amendments to its issuer and
third party tender offer rules on July 11, 1986.35 The amendments provide
that a tender offer must be open to all holders of the class of securities sub.
ject to the tender offer and that any security holder must be paid the highest
consideration paid to any other security holder during the tender offer. In
addition, the Commission amended existing rules concerning minimum
offering periods and withdrawal rights. A tender offer is now required to
remain open for at least ten business days upon the announcement of an
increase or decrease in the percentage of securities being sought or the
consideration offered. The amendments provide that withdrawal rights extend throughout the offering period and eliminate the extension of withdrawal rights upon commencement of a competing bid.
On July 31, 1986, the Commission issued a concept release relating to
corporate takeovers." seeking public comment on the effects of substantial acquisitions of securities effected during the pendency of, or immediately after the termination of, a tender offer and whether a regulatory
response is appropriate; establishing a security holder approval requirement
for the adoption of "poison pill" plans; and permitting issuers to "opt-out"
of the requirements imposed by tender offer rules through the adoption
of charter amendments by security holders. The Commission is reviewing
comments made in response to this release with a view to possible rulernaking or legislative proposals.
Shareholder Communications-On October 15, 1985, the Commission
amended its shareholder communications rules, which govern the process
by which registrants communicate with the beneficial owners of securities
registered in the name of a broker, dealer, or other nomineeY The amendments provide, among other things, that a registrant that wishes to obtain
a list of the beneficial owners of its securities must request information from
all brokers with customers who are beneficial owners; a broker must provide a list of non-objecting beneficial owners to registrants as often as they
request the information, rather than only once a year, and within five business days of the compilation date; a registrant may mail its annual report
directly to security holders if it notifies the broker at the time it requests
beneficial owner information; and a broker may employ an intermediary
to act as its designated agent in performing its shareholder communications obligations.
18

The Commission published for comment on May 29, 1986 proposals intended to implement provisions of the recently enacted Shareholder Communications
Act of 1985.36 These proposals
were adopted
with
modifications on November 25, 1986. The proposals govern cornrnunications and proxy processing with respect to securities registered in the name
of a bank, association, or other entity that exercises fiduciary powers as
well as clarify the circumstances in which registrants need not deliver annual report and proxy or information statements to security holders. In addition, the Commission will consider in the near future, proposed
amendments concerning owners who purchased securities through an employee benefit plan.
Filing Fees-On January 9, 1986, the Commission amended the rules setting filing fees for certain Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)
acquisition and business combination transactlons." The amendments follow legislation that requires payment to the Commission of a filing fee calculated on a percentage of the transaction's value for tender offers and proxy
and information statements involving an acquisition, merger, consolidation, sale or other disposition of substantially all the assets of a company.
Pricing Amendments-On
October 27, 1986, the Commission published
for comment proposals intended to allow registrants, under specified conditions, to omit information on the public offering price, other matters dependent upon the public offering price, and the underwriting syndicate from
the form of prospectus filed as part of a registration statement that is
declared effective.v' The proposals would require that the omitted information be contained in the form of prospectus used in connection with the
public offering after the effective date of the registration statement. The
proposals also would amend the filing rules for prospectuses used after effectiveness to eliminate unnecessary filings, classify prospectuses according to the nature of the information being added or modified, and shorten
the filing period.
Classification of Issuers-On July 8, 1986, the Commission increased the
total asset threshold requirement for registration under the Exchange Act
from $3 million to $5 million. Corresponding changes also were made to
the Exchange Act rules governing termination of reporting requirements."
The Commission also requested public comment about other criteria to
govern application of the Exchange Act reporting systern.v
Filings for Exempt Private Offerings- On October 2, 1986, the Commission adopted revisions (proposed on June 5, 1986) to Form 0, the notice
required to be filed when a transaction is effectuated in reliance upon the
exemptions from the Securities Act registration requirements provided by
Section 4(6) or Regulation 0.43 The revisions permit a uniform filing format to satisfy both federal and state requirements and eliminate the requirement to provide certain statistical information about the issuer. In addition,
the revisions eliminate the six-month updating and final filing requirements
so that only an initial filing within 15 days of the first sale of securities is
necessary.v'

The Proxy Review Program-On November 4, 1986, the Commission de.
termined to adopt comprehensive proxy rule amendments. The amend.
19

ments bring to the proxy context the benefits of the integrated disclosure
system, simplify proxy disclosure concerning compensation plans, and require new registrants to provide disclosure concerning changes in accountants and related disagreements.
Interpretations
On September 23, 1986, the Commission issued an interpretive release
indicating that domestic branches and agencies of foreign banks will be
treated as "banks" for purposes of the Section 3(a)(2) exemption from the
Securities Act registration requirements. This interpretation is dependent,
in each case, on the existence of Federal and/or State banking regulation
of the branch or agency substantially equivalent to that applicable to Federal or State chartered domestic banks doing business in the same jurisdiction.
Conferences
SEC Govemment-Business
Forum on Small Business Capital FormationThe fifth annual SEC Government-Business Forum on Small Business capital formation was held in Washington, D.C. on September 25-27, 1986.
Approximately 175 small business executives, accountants, attorneys, and
government officials met to devise methods to implement recommendations of previous Forums and the 1986 White House Conference on Small
Business and to discuss securities, financial services, liability insurance,
payroll costs, and ERISA issues.
SECINASAA
Conference under Section 19(c) of the Securities Act of
1933-ln March 1986, approximately 35 senior staff officials of the Commission met with representatives of the North American Securities Administrators Association Inc, in Washington, D.C. to discuss methods of
effectuating greater uniformity in Federal-State securities matters.
Accounting and Auditing Matters
The Federal securities laws provide for the audit of financial statements
of publicly held corporations by independent accountants. Thus, those laws
have placed upon the accountant important responsibilities in facilitating
the capital formation process, and as a result, the economy as a whole.
Today, the accounting profession is subject to a unique combination of
public and private sector efforts designed to ensure that the profession
meets its public responsibilities. These efforts include peer review and other
membership requirements of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA)Division for CPA Firms, private sector standards-setting,
the Commission's programs (including oversight of private sector initiatives), state licensing activities and private civil litigation against accounting firms. This framework has been built over time and is subject to
continued refinements and improvements.
The primary Commission programs for ensuring compliance with the accounting and financial disclosure aspects of Federal securities laws are:
20

• Rulemaking initiatives which supplement accounting standards, irnple-

ment financial disclosures and establish independence criteria for accountants;
• The review and comment process which results in improvement of fiI.
ings, identification of emerging accounting issues (which can result in
rulemaking or private sector standards-setting), and identification of
problems warranting enforcement actions;
• The enforcement program, which imposes legal sanctions and serves
to deter irregularities by enhancing the care with which registrants and
their accountants analyze accounting issues; and
• Oversight of private sector efforts to establish accounting and audit.
ing standards and to improve the quality of audit practice.
The Commission's direct efforts are multiplied by initiatives of the Finan.
cial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the AICPA and other activities
of the profession under Commission oversight. In addition to Commission
enforcement actions, significant numbers of actions are brought by private
litigants, many of which are a direct result of Commission actions.
The cumulative effect of the Commission's programs, private sector in.
itiatives and civil litigation comprises a comprehensive system under which
the integrity of financial reporting for public companies is constantly be.
ing challenged, modified and improved.
The Commission's review and comment process and enforcement programs are discussed elsewhere in this report. The remainder of this section summarizes
the Commission's
accounting-related
rules and
interpretations and the oversight function.
Accounting-Related

Rules and Interpretations

Regulation SoX provides guidance as to the form and content of financial statements filed with the Commission. The Commission has also adopted various rules that specify disclosure of financial information outside of
the financial statements. For example, certain supplementary financial information, selected financial data and a management's discussion and anal.
ysis of the company's financial condition and results of operations are
required by Regulation S-K.
To address significant accounting issues, the Commission may issue interpretive releases and, when announcing rule changes, provide guidance
for compliance with new or amended rules. In addition, the Commission
staff periodically issues Staff Accounting Bulletins (SABs) to inform the
financial community of its views on accounting and disclosure issues. For
example, in December 1985, a SAB was issued on accounting for and disclosure of financial guarantees.45 In December 1985 and June 1986, SABs
were issued on two issues relating to business combinations of financial
institutions. The first of these concerned goodwill amortizatlon;" and the
second, adjustment of loan loss allowances.v ln July 1986, a SAB was issued on discounting property-casualty insurance reserves." The staffs views
on accounting for research and development arrangements were published
in September 1986.49 An omnibus SAB covering several issues was issued
21

in early October. It discussed certain issues relating to preferred stock, cheap
stock, and the applicability of SABs.50
Recent rulemaking initiatives reflect the Commission's efforts to upgrade
financial and accounting disclosure and, at the same time, simplify that
disclosure. During the past year, the Commission finalized amendments
to Regulation SoX(a) to rescind obsolete or duplicative rules, 51(b) to clarify rules dealing with the presentation of consolidated financial statements
in Commission filings,52 and (c) to require, under certain circumstances,
disclosure of the nature and extent of a registrant's repurchase and reverse
repurchase transactions and the associated degree of risk. 53The Commission also published its views on the significance of certain oral guarantees
to the financial reporting process.>'
Oversight of Private Sector Standards-Setting
In addition to its direct action through rulemaking and other programs,
the Commission monitors the structure, activity, and decisions of the private sector standards-setting
organizations.
FASB-Although the Commission has adopted Regulation SoX, promulgated other rules and disclosure requirements in the financial reporting area,
and has published interpretations and guidance where necessary, it has
generally refrained from prescribing the accounting methods to be followed
in the preparation of financial statements.
In lieu of specifying accounting principles, the Commission has presumed
financial statements to be misleading or inaccurate unless prepared in accordance with accounting principles which have substantial authoatatlve
support. Under this concept, the Commission looks to the FASB to provide the initiative in establishing and improving accounting principles. Oversight of the process involves not only Commission review of the standards
set, but also the direct participation of staff members and, in some instances,
the Commission itself in the initial setting of standards. Staff members monitor developments closely and are in frequent contact with the FASB, participate in meetings, public hearings, and task forces. The Commission
monitors the progress of FASB projects and meets periodically with the
FASB to discuss topical issues.
For example, the Commission believes that there are broad-based accounting measurement and recognition issues involved in the complex
financial instruments and fihancial transactions available in the marketplace. In fiscal 1985, recognizing that these issues affect SEC registrants
as well as other entities (including publicly held banks and savings and loans
that report to other government agencies), the Commission authorized the
Chief Accountant to send a letter to the FASB recommending that the FASB
add a project to its agenda to deal with the accounting issues involved in
the broad area of financial assets and transactions.
In fiscal 1986, the FASB added a major long-term project to its agenda
that will address financial instruments and off balance sheet financing
issues. The project is comprised of several parts, some of which will be de22

veloped simultaneously.
Significant parts of the project include (a) disclosure about financial assets and transactions,
(b) accounting
for
risk-transfer instruments such as guarantees and interest rate hedging instruments, (c) off balance sheet financing arrangements, (d) the appropriate measurement basis for financial instruments, and (e) accounting for
securities with both debt and equity characteristics.
Pensions-In December 1985, the FASS issued two statements dealing
with the complex and controversial topic of pensions. 55 The first statement
addresses the accounting and disclosure for pension plans by employers.
The second statement dictates how gains and LOsses should be recognized
upon termination of certain pension plans.
Cash Flow Reporting-In July 1986, the FASS issued a proposed statement which would require a statement of cash flows as part of a full set
of financial statements of all business enterprises, replacing the statement
of changes in financial position. A final statement is expected to be issued
in 1987.56
Income Taxes-In September 1986, a proposed statement on accounting for income taxes was issued by the FASS, which requires comprehensive inter-period tax allocation based on a liability approach. Public hearings
and a final statement are scheduled for 1987.57 The Commission also issued an interpretive release related to the proposed statement immediately after the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was enacted. The release specifies that
registrants may provide quantified disclosure of the impact of the tax legislation by pro forma application of the FASS's proposed statement. Further, the release indicates that registrants not providing quantified
disclosures should nonetheless discuss the impact of the Tax Reform Act
of 1986 on existing deferred tax amounts. All registrants should disclose
the potential effects of the tax legislation on future operations and liquidity, if material. 58
Financial Reporting and Changing Prices-In September 1986, the FASS
issued an exposure draft that would supersede earlier pronouncements
on
reporting the effects of changing prices, making previously required disclosure voluntary. A final statement was issued before the end of calendar
1986. The specific disclosure previously required is voluntary for calendar
1986 annual reports, but general disclosure on the effects of inflation is
still required in Management's Discussion and Analysis pursuant to Regulation S_K.59
Other Projects-Other significant projects on the FASS's technical agenda
include accounting for investments in subsidiary and non-subsidiary entities, nonrefundable loan fees, stock compensation plans, and accounting
for the insurance and utility industries.
Timely Financial Reporting Guidance-Encouraged
by the Commission,
the FASS has continued its efforts to provide more timely gUidance on
emerging issues. Several technical bulletins were issued in fiscal year 1986
by the FASS staff on specific issues. These included guidance on accounting for (a) leases.s" (b) purchase of life insurance;" (c) certain issues related to business cornblnattons." and (d) purchase of treasury shares in excess
23

of current market price (qreenmail)." Also, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(in which the Commission's Chief Accountant plays a significant role) has
discussed over 115 issues since its inception in 1984, covering a range of
specific issues on topics such as financial instruments and financial institutions, business combinations, and income taxes. A number of the issues
were introduced by or at the request of the SEC. On many issues, the group
reached a consensus that (a) a single method of accounting is called for
based on existing literature, (b) existing guidance is adequate, or (c) the
issue does not present a pervasive problem. Other issues have been referred
to the FASB or the AICPA for action or further consideration. The Commission expects the positions agreed upon at those meetings to be followed
by registrants; registrants that do not follow them will be asked to justify
departure from any consensus reached. Based on the work of the EITF in
the first two years, the Commission believes that the EITF is performing
a useful role in providing timely guidance to registrants and their accountants.
Oversight of the Accounting

Profession's Initiatives

In addition to oversight of the private sector process for setting accounting standards, the Commission also oversees various activities of the accounting profession conducted primarily through the AICPA. These include
the Auditing Standards Board, which establishes generally accepted auditing standards; the Accounting Standards Executive Committee, which provides guidance on specific industry practices and prepares issues papers
on accounting topics for consideration by the FASB; and the SEC Practice
Section (SECPS) of the Division for CPA Firms, which seeks to improve
the quality of accounting firms through various membership requirements
including peer review.
The Auditing Standards Board has made progress in fiscal year 1986 on
a number of initiatives to improve the quality of independent audits. For
example, an auditing standard on reports on the application of accounting
principles was issued in July 1986, in response to concerns about "opinion
shopping."64 Other standards-setting projects, including projects relating
to auditor responsibilities for detection and reporting of fraud and evaluation and reporting on internal controls are progressing in development.
The AICPA, along with other organizations, sponsored the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting ("NCFFR"), which is an independent commission to study issues involved in the prevention and detection
of fraud in the context of financial reporting. The NCFFR expects to complete its work and issue a report in fiscal 1987.
In addition to the AICPA's initiatives, members of the accounting profession have developed proposals designed to improve the quality of independent audits. A position paper by Price Waterhouse ("PW") recommended
modified standards which would require an auditor (a) to review and evaluate a company's management controls, and (b) to identify circumstances
indicating a higher risk of management fraud and to perform additional

24

tests if necessary." PW further recommended formation of a statutory selfregulatory organization with mandatory membership for firms practicing
before the SEC, and a variety of initiatives to limit accountants' liability.
A second position paper by seven major accounting firms recommended,
among other things, (a) increased disclosure in SEC filings of risks and uncertainties and that such disclosure be audited. and (b) mandatory memo
bership in the SECPS for firms practicing before the SEC. 66
The Commission reviewed the merits of the initiatives described above,
as well as a bill introduced in Congress entitled, "The Financial Fraud De.
tection and Disclosure Act of 1986." In addition, the Commission held a
Roundtable to discuss these issues with representatives from academia, industry, the accounting profession and others. The Commission believes that
the results of the ASB and NCFFR projects should provide valuable insight
into the need for and nature of changes in the fraud detection and internal
control areas.
SEC Practice Section- The Commission oversees the activities of the
SECPS through frequent contact with the Public Oversight Board (POB)
and members of the executive and peer review committees of the SECPS.
In addition, the staff reviews POB files and selected working papers of the
peer reviewers. The Commission believes the peer review process contrlbutes significantly to improving the quality control systems of member firms
and thus should enhance the consistency and quality of practice before the
Commission. According to the POB's Annual Report as of June 30, 1986.
391 firms have voluntarily become members of the SECPS, including all
firms with 30 or more SEC reporting clients."?
In the past year, several professional groups have called for mandatory
peer review, or mandatory membership in an organization conducting peer
reviews, for auditors of all Commission registrants. As discussed above,
both Price Waterhouse and a group of seven major accounting firms issued
proposals in this area. In addition, a special committee of the AICPA reexamined the AICPA Code of Ethics and concluded that the accounting
profession should establish a mandatory program to monitor practice to
improve quality.t" Adoption of the Committee recommendation would effectively require that accounting firms which practice before the SEC (and
whose members belong to the AICPA) be members of the SECPS. The Commission is considering the feasibility of various methods of requiring peer
review for firms with SEC clients.
Other refinements have been made in 1986 to the SECPS and the peer
review process. Each SECPS member firm is required to adopt a Statement
of Philosophy covering the broad principles influencing the firm's quality
control and operating procedures. Each member firm must also establish
policies and procedures concerning the rendering of opinions on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to other than audit
clients. Compliance with the new requirements will be tested during peer
reviews. Peer reviewers will be required to refer in their peer review report
to a letter of comment, if such a letter is issued. A letter of comment contains a description of matters leading to a modified report and other recommendations on matters which were not so serious as to require a modified

25

peer review report. The Commission strongly encourages continuing refine.
ments in the program and its staff wiII continue to suggest modifications
where appropriate.
Special Investigations Committee- Activities of the Special Investigations
Committee (SIC) supplement peer review. The SIC determines whether allegations of failure in the conduct of an audit indicate need for improvements in, or compliance with, quality control systems of the reporting firms
and whether changes in professional standards are required. If specific members of the firm's professional staff may have failed to follow established
policies and procedures, the SIC considers whether corrective action taken
by the firm is appropriate.
The POB monitors the activities of the SIC and has complete access to
the process and to SIC files. In its June 3D, 1986 Annual Report, the POB
concluded that the SIC is achieving its objectives by effectively complementing the peer review process and improving the quality of professional practice and literature."
During the past year, the SECPS has established procedures for limited
SEC access to certain information about the SIC's process to enable the
SEC to more effectively oversee this aspect of the profession's program.
After experimenting with this arrangement, the Commission staff concluded
that certain changes were necessary in order to achieve its oversight objective. In fiscal year 1986, the SIC conducted a review of its processes,
and a Task Force is considering refinements to the current process including (a) establishing specific guidelines to determine when a special peer
review of a firm will be performed, (b) further expanding the circumstances
in which member firms report cases to the SIC, and (c) making the results
of SIC inquiries available to subsequent peer review teams. During a meeting with the POB in July 1986, the Commission was informed that the
SECPS is also considering requiring additional steps to be taken in an SIC
inquiry. Recommendations
in this regard are expected to be formulated
by early 1987.
The Commission is encouraged by the continuing efforts to improve the
SIC process. The ultimate test, however, is the extent to which the SECPS
is able to achieve sufficient public credibility in this area.

The Edgar Project
Introduction
The Commission's electronic disclosure system, Edgar, completed its second full year of pilot operations on September 24, 1986. When fully operational, Edgar will accelerate
dramatically
the filing, processing,
dissemination and analysis of time-sensitive corporate information filed with
the Commission. The primary purpose of Edgar is to increase the efficiency
and fairness of the securities markets for the benefit of investors, corporations and the economy. Under Edgar, as information is electronically filed
with the Commission, it will be accessible to investors, the media and others
on personal and business computer screens in minutes, instead of days and
weeks.
The pilot system has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of electronic filing. Over 15,000 electronic filings have been made and the Com.
mission is moving forward with a fully operational system.

Pilot System
The Pilot system began with a group of volunteer companies whose filings are processed by the Division of Corporation Finance. At the end of
fiscal 1986, 237 such companies (plus 135 investment companies) were
filing electronically. These filers range from major industrial companies to
those which made their initial public offerings on the system. While additional Pilot participation has been Iimifed as of August 31, 1986, other com.
panies may continue to take advantage of the test facilities of the Pilot
system.
During the year, filings processed by the Division of Investment Management were included in the Pilot system. In addition to filings made by 21
companies under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which
were included in the Pilot in 1985, a volunteer group of 135 investment
companies in seven management investment company complexes and four
unit investment trust complexes with 16 registered investment companies
and over 1,500 individual series, began to file electronically. Further, all
management investment companies were invited to submit their semi.
annual reports on Form N-SAR electronically. To facilitate electronic flling of Form N-SAR, each complex was sent software on a pre-programmed
diskette which automatically prepares and formats the tagged answer sheet
for filing with Edgar. Four hundred forty-one companies have taken advantage of the opportunity to submit this form electronically.
In fiscal 1986, the major developmental work on the Pilot Edgar
system was completed. Enhancements were added to the system to make
electronic filing more convenient for filers and to test the potential for
productivity improvements in the operational system. These enhancements
27

included automatic notification to filers by electronic mail of acceptance
or rejection of filings and the ability to accept and process tender offer and
contested proxy material. Further, the utility of the intelligent workstations
used to examine filings was improved in several ways: (1) certain portions
of the selective review screening sheet are completed automatically; (2) examiners may request that a notification message automatically appears in
the workstation in-box when certain events occur; and (3) improvements
in the menu-driven software for the workstations reduce the time needed
to select and use various functions.
Further, an approach to data tagging is being tested. A voluntary schedule is being filed by participants whose filings are processed by the Division of Corporation Finance. The schedule uses a specified format and
standard captions to identify data for ratio calculation. Edgar performs the
calculations automatically at the time of filing acceptance. Initial results
have been encouraging.
Operational System
During the past year, significant progress was made toward the operational Edgar system. A revised Request for Proposals ("RFP") was issued
on May 6, 1986 with bids due and the contract to be awarded in 1987. Issuance of the RFP followed extensive comment from potential bidders, information vendors, users and filers. The RFP issued for the operational system
includes changes made in the system as a result of the comments. It reflects
an effort to balance, within legal requirements and budgetary contraints,
the needs of the Commission, the filing community, the contractor, and
users of Commission information. The RFP requires the contractor to support the following functions: receipt, internal processing, dissemination of
filings, systems development, facilities management, backup and recovery, training, security, and links to existing Commission automated systems.
The RFP requests that offerors propose phase-in schedules for both the
Divisions of Corporation Finance and Investment Management by criteria
such as company size, industry or dissemination market interest. The phase.
in schedule will be determined by the Commission after consultation with
the contractor and after notice and comment in a rulemaking proceeding.
One of the objectives of Edgar is one-stop filing for issuers of new and
public companies so that one filing on Edgar will meet the requirements
of the states and self-regulatory organizations. To this end, the staff has
worked closely with the North American Securities Administrators Associ.
atlon, the stock exchanges and the National Association of Securities Deal.
ers, The RFP recognizes the needs of the states and the self-regulatory
organizations.
Paralleling the procurement effort, steps have been taken with respect
to the rulemaking necessary for the operational system. The Divisions of
Corporation Finance and Investment Management formed task forces to
conduct a comprehensive review of existing rules and to develop proposed
rules for the operational system.

On June 26, 1986, the Commission issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaklnq.?" It sought comment on the rule changes necessary to
require electronic filing and to facilitate electronic filing by updating the
rules to take advantage of the efficiencies of electronic filing and processing by filers, as well as by the Commission. Specific areas discussed in the
release include mandatory electronic filing, signatures, exhibits, and amendments and supplements to filings.
Conclusion
In the coming year, work on the operational system will include evaluation of proposals, award of a contract, proposal and adoption of rules and
planning for the transition.

In fiscal 1986 the Commission's secondary market internationalization
program made significant progress. The Commission explored issues of
concern with securities markets and market participants, facilitated the development of international linkages between securities markets and clear30

ing agencies, and ensured that such linkages incorporate adequate market
surveillance and information sharing arrangements.
During the fiscal year, the Commission approved several new options
products, a new uniform margin system, and a simplified, more understandable, options disclosure document. The Commission also held a Roundtable on Index Arbitrage trading to develop a better understanding of the
benefits gained from stock index products in reducing costs to investors
and the price volatility occurring four times during the year when both options and futures expire on the same day.
Progress was made toward a certificate reduced trading environment, by
increased reliance on book-entry systems. As a result of efforts this year,
forty-six states now allow domiciliary insurance companies to use securities depositories.
In the inspection area, the Commission improved its productivity in the
broker-dealer regulatory program through the development of specialized
computer programs. These systems also monitor referrals to SROs pertaining to broker-dealer performance.
Securities Markets,

Facilities and Trading

The National Market System-Rule
11Aa2 -1 under the Exchange Act reo
quires that transactions in national market system (NMS) securities be
reported on a real-time basis, increasing market efficiency and improving
execution of orders. Over 2500 over-the-counter (OTC) securities now are
designated as NMS securities, 400 more than last year.
The Commission took action on several important NMS initiatives. It
adopted temporary amendments to Rules 10a-1 and 31.1 under the Ex.
change Act, the short sale and transaction fee rules, respectively, to ex.
c1ude from coverage all NMS securities traded on an exchange on a listed
or unlisted trading privileges basis.t'The Commission also approved an au.
tomated interface between the Cincinnati Stock Exchange's National Securities Trading System and the Intermarket Trading System."
The Commission also continued to study automation in the OTC market. The Division of Market Regulation issued two no-action positions con.
cerning regulation of automated OTC trading systems, informing system
developers that the Division would not recommend enforcement action if
such systems were not registered as exchanges.P'The Commission also
directed the Division of Market Regulation to consider new regulatory approaches for such systems.
National System for the Clearance and Settlement of Securities Trans.
actions- The Commission approved a proposed rule change by the National
Securities Clearing Corporation ("NSCC") that established an automated
system for the processing of customer account transfers.?" and approved
proposed rule changes by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board that require members to use this system.?" The
Commission also approved a proposed rule change by the Midwest Securities Trust Company for a pilot program that established a centralized, au31

c.

tomated system for the processing of transactions in commercial paper. 76
The Commission also approved, on a pilot basis, a proposed rule change
by NSCC that established centralized and automated processing of mutual
fund securities sold by broker/dealers."
Securities Immobilization-In fiscal year 1986, the Commission continued
to make progress in its efforts to increase the immobilization of securities
in securities depositories. For example, several states removed restrictions
on depository use by domiciliary insurance companies for their portfolio
assets. Forty-six states now allow domiciliary insurance companies to use
depositories. Also during the fiscal year, issuers, transfer agents, brokerdealers and clearing agencies, through several task forces, continued their
cooperative efforts to identify ways to increase the immobilization of securities certificates and to experiment with uncertificated book-entry systems.
In fact, year-long efforts of one task force, which consists of major investment banking firms, were rewarded in early October 1986, when Ford Motor Credit Corporation became the first "book-entry only" corporate debt
issuer by issuing $200 million of three-year notes in "global certificate form"
through Depository Trust Company.
Intemationalization- The Commission's secondary market internationalization program made significant progress during fiscal year 1986. As part
of its ongoing efforts to foster a dialogue on the issues raised by the increased transnational trading of securities, the Commission released a staff
summary of the comments received in response to the Global Trading
Release." In addition, the Commission worked to facilitate the development
of international linkages between securities markets and clearing agencies,
and to ensure that such linkages incorporate adequate market surveillance
and information sharing arrangements.
During the fiscal year, the Commission approved the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.London Stock Exchange quotation sharing pilot program, the first market
linkage between a U.S. self-regulatory organization and an exchange not
located in North America. 79The Commission also approved an international
trading linkage between the Midwest and Toronto Stock Exchanges, the
third such linkage involving U.S. and Canadian markets.s'To facilitate trading in the securities included in these linkages, the Commission staff issued no-action letters to the Canadian Depository for Securities, Limited
("CDS") and The Stock Exchange, London, England, permitting them to
establish automated securities processing links with their U.S. counterparts
without registering as clearing agencies in the United States."
The Commission has continued to improve its ability to expose and prosecute those who would abuse the integrity of international securities markets. During the fiscal year, the Commission and the Japanese Ministry of
Finance agreed to facilitate each agency's respective requests for surveillance and investigatory information on a case-by-case basis. 821naddition,
the Commission entered into a memorandum of understanding with the
United Kingdom's Department of Trade and Industry regarding the sharing of information.

32

The Commission also approved a proposed rule change that enables certain Canadian banks and trust companies to qualify as escrow receipt issuers thereby enabling Canadian writers of equity call options to cover their
positions at local financial institutions, and not through U.S. financial institutions as previously requlred.s-Another
rule change amended a clearing agency's rules to clarify that all securities deliveries, pledges and
transfers through its facilities are governed by the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code. including key provisions that were recently amended to
recognize the validity of book-entry movements of securities held in fungi.
ble bulk at a foreign clearing corporation.s" The Commission also received
a Form CA-l application for clearing agency registration from the International Securities Clearing Corporation."
Options-During
fiscal 1986, the Commission amended Rule 9B-l
under the Exchange Act which provides for the distribution to investors
of an options disclosure document." The amendment eliminated the requirement that the disclosure document contain information regarding the
uses of the options classes discussed by the document. The Commission
also adopted an amendment to Rule 3a 12-8 under the Exchange Act that
exempted Japanese government debt securities from the Exchange Act for
purposes of marketing futures contracts on those securities in the United
States." In addition. the Commission issued a release proposing amendments to the Rule exempting United Kingdom, Canadian, and Japanese
government debt securities from the Exchange Act for purposes of allowing the trading and marketing in the U.S. of futures contracts on such securities by boards of trade which are not located in the country which issued
such securitles.P" In addition, the Commission approved proposals by the
Chicago Board Options Exchange ("CBOE") and the American Stock Exchange ("Amex"), respectively, to implement CBOE's retail automatic execution system ("RAES") for options on the Standard and Poor's 100, and
Arnex's automatic execution system ("AUTO.EX") for options on the Major
Market Index, on a permanent basis.59 In addition, the Commission approved
CBOE's proposal to begin a six month pilot using RAES for the execution
of individual equity options.P'' Moreover, the Commission approved
proposals submitted by the New York Stock Exchange and Arnex, respectively, to trade two new broad-based index options, NYSE's BETA Index,
and Arnex's Institutional lndex.?' Further, the Commission approved a
proposal by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. ("Phlx") to trade options
on the European Currency Unit ("ECU").92 The ECU represents the weighted value of the currencies of ten of the member states of the European Economic Community. In addition, the Commission approved CBOE's proposal
to trade European-style options on five foreign currencles.P Finally, the
Commission also approved proposals submitted by the five options exchanges as well as the NASD to establish a uniform, premium-based customer margin system for short options positions, which became effective
on January 31, 1986.94
In fiscal 1986, the Commission also focused on the impact on the
market of certain arbitrage and related trading strategies involving index

33

options and futures and the underlying component stocks on the last trading day before expiration (the so-called "Expiration Friday" phenomenon).
In October 1985, the Division of Market Regulation sent a letter to the options SROs soliciting their views and comments on various alternatives to
address Expiration Friday ectlvlty.v' In response, the SROs commissioned
a study of the expiration day effects of index options and futures trading
on the market. 96The study found that both stock market volatility and trading volume is significantly greater on Expiration Fridays than on other days.
Nevertheless, it concluded that the magnitude and frequency of expiration
day price effects did not warrant any structural changes to expiration day
procedures in view of the important hedging uses for index futures and options and the fact that arbitrage activity maintains the essential pricing linkages necessary to facilitate such hedging.
The Commission also responded to a letter from Congressman Dingell
requesting the Commission's views on issues related to program and arbitrage trading and its effects on options, futures and stock markets. 97The
Commission's response analyzed the costs and benefits of several alternative procedures that have been suggested to address the concerns in this
area. In a continuing effort to address Expiration Friday concerns, the Commission held a Roundtable discussion on index arbitrage and its effects on
the marketplace.w Finally, at the Commission's request, the New York Stock
Exchange experimented with the disclosure of 50-called "Market-on-Close"
orders at 3:30 p.m. on the September 19, 1986, Expiration Friday'"
Issuer Tender Offers-On
july 11, 1986, the Commission published a
release adopting amendments to Exchange Act Rule 13e-4.100 Rule 13e-4
regulates tender offers and exchange offers by issuers for their own securities. The amendments, which parallel the requirements of Rule 14d-l0 for
third party tender offers, require that an issuer tender offer must be extended
to all holders of the subject securities and that all security holders must
be paid the highest consideration paid to any other security holder during
the tender offer. The amendments also extend withdrawal rights throughout the offer, and require the offer to remain open for ten business days
from an increase or decrease in the percentage of shares sought or consideration offered.
Regulation of Brokers, Dealers, Municipal Securities
and Transfer Agents

Dealers,

Broker-Dealer and Transfer Agent ExaminationsDuring fiscal year 1986,
the Commission improved productivity through the increased use of computers in its broker-dealer regulatory programs. Systems to monitor referrals to the SROs as well as to maintain accurate profiles of broker-dealers
located in various regions of the country have been developed. In addition,
a pilot test begun in fiscal year 1985 to analyze the feasibility of using portable computers to conduct broker-dealer examinations was completed, and
indicated that use of such computers can improve examiner productivity.

34

The broker-dealer oversight program was revised in order to place greater
emphasis on review of sales practices at large national firms. These examinations included on-site reviews at both the headquarters and a number
of branch offices of the chosen firms. In addition, continued concern that
organized crime figures or others might attempt to launder funds through
broker-dealers has led both SEC and SRO staff to spend more examiner
hours on that phase of the examination and to revise the Commission's related examination procedures.
The staff completed 481 oversight examinations of SRO members, an
8 % increase over the record 447 examinations completed in FY 1985. The
staff also completed 69 cause examinations, a decrease from the 145 conducted last fiscal year and 228 in FY 1984. The continued decrease in the
number of cause examinations resulted from increased referrals to SROs
of matters for which they have adequate remedies.
The staff also conducted 102 transfer agent examinations. These examinations were conducted following guidelines set by the staff which are
designed to improve examination selection and to followup on deficiencies noted in prior examinations.
Rule 10b-6 and Shelf Distributions-On
September 11, 1986, the Commission issued an interpretive release with respect to shelf distributions and
Exchange Act Rule 10b-6, which proscribes certain conduct by participants
in a distribution of securities. tOt Until recently, the staff had interpreted Rule
10b-6 in the context of shelf distributions to require every distribution participant, including every shelf shareholder, to comply with the applicable
cooling-off period prior to any offers or sales off the shelf by any shelf share.
holder. The interpretive release formulates a revised position, which is briefly that, unless an individual shelf shareholder is affiliated with the issuer
or another shelf shareholder or is acting in concert with the Issuer or-another
shelf shareholder, the restrictions of Rule 10b.6 with respect to the individual
shelf shareholder apply only when the individual shelf shareholder is offering or selling shares off the shelf. The release also discusses the application of Rule 10b-6 to broker-dealers during such distributions.
Rule 1Ob-6 Amendments-On
October 22, 1985, the Commission issued
a release soliciting comments on proposed amendments to Rule 10b-6. If
adopted, the amendments would permit broker-dealers to engage in solicited brokerage up until specified cooling-off periods; define Rule 1Ob-6's applicability to distribution participants; modify Rule 10b-6's restrictions on
exercise of standardized call options; and revise Rule 10b-6's preamble.I'"
Financial Responsibility Rules-On
September 4, 1986 the Commission
issued a release soliciting comments on some proposed amendments to
the Commission's flnancial responsibility and recordkeeping rules in connection with the treatment of repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements entered into by registered
broker-dealers.l'"
The proposed
amendments to the rules are intended to ensure accountability of monies
and securities obtained through repurchase agreements and to place a cap
on the leverage now available to firms participating in the repurchase agreement market. With respect to hold-in-custody repurchase aqreements'P' the
35

proposed amendments will further the purposes of the Commission's financial responsibility rules, which are to provide safeguards with respect to
the financial responsibility and related practices of brokers and dealers.
Uniform Net Capital Rule-On November 14, 1986 the Commission approved amendments to the net-capital rule, Rule 15c3-1, which: (l) recognize hedged positions between non-convertible corporate investment grade
fixed income securities; (2) recognize hedged positions between nonconvertible fixed income securities and U.S. Government bond futures; and
(3) reduce the haircut for hedged corporate bond positions. lOS
Interpretations of the Net Capital Rule-On February 14, 1986 the Division issued a no-action letter to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in which
it acknowledged the risk-reducing features of maintaining offsetting positions in forwards obtained in the interbank market and options in the seven
major foreign currencies.i'"
On February 27, 1986, the Division issued a no-action letter to the New
York Stock Exchange permitting brokers and dealers to apply certain
reduced haircut charges under the net capital rule to positions comprised
of options or futures contracts as to broad-based stock market indices offset by a basket of securities in the actual index.':"
Transfer Agent Registration Forms-On March 27, 1986, the Commission
adopted new forms for the registration and monitoring of transfer agents. lOB
A simplified Form TA-I was implemented to conform with that used by
the federal bank regulatory agencies and a new Supplement was designed
to provide information about persons associated with non-bank, non-issuer
transfer agents. In addition, new Form TA-2 was created to provide annual
reports of essential processing information about each transfer agent's activities, which will enhance the Commission's oversight of these registrants.
Bank Securities Activities-On July 1, 1985, the Commission adopted Rule
3b-9 under the Exchange Act.109 The rule requires banks to conduct certain securities activities through broker-dealers registered under the Exchange Act. These activities are: 1) public solicitation of brokerage for
transaction-related compensation, 2) receipt of transaction-related compensation for providing brokerage services for trust, managing agency or other
accounts to which the bank provides advice, or 3) dealing in or underwriting securities. The rule also contains several exceptions for banks that conduct only limited securities activities.
Rule 3b-9 became effective on January 1, 1986. The Commission has
received at least 170 applications from bank affiliates which were submitted in order to facilitate compliance with the Rule. Between December 1985
and June 1986 the Commission issued numerous letters granting banks
and their affiliates additional time to comply with Rule 3b-9 in order to ease
the registration process. Those extensions expired September 1, 1986.
Extension of Credit by Broker-Dealers of Direct Participation ProgramsOn March 7, 1986, the Commission adopted Rule 3a12-9 under the Exchange Act.IIO The rule exempts the securities of certain direct participation programs from those provisions of the Exchange Act that currently
prohibit broker-dealers from arranging extensions of credit to investors to
36

purchase securities. The rule allows broker-dealers, subject to certain conditions, to participate in public offerings of securities of direct participation programs that provide for mandatory installment payments by
purchasers.
Interpretive Release Concerning the Scope of Section 28(e) of the Exchange
Act-On April 23, 1986, the Commission issued an interpretive release under Section 28(e) of the Exchange ACt.l11Section 28(e) provides a safe harbor for money managers who use commission dollars generated by account
transactions to pay for research and brokerage services. In the release the
Commission clarified its interpretation of certain provisions of Section 28(e)
and discussed various disclosure obligations of money managers under the
federal securities laws. The Commission also expressed its views regarding best execution obligations of fiduciaries for their clients' transactions
and its views and those of the United States Department of Labor regarding directed brokerage practices by sponsors of employee benefit plans.
Lost and Stolen Securities-In
1977, the Commission instituted the Lost
and Stolen Securities Program. The Commission's designee, the Securities Information Center, maintains an up-to-date database on lost, stolen
and counterfeit securities. Program participants number just over 19,600,
and include securities organizations, federally-insured banks and non-bank
transfer agents. Year-end statistics for 1985 show a 19% increase in the
dollar value of securities certificates reported lost, stolen or counterfeit.
As a result, the total value of certificates in the database increased from
$7.9 billion to $9.8 billion during 1985. The number of certificates reported as lost, stolen or counterfeit also increased 3% from 491,944 in 1984
to 506,223 in 1985. SIC also reported approximately a 14% increase in
the number of certificates about which participants inquired in 1985: from
2,658,886 in 1984 to 3,029,304 in 1985. Finally, the number of 1985 in.
quiries from participants that matched previous reports of lost, stolen or
counterfeit securities ("hits") by certificate was 3,022.
On November 29, 1985,112the Commission published for public com.
ment a number of amendments to the Lost and Stolen Securities Program.
The proposed amendments seek to clarify common questions about the
program, codify certain longstanding interpretations of the rules govern.
ing the program, focus the rule on negotiable certificated securities and
effectuate certain recommendations made by the General Accounting
Office.
Transfer Agent Regulation-The Commission adopted amendments to Ex.
change Act Rules 17Ad.5 and 17Ad.1 O. The amendments to Rule 17Ad-5
require registered transfer agents to respond promptly to written inquiries
from security holders concerning dividend and interest payments. The Rule
17Ad.1 0 amendments expand the time period afforded transfer agents to
recover over-issued securities before mandatory buy-in of those securities. I 13
The Commission also proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad.1 that treat each
line on a depository-presented shipment control list as a separate item for
turnaround purposes and certain recordkeeping purposes.v'" The Cornmission approved those amendments as modified to reflect industry comments
and suqqestlons.P"

Oversight of Self-Regulatory

Organizations
of September 30, 1986, ten exchanges
were registered with the Commission as national securities exchanges. During the fiscal year, the Commission granted applications by exchanges to
delist 109 equity and debt, and 20 options issues, and granted applications
by issuers requesting withdrawal from listing and registration for 32 issues.
In addition, during the fiscal year the Commission granted 577 applications
by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges.
The exchanges reported to the Commission 419 final disciplinary actions
imposing a variety of sanctions upon member firms and their employees.
This compares with 530 final disciplinary actions in fiscal 1985.
During the fiscal year, the Commission received 181 proposed rule
changes from exchanges. Among the significant rule filings approved by
the Commission were: (1) revisions to the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE") constitution; 116 (2) a final series of proxy surcharges and rates of
reimbursement for NYSE and American Stock Exchange member firms in
connection with their compliance with shareholder communication requirements; 117 (3) amendments to the NYSE customer account transfer rule; 116
and (4) amendments to NYSE trading halt procedures.t '?
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. - The NASD, with over 6400
members, is the only national securities association registered with the Commission. In fiscal 1986, the NASD reported the disposition of 252 formal
and summary disciplinary actions and 174 formal and summary actions
by the Association's NASDAQ Trading Committee.
In addition, the Commission received 33 filings of proposed rule changes
from the NASD. During 1986, the Commission approved NASD proposals:
amending the NASD's Code of Arbitration to conform the NASD's arbitration procedures to amendments made to the Uniform Arbitration Code by
the Securities Industry Conference on Arbitration; 120 amending the Uniform
Practice Code to establish timeframes to be adhered to by broker-dealers
when transferring customer securities accounts from one member firm to
another member firm; 121 amending the requirements of the Series 7 General
Securities Representative exam to cover developments in the securities industry and to place more emphasis on application, evaluation and analysis
than on factual recall; 122 and amending the Rules of Fair Practice to require members to maintain records of their aggregate short positions as
well as their customers' short positions in NASDAQ securities.P?
The Commission also denied a petition for a rehearing from one brokerdealer that sells securities issued by its affiliate ("self-underwriting"), to
amend the NASD's rule regulating those offerings. The petitioner, a former SECO broker-dealer, requested that the Commission amend the NASD's
rules to be consistent with the Commission's self-underwriting rules under
the obsolete SECO prograrn.P"
Municipal Securities RulemaJcing Board-In
fiscal 1986, the Commission
received and approved 13 filings of proposed rule changes from the MSRB.
Of particular note was the modification of MSRB Rule G-ll (g), to change
National Securities Exchanges-':"'As

Clearing Agencies
During the fiscal year, the Commission received 99 proposed rule changes
from registered clearing agencies and approved 89 proposed rule changes
genera"lIy providing greater financial protection for clearing agencies and
reducing costs to market participants. For example, Options Clearing Corporation rule changes provided for uniform, same-day funds settlernentt-"

ing short options call positions without increasing clearing agency exposure
from that activity. 127 The Commission also approved a complete restructuring of Options Clearing Corporation's non-equity options margin program that uses options price and portfolio theories to measure more
accurately the clearing agency's financial exposure from rnernbers'optlons
activity. 128
The Commission also approved rule changes that further extended automated clearance and settlement services for municipal securities. Effi.
cient processing of when-issued and syndicate takedown transactions was
made available nationwide.P" and two depositories established bearer
municipal bond programs. 130 Moreover, one depository established automated processing services for invitations to tender municipal securltles.'>'
Finally, municipal securities brokers' broker participation in the National
Clearance and Settlement System was facilitated by a clearing agency
proposal to establish a special clearing fund formula that reduces the minimum clearing fund contribution requirements for brokers' brokers.':"
SRO Surveillance and Regulatory Compliance Inspections
The Commission continued its program of referring to SROs matters that
are appropriate for SRO investigation and, as necessary, disciplinary action. The use of a computerized tracking system to track SRO referrals instituted in FY 1985 was enhanced this fiscal year. The Commission
continued during the fiscal year to encourage the SROs to pursue greater
numbers of sales practices related matters, while also evaluating SRO performance on handling all referrals in order both to formulate recomrnendations for improved procedures at the SROs and to make determinations
as to the type of matters that are appropriate for referral to SROs or the
states. This fiscal year 235 matters were referred to the SROs as compared
with 343 in fiscal 1985. The decrease in matters referred as compared
with last fiscal year is attributable to a determination to track only the more
significant referrals. The number of referrals for FY'86 is a 26% increase
over the number of matters referred in fiscal year 1984.
Section 19(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 19d.1
thereunder requires all self-regulatory organizations to file notice with the
Commission of all fin-aI disciplinary actions.
A Rule 19d-1 filing may report a completed action that was initiated at
any time during the last four years. This time lag frequently reflects the
severity of the violation(s) charged, the number of respondents involved,
39

or the complexity of the underlying facts. Thus, SROs generally conclude
cases involving minor or technical violations with a single respondent in
less than a year; cases involving serious trading violations (e.g., price
manipulation, prearranged trading, frontrunning, etc.) require more time
to complete because of the necessity to demonstrate specific intent to the
disciplinary panel that acts as a trier of fact. Consequently, the absolute
number of Rule 19d-l notices submitted by a SRO in a given year is not
a precise measure of its proficiency in market surveillance and compliance.
Nevertheless, the number of actions reported can be useful in assessing
the regulatory effectiveness of different SROs over similar time periods,
and this information has proved useful in focusing inspections of SRO
regulatory programs.
SRO Final Disciplinary Actions FY 86
In fiscal 1986 the American Stock Exchange ("AMEX") filed 52 Rule
19d-l filings; the Chicago Board Options Exchange ("CBOE") filed 166;
the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") filed 112; the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange ("PHLX") filed 18; the Pacific Stock Exchange ("PSE") filed 68;
the Boston Stock Exchange ("BSE") filed 2; and the Midwest Stock Exchange ("MSE") filed 2; as well as 426 filed by the National Association
of Securities Dealers ("NASD").

During the fiscal year, the staff conducted 22 inspections of SRO market surveillance, disciplinary, compliance, and operational programs.
The staff completed an inspection of the NYSE's Stock Watch and Industry Analysis programs during the year. The inspection revealed that in
response to previous recommendations, the NYSE is developing a new realtime surveillance system. The new system will compare current trading to
historical norms for each exchange listed issue to produce exceptions which
will then be investigated by staff. In contrast to the current surveillance system, which uses quantitative exception parameters for groups of stocks,
the new system will incorporate price and volume characteristics of each
stock into its exception parameters. It is expected that the new system will
be tested during the later part of 1986. The inspection also noted ways in
which other surveillance exception reports could be enhanced. Late in the
year, the Division began an inspection of the NYSE's Department of Enforcement. This inspection should be completed in October of 1986.
The staff also completed comprehensive inspections of the Amex's surveillance, investigatory and enforcement programs for both equities and

40

equity options. The equities inspection revealed improvements in the surveillance and investigatory programs resulting from the establishment of
automated surveillance reports and refinements in the equity audit trail.
The equity options inspection disclosed that surveillance of upstairs member firms had improved, and encouraged additional automation of the surveillance of floor members. The equity options inspection also found that
the Amex instituted a highly successful new order ticket review procedure
designed to monitor specialist performance.
During 1986, the staff inspected both the equities and equity options surveillance and disciplinary programs of the PSE to determine if the Exchange
had appropriately responded to previous inspection findings. The inspection revealed improvement in the surveillance and disciplinary programs
of the PSE, and that both the equities and equity options programs were
functioning adequately. In addition the PSE had implemented a significantly
improved options audit trail.
The staff also completed comprehensive inspections of Ph lx's equities
and equity options surveillance programs. The equity options inspection
noted significant improvement from the previous inspection. Although
several minor deficiencies were noted, the program was found to be functioning adequately. In response to the inspection findings, the Phlx agreed
to implement steps to enhance surveillance of Phlx primary issues.
The staff also conducted an inspection of the NASD's Qualification Section to evaluate enforcement standards for inclusion and deletion of securities in the NASDAQ System. The inspection found that the Qualifications
Section was effectively managed, and that established procedures were followed consistently. Late in the year the staff began an inspection of the
NASD's surveillance and disciplinary programs regarding the NASDAQ
market. This inspection revealed substantial improvements in NASDAQ
surveillance programs and progress toward an effective audit trail for NASDAQ securities.
The staff also completed inspections of the Spokane Stock Exchange,
Inc. ("SSE") and the Intermountain Stock Exchange, Inc. ("ISE"). Recommendations resulting from the SSE inspection included creation of a new,
comprehensive self-regulatory program for the Exchange and coordination
of that program with the NASD's member firm examination program. Following the ISE inspection, the exchange proposed a voluntary dissolution.
Subsequently, however, the Commodities Exchange, Inc. ("COMEX") and
the ISE executed an agreement for the purchase of ISE's registration as
a national securities exchange. Subject to Commission approval the ISE
would continue to exist as a dormant exchange, owned by the COMEX.
The staff also completed an inspection of the SSE equity surveillance
program. The inspection revealed that SSE is developing a new automated order routing and execution system. SSE has agreed to use this system
and implement various automated enhancements to its surveillance
programs.
In 1986 the inspection program continued to emphasize increasing the
accuracy of audit trails as a means of improving automated surveillance.
41

As part of each inspection, staff met with exchange personnel to discuss
audit trail developments and ways in which further improvements could
be made. Significant progress was achieved during the year by the NYSE,
the NASD and the PSE in their audit trails.
The staff conducted an inspection of the NYSE's Department of Enforcement in order to analyze the NYSE's policy not to investigate customer com:
plaints, terminations of registered representatives for cause and notices by
members of disciplinary action taken against their registered representatives ("cause matters"). In response to staff recommendations, the NYSE
indicated that a preliminary investigation of all potential sales practice violations would be undertaken unless matters were deferred to another SRO
or previously investigated. Additional policy changes to be implemented
include the periodic review of cases designated "no open," adoption of a
uniform system for recording customer complaints, procedures to improve
reporting among NYSE departments, improved documentation of why
cause referrals are not documented and improved file storage and retrieval.
A comprehensive inspection of compliance programs at the Phlx, including routine examinations, financial surveillance and cause investigations,
was conducted during fiscal year 1986. As a result of the concerns noted
during that inspection, the Phlx entered into a contract with the NASD to
conduct all compliance responsibilities for its foreign currency options
members on the behalf of the Exchange.
A comprehensive compliance inspection of the CBOE was completed during the fiscal year. That inspection reviewed cause investigations, routine
examinations and formal disciplinary actions, and disclosed weakness in
routine sales practice examinations and cause investigations, as well as
minor deficiencies in financial examinations of members and the development of formal disciplinary actions.
The staff also conducted inspections of eight of the fourteen NASD district offices. Inspections of the district offices in Seattle, Denver, Dallas,
Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and New York were conducted by the
Commission's Regional Offices. Inspections of the district offices in Kansas City and New York (two inspections of New York) were conducted by
the Washington, D.C. office. The NASD district office inspections generally revealed that the NASD was meeting its oversight responsibilities under
the Act. The inspections did reveal isolated deficiencies in the processing
of examinations, documentation of financial surveillance, documentation
and scope of cause investigations and processing of formal disciplinary action programs. With respect to the district office in New York, the staff noted serious delays in processing examinations and cause investigations as
well as delays in processing the related formal disciplinary actions. The inspections also noted that a number of management changes have occurred
in that district and that improvements had been made in addressing
procedural deficiencies. In addition to the inspections conducted during
fiscal year 1986, the staff encouraged and monitored automation by the
NASD of its district recordkeeping functions as well as the development
of a program to use computers for conducting field examinations of broker42

dealers. Reviews of the arbitration programs administered by the NASD
and NYSE were in progress at the end of the fiscal year. Finally, the staff
met with the NYSE and the NASD on a quarterly basis to discuss current
regulatory, examination and oversight issues.
In response to continued investor complaints concerning delays in transferring accounts between broker-dealers, the staff monitored the progress
of the recently implemented automated transfer system.
Applications for Re-entry-During the fiscal year the Division of Market
Regulation received 113 SRO applications to permit persons subject to
statutory disqualifications, as defined in Section 3(aX39) of the Exchange
Act, to become associated with broker-dealers.P? This number of filings,
a 50% increase from fiscal year 1985, represents by far the largest number of 19h-1 filings ever received and processed by the staff in anyone fiscal year. The distribution of filings among the SROs was the following:
NASD (88); NYSE (21); and AMEX ( 4). Of the total filings processed, ( 5)
applications were subsequently withdrawn; 100 completed; and 8 were
pending at the year end. One application was denied by the Commission.
The staff refused to take a no action position in one application.
In February 1986, the Division of Market Regulation requested that
these clearing agencies prepare formal comprehensive risk assessment
reports, as contemplated in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19600,135
which enumerated the standards for Clearing Agency Registration. These
risk assessment reports would be presented to the clearing agencies' respective Boards of Directors and filed with the Division by January 1, 1987. In
addition, because new services and systems are developed and offered to
clearing agency participants fairly regularly, the Division has requested
these risk assessment reports be updated annually.
Primary responsibility for examining and inspecting registered clearing
agencies was shifted to the Commission's regional offices in 1986. The Division of Market Regulation, in conjunction with appropriate New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia personnel, will coordinate this transfer
to the regional offices and provide support assistance and counsel to regional office examiners. Transfer of the clearing agency inspection program to
the regional offices will ensure more regular Commission oversight of securities depositories and clearing corporations, and allow the Commission
to utilize the expertise and experience of its regional office examiners who
conduct broker-dealer, transfer agent, and investment adviser inspections.

Investment Companies and Advisers
Key 1986 Results
The Division of Investment Management oversees the regulation of investment companies and investment advisers under two companion statutes, the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act) and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Investment Advisers Act),and ad.
ministers the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (Holding Company Act).
During 1986 the number of registered investment companies increased
by 19% and the assets they manage increased by 61 %. The number of in.
vestment advisers registered increased by 7%. This rate of increase is significantly lower than that experienced in prior years because about 1,500
advisers did not wish to file the new uniform registration form, thus terminating their registrations.

During fiscal 1986 the Division and the regional offices continued efforts
to coordinate their regulatory activities with state authorities that share the
Commission's jurisdiction over investment advisers, by conducting joint
examinations, providing training for state examiners, and routinely sharing examination results.
Due to the large growth in the number of investment advisers registered
with the Commission in recent years, the Commission took steps to reevaluate the current regulatory structure for advisers. An SEC Roundtable on
Investment Advisers and Financial Planners was held on May 7, 1986 to
give the Commission the benefit of the views of outside experts. Discus.
sion at the Roundtable centered on industry growth, and whether it poses
additional risks to investors; disclosure to investors and how it can be Improved; and alternatives to the current regulatory system, including the establishment of one or more self-regulatory organizations for advisers and
greater emphasis on state regulation.
Regulation of investment advisers and financial planners was also the
topic of a hearing held on June II, 1986 by the Subcommittee on Telecom.
munlcations, Consumer Protection and Finance of the House Committee
on Energy and Commerce. In testimony at the hearing the Commission
stated that, although any abuse is unacceptable, the evidence of abuse by
planners and advisers was limited. Improved coordination with the States
and productivity enhancements are enabling the SEC to deal with the industry's expansion under current regulation. The SEC is continuing to work
with both state regulators and industry representatives to ensure the continuation of cost-effective investor protection.
The staff also cooperated with the National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD") as it began a pilot program to evaluate the feasibility of conducting inspections of NASD members who are also registered investment
advisers. The pilot is designed to provide information on whether the NASD
might function as a self-regulatory organization for investment advisers.
The Division and the Regional Offices conducted an investment adviser
training program for NASD examiners participating in the NASD pilot program, which will continue into the coming year.
During the year personal computers were used increasingly by Commission examiners, both for on-site inspections of investment companies and
investment advisers and in subsequent report writing and file maintenance.
These computer applications hold the promise of adding considerable economies to the program's examination capabilities.
Disclosure Requirements
The Commission adopted Form N-14, a simplified form for registering
securities issued by management investment companies and business development companies in business combination transactions. 136 The Commission proposed a package of new rules and rule amendments that would
standardize the computation of mutual fund performance data used in advertisements and sales literature to enhance investors' ability to compare
performance clalrns.P?
45

I

Edgar
In July, 1985, the Division's Office of Public Utility Regulation began accepting electronic filings from registered public utility holding company
systems and their member companies. The Division also formed an Edgar
Pilot Branch in October, 1985, which began processing electronic filings
for a volunteer group of investment company registrants in November,
1985. The volunteers include a representative group of 158 management
investment companies and 72 unit investment trusts with over 2,000 active series. Additional electronic filings of Form N-SAR (semi-annual report
of registered investment companies) also were made by 441 registered
management investment companies not participating full-time in the Edgar
pilot. As of September 30, 1986, the Division had received 5,063 Edgar
filings
In October, 1986, the Commission published for comment a proposed
rule that would allow optional electronic filing of Form 13F, the report of
securities holdings filed by institutional managers. The rule would specify
a uniform format and require that electronic filings of this form be made
on magnetic tape, a medium particularly suited to large, formatted data
filings.138

Regulatory Policy
In January 1986, the Commission issued an advance concept release requesting comment on whether Rule 10f-3 under the Investment Company
Act should be amended to provide better protection for investors and greater flexibility for investment companies. The current rule provides a limited
exemption from a statutory prohibition against acquisitions by a registered
investment company of securities underwritten by an affiliate of the company during the existence of the underwriting or selling syndicate to give
investment companies greater flexibility in making inve~ents,
while
providing better safeguards against overreachlnq.P"
In March 1986, the Commission adopted amendments to Investment
Company Act Rule 2a- 7, which permits money market funds to use the
amortized cost method of valuing their portfolio securities or the pennyrounding method of computing their price per share. The amendments allow funds to acquire put options and treat variable note or floating rate debt
securities with periodic demand features (a type of put option) as short-term
securities under specified conditions.
At the same time, the Commission amended Investment Company Act
Rule 12d3-1 to clarify when investment companies may acquire demand
features and another type of put option known as standby commitments,
and adopted a new Rule 2a4J-J allowing registered investment companies
to assign a fair value of zero to standby commltments.v'?
In September 1986, the Commission proposed Rule 6c-9 under the Act
to provide, under specified conditions, an exemption from the Act to foreign banks that offer or sell their debt securities and non-voting preferred
stock in the United States, either directly or through a finance subsidiary.
46

The Commission also solicited comment on the conditions under which
foreign banks offering or selling their own equity securities in the United
States should be exempted from the ACt.141
In June 1986, the Commission proposed an amendment to Rule 31a-2
to permit investment companies to maintain required records on magnetic tape, disk, or other computer storage medium, in order to recognize the
use of computers in the Industry.':"
Investment

Advisers

On November 14, 1985, the Commission adopted Rule 205-3, which permits registered investment advisers, under specified conditions, to receive
performance-based compensation.v" On January 1, 1986, the new Form
ADV became effective, a uniform form for the registration of investment
advisers with the states and the Commission. All previously registered in.
vestment advisers were required to re-register on the new form by March
31, 1986. On September 9, 1986, the Commission adopted Rule 202 (a)(l)-l,
which provides that a transaction that does not result in a change of actual
control of an investment adviser will not be deemed to be an assignment
requiring client consent.v" Also in September 1986, the Commission proposed Rule 206(4)-4 to codify an investment adviser's fiduciary obligation
to give material financial and disciplinary information to clients.r" That
proposed rule would set forth a general disclosure standard and provide
guidance on some of the types of information that advisers must disclose
to clients.
Insurance Requirements
In May 1986, the Commission adopted Rule 151 under the Securities Act,
establishing a "safe harbor" for specified types of annuity contracts. 146The
rule assists insurance companies to determine which of their annuity
products are not covered by the registration and other requirements of the
federal securities statutes. Rule 151defines the term "annuity contract or
optional annuity contract," as used in Section 3(a)(8) of the Securities Act,
to include any contract offered by a corporation subject to state insurance
regulation, under which the insurer assumes the investment risk, and which
is not marketed primarily as an investment.
On October 15, 1985, the Commission amended Rule 22c-1 under the
Investment Company Act,147permitting insurance company separate accounts offering variable annuity contracts an extended time period for
processing and pricing initial purchase payments.
Public Utility Holding Companies
There are now 13 registered holding companies with aggregate assets
as of March 31, 1986, of $82.6 billion, an increase of $4.4 billion, or 5.6 %
over June 30, 1985. Total operating revenues, as of March 31, 1986 were
$34.1 billion, a $0.3 million decrease from June 30, 1985. There are 65

47

electric or gas utility subsidiaries, 74 non-utility subsidiaries, and 22 inactive companies in the 13 registered systems, a total of 174 companies operating in 24 states (excluding seven power supply subsidiary companies).
In March 1986 the Commission revised Holdinq Company Act Rule 70
and amended Rule 50. The revision to Rule 70 increased the number of
persons affiliated with investment bankers and commercial bankers who
may serve as officers or directors of public utility holding companies and
their subsidiaries. The amendment to Rule 50 conformed it to the shelf registration provisions of Securities Exchange Act Rule 415. Rule 50 governs
competitive bidding procedures for the distribution of securities issued by
public utility holding companies and their subsldiaries.v"
Holding Company Fmancmgs-During fiscal 1986, the Commission authorized $9.3 billion of senior securities and common stock financing for the
13 registered systems: $7.7 billion in long-term debt financing, with $1.6
billion in common and preferred stock. Long-term debt financing increased
by 113.9% over fiscal 1985, primarily attributable to redemption and tender
offer refinancings of over $2.4 billion from decreasing interest rates. Over
$1.1 billion of pollution control financing and $5.3 billion of short-term debt
financing were approved. The pollution control financing was a 50%
decrease from amounts authorized in fiscal year 1985. This decrease
represents the uncertainties of the tax-exempt market caused by Congressional limitations on tax-exempt securities and the recent tax legislation.
Short-term debt decreased by 7% over the previous year. Total financings
in fiscal 1986 of $15.7 billion exceeded financings authorized in fiscal 1985
by $3.6 billion, an increase of over 29.8%. The Commission authorized
$134 million for fuel exploration and development activities during 1986.
Subsidiary Seroice Companies-At
the end of calendar year 1986, 12 subsidiary service companies provided managerial, accounting, administrative
and engineering service to 11 of the 13 registered holding companies. Bill.
ings for services rendered to the holding company systems amounted to
$1.5 billion or 4.4 % of the total revenues generated by the electric and
gas operating utilities. Subsidiary service companies are heavily laborintensive, employing 18,241 staff, and have assets of $901.5 million.
The Commission's continuing review of holding company fuel procurement activities, accounting policies and annual reports of the subsidiary
service companies and fuel procurement subsidiaries, and the review of nonutility quarterly reports resulted in savings to consumers during the fiscal
year of approximately $43.7 million.
Significant Applications

and Interpretations

Investment Company Act-The Commission issued an order on January
30, 1986, exempting the IDS Mutual Fund Group ("Group") from Section
10(f)of the Investment Company Act and Rule 1Of-3,to permit Group funds
to purchase securities through affiliated underwriting syndicates (most significantly Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.) in amounts exceeding the limits
of Rule 10f-3(d). The order was subject to several conditions designed to

48

assure investor protection, and two sets of quantity limitations on the ago
gregate amount of securities an individual fund could purchase from the
affiliated underwriter.
An order was issued by the Commission on March 17, 1986, permitting
the Kemper Investment Trust, Series 1 and Subsequent Series ("Trusts")
to invest a substantial amount of assets in the shares of the Kemper Mutual Funds in excess of the limitations on a "fund of funds" in Section 12(d)(1)
of the Act. The Trusts are a series of unit investment trusts that maintain
portfolios of zero-coupon obligations and underlying fund shares. Affiliated transactions associated with the purchases were also approved under
Section 17(d) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 17 d-I.
On June 19, 1986, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ("Shearson") and
members of the IDS Mutual Fund Group were exempted from Section
17(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act by a Commission order that permitted the Funds to lend portfolio securities to Shearson and its affiliated
broker-dealers, subject to conditions to ensure the Funds fair treatment and
protection from overreaching. Regarding the loans, the applicants were also
granted an order under Section 17(d) and Rule 17 d-I to permit associated
joint transactions between Shearson and the Funds.
On July 23, July 28, and August 12, 1986, the Commission issued orders of exemption under Section 6(c) of the Act permitting, respectively,
Westpac Banking Corporation, an Australian bank, and Barclays PLC and
National Westminster Bank PLC, English bank holding companies, to issue and sell equity securities in the U.S. under several conditions, including that the foreign banks have a substantial presence in the U.S. and that
they be regulated as banks both in their home country and the U.S. These
were the first foreign banking entities granted exemptions permitting them
to make general offerings of equity securities in the U.S. Previously, foreign banks had been granted exemptions covering general offerings of debt
securities.
Holding Company Act- The Commission issued a notice of, and order
for, hearing on two applications filed by South Jersey Industries, Inc. on
its proposed acquisition of Chesapeake Utilities Corporation and a declaratory order that the proposed acquisition of Chesapeake common stock
would not affect South Jersey's exemption under the Act. 149 A hearing was
ordered to commence on January 22, 1986; however, on January 24, 1986
South Jersey withdrew its applications, citing Chesapeake's changed financial condition.
The Commission issued an order authorizing Cleveland Electric llluminating Company and Toledo Edison Company to become wholly-owned subsidiaries of Centerior Energy Corporation, a newly created, predominantly
intrastate public utility holding company. A request for hearing by an Ohio
consumers organization was denied. 150 The merger of the two Ohio utilities represented one of the largest utility combinations in recent history.
With combined assets of over $9 billion, the new holding company is the
18th largest electric utility system in the United States.
The Commission issued a series of orders authorizing the Middle South
Utilities, Inc. system to enter into several financing transactions totalling
49

$1 billion. 151 The financial viability of the system had deteriorated from
rate relief insufficient to compensate for the construction of two nuclear
generating plants. The deterioration had extended to a point where the Commission was unable to make the findings required under the Holding Company Act to authorize needed transactions. However, during the fall and
winter of 1985-86 adequate rate relief was received by the system companies, allowing the Commission to authorize these transactions.
The Commission issued an order authorizing Columbia Gas System to
form a non-utility subsidiary, Producer Settlement Corporation, to assist
in the financing of up to $800 million of first mortgage bonds. These bonds
are issued to independent gas producers as compensation for the renegotiation of over $5 billion of high take-or-pay gas contracts. 152 The renegotiation of the gas contracts was needed to reverse the substantial declining
earnings of Columbia from the slide in natural gas rates authorized by
regulatory bodies.
The Commission issued a notice of, and an order for, hearing on an application by Columbia Gas System to form a new gas marketing subsidiary, TriStar Gas Marketing, Inc. 153 TriStar proposed to purchase spot market
gas in the open market and arrange for delivery to end-users using associate and non-associate pipeline facilities. The Office of the Consumer Counsel of Ohio and two independent gas marketing companies intervened and
requested a hearing. A hearing was ordered to start on July 21, 1986;
however, on July 17, 1987 Columbia withdrew its application, citing
changed market circumstances.
The Commission issued an order authorizing CSW Credit, Inc., a nonutility subsidiary of Central & South West Corporation, to factor the accounts receivables of specified non-associate electric utilities, in addition
to those of its associate companies. 154 The order limits the amount of nonassociate accounts receivables to less than those of the associate companies.
Institutional Disclosure Program-Securities
Exchange Act Section 13(1)(1)
and Rule 13f-1 under it requires specified "institutional investment
managers" to file quarterly reports on Form 13F. Managers filing these
reports disclose specified equity holdings of the accounts over which they
exercise investment discretion. As of June 30, 1986, Form 13F reports had
been filed by 1,543 managers for holdings totaling $1.091 trillion.
Form 13F reports are available to the public at the Commission's Public
Reference Room promptly after filing. Two tabulations of the information
contained in these reports are available for inspection: (1) an alphabetical
list of the individual securities, showing the number of shares held by the
managers reporting the holding; and (2) a list with the total number of shares
of a security reported by all reporting managers. Both tabulations normally are available about two weeks after the date on which the reports must
be filed.
The tabulations are prepared by an independent contractor selected
through the competitive bidding process. The contractor provides its services to the Commission without charge, and is required to make a variety
of specified tabulations available to the public at reasonable prices within
ten days after receiving the reports.

The General Counsel represents the Commission in all litigation in the
United States Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals, defends the Com.
mission and its employees when sued, prosecutes administrative dlsciplinary proceedings against professional persons under Rule 2(e) of the
Commission's Rules of Practice, and appears amicus curiae on behalf of
the Commission in significant private litigation involving the Federal securities laws. In addition, under the supervision and direction of the General
Counsel, the Regional Offices represent the Commission in corporate reorganization cases under the Bankruptcy Code that have a substantial public
investor interest. The General Counsel also seeks to ensure that objectives
of the Commission's enforcement and regulatory programs are accornplished, that judicial interpretations of the Federal securities laws afford
adequate protection to investors, and that the Commission is able to discharge its statutory responsibilities, unimpeded by lawsuits against the agency or its staff.
The General Counsel represented the Commission in 285 litigation matters during fiscal year 1986. During the year, 37 courts of appeals and
Supreme Court cases were concluded, all but three favorably to the Com.
mission. There were 18 appeals before the Supreme Court and Federal
courts of appeals of cases in which a party subject to a Commission injunctive action challenged the lower court's resolution of the case in a manner
favorable to the Commission or, much less frequently, the Commission
challenged an adverse decision. Of these appeals, seven were concluded,
with only two outcomes unfavorable to the Commission. The foregoing compares with the following cases in fiscal year 1985: a total of 289 matters,
of which 37 were appeals of injunctive action cases. Of those appellate cases,
15 were concluded, with only two outcomes unfavorable to the Commission.

There also were 25 appellate and district court actions seeking to overturn Commission orders, primarily those issued in administrative proceedings or affirming self-regulatory organization disciplinary proceedings
against regulated entities such as broker-dealers. Of these appeals, eight
were concluded, with no adverse results. In fiscal year 1985, there were 20
actions, 12 of which were concluded with only one adverse result.
The Commission handled 42 amicus cases during the year (compared
to 44 such cases in fiscal year 1985). The Commission participated in 19
private cases that were decided; only two of these resulted in a decision
adverse to views advocated by the Commission.
The General Counsel also handled more than 218 other proceedings before the Commission or in the Federal district courts, compared to 185 in
fiscal year 1985. These included 24 suits brought against the Commission
or its staff, and 54 suits, including actions under various public information statutes, seeking access to Commission documents. Of the latter, 46
involved discovery subpoenas in private actions in which the Commission
is not a party. In fiscal year 1985, there were 63 suits brought against the
Commissioners or the Commission's staff, and 78 suits (including 54 thirdparty subpoenas) under the various public information statutes.
In addition to litigation, the General Counsel is involved in significant
legislative and regulatory work. For example, the Office assisted the Chairman in preparing testimony on a number of important issues, including
regulation of financial services, regulation of investment advisers and financial planners, the Commission's responsibilities regarding bank financial
reporting, and financial reporting and the role of the independent auditor.
The Office also assisted the Commission in preparing a legislative proposal
to amend the private civil liability provisions of the Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act.
During fiscal year 1986, 116 debtors with securities registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) in the hands of the public
commenced Chapter II reorganizations. The Commission entered its appearance in 48 of these cases, involving aggregate assets of $10.6 billion
and about 260,000 public investors. The Commission entered an appearance in one case to pursue a specific law enforcement interest. A list of
these cases is set forth in Table 42 in the Appendix to this Report. The Office
also submitted proposed amendments to the Bankruptcy Rules to the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of
the United States in connection with that committee's
review of the
Bankruptcy Rules following the passage of The Bankruptcy Amendments
and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984.
Litigation

Appeals in Commission Enforcement Actions- This litigation consists
primarily of attempts by defendants in Commission injunctive actions to
obtain reversal by a court of appeals of district court decisions finding that
they have violated the law, enjoining them, and/or ordering other relief such
52

as disgorgement of illegal profits. In addition, the Commission, when it is
denied relief, will in some cases take an appeal.
In SEC v. Drysdale Securities Corp., 155 the Commission appealed the dis.
trict court's dismissal of the Commission's complaint for injunctive relief
in an action involving a fraud by a government securities dealer that caused
losses to institutional investors of almost $300 million. The Commission's
complaint alleged, among other things, that an accountant engaged in securities fraud by preparing false financial statements that concealed the dealer's insolvency and that were relied upon by the investors. The district court
dismissed the complaint, holding that, since the alleged misrepresentations
did not pertain to the merits of the government securities traded or to their
issuer, they did not occur "in" or "in connection with" the offers, purchases
or sales of securities, and therefore did not violate antifraud provisions of
the Federal securities laws. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
reversed, reasoning that the securities were transferred as a direct result
of the misrepresentations
of the dealer's financial condition, and that these
misrepresentations
related to a significant part of the consideration for the
securities transactions-the
dealer's concurrent agreement to repurchase
or to resell the securities.
In SEC v. The American Board of Trade, 156 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which had previously issued a decision in this
case in 1984,157 affirmed the district court's ruling on remand in favor of
the Commission. In the prior decision, the court had stayed an injunction
against defendants' further illegal sales of unregistered short-term notes
to provide them with an opportunity to seek registration of the notes. In
its decision in 1986, the court found that registration of the notes could
not be effected because the defendants could not provide certain essential
certified financial statements. As a result, the court upheld an order granting the Commission's motion to lift the stay of the injunction against illegal sales and enjoining temporarily redemptions of existing notes, pending
formulation of a plan to terminate the notes program. There are now outstanding over $80 million of these unregistered notes.
In SEC v. Rogers, 158 a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed (two to one) the district court's judg'
ment that the defendant did not violate the antifraud and registration
provisions of the Federal securities laws in connection with the offer and
sale of tax-shelter investments in South American gold mining properties.
The court held that the district court's findings of fact with respect to defendant Rogers' liability were not dearly erroneous.
The same court affirmed a judgment against the Commission in another
injunctive action alleging violations of the registration and antifraud provisions, SEC v. Belmont Reid & Co. 159 The court held that sales contracts for
the delayed delivery of gold coins at a substantial discount from the market price of gold were not securities. The court stated that the case "was
a dose one," but reasoned that, even though investors were dependent upon
the promoter to use their funds to develop a mining enterprise capable of
producing the coins, a security was not present since the investors' "primary
53

purpose" was to profit from the rise in the price of gold during the early
1980's. The Commission has filed a petition for rehearing of that decision.
Petitions to Review Commission Orders-Petitions
to courts of appeals
for judicial review of Commission orders arise from Commission administrative proceedings conducted under various provisions of the Federal securities laws, including proceedings to review disciplinary actions by national
securities exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. (NASD).160These proceedings may involve, among other things, issues
central to the Commission's enforcement program and thus to the integrity of the securities markets, including questions of interpretation of the securities statutes.
For example, in Lowell H. Listrom & Co. v. SEC, 161the United States Court
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has been asked to reveew the Commission's determination that a broker-dealer violated recordkeeping, confirmation and credit-extension
regulations under the Exchange Act in
connection with a best-efforts underwriting. Petitioner contends that the
Commission's recordkeeping and confirmation requirements were not applicable to transactions by those persons who sought to participate in the
underwriting by submitting a written subscription agreement. The Commission has urged the court to uphold its interpretation of these rules as
applying to transactions by all persons who did business with the broker
in the underwriting rather than only those persons who engaged in oral
transactions, since the rules at issue are important prophylactic measures
designed to provide regulators with tools for detecting broker-dealer misconduct, and to guard against abuses in the underwriting of new issues.
In Exchange Services v. SEC,162 the United States Court of Appeals for
the Fourth Circuit affirmed a Commission decision that upheld an NASD
determination that order takers employed by the petitioner, a discount
broker-dealer, must qualify as registered representatives by passing the
general securities examination required by the NASD of all persons who
engage in the securities business. The court deferred to the judgment of
the Commission, which had concluded that, notwithstanding the limited
nature of their duties, petitioner's order takers must pass the general examination because of their regular and continuous contact with the investing public. The court also upheld the Commission's judgment to refrain
from considering, in the context of a proceeding involving a particular
brokerage firm, allegations that the existing testing requirements are too
onerous in light of the limited nature of order takers' duties. The court emphasized that the NASD and the Commission, in a separate inquiry, are
conducting an ongoing review of overall testing requirements.
And in Earl v. SEC, 163the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit affirmed an order of the Commission that upheld sanctions imposed
by the NASD on the petitioner, who admittedly misappropriated funds from
customers and his firm while employed as a branch manager of a brokerdealer firm. Rejecting the petitioner's contentions, the court of appeals
found that the Commission did not abuse its discretion either in upholding
these sanctions or in denying petitioner oral argument and leave to adduce
additional evidence before the Commission.

54

Commission Participation in Private Litigation-The
Commission also par.
ticipates as a friend of the court in selected private litigation that involves
significant securities law issues. Such litigation is an important supplement
to the Commission's enforcement program. In addition, because the Fed.
eral securities laws provide for private remedies as well as governmental
enforcement actions, decisions in private cases may have precedential effect on the Commission's own regulatory activities.
In Randall v. Loftsqeerden, 164 the Supreme Court reversed a decision of
the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit: The Supreme
Court held that the recovery available to a defrauded tax-shelter investor,
suing under either Section 12(2) of the Securities Act or Section lO(b) of
the Exchange Act to rescind the fraudulent transaction or to obtain rescissionary damages, may not be reduced by any tax benefits the investor has
received from the investment. Adopting arguments urged by the Commission and the United States in a friend of the court brief, the Court reiterated the important deterrent purpose of private rights of action under the
Federal securities laws.
In light of its ruling in Loftsgaarden, the Supreme Court also vacated and
remanded two rulings by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit requiring offset of tax benefits: Salcer v. Enuicon Equities
Corp. 165 and Freschi v. Grand Coal Venture. 166 Still pending before the Tenth
Circuit is Feldman v. Pioneer Petroleum Corp., 167 in which the Commission
filed a brief on an issue left open by the Supreme Court in Loftsgaardenwhether tax benefits should be deducted from a Section 10(b) "out-ofpocket" recovery. The Commission's position is that it is likewise improper
to offset tax benefits against an out-of-pocket recovery.
In Point Landing v. Omni Capital Intemational, 166 the Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of claims under Section 10(b) and
Rule 10b-5 based on alleged fraudulent misrepresentations in the sale of
silver straddle commodity futures through discretionary trading accounts.
Consistent with the position argued in briefs filed (at the request of the court)
by the Commission and by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
the court held that the plaintiff purchasers had no private cause of action
under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, but could sue only under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). Thus, the court agreed with both agencies
that Section 2(a)(1)(A) of the CEA, which gives exclusive jurisdiction over
commodity accounts to the CFTC, also preempts private actions under the
securities laws based on Commission rules. The court deemed it unnecessary to decide whether the CEA also preempts private rights of action that
are self-executing, in the sense that they do not rely on the promulgation
of a Commission rule.
In Long Island Lighting v. Barbash, 169 the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit agreed with the position urged by the Commission
in a friend of the court brief concerning the interpretation of the Commission's proxy solicitation rules. Noting that these rules expressly apply to
communications "reasonably calculated" to influence shareholder votes,
the court of appeals rejected the standard adopted by the district court-

55

that only communications "targeted directly at shareholders" are subject
to the proxy rules. That unduly narrow standard, the court stated, would
alloweasy evasion of the rules. The court of appeals also held that the proxy
rules apply to materials published in newspapers and to communications
addressing matters of public interest. A dissenting judge would have first
considered the First Amendment issue the district court had considered
in connection with the newspaper advertisement involved in this case.
In Beaumont v. American Can Company, 170 the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of a
private action brought against the American Can Company for violations
of the Commission's antifraud and disclosure rules in connection with the
1982 merger of Associated Madison Companies, Inc., into an American Can
subsidiary. The plaintiffs, former shareholders of Associated Madison,
claimed that, in violation of the rules, the joint proxy statement and prospectus for the merger failed to disclose information relating to the merger price
terms contained in letters from American Can requesting no-action positions and exemptions under certain Commission rules. Consistent with the
position argued by the Commission in its brief (filed at the request of the
court), the court held that the facts concerning the exemptions and no-action
positions were not material for purposes of disclosure to Associated Madison's shareholders.
In Rembold v. Pacific First Federal Savings Bank, 171 the Commission filed
a friend of the court brief in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit, urging that the jurisdiction of a Federal district court under the Federal securities laws to consider claims alleging fraud in connection with the
sale of stock by a savings and loan association, pursuant to its conversion
to a stock company, is not ousted by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's
approval of the conversion. The Commission also urged that position in
a brief filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
in Craft v. Florida Federal Savings & Loan Association. 172 In Rembold, the
court stated it agreed with the Commission's position and reversed the lower
court; in Craft, the court said it need not reach that question in light of its
disposition of the appeal on another ground.
In Brawer v. Options Clearing Corp., 173 the Commission filed a friend of
the court brief in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
in a suit instituted by a writer of put options. Plaintiff alleged that the Options Clearing Corporation (Ocq and the American Stock Exchange had
violated a provision of their by-laws (part of a standardized options contract) when they did not adjust the price and terms of the options after an
issuer exchange offer that effected an alleged recapitalization. The district
court had dismissed the complaint on the ground that no Federal cause
of action existed against a registered clearing agency or national securities exchange for violation of self-regulatory organization rules. The Commission urged affirmance on different grounds, arguing that the plaintiff
had not alleged a violation of the adjustment rule (which provides that the
adjustment decision was to be made in the sole discretion of a committee
of the ocq in the absence of sufficient allegations that the adjustment decision was tainted by fraud or bad faith. The Commission further urged that,
56

if a violation of the adjustment rule had been alleged, the common law
breach-of-contract
remedy provided an adequate remedy; therefore, no
separate Federal remedy need be implied. The Commission asked that the
appeals court not reach the issue whether an implied action may lie against
an exchange.
In Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith v. Bobker.P" involving a tender
offer for less than all of the issuer's securities, the District Court foe the
Southern District of New York, as urged by the Commission in a brief filed
at the request of the court, found that a short sale made by a shareholder
during the proration period of the tender offer, after he had tendered all
of his shares, violated the hedged-tendering prohibitions of Rule IDb-4. Under the rule, the shareholder was required to repurchase the securities sub.
ject to the stIort sale or withdraw those securities from the tender by the
end of the proration period.
In Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. v. Drysdale Securities Corp.,m a prlvate action arising out of the same circumstances as SEC v. Drysdale Securities Corp. (discussed
under appeals in enforcement
actions), the
Commission filed a friend of the court brief, at the court's request, taking
the position that traditional repurchase agreements for United States
government securities were not separate securities for purposes of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Rather, the Commission urged, as the Second Circuit had held in the Drysdale Securities Corp. case, that fraud in
repurchase agreements occurs in connection with the purchase and sale
of the underlying security and is subject to the antifraud provisions for that
reason. The court of appeals affirmed the jury verdict for the plaintiff on
this basis, not reaching the question whether repurchase agreements were
separate securities.
In SIPC v. Vigman,176 the Securities Investor Protection Corporation
sought review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
of a district court order dismissing, on standing grounds, securities fraud
claims arising out of the collapse of two California brokerage firms. The
Commission filed a memorandum with the court of appeals urging that unauthorized broker-dealer trading in customer accounts can violate Rule
IDb-5. The Commission explained that, under the "shingle" theory, a brokerdealer may be held liable under Rule 1Db-5 for conduct inconsistent with
its implied representation that customer accounts will be managed with fairness and honesty and in accordance with industry standards.
In Levinson v. Basic, lnc., 177 the Commission filed a .brief in the United
States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit urging the court to reject the
lower court's holding that merger negotiations are never a material event
until an agreement in principle is "reasonably certain." The court of appeals agreed with the Commission and held that, at least where a company
makes statements about corporate developments, merger negotiations may
be material to investors even before there is an agreement in principle. The
court agreed with the Commission.
Trading on Material Non-public InformationThe issue of when trading
on material non-public information violates the Federal securities laws con.

tinues to be actively litigated. This year the Commission submitted amicus briefs in two cases.
In United States v. Carpenter, 178 the United States Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit affirmed the criminal convictions of defendants who traded on information that one defendant, a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, obtained in the course of his employment and tipped to the other
defendants. The defendants had sought dismissal of the charges, arguing
that, unlike other cases involving trading on misappropriated information,
in this case the only party from whom the information was stolen was not
itself a participant in securities transactions. Agreeing with the position
I urged by the Commission, the court rejected that argument. The court held
that trading on information misappropriated in breach of an employer: imposed fiduciary duty of confidentiality violates Section 10(b) and Rule
[ IOb-5even though the victim of the fraud was not itself a purchaser or seller
, of securities.
In Anheuser-Busch v. Thayer,179 the Commission filed a brief in a Rule
lOb-5 action brought by Anheuser-Busch against a former Anheuser-Busch
director and other defendants. Anheuser-Busch's complaint alleged that the
director and other defendants traded on nonpublic information misappropriated by the director from the plaintiff concerning Anheuser-Busch's plans
to acquire another company, causing the price of the target company's stock
to increase dramatically. As a result, Anheuser-Busch claims, it had to pay
a higher price for that stock than it otherwise would have paid. The Commission's brief, filed in connection with defendants' motions for summary
judgment, urged the court to hold that a person who trades in securities
while in possession of nonpublic information he has misappropriated or
who tips others who trade, violates Rule 10b-5, as do his tippees. The Commission also urged the court to hold that a private plaintiff like AnheuserBusch that satisfies the standing requirements for bringing suit under Rule
lOb-5 may sue persons who violate the rule by such tipping or trading. The
district court, apparently agreeing with the Commission, denied defendants'
motions for summary judgment.
Tender Offer Litigation-This year the Commission, as in past years, filed
friend of the court briefs in several cases involving tender offers.
In Radol v. Thomas, 180 the Solicitor General, at the request of the Supreme
Court, filed a brief expressing the views of the United States and the Commission as to whether certiorari should be granted to review a decision by
the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The court of appeals had upheld a judgment entered on a jury verdict for the defendants
in a class action brought by former target shareholders of Marathon Oil
Company challenging U.S. Steel's acquisition of the company. In that decision, and in a companion case, Starkman v. Marathon Oil Co., 181 the court
of appeals rejected the plaintiffs' contention that certain appraisals of Marathon's oil and gas reserves should have been disclosed in the context of
U.S. Steel's tender offer, holding that neither these appraisals nor any other
form of future-oriented or "soft" information is material to a target shareholder's decision to tender unless the underlying projections regarding future corporate and economic events are virtually certain. Because the Sixth
58

!

Circuit's decision turned in large part on specific Commission rules pro.
hibiting the disclosure of appraisals of the target company's oil and gas
reserves, which rules since have been amended, the Commission urged the
Supreme Court to deny certiorari on the ground that the case did not pro.
vide an appropriate vehicle for consideration of the materiality of soft in.
formation. The Court denied certiorari.
In Moran v. Household International, 182 the Commission filed a friend of
the court brief urging the Supreme Court of Delaware to hold that a "poi.
son pill" defense to tender offers adopted by Household International
without submission to its shareholders was not in the interests of the cor.
poratlon's shareholders. The Supreme Court of Delaware disagreed and up.
held the poison pill plan. In so ruling, the court held that the plan was an
appropriate response to certain types of coercive hostile tender offers. The
court rejected the Commission's arguments that the plan would preclude
shareholder consideration of all hostile tender offers, and would deter proxy
contests by persons opposed to management.
In Hanson Trust PLC v. SCM Corp., 183 the Commission filed, at the reo
quest of the Second Circuit, a memorandum taking the position that Han.
son Trust's extensive open market purchases of SCM stock within hours
of terminating its tender offer for that stock created a sufficiently serious
question whether Hanson Trust violated Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act
to support the district court's entry of a preliminary injunction. The Com.
mission argued that a "purported" termination of a tender offer should not
be given effect if designed to evade the Williams Act and that, under an
eight factor test, open market and privately negotiated purchases may con.
stitute an unconventional tender offer. The Second Circuit held that the
purchases by Hanson did not constitute an unconventional tender offer since
the sellers-professional
erbltraqeurs-s-were sophisticated and thus did not
require the protections of the Williams Act.
Commission Action Under Rule 2(e)-Under
Rule 2(e) of its Rules of Practice, the Commission may suspend or bar from practicing before it professionals who have violated the Federal securities laws, been enjoined, or
engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct. Most Rule 2(e)
proceedings involve the conduct of accountants and lawyers; they playa
critical role in the disclosure of full and accurate information to the invest.
ing public. Thus, the ability to discipline those who have engaged in violative
conduct is necessary to protect the integrity of the Commission's processes.
In the last year, final determinations have been reached in several Rule
2(e) proceedings Involving accountants and a lawyer; proceedings are still
pending against other accountants.
In Davy v. SEC, 184 the Ninth Circuit affirmed the Commission's order per.
manently barring an accountant from practice before the Commission based
on antifraud violations and improper professional conduct. Significantly,
the court reaffirmed the validity of Rule 2(e), rejecting a challenge to the
Commission's authority to promulgate the Rule. The court held that the
authority granted the Commission under Section 23(a)(l) of the Exchange
Act to establish rules and regulations "as may be necessary or appropriate

59

I

-

to implement the provisions" of the Act provides the statutory foundation
for the Rule. The court explicitly adopted the 1979 opinion in Touche Ross
v. SEC, 185 in which the Second Circuit comprehensively analyzed the history and bases of the Rule and found it a proper exercise of the Commission's prerogative to discipline professionals whose misconduct could
undermine the Commission's processes. The Davy case thus represents a
significant judicial endorsement of the Commission's authority to regulate
the professionals who practice before it.
In Michael S. Hope, c.P.A., 186 the Commission formally censured Hope,
the engagement partner for the audits of a company's 1980 and 1981financial statements. Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations,
Hope consented to a Commission Opinion and Order finding that his conduct in connection with those audits had been improper within the meaning of Rule 2(eXIXii).The Commission found that the company's 1980 and
1981financial statements were materially misstated and were not presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards because the
auditors had failed to obtain sufficient competent evidence concerning
several assertions in the financial statements, had failed to exercise the due
care required of independent auditors, and had failed to perform the au.
dits with the requisite level of professional skepticism. The Commission
accepted Hope's offer of settlement based on his representation that he had
not practiced before the Commission as an independent public accountant
for over three years.
In another Rule 2(e) proceeding, John E. Harrington and Gregory 8. Arnott,187 the Commission disciplined two accountants for their role in Fox
8- Company's audits of Flight Transportation Corporations' financial statements for 1979, 1980 and 1981.The Commission had charged that Flight,
two of its subsidiaries and its president, during that period, fraudulently
reported nonexistent sales and assets as part of a scheme for attracting publie investments that were to be used for the personal benefit of Flight's
management. Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations,
the two respondents consented to an Opinion and Order finding that Harrington, formerly a partner in Fox & Company, had engaged in improper
professional conduct in all three audits, and that Arnott, formerly a manager
with Fox & Company, had engaged in improper professional conduct in
the 1980 and 1981audits. The Commission found that Harrington and Arnott had not performed the audits in accordance with Generally Accepted
AUditingStandards in that they failed to maintain an attitude of professional
skepticism throughout the audits and had failed to obtain sufficient competent evidence of the existence of the material assets and revenues of
Flight's subsidiaries. What evidence the auditors did obtain for those assets and revenues came directly from Flight's management. Based on its
findings, the Commission barred Harrington from appearing and practicing before it, with permission to apply for readmission after five years. Arnott was suspended with permission to apply for limited readmission after
one year and full readmission after two.
In Gary L. Jackson, 188 the Commission affirmed the administrative law
jUdge's initial decision barring Jackson from practicing as an accountant

60

before the Commission based on entry of a permanent injunction, by consent, against further violations of the reporting provisions of the Exchange
Act. In disciplining Jackson, the Commission relied upon evidence disproving his contention that he was unaware that his audit would be used in a
document filed with the Commission. However, the Commission also em.
phasized that accountants should be aware that certified financial state.
ments may be used in Commission filings without their express consent.
And in Richard Hirschfeld, 169 the Commission adopted the initial decision
of the Administrative Law Judge permanently barring Hirschfeld from practice before it as a lawyer. Hirschfeld was disciplined based on a permanent
injunction for antifraud violations entered by the court in SEC v. Crusmpion Sports Management. 190 Based on Hirschfeld's serious misconduct in that
case and prior injunctions entered against him for antifraud violations, the
Administrative Law Judge held that the public interest required that Hirschfeld be barred permanently from practicing before the Commission as a
lawyer.
Litigation InvoLving Requests for Access to Commission Records-Although

the Commission received numerous Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
and confidential treatment requests in fiscal year 1986, only five of those
requests resulted in the filing of court actions against the Commission; four
were resolved in the Commission's favor and one is pending. The Commission received 1671 requests under the FOIA for access to Commission
records. Approximately 40 % of the 1986 results were for investigatory files.
The Commission also received 2003 requests for confidential treatment
from persons who submitted information. In fiscal year 1986, 64 requestors appealed the denial or partial denial of FOIA requests to the Cornmission's General Counsel, who has delegated authority to decide such appeals.
Additionally, two confidential treatment requesters appealed the denial of
their requests.
In Mermelstein v. SEC, 191 the district court upheld the Commission's withholding under Exemption 8 of the FOIA of a Commission examination
report on a self-regulatory organization. The court agreed with the Com- mission that securities exchanges are "financial institutions" for purposes
of the FOIA and, thus, Commission examination reports of the exchanges
I
may be exempt from disclosure under Exemption 8.
..In Sefecerd Services v. SEC, 192 the district court ruled that an FOIA reo
quester's entitlement to a Vaughn index (a listing of the documents withheld from disclosure) does not attach until after administrative remedies
have been exhausted. The court denied the requester's motion to compel
the Commission to provide a Vaughn index prior to administrative appeal
of the FOIA Officer's decision to withhold various documents. The results
[ of the administrative review, the court noted, could obviate the need for
an index or at least reduce the number of documents in dispute. The requester, therefore, must await the ruling on the administrative appeal but
may thereafter seek a Vaughn index as part of any subsequent judicial
challenge to the final agency action.193

61

The Commission also was served with discovery subpoenas in fiscal year
1986 in private actions in which the Commission is not a party. These private parties seek information from Commission investigatory files or testimony from present or former Commission employees related to their
pending litigation.
-I Litigation Against the Commission and Its Staff-During fiscal year 1986,
- the Commission and its staff were defendants in 39 actions in which perl sons sought to challenge Commission rules, to enjoin Commission law enforcement efforts, to obtain damages awards, or to challenge personnel
decisions. The Commission prevailed in each case decided during the fiscal year; 16 cases were still pending at year-end.
In American Bankers Association v. SEC, 194 the district court affirmed the
- validity of Commission Rule 3b-9. With certain exceptions, that rule requires
a bank that wishes to engage in a general securities business to register
with the Commission as a securities broker-dealer, so that it will be subject
to the requirements imposed on such broker-dealers for the protection of
their customers and the integrity of the securities markets. The American
Bankers Association (ABA) argued that the Commission lacked authority
to adopt the rule because banks had been excluded from the Commission's
regulatory authority. The district court rejected the ABA's argument, holding that Rule 3b-9 falls within an area Congress intended the Commission
to regulate. The court noted that while "banks" were excluded from the
definition of "broker-dealer" in 1934, that exclusion is prefaced by the words
"unless the context otherwise requires," and the services now promoted
by banks are "functionally
Indistinguishable"
from those offered by
registered brokers and dealers. The court held that the statute and legislative history were unclear, and it would defer to the Commission, which had
acted reasonably in promulgating the rule. The ABA's appeal from the district court's decision, decided after the close of the fiscal year, was in favor
of the ABA position.
In Sprecher v. von Stein, 195 the Second Circuit upheld a district court order dismissing fJ suit against the Commission, its Commissioners and three
staff members for failure to state a claim or, alternatively, granting summary judgment for the defendants. The plaintiff claimed that the staff was
conducting an investigation solely to harass him, and alleged violations of
constitutional rights as well as various common-law torts. The court of appeals found the allegations to be "insubstantial," "speculative," "conclusory" and in general "without merit." The court reaffirmed a prior decision
in which it held that the exclusive method to challenge a Commission investigation was in a subpoena enforcement proceeding. Plaintiffs appeal
from the district court's award under Rule II to the Commission of $14,000
in costs and attorneys' fees is currently pending before the Second Circuit.
In Prevatte v. SEC,196 the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of a complaint against the Commission and several Commission em.
ployees alleging that the Commission had unlawfully disqualified plaintiffs
from engaging in the securities business. The court affirmed the lower
court's decision that the claims were barred on res judicata and immunity

62

grounds. The court previously had rejected Prevatte's allegations that his
due process rights had been violated by the NASD and the Commission
in proceedings to bar him from the securities industry.'?"
In addition, the Commission litigated five actions involving personnel
matters. Three were decided in the Commission's favor;196 the remaining
two are pending.
Further, three actions were filed under the Right to Financial Privacy Act
seeking to block the Commission from obtaining access to customer records
at banks. In all of these cases, the district court found that the Commission
was properly seeking the subpoenaed records for a legitimate law enforce.
ment inquiry and enforced the Commission's subpoenas.
Finally, only one motion was filed in court in fiscal year 1986 under the
Equal Access to Justice Act seeking attorneys fees and expenses. The motion is pending.

Significant Legislative Developments
ReguLation of Financial Services-During
the latter part of the 99th Congress, the Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs
of the House Committee on Government Operations conducted a broad inquiry into the fundamental premises underlying the present statutory pro.
visions mandating a separation of banking from commerce and of banking
from investment banking. Chairman Shad testified before the Subcommittee on July 22, 1986, concerning issues suggested by the possibility of legislative relaxation of the prohibitions of the Glass-Steagall Act to permit banks
to engage in additional securities activities. In addition, the Commission
staff prepared extensive responses to the Subcommittee's
requests for ad.
ditional information and factual data related to the underwriting, marketmaking, and investment advisory activities of securities firms, in order to
assist the Subcommittee in evaluating the current competitive situation and
the possible role that banks might play if permitted.
The Commission's testimony reiterated its longstanding view that, as the
lines of demarcation between the banking and securities industries con.
tinue to erode, reform of financial regulation should be governed by the
principle of functional regulation. Functional regulation means that regulation should be by functional activities, rather than by outmoded industry
classification, and fragmented regulation of essentially similar activities
should be ended. Consistent with this principle, the Commission supported permitting banks to underwrite municipal revenue bonds and mutual
funds, provided that they are required to conduct these new and existing
securities activities in separate corporate affiliates within a bank holding
company structure, subject to the same regulations and administered by
the same regulator, as others that engage in such activities.
Regulation of Investment Advisers and FmanciaL Planners-On June II, 1986,
the Chairman testified before the House Subcommittee on Telecomrnunications, Consumer Protection and Finance concerning investment advisers
and financial planners. The Chairman observed that the recent growth of
investment advisers and financial planners correlated with the increase in
63

1

,

securities trading and the 1982-86 bull market and that the available evidence of abuses in the industry was limited. Also, the Chairman noted that
past and contemplated productivity gains by the Commission's staff and
improved coordination with state authorities are enabling current regulation to deal with the industry's expansion. Accordingly, he cautioned against
a hasty extension of Federal regulation in this field.
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act-In May 1986, the
Commission submitted to the Subcommittee on Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary a legislative proposal to amend the private civilliability provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO). The proposal, developed by the Office of the General Counsel, implemented recommendations made by the Chairman in his earlier testimony
before the Subcommittee.
Generally, the proposal (I) provides discretion
to the courts to award costs and attorney's fees to prevailing defendants;
(2) limits civil RICO claims based on mail, wire or securities fraud to cases
with earmarks of organized crime or cases in which the defendant has a
history of criminal misconduct similar to that which caused the plaintiff's
injury; and (3) imposes a uniform statute of limitations on private civil RICO
claims.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977-0n June 10, 1986, Commissioner
Fleischman testified on behalf of the Commission in support of amendments
to the accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977
("FCPA") before a joint hearing of the Subcommittee on Securities and the
Subcommittee on International Finance and Monetary Policy of the Senate
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. The amendments generally would codify the Commission's Policy Statement on the FCPA. The
Commission deferred to the Department of Justice and Commerce with
regard to amendments to the antibribery provisions of the FCPA.
Bank Accounting and Financial Reporting-On
April 24, 1986, Chairman
Shad testified concerning the Commission's responsibilities regarding bank
financial reporting. In that testimony, the Chairman reiterated the recommendation of Vice President Bush's Task Group on Regulation of Financial Services, that regulation of the securities registration and reporting
requirements be consolidated within the Commission. That could be accomplished by requiring all banks and thrifts publicly issuing securities (but
not deposit instruments) to the investing public to comply with the registration requirements of the Securities Act. It also would involve repealing
Section 12(i) of the Exchange Act to transfer administration and enforcement of the reporting requirements to the Commisson.
Financial Reporting and the Role of the Independent Auditor-On
June 23,
1986, Chairman Shad testified concerning financial reporting and the role
of the independent auditor. Specifically he discussed recent private sector
regulatory and legislative initiatives, including a bill currently pending in
Congress entitled the Financial Fraud Detection and Disclosure Act of 1986.
The Chairman indicated that the Commission fully supports any costeffective measures that would improve the current regulatory system.

64

Regulation of the Govemment Securities Markets-Following
passage by
the House of Representatives of legislation that would establish a regulatory system for the government securities markets, the Senate continued to
consider the appropriate regulatory structure for those markets. In April
1986, the Commission joined with the Department of the Treasury and the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in sending to the Chair.
man of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs a letter that
endorsed responsible regulation of the government securities markets. The
agencies also indicated that Treasury would be appropriate as rule-maker
for those markets. Commission staff members provided drafting and other
technical assistance to Committee staff members. On September 3, 1986,
the Senate Committee reported out a bill that conformed with the aqencies' views.

Corporate Reorganizations
The Commission acts in a statutory advisor's role in reorganization cases
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to ensure that interests of pub.
lie investors are adequately protected. In these cases, administered in Fed.
eral court, a debtor generally is allowed to continue business operations
under court protection while it negotiates a plan to rehabilitate the business and to pay the company's debts. Reorganization plans often provide
for the issuance to creditors and shareholders of new securities in exchange
for part or all of their claims or interests in the debtor under an exemption
from registration under the Securities Act provided by the Bankruptcy Code.
In its capacity as special advisor, the Commission may raise or present
its views on any issue in a Chapter 11 case, but it may not initiate an appeal. Although Chapter 11 relief is available to businesses of all sizes, the
Commission generally limits its participation to cases involving debtors that
have publicly traded securities registered under the Exchange Act. In flscal year 1986, the Commission presented its views on a variety of issues.
Committees-Official
committees are empowered to consult with a deb.
tor in possession in the administration of a case and to participate in the
formulation of a plan. With court approval, official committees are permit.
ted to employ, as a cost of administration, one or more attorneys, accountants, or other agents to assist the committee in performing its duties. In
addition to a committee to represent creditors holding unsecured claims,
the Code also allows the court to appoint additional committees for stockholders and others where necessary to assure adequate representation of
their interests in a case. During fiscal year 1986, the Commission moved
or supported motions for the appointment of committees to represent in.
vestors in five Chapter 11 cases.199
In a case having practical significance for the representation of equity
security holders by official committees, In re Evans Products Company, 200
the Commission participated in an appeal to the district court, urging that
the Bankruptcy Code permits regular reimbursement of actual, necessary
expenses of members who serve on official committees based on the same

65

standard applicable to other official participants in the case: that the activities that led to the incurring of the expenses were in furtherance of the
members' statutory duties under the Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy
court had ruled that there was no statutory basis for authorizing expenses
of official committee members and that, even if these were authorized, comi mittee members have the same burden as unofficial participants in the case
of demonstrating that their activities made "a substantial contribution" to
~ the case. The district court agreed with the Commission that there was a
'" statutory basis for authorizing official committee member expenses, but
~ applied the "substantial contribution" test as proposed by the bankruptcy
court. The potential harshness of the test was mitigated, however, by the
district court's additional holding that expenses incurred by members of
an official committee in furtherance of its authorized business are "pre'__ sumed" to be expenses that benefit the estate."?'
_
In In re Psych Systems, lnc., 202 the Commission responded to objections
. filed by creditors concerning the proper standard to be applied to review
c4 of fee applications of counsel for an official equity securities holders' committee where the estate proves to be insolvent. The Commission urged that
; actual necessary professional services, as provided for in Section 330(a)
of the Bankruptcy Code, authorizes compensation to official committee
counsel for services reasonably related to the performance of duties within
" the scope of the official responsibilities of the committee, without regard
to whether those services produce a measurable benefit to the estate or
to the committee's constituents. The matter is pending.
Estate Administration-In
reorganization cases, the Commission acts to
protect the interests of public investors by participating on selected issues,
arising in the administration of the debtor's estate, that have a significant
impact upon the rights of public investors generally.
In In re Johns-Manville Corp., 203 the bankruptcy court, in an action affirmed by the district court, had enjoined the equity security holders' committee and Manville shareholders from pursuing a Delaware state court
action to compel the debtors to hold an annual shareholders' meeting. The
equity committee had stated that it sought a shareholder meeting because
of a dispute with management over how the reorganization was being conducted, but the bankruptcy court found and the district court agreed that
a shareholder meeting would jeopardize the reorganization. In support of
an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the
Commission filed a brief urging reversal of the lower court decisions.
The Commission stated that under the Bankruptcy Code, where ordinarily management remains in possession of the debtor, the shareholders
generally retain their state corporate law rights to elect directors during
the pendency of the reorganization case. The Commission argued that, during the plan negotiation phase of a reorganization case-prior
to the filing
of a plan impairing shareholder interests and the approval of a related disclosure statement-there
should be a strong presumption in favor of the
exercise of the shareholders' corporate franchise to influence the course
of the reorganization. ln this case, the Commission asserted that the deb-

j

66

tor had not overcome the presumption
favoring shareholder
selfgovernance. The Commission pointed out that, in its view, there was no
substantial evidentiary foundation for the bankruptcy court's acceptance
of the debtor's contention that the shareholders' meeting would subvert the
reorganization. The court of appeals reversed the district court, generally
adopting the Commission's positions.
In re Standard Metals 204raised the issue of whether a debtor that had
taken no steps to effect notice to potential creditors not listed on its schedules filed with the court, may invoke the procedures of the Bankruptcy Code
to cut off the right of such creditors to participate in the reorganization.
The bankruptcy court had concluded that, since the claim based on violations of the Federal securities laws by the debtor was unknown to the debtor prior to establishment of the claims bar date, notice of the bar date was
not required. The district court affirmed. In support of an appeal to the
Unite:! States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the Commission argued that the Bankruptcy Code and rules imposed a duty on the debtor
to give at least publication notice to unscheduled creditors and that due
process requires an appropriate form of notice before claims may be barred
and discharged in a reorganization case. The appeal is pending.
In two cases this year,205 the Commission reiterated its position that a
creditor may file a class proof of claim on behalf of other similarly situated
creditors. In its briefs, the Commission has urged that neither the Bankrupt.
cy Code nor the Bankruptcy rules should be read to preclude the filing of
class proofs of claims. In the Commission's view, the broadened claim con.
cept adopted in the Bankruptcy Code, and the prospect that many individuals in a bankruptcy setting may have similarly situated claims, are
inconsistent with a restrictive interpretation of a proof of claim requirement.
Both appeals are pending.
In In re Amarex, Inc.,206 the Commission, in support of an appeal to the
district court, urged that the automatic subordination provision in Section
51O(b) of the Bankruptcy Code-for
rescission of damage claims arising
out of the purchase or sale of securities-should
not be read to subordinate
every claim by security owners against a debtor merely because the claim
would not have existed "but for" the claimant's purchase of the debtor's
securities. The Commission argued that investor claims are not subject to
subordination unless the illegality on which they are based occurs in a securities transaction. The Commission pointed out that it is not uncommon
for security owners to have distinct and legitimate claims other than securities fraud type claims and that the automatic subordination provision
was not intended to affect those claims. The appeal is pending.
In In re Roblin Industries, Inc.,207 the bankruptcy court, as urged by the
Commission, denied a motion by the debtor to approve a stipulation acknowledging the validity of certain bank security interests as a condition
for obtaining post-petition financing from the banks. The Commission had
argued that the debtor had agreed to enter into the stipulation without undertaking any examination of the banks' claims and that the record before
the bankruptcy court, therefore, was insufficient for the court to make an

67

informed judgment as to the propriety of the stipulation. Following the decision, the debtor withdrew an application to approve another portion of
the stipulation that proposed to waive claims and defenses against the
banks.
Plans of Reorganization/Disclosure Statements-A
disclosure statement
is
a
combination
proxy
and
offering
statement
used
in
connection with the
.'1
acceptance of a plan of reorganization that often includes the exchange
of new securities for claims and interests of creditors and shareholders in
~ the debtor. The Bankruptcy Code provides that adequate disclosure is to
.j be made without regard to whether or not the information provided would
:1 otherwise comply with the disclosure requirements of the Federal securities laws. But, in recognition of the Commission's special expertise on disclosure questions, the Bankruptcy Code recognizes the Commission's right
to be heard, distinct from its special advisory role, on the adequacy of disclosure, and the Bankruptcy rules require service on the Commission of
all disclosure statements.
During fiscal year 1986, the Commission received approximately 4,400
disclosure statements filed in Chapter 11 cases involving both privatelyheld and publicly-held corporations. The staff reviewed 207 disclosure statements, including those disclosure statements filed in cases involving a
publicly-held company.
The Commission staff reviews disclosure statements to determine whether
the plan proposed involves the issuance of securities consistent with the
exemption from registration in the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise in compliance with the Federal securities laws. The Commission also reviews disclosure statements to determine whether there is adequate disclosure
concerning the proposed plan. Generally, the Commission seeks to resolve
questions concerning bankruptcy disclosure through staff comments to the
plan proponent. If those cannot be resolved through this process, the Commission may object to the disclosure statement in the bankruptcy court.
During fiscal year 1986 the Commission commented on disclosure statements in 102 cases, and objected to disclosure statements in five cases.
In addition to specific disclosure concerns, the Commission also acts to
assure that public investors are given an adequate opportunity to be heard
on disclosure-related questions and, from time to time, the Commission
objects to confirmation of plans where there is a significant legal question
presented.
The Commission pressed significant objections this year in two cases/OB
to provisions of the debtors' plan and disclosure statement that provided,
upon confirmation of the plan, for the release and discharge of certain nondebtor individuals-officers,
directors and employees of the debtors. The
Commission argued that such a plan provision is contrary to the provision
of the Bankruptcy Code that generally provides that discharges of a debtor
do not affect the liability of any other entity on such debt. The Commission also argued that the proposed release of non-debtor individual liability, without fair consideration paid for such release, was contrary to sound
public policy. Both debtors agreed to delete the plan provisions following
a hearing on the Commission's objections.

1

68

. In In re Continental Airlines Corp., 209 the debtors' plan provided that unsecured creditors would receive deferred payments from the debtors and a
guarantee of those payments by the non-debtor parent of the debtors. The
guarantee was subject to certain terms and conditions that were not dis.
closed because of the "potential prejudice" that the debtors claimed would
result from such disclosures. The Commission argued that, absent a sub.
stantial showing of the need for confidentiality, the debtors should disclose
the terms and conditions of the guarantee as well as financial information
with respect to the guarantor's ability to perform the guarantee. Following
a hearing on the Commission's objections, the debtor agreed to disclose
the terms of the guarantee.
In In re Dakota Minerals,210 the debtor failed to notify equity security
holders of the time fixed for filing objections to, and the hearing to con.
sider approval of its disclosure statement. Instead, the debtor served no.
tice on a recently authorized and nonfunctioning equity security holders'
committee formed one day before the debtor filed its plan and disclosure
statement. The bankruptcy court agreed with the Commission's objections
that restricting notice in this manner was not appropriate. The court held
that, under the Bankruptcy rules, service on the equity security holders'
committee was not a sufficient substitute for notice to equity security
holders.
In In re Standard Metals Corp., 211 the plan and disclosure statement provided for the sale of substantially all of the debtor's assets and classified stock.
holders as "unimpaired," thus not permitting them to vote on the plan. The
Commission filed an objection to confirmation of the plan on the ground
that the proposed sale altered shareholders rights since under state law such
a sale would require approval of a majority of shareholders. Accordingly,
the Commission argued that the interests of shareholders were impaired,
entitling them to vote on the proposed plan of reorganization. The debtor
agreed to amend the plan to classify shareholders as impaired. The court
denied confirmation on other grounds.
Compliance

with the Registration

Requirements

of the Securities Act-

Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code contains a limited exemption from
registration under the Securities Act for the distribution of securities by
a debtor, or an affiliate or successor to the debtor, pursuant to a plan of
reorganization and in exchange for claims against or securities of the deb.
tor. The issuance of securities pursuant to a plan is deemed to be a "public
offering," which means that there is no restriction on resale of such securities unless the seller is an "underwriter" as specifically defined in Section
1145(b). In one case litigated this year, In re Avanti Motor Corp., 212 the deb.
tor's disclosure statement indicated that the debtor intended to rely upon
Section 1145 of the Code for a .proposed public offering of securities in.
tended to fund the plan of reorganization. The Commission objected to the
debtor's disclosure statement because the recipients of securities under the
proposed public offering are members of the general public who do not
have claims against or interests in the debtor. The debtor agreed to com.
ply with the Federal securities laws if it determined to go ahead with the
public offering.

69

Stockbroker Liquidation Proceedings- The commission monitors stockbroker liquidation proceedings conducted under the Bankruptcy Code
rather than under the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act,
for significant legal issues that have an impact on customers of those stockbrokers. In one case this year, In re Korbin Secumies.t> the bankruptcy court,
as urged by the Commission, denied a trustee's motion for turnover of all
of the cash and securities contained in some 4,000 to 6,000 securities accounts maintained by the debtor's clearing broker and "introduced" by Korbin. The Commission had urged that, under the regulatory scheme covering
the relationship between introducing and clearing broker-dealers, an introducing broker ordinarily has no interest in the cash or securities held
by its clients in accounts maintained by the clearing broker-dealer. The
Commission noted, however, that if the introducing broker-dealer engaged
in unauthorized transactions in the client accounts, the ordinary relationship is severed and turnover may be appropriate with respect to the cash
and securities in those particular accounts.

Economic Research and Analyst
The Economic and Statistical Research Program provides the Commission and the operating divisions with the objective perspective and the tech.
nical support required to understand and evaluate the economic aspects
of SEC regulation. This program is carried out by the Office of the Chief
Economist (OCE) and the Directorate of Economic and Policy Analysis
(DEPA).
The economic staff provides the Commission with economic advice and
research studies on rule proposals, established policy and the capital mar.
kets. The staff assists the Commission in making decisions affecting the
efficiency and structure of our nation's securities industry and markets. In
addition, the program encompasses statistical monitoring of major program
initiatives impacting the securities industry and markets and publication
of the SEC's Monthly Statistical Review.
Changes in the market place have increased the number and complexity
of economic issues coming before the Commission. The trend toward in.
creased internationalization
of the securities markets, the rapid growth in
both new issues and secondary market trading, the application of new tech.
nology within the industry and the continued expansion of new financial
products have greatly complicated the analysis of the impact of SEC regulation. New and more complex market structures and trading systems are
also increasing the need for economic analysis. Significant changes in the
operations of the options markets have occurred as a result of the introduction of new automated execution systems on a pilot basis and because com.
peting market centers are now permitted to trade options on the same
underlying NASDAQ security in a competitive framework,
A number of international developments will impact the Commission and
require in-depth economic and policy analysis. The securities markets play
a much larger role in international finance than was the case just a few years
ago. In 1985 alone U.S. issuers raised a record $40 billion through international bond issues and foreign issuers tapped the U.S. bond market for $4.7
billion. U.S. and Canadian securities markets have developed electronic
trading linkages and London participates in the first transatlantic exchange
of quotations in selected stocks. U.S. clearing agencies have begun to develop links with clearing agencies from around the world. The global character of our markets is also reflected in the rapid growth of U.S. and foreign
investors' transactions in each other's stock markets and the fourfold in.
crease since 1983 in the number of U.S. mutual funds investing on a global
basis.
During fiscal 1986, the economic staff reviewed 101 rules and rule
proposals. Rule reviews emphasized the economic costs and benefits of alternative approaches to regulation. In addition, advice was given to the operating divisions on requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),
71

particularly focused on reducing regulatory burdens on small business entities. In fiscal 1986 the economic staff reviewed 25 RFA analyses and 16
RFA certifications.
Staff economists prepared two studies of the effects of multiple trading
on the bid-ask spreads for options in order to assess the impact of competition in the marketplace for these securities and analyzed rule proposals and
amendments related to the exemption
from the short sale rule of OTC Na;
tional Market System Securities traded on exchanges on the basis of unlisted trading privileges. Other analyses examined proposals to amend rules
concerning reserve requirements of broker-dealers, the capital requirements
on positions held by broker-dealers in equity securities and proposed
changes to dealer mark-up disclosure requirements. As part of an on-going
review of broker-dealer financial responsibility rules, the staff analyzed information concerning broker-dealer llquldations by the Securities Investor
Protection Corporation between 1979 and 1984.
During fiscal year 1986 the economic staff published two empirical
studies in the takeover area: "The Economics of Poison Pills" and "Non investment Grade Debt As A Source Of Tender Offer Financing." Also completed was a study of the rules affecting shareholder resale of restricted
securities to determine if more cost-effective rules could be developed to
encourage capital formation while maintaining necessary protection to investors. Additional research was done in policy areas related to corporate
registrants and the staff expanded on its cost/benefit analysis of the proposed quarterly reporting requirement of sales and net profits by business
segments of corporate issuers operating in multiple lines of business.
Two research projects were completed in the area of investment management regulation. One dealt with the relationship between mutual funds performance and sales of fund shares and the effect of sales loads on this
relationship. The other dealt with the growth in the practice of using fund
assets (l2b-l Plans) to promote the distribution of new fund shares.
Other issues analyzed during fiscal 1986 were the differential voting rights
on equity shares and related listing requirements, recent developments in
the takeover debate and the regulation of hostile tender offers.
Additional studies and analyses included an examination of factors affecting stock price runups prior to announcement of tender offers. The impact of SEC's decision to enforce the ceiling test for evaluating reserves
of full-cost oil and gas companies was also studied.

Management and Program Supper
Key 1986 Management

and Program Developments

In carrying out its mission, the Commission made special efforts to solicit
a wide range of view points on issues affecting investors and the securitle:
industry. The Chairman and Commissioners hosted roundtable discussion.
and other forums with industry and investor representatives on issues relating to the effect of rumors upon securities prices, program trading, internationalization of the securities markets, the role and responsibilities of
independent auditors, and regulation of investment advisers and financial
planners. The Commission's Executive Staff coordinated program activities, including concept releases, rule proposals, legislation, and new initiatives.
Information

Systems Management

Under the management of the Office of Information Systems Management (ISM), a total of 314 microcomputers were in use during 1986 through.
out the agency to facilitate the Commission's substantive and administrative
workload. The growth in the number of microcomputers
during the year
brought about an increase in services provided by the User Support Information Center, which presented over 200 training courses with a combined
enrollment exceeding 1,200 students. In addition, the center responded to
over 1,300 requests for technical assistance from microcomputer users.
ISM established a communications link between Edgar and the agency's
mainframe computer, permitting access to workload related databases via
the Edgar workstations. ISM designed and implemented five computer systems that enhanced the effectiveness of Commission personnel. Each system is briefly described below.
An electronic funds transfer subsystem allows the electronic transfer of
paychecks from Treasury to individual employee accounts. A multi-agency
payroll/personnel system permits smaller federal agencies to use the SEC
system to process their payroll and personnel requirements. The performance and management recognition system monitors the scheduling of
personnel evaluations. A system was also developed to track delinquent
disclosure statements made by institutional investment managers (13-F filings). Finally, an automated semi-annual report form (N-SAR) which electronically captures specific information used to monitor investment fund
activity was established in the Division of Investment Management.
Financial Management
Funding in 1986 was initially provided to the SEC through an annual appropriation of $111,100,000.
This amount was later reduced 4.3 % to
73

$106,323,000 by Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation. The net reduction
of $4,777,000 resulted in a loss of 60 staff years, a 3 % decline from 1,994
to 1,934 staff years.
For the fourth consecutive year, and only the fifth year in its 52-year history, the SEC collected fees in excess of its annual appropriation. At the
• end of fiscal year 1986, a record collection of $215 million in fees was
i deposited into the General Fund of the United States Treasury. This
represents twice the amount of the agency's 1986 funding and exceeds the
previous record amount collected in 1985 by $56 million. Fees are generated from four primary sources: securities registered under the Securities
Act of 1933 (57 % of the total), transactions on securities exchanges (21 %),
tender offers and merger filings (19%), and miscellaneous filings (3%).
In 1986, the SEC continued its support of the Administration's Reform
88 initiative, aimed at improving overall agency management and productivity. The Comptroller's staff expanded its use of microcomputers to expedite the preparation of management reports required by the Office of
Management and Budget and other oversight agencies. The staff also revised its accounting manual, incorporating new automation changes into
the SEC accounting system. The use of Diners Club cards for official travel
was instituted, thereby reducing the dra.w of government money from interest bearing accounts, while allowing the traveller more flexibility in paying necessary business expenses.
The Comptroller enhanced the agency's financial accounting system by
providing a single entry update capability for posting entries to the generalledger from subsidiary ledger postings. This change eliminates the need
for separate entries of common data. In addition, an automated inventory
system was designed and implemented.
The SEC payroll system entered its second year as a host system for other
smaller federal agencies. Work is now underway to modify the payroll system to accommodate the new Federal Employee Retirement System options which become effective for all post-1984 employees on January I,
1987.
The Commission is prohibited from accepting reimbursement from regulated entities. The 1983 Securities Exchange Act amendments, however,
gave the Commission the authority to accept payment and reimbursement
from other organizations to defray the cost of travel and subsistence expenses incurred by Commissioners and staff participating in meetings and
conferences related to the functions or activities of the SEC. During 1986,
Commissioners participated in 39 meetings and conferences. To pay the
cost of attendance, private entities reimbursed the SEC $21,170 while the
government's portion amounted to $2,405. SEC staff participated in 345
meetings and conferences. The SEC was reimbursed $101,089; the government's portion of these costs was $16,662.
Facilities Management
The Office of Administrative Services (OAS) handled numerous details
related to the closing of the Washington Regional Office, including the relo-

74

cation of personnel and equipment to the new Philadelphia Regional Office
and to the SEC headquarters. OAS restructured the Public Reference Room
to provide additional seating for the public as well as for personnel of the
agency's dissemination
contractor. OAS facilitated GSA delegation of
authority to enable the Commission to manage property leases for SEC
Offices in Washington, Los Angeles, Denver, Miami, and Houston.
Personnel Management
The Office of Personnel continued to take steps to promote the efficient
utilization of the agency's human resources. The recruitment, development,
and retention of superior candidates and experienced staff remain a high
Commission priority.
During fiscal 1986, the office encouraged programs and projects designed
to enhance the quality of work life for Commission staff. For example, the
orientation
session for new employees was completely
revised. A
professionally-produced
videotape now provides all new staff with a brief
history of the SEC, an overview of agency offices and functions, and welcoming remarks by key officials.
The staff aggressively used recently acquired authority from OPM to hire
accountants and securities compliance examiners. The new procedures have
improved the quality and timeliness of staffing critical positions by shortening the hiring process by five weeks on average.
Training programs emphasized skills development in written communications, microcomputer applications, and litigation techniques and support.
During the past year, approximately 500 headquarters and 300 regional
office staff attended formal training in their disciplines.
The Office of Personnel prepared new or revised policy guidelines for
within-grade quality increases, employee grievances, discipline and performance management. In addition, an automated retirement computation
program was obtained, permitting immediate, on-site preparation of individual figures on annuities and benefits.
The Office of Personnel completed an extensive review and evaluation
of the Personnel Security and Suitability system. The system contains
records of information gathered during employee background investigations conducted by the Office of Personnel Management. This information
assists the Commission in making determinations about the suitability of
applicants for employment with the SEC and of current employees for sensitive positions. As a result, additional controls were implemented to ensure that all existing positions are properly designated as to their sensitivity.
The affected staff is fully aware of its obligations to safeguard confidential
information, as a result of a special training program conducted during the
year.
Public Affairs
The Office of Public Affairs communicates information on Commission
activities to those interested in or affected by Commission actions, includ75

ing regulated entities, the press, employees of the Commission and the
general public.
The office directs publication of the SEC Annual Report that provides
information on Commission activities to Congress, the securities bar and
other interested parties, and, through the Depositary Library System, to
selected colleges and universities throughout the country. Public Affairs
publishes a regular newsletter and prepares a daily summary of news clips
for Commission employees. Speeches presented by Commissioners and
senior staff and testimony are retained and disseminated in response to
requests from the public. During the year, the staff responded to approximately 63,500 requests for information and coordinated programs for more
than 310 foreign visitors. Also during the year, the staff updated and revised such publications as the "SEC Publications Guide," "Investigate Before You Invest," and "Q&A for Small Business."
Public Affairs staff prepares the SEC News Digest, which provides information on virtually all SEC actions-rule
changes, enforcement actions
against individuals or corporate entities, acquisition reports, releases, decisions on requests for exemptions, upcoming Commission meetings, and
other events of interest. Information on Commission activity is also disseminated through notices of administrative actions, litigation releases, and
other materials. The News Digest is available in the Public Reference Room.
Press releases issued prior to Commission meetings and press briefings
conducted after these meetings provide insight into proposed and adopted changes in policies and regulation. The office also issues press releases
on upcoming events, on-going programs, and special projects. In all, 75
news releases were issued during the year. When appropriate, actions are
brought to the attention of the national and regional press. Special projects,
such as roundtable discussions on emerging issues in the financial markets, are also publicized.
Consumer Affairs
During fiscal year 1986, the Commission staff responded to more than
36,000 complaints and.Inquirles. Of these, nearly 50% involved investor
disputes with registered broker-dealers, 17% concerned issuers of securities, and 6% pertained to banks. The remainder regarded transfer agents
and investment advisers, or were general inquiries.
Specialists in Consumer Affairs review and respond to all complaint letters. If the investor's concern can best be answered by the investment firm
itself, the matter is referred there for review and resolution. Staff contacted firms in 27% of the cases on behalf of the investor. Consumer Affairs
refers to the appropriate SEC division those matters which appear to violate federal securities laws.
Consumer Affairs received 1,535 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and 1,960 confidential treatment requests during the year. Confidential treatment requests were typically made in connection with proprietary

76

corporate information and were carefully evaluated to prevent the in.
discriminate and unwarranted release of information exempt from the FOIA.
In addition, the staff answered 1,335 congressional inquiries.
Finally, over 20,000 people visited the Commission's Public Reference
Rooms. To assist these visitors, the staff wrote a booklet entitled "Welcome
to the SEC's Public Reference Room," which explains the operation of the
room and identifies the types of materials available for public review.

Equal Employment Opportunity
The Commission continued its program of Equal Employment Oppertunity instruction for managers and supervisors. Fifty staff members attend.
ed training at headquarters dealing with equal employment opportunity law,
affirmative action, sexual harassment,
EEO discrimination
complaint
processing, and methods for improving employment opportunities for
minorities and women. Additionally, the Commission's first EEO confer.
ence in over five years was held in Rosslyn, Virginia, for EEO collateral duty
personnel (i.e., EEO Counselors, Federal Women Program Coordinators
and Hispanic Employment Program Coordinators). Twenty-nine employees
attended this meeting, which was intended to enhance participants'
knowledge and skills in EEO program management.
During the year, the employment of Black women increased by 1.0%
and Hispanics by 0.3%. Employment for all other minority groups and for

133The Market Surveillance Committee (MSC) was recently established by the
NASD as a responsee to the growth and visibility of the NASDAQ market, and
the resulting need for an effective mechanism to deal with NASDAQ disciplinary matters. Of national jurisdiction, it reviews investigations> and disciplines
members for all market-related trading violations such as insider trading, market manipulation, and marklnq-the-close, as well as market maker technical
violations, including excess spreads, erroneous trade reporting and failure to
report volume. The MSC meets four times a year, and its subcommittees (Investigations, which reviews all Market Surveillance investigations, and Compliance, which reviews all NASDAQ market maker violations) meets eight times a
year.
134The staff also completed the processing of 6 applications that had been
pending at the end of the 1985 final year.

APPENDIX
THE SECURITIES

INDUSTRY

Revenues, Expenses, and
Selected Balence Sheet Items
Broker-dealers that are self-regulated
through
their
membership
in a
registered securities exchange or the
National Association of Securities Dealers produced revenues of $50.2 billion
in 1985, 27 percent above the 1984 level. I Almost 61 percent of this increase
in revenues stemmed from the growth
of revenues from the principal securities
activities (brokerage, principal transactions and underwriting). The "all other
revenues," which include interest income from securities purchased under
agreements to resell and fees from handling private placements, mergers and
acquisitions, accounted for 33 percent
of revenues in 1985.

Securities commission
income increased $1.8 billion or 19 percent, while
mutual fund sales rose 88 percent. Trading gains on firms' securities accounts
increased $2.9 billion, or 30 percent,
and represented 25 percent of total
revenues in 1985. Profits from underwriting increased $1.7 billion, and rose
as a percent of total revenues to ten percent in 1985.
Pre-tax income increased 133 percent
from the preceding year to $6.6 billion.
as expenses grew by $6.8 billion (18 percent) to $43.6 billion in 1985.
Assets rose by $142.0 billion to
$456.2 billion and liabilities grew
$136.2 billion to $431.7 billion. Ownership equity increased $5.9 billion during 1985 to $24.5 billion at year's end.

IDue to changes in FOCUS reporting
requirements, consolidated information
for 1981 is not available. In order to provide consistent information, new financial data was developed for prior years

and Table 1 now presents unconsolidated data for all years. This data will not
be comparable to the Table 1 published
in the SEC Annual Report for 1981 and
prior years.

Securities Industry Dollar In
1985 For Carrying and
Clearing Firms
Data for carrying and clearing firms
only are presented here to allow for
more detail, as reporting requirements
for introducing and carrying and clearing firms differ and data aggregation of
these two types of firms necessarily
results in loss of detail. Carrying and
clearing firms are those firms which
clear securities transactions or maintain
possession or control of customers' cash
or securities. This group produced 87
percent of the securities industry's total
revenues.
Securities commissions and trading
gains accounted for 20 cents and 26
cents, respectively, of each revenue dollar in 1985. Together these two items
accounted for 46 cents of each revenue
dollar generated in 1985 the same as in
1984. In terms of dollars, they accounted for $20.2 billion of the $43.7 biIlion
of total revenues earned by carrying and
clearing firms. Margin interest income
accounted for six cents of each revenue
dollar in 1985 compared with nine cents
in 1984.
Total expenses consumed 88 cents of
each revenue dollar earned in 1985, six
cents less than the 1984 level of 94
cents. This improved the industry's pretax profit margin from six cents per
revenue dollar in 1984 to 12 cents in
1985.
Interest expense, again the single largest expense item, declined in 1985 by
ten percent to absorb 26 cents of each

revenue dollar, which compares to 30
cents in 1984. In dollars, interest expense increased to $11.4 billion, $1.0
biIlion more then the year before.
Employee-related expenses (registered
representatives' compensation and clerical and administrative employees' expenses) consumed 34 cents of the
revenue dollar in 1985, with no change
from 1984. Registered representatives'
compensation
was 32 percent more
than the 1984 level and absorbed 19
cents of each revenue dollar in 1985
compared to 18 cents in the previous
year. In dollar terms, employee-related
expenses accounted for $14.9 billion of
the $38.4 biIlion of total expenses.
Other expense categories consumed
about the same proportion of the industry revenue dollar in 1985 as they did
in 1984.
Total assets of broker-dealers carrying and clearing customer accounts rose
by $133.5 biIlion to $437.4 biIlion in
1985. About 56 percent of this increase
in assets can be attributed to two items:
resale agreements rose $33.3 billion,
and long positions increased $42.0
biIlion.
Total liabilities, including subordinated debt, increased $128.3 biIlion or 45
percent to $416.5 biIlion with increases
in repurchase agreements of $26.4 billion and short positions in securities of
$30.3 biIlion. Owners' equity rose 33
percent from $15.8 billion in 1984 to
$21.0 biIlion, and total capital increased
33 percent to $27.0 billion from $20.2
billion in 1984.

Self-Regulatory Organizations:
Revenues, Expenses, Pre-Tax
Income and Balance Sheet
Structure.
In 1985 the total revenues of selfregulatory organizations ("SROs") rose
approximately $85.3 million to $645.1
million, an increase of 15% over 1984
(the 1984 increase was 8% over 1983).
The New York Stock
Exchange
("NYSE"), National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASO") and American
Stock Exchange ("Amex") accounted
for 68% of the SROs' total revenues.
Most SRO revenues came from listing,
trading, and market data fees. The
NYSE reported total revenues of $257.7
million, of which 56 % consisted of listing and trading fees. The Amex report.
ed total revenues of $84.5 million, of
which 56% consisted of listing and trading fees. The Amex reported total
revenues of $84.5 million, of which 72 %
were derived from transaction and com.
munications charges. The NASO reported total revenues of $97.3 million. The
Chicago Board Options Exchange
("CBOE") had the largest percentage increase in revenues over last year, 31 %.
The total expenses of all SROs were
$564.1 million in 1985, an increase of
$64 million (13%) over 1984. The Mid.
west Stock Exchange ("MSE") had the
largest percentage increase in total expenses, 37%. The Cincinnati Stock Exchange ("CSE") reduced
its total
expenses by 20 %.
Aggregate pre-tax income of all SROs
rose to $73.8 million in 1985 from $56.9
million in 1984, an increase of 30%.
Pre-tax profit margins widened because
aggregated
total revenues increased
15% and aggregate total expenses increased only 13%. These wider margins
can be partly attributed to rising trading volume and a corresponding
increase in transaction fees. The NYSE
had a pre-tax income of $35.7 million,
a 120% increase from 1984. The
CBOE's pre-tax income increased of
$7.8 million, from $1.4 million in 1984
to $9.2 million in 1985, an increase of

4.57% (but this increase largely reflects
CBOE's unusually low pre-tax income in
1984). The Arnex's net income rose to
$9.6 million in 1985 from $9.3 million
in 1984, a 4% increase. The Ph lx's net
income rose to $2.1 million in 1985
from $2.0 million in 1985, a 4 % increase. The Boston Stock Exchange's
("SSE's'') pre-tax income rose to $687
thousand in 1985 from $588 thousand
in 1984, a 17% increase. The Pacific
Stock Exchange ("PSE") had a 1985 pretax income of $1.1 million against a loss
of $759 thousand in 1984. Finally, the
CSE had a pre-tax loss of $37 thousand
against a 1984 pre-tax loss of $775 thousand, reducing its pre-tax loss, year to
year, by 95%.
The total assets of all SROs were
$1,188 million in 1985, an increase of
44% from 1984. The NYSE's total assets increased by $54.4 million or 30%,
from 1984 to 1985. The total assets of
the MSE and the Phlx also increased significant but these increases were due
largely to increased asset levels at certain subsidiaries.
The aggregate net worth of the SROs
rose to $400.9 million in 1985 from
$352.3 million in 1984, an increase of
14 %. The largest percentage increase
was at the BSE (39%), followed by the
Phlx (21 %), the Spokane Stock Exchange (19%), and the NASO (18%).
The NYSE's net worth increased by 13%
from $144.6 million to $162.8 million.
The only decrease occurred at CSE,
where net worth decreased by $36 thousand, from $111 thousand in 1984 to
$75 thousand in 1985, a 32% reduction.
Aggregate clearing agency service
revenue increased by 20%, or $38 million in 1985 due to comparable increases in securities trading volumes.
Total depository service revenue increased $23 million, due primarily to a
$15 million gain by the Depository Trust
Company CDTC") and a $5 million gain
by the Midwest Securities Trust Company ("MSTC"). Service revenue of clearing corporations
increased by $15
'1 million, due largely to increases of more
than $6 million at both the Options

118

Clearing Corporation ("OCC") and the
National Securities Clearing Corporation ("NSCC").
The depositories continued to expand
the base for service revenues by increasing the number of shares on deposit and
the face value of debt securities in custody. At the end of 1985 the total value
of securities in the depository system
reached $2.3 trillion. DTC alone held
over $1.2 trillion and, in addition, had
more than $780 billion in FAST balance
certificates at transfer agents. This
movement of certificates into deposito.
ries was made possible by the further ex.
pansion of the number of depository
eligible issues. The MSTC had 377,000
eligible securities issues at year end,
while DTC had over 262,000. The major
portion of this composite growth was in
municipal bonds, which increased 84%
to $319 billion of face value, and
represents half the value of all municipal
bonds outstanding in the United States.
Total depository pre-tax income was
ten times the previous year's result.
DTC's excess of revenues over expenses
of $5 million represents 80% of the aggregate pre-tax income for all depositories. The DTC determined
that the
amount of shareholders' equity should
be increased to mitigate business uncertainties. DTC, like all clearing agencies,
adjusts refunds of fees and fee structures-to provide funds to meet expenses
and provide the amount of earnings
which it wishes to retain.
The clearing corporations recorded
an aggregate increase in pre-tax income
of more than $3 million. NSCC posted
a pre-tax gain of almost $3.3 million, up
$2.5 million over 1984. NSCC has stated that $1 million of net income will be
used for the purpose of providing
capitalization for the new International
Securities
Clearing
Corporation
("ISCC"), a wholly owned subsidiary.
ISCC was established in November 1985
to provide services for U.S. institutions

119

through linkages with clearing agencies
in other countries. The OCC also record.
ed a significant increase in pre. tax income, $1.1 million, as compared to $80
thousand in 1984. The OCC also realized $333 thousand from the sale of
stock to NASD, which became a participant. As a result, OCC shareholders
equity increased
more than $1.3
million.
The Pacific Clearing Corporation
("PCC") incurred a pre-tax loss of over
$1.2 million after reporting a profit of
$678 thousand in 1984. The Pacific
Securities Depository Trust Company
("PSDTC") reported a pre-tax gain of
$189 thousand in 1985 versus a pre-tax
operating loss of $46 thousand the
previous year. In 1985, PSE, the parent
company, transferred funds from equities trading to PCC and PSDTC in the
amounts of $665 thousand and $272
thousand, respectively; these transfers
are included in revenues. Further PSE
support to its subsidiaries was provided by forgiving allocated administrative
and financial services given by the parent to PCC ClndPSDTC in the amounts
of $756 thousand and $931 thousand,
respectively. The combined net worth of
PCC and PSDTC declined by about one
half to $433 thousand.
The aggregate of all clearing corporation and depository net worth rose by
$8 million to a new high of almost $33
million. In addition to net worth, participant clearing fund contributions provide protection to the clearing agencies
in the event of a participant default.
Should a participant default and his
losses exceed his deposit, the entire participants' fund may be charged on a pro
rata basis. No clearing agency has ever
assessed non-failing participants' contributions. During 1985 the equity clearing funds increased by one-third to $277
million, option clearing funds increased
$22 million and depository clearing
funds remained at $214 million.

EXEMPTIONS
Section 12(h) Exemptions
Section 12(h) of the Exchange Act
authorizes the Commission to grant a
complete or partial exemption from the
registration provisions of Section 12(g)
or from other disclosure and insider
trading provisions of the Act where such
exemption is consistent with the public
interest and the protection of investors.
For the year beginning October 1,
1985, 4 applications were pending. and
an additional 18 applications were filed
during the year. Of these 22 applications, 11 were granted and 1 was denied
and 1 withdrawn. Nine applications were
pending at the close of the year.

Exemptions For Foreign
Private Issuers
Rule 12g3-2 provides various exemptions from the registration provisions of
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act for
the securities of foreign private issuers.
Perhaps the most important of these is
that contained
in subparagraph
(b)
which provides an exemption for certain
foreign issuers which submit. on a cur.
rent basis, the material specified in the
rule. Such material includes that information about which investors ought
reasonably to be informed and which
the issuer: (1) has made public pursuant
to the law of the country of domicile or
in which it is incorporated or organized;

123

(2) has filed with a foreign stock exchange on which its securities are traded and which was made public by such
exchange; and or (3) has distributed to
its security holders. Periodically, the
Commission publishes a list of those foreign issuers which appear to be current
under the exemptive provision. The
most current list is as of July 31. 1985
and contains a total of 559 foreign
issuers.

Rule 10b-6 Exemptions
Exchange Act Rule 10b.6 is an antimanipulative rule that prohibits trading
in securities by persons interested in a
distribution of such securities. During
the fiscal year, the Commission granted 32 exemptions pursuant to paragraph
(h) of Rule 10b-6 under
circumstances indicating that the proposed transactions did not appear to
constitute manipulative or deceptive
devices or contrivances comprehended
with in the purposes of the rule.

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
There
were 2.583
companies
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as of September 3D,
1985. New registrations totaled 299,
with 47 registrations terminated during
the fiscal year. This compares with 1984
fiscal year figures of 2,331 total registrations, 256 new registrations and 54
terminations.

Again in 1986, the number of electronic book entries in settlement of
securities transactions among DTC participants outpaced physical deliveries.
This trend may be measured by noting
the ratio of computer book-entry deliveries to total certificates withdrawn.
These figures exclude municipal bearer bonds. While the combined number
of shares traded on the Consolidated
Tape and NASDAQ increased by 26%

in 1985 and the number of NSCC trade
settlements increased 28%, the number
of certificates withdrawn decreased in
1985 by 10%. While the total certificates withdrawn from DTC increased
slightly in 1986, the ratio of the bookentry deliveries to certificates withdrawn
has increased to 7.3 to 1 in 1986. In
1981, only 2.4 book-entry deliveries
were made for every certificate
withdrawn.

ENFORCEMENT
Types of Proceedings
As the table reflects, the securities
laws provide for a wide range of enforce.
ment actions by the Commission. The
most common types of actions are injunctive proceedings instituted in the
Federal district courts to enjoin continued or threatened securities law vio-

lators, and administrative proceedings
pertaining to broker-dealer firms and/or
individuals associated with such firms
which may lead to various remedial
sanctions as required in the public in.
terest. When an injunction is entered by
a court, violation of the court's decree
is a basis for civil or criminal contempt
against the violator.

of five companies. This compares with
six in fiscal year 1985. In most instances, the trading suspension was ordered because of substantial questions

Foreign Restricted

List

The Securities and Exchange Com.
mission maintains and publishes a For.
eign Restricted List which is designed to
put broker-dealers,
financial institutions, investors and others on notice of
possible unlawful distributions of for.
eign securities in the United States. The
list consists of names of foreign companies whose securities the Commission
has reason to believe have been, or are
being offered for public sale in the United States in possible violation of the
registration requirement of Section 5 of
the Securities Act of 1933. The offer and
sale of unregistered securities deprives
investors of all the protections afforded
by the Securities Act of 1933, including
the right to receive a prospectus containing the information required by the
Act for the purpose of enabling the investor to determine whether the investment is suitable for him. While most
broker-dealers refuse to effect transactions in securities issued by companies
on the Foreign Restricted List, this does
not necessarily prevent promotors from
illegally offering such securities directly to investors in the United States by
mail, by telephone, and sometimes by
personal solicitation. The following foreign corporations and other foreign entities comprise the Foreign Restricted
List.
