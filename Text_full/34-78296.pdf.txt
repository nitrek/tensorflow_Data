EXTENSION ORDER

Pursuant to the Order Scheduling Briefs in this matter, Applicant’s brief in
support of his Application for Review was due June 23, 2106, and FINRA’s opposition is
due July 25, 2016. FINRA has requested an extension of time until July 29, 2016, to file
its opposition to Applicant’s brief, stating that it did not receive Applicant’s brief until
June 28, 2016.
Extensions of time are disfavored. It appears appropriate, however, to grant a
brief extension. Therefore,
It is ORDERED that FINRA’s opposition brief is due July 29, 2016 and
Applicant’s reply brief is due August 12, 2016. No further extensions will be granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Jill M. Peterson
Assistant Secretary
