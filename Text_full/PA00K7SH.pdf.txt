Abstract:
The USAID Pakistan Firms project aims to assist the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Board of Investment and Trade (KPBOIT) in meeting its mandate of promoting
investment and trade in the province. In an effort to assist KPBOIT in developing
adequate legal structure, a comprehensive study of possible legal structures
was carried out. Based on the results of that study and approvals from provincial
government, it was concluded that the KPBOIT should act as an autonomous
body formed under statute. This report presents the manual on Human
Resource policies and procedures developed for KP-BOIT.

7.3

Performance Evaluation Phases

KPBOIT Performance Appraisal Process is carried out in several steps starting at the beginning
of the year by the direct supervisor agreeing with the employee on job responsibilities.
Employee’s performance targets shall be in line with the section and organization's objectives.
Performance Management at KPBOIT is a continuous process that is divided into three phases,
following are details of each phase in the Performance Management Cycle:
a) Phase I: Objective Setting
b) Phase II
: Mid-Year Progress Review
c) Phase III: Annual Performance Appraisal

7.3.1

Phase 1: Objective & KPI setting

Performance Management at KPBOIT will be initiated with the setting of individual
performance objectives on objective setting form (template provided in Annex 6) at the
start of the year. The Objectives Setting Exercise focuses on giving each employee an
understanding of how his/her work connects to, and serves both the short-term (projectbased) and long-term goals of KPBOIT and cascading down the overall KPBOIT

Final Report

strategy. Employees will be required to align their performance objectives with their
Directorate’s which in turn will give them better visibility of their contribution to the
KPBOIT performance.
Directorate and individual objectives need to be SMART, i.e.:






Specific;
Measurable;
Achievable;
Result-oriented; and
Time bound

Objectives should cover an employee’s core responsibilities, and subject to revision as
when required. Ideally each individual should have enlisted five to seven objectives
which should be clearly documented.
Achievement against performance objectives will be gauged by assessing percentage
achieved against each objective, progress will be assessed during the Mid-Year
Progress Review and the Annual Appraisal.

7.3.2

Phase 2: Mid-Year Review

To evaluate employees’ performance in the first six months of the calendar year, a
progress review exercise will be conducted from the 1st of July, every year. The MidYear Progress Review will assess performance on progress against annual objectives
set at the start of the year, and will provide an opportunity for developmental feedback
and corrective action.
In the Mid-Year Progress Review performance will be evaluated on the following ratings:



Performance meets the required standards and expectations; employee has the
necessary ability to effectively carry out responsibilities of the current position.
Performance lacks consistency; employee does not meet required standards /
expectations in one or more areas & requires additional monitoring and
supervision.

The Mid-Year Progress Reviews shall be carried out by the Head of relevant
Directorateon Interim Review Sheets (template provided in Annex 7) that shall be
handed over to HR. This complete activity shall be executed within the month of July.

7.3.3

Phase 3: Annual Performance Appraisal

A comprehensive discussion on the performance and achievements of the employee will
be conducted during the Annual Performance Appraisal; however, Coaching, Counseling
and Guidance must be an on-going process for the desired improvement and
development.
The Annual Performance Appraisal is a guiding tool for the employees and is crucial for
performance feedback, future promotions, increments and incentives. In the
Performance Appraisal Form (template provided in Annex 8), performance will be rated
on a point scale:
a) Outstanding (Performance Rating Score: Equal to or above 3.5): Work
performance consistently exceeds job requirements. Employee goes beyond the
parameters of the job & makes exceptional contribution to the organization.

USAID Firms Project

Page. 32

Human Resource Policies and Procedures Manual - KPBOIT

Final Report

b) Exceeds Expectations (Performance Rating Score: Greater than (or equal to) 2.5
lower than 3.5): Work performance is consistently above the standards of
performance for the position.
c) Meets Expectations (Performance Rating Score: Greater than (or equal to) 1.5
lower than 2.5): Work performance consistently meets the standards of
performance for the position and team.
d) Improvement Needed (Performance Rating Score: Greater than (or equal to) 1
lower than 1.5): Work performance does not consistently meet the standards of
performance for the position. Effort is needed to improve performance and bring
it in line with team performance standards.
e) Unacceptable (Performance Rating Score: Lower than 1): Work performance is
inadequate and inferior to the standards of performance required for the position.
Performance at this level cannot be allowed to continue.
Employees who get a performance rating of “Improvement needed” in their Performance
Evaluation Report (PER) will not qualify for a salary raise, promotion or incentive. These
employees will be put on a three-month Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), with clear
expected deliverables agreed between the employees and their Head of Directorate.
This will help ensure that timely developmental feedback is provided to employees with
serious development needs. The PIP process will be driven by head of Directorate and
an HR representative. Employee’s performance will be evaluated in the Annual
Appraisal to judge whether he/she has shown the desired improvement. In case the
desired improvement has not been shown, KPBOIT may decide to relieve the employee
of his/her services.

7.4

Performance Evaluation Report (PER)

Based on the Annual Performance Appraisal and midyear review, a comprehensive
Performance Evaluation Report (PER) shall be prepared by the head of relevant Directorate.
PER shall incorporate the evaluation process followed and the results of the performance
evaluation process with an overview of the relevant employee’s profile.
PER shall also incorporate the recommendations of the head of relevant directorate as to the
action that should be carried out to improve performance. These actions may include (but not
limited to) trainings, mentor ship, promotions, salary raise, incentives, benefits etc.
The performance Evaluation Report (PER) shall be handed over to the head of HR along with
the performance Appraisal form. Head of HR shall ensure that the PER is in line with the
Performance Appraisal Form and Interim Review Sheet. Head of HR shall ensure that the
evaluation process and guidelines embodied in this manual have been appropriately followed

Informal and Formal;

10.1.1 Level 1: Informal Procedures
Step 1 – Informal Discussion/Counseling:
The management of KPBOITrecognizes that the majority of its staff member sincerely
wants to do what is required of them and follow the policies and procedures. An
unsatisfactory conduct or performance may, in the first instance, be subject of informal
discussions, counseling and offering every opportunity to improve performance or

USAID Firms Project

Page. 39

Human Resource Policies and Procedures Manual - KPBOIT

Final Report

encourage an executive to improve his conduct or performance, a counseling session
with the head of relevant directorate may be held.
This session is used to bring the employee’s attention to the aspects in which it is
thought that performance or conduct is unsatisfactory (for example, an issue of time
keeping) and to ascertain whether the employee recognizes that there is a problem.
Step 2 – Verbal Warning:
A verbal warning is likely to be appropriate when there is a first breach of rule(s), and the
breach is of a minor nature. The Verbal warning is an important step in the disciplinary
process, because it is at this point that cause for further action may be prevented or - if
cause persists - provides the foundation for further action(s).

10.1.2 Level II – Formal Procedures:
The formal procedure may follow a pattern of written warnings where previous informal
disciplinary action has not resulted in improvements of either performance or behavior.
In case, if a single act of misconduct may be of a sufficiently serious nature to be
addressed and an investigation is required to determine the cause of the event then step
1&2 shall be ignored.
Step 1 - First Written Warning:
First written warning is likely to be appropriate when there is:
a) A continued, or a repeated, breach of a rule(s) as mentioned in KPBOIT
Disciplinary Code or
b) A first breach of a rule or misconduct which, when assessed, is of sufficient
gravity to warrant a penalty higher than a verbal warning.
c) A written warning may or may not be preceded by a verbal warning depending on
the seriousness of the inappropriate behavior or if one or more verbal warnings
have been ineffective in correcting conduct or behavior.
Warning letter shall be formed by the head of HR and approved by the CEO / secretary
of board. Copy of warning letter shall be recorded in the employees personnel file while
the original shall be handed over to the relevant employee.
Step 2 - Second (Final) Written Warning:
If same offence is occurred again or performance/conduct fails to improve written
warning shall be given by filling Disciplinary Form by the HR, followed by a formal
disciplinary interview with the head of Directorate. The second written warning gives
details of the offence and of the required improvement, and copy shall be placed in the
personal file held in the HR while the original shall be handed over to the employee.
Step 3 –Investigation & Suspension and Enquiry
a) Suspension
 Where there are allegations of Criminal practices or Gross Misconduct, the
employee shall be suspended as soon as it is determined that there is a case
of Criminal practices or Gross misconduct. Suspension does not in itself
constitute a disciplinary act, but allows for a fair investigation totake
place.The order of suspension is communicated in writing to the employee.
 An executive under suspension will be paid his basic pay only and the
maximum period of this suspension is 2 months.

Objective setting is the part of KPBOIT performance management process. It provides powerful mechanism for
delivery of KPBOIT’s strategy and enhances our career opportunities by aligning the goals of every
individual with KPBOIT’s vision, values and objectives. Objective setting enables us to maximize our
potential both as individual and as Society.
Objective setting and development plannning is the first step in the process and ensures that at any time during
the year, every staff member of KPBOIT can answer the following 5 key questions:
What are the KPBOIT’s goals?
What are my department goals?
What is my role in the department and what are my goals?
How will I be measured and rewarded?
What are my career opportuinites at KPBOIT?
In developing your objectives for this performance year, review relevant targets(financial and non financial) in
your career plan as competencies for your role. You should then set the roles in following areas:
KPBOIT goals
Persoanl development goals
Career aspirations
Mobility
Note: If you change job assignment part way through the year, be sure to confirm or revise these goals with your
new departmental head.
Guide for Objective setting: Think about what you will do to support KPBOIT and your business area to
achieve our strategy. Please outline your critical three business goals below and include measures of success,
e.g. relevant Key Performance Indicators. When considering how you will achieve your goals you should
cover specific supporting activities. These could include behaviours, technical skills and market knowledge.

Development Goals

well as those behaviours that will be useful for future career progression. Please also consider any
continuous professional development/education requirements from your professional institute when
determining your development goals. Consider your career plans for next 1-3 years. What opportunities,
development, resources and other support will you require in order to achieve these goals?
