On August 22, 2016, a judgment of conviction was entered against Weed in

District of Massachusetts, finding him guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit securities
fraud and wire fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371; one count of
securities fraud, in violation of Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78j(b) and 78ff, and Title
17, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 240.10b-5, and Title 18, United States Code, Section 2;
and seven counts of wire fraud in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1343, 1349,
and 2. Weed’s conviction arises out of, inter alia, his role in a scheme to pump and dump the

Rule 102(e)(2) provides in pertinent part: “Any attorney who has been suspended or disbarred by a court
of the United States or of any State; . . . or any person who has been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor

In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that Weed has been convicted of a felony
within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED, that Richard Weed is forthwith suspended from appearing
