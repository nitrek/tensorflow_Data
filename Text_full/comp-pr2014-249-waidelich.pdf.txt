SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION,
Plaintiff,

CIVIL ACTION No.

v.

HON.

ERIC C. WAIDELICH,
Defendant.
___________________________________/
COMPLAINT
Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), alleges and states as
follows:
SUMMARY
1.

The Securities and Exchange Commission brings this civil action in connection

with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by Defendant Eric C.
Waidelich (“Defendant” or “Waidelich”). Defendant was the City Administrator for the City of
Allen Park, Michigan (“the City” or “Allen Park”) who reported to the City’s Mayor and to
Allen Park’s governing body, the City Council.
2.

In 2008 the City began planning an economic development project in the form of

a $146 million movie studio (“Studio Project”) with eight sound stages, led by a Hollywood
executive director. The City intended to support the development in part by $31 million of
issuing bonds, which it ultimately did on November 12, 2009 and June 16, 2010 (collectively

1

2:14-cv-14279-TGB-MJH Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 2 of 14

Pg ID 2

“Bonds”). The City initially intended to repay the bond debt service with $1.6 million of
revenue from leases at the Studio Project.
3.

As the City Administrator, Defendant Waidelich was primarily responsible for

executing the City Council’s directives, including the plans for the Studio Project and the
supporting Bonds.
4.

By the time the City issued the Bonds, however, the plans to implement and pay

for the Studio Project had deteriorated significantly. None of these changes, however, were
reflected in the Bond offering documents nor in any of the City’s other public statements.
5.

Instead, the Bond offering documents continued to repeat the City’s original plans

for the Studio Project. In fact, by the time the Bonds were issued, the Studio Project had
deteriorated to the point where it was much smaller, consisting of building and operating a
vocational school. The deterioration put the City’s ability to service the debt for the Bond
offering at substantial risk.
6.

In addition, in connection with the Bond offerings, the City included outdated

budget information which did not reflect Waidelich’s knowledge that the City faced a budget
deficit for Fiscal 2010 of at least $2 million, or over 8.4% of its total general revenue fund.
7.

Waidelich was aware of the deterioration of the scope and viability of the Studio

Project as well as of the City’s budget deficit. He nonetheless participated in drafting the
offering documents for the Bonds which falsely stated that the Studio Project would still be the
$146 million, full-service facility with eight sound stages, led by the Hollywood executive.
8.

Through the activities alleged in this Complaint, Defendant Waidelich, directly or

indirectly, engaged in transactions, acts, practices or courses of business which constitute
2

2:14-cv-14279-TGB-MJH Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 3 of 14

77q(a)(2)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15
U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5(b) [17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5(b)] promulgated thereunder.

12.

practices and courses of business alleged herein.
FACTS
Background
13.

The Allen Park City Administrator was responsible for running the City’s daily

operations including preparing and submitting annual budgets to the City Council, and carrying
3

2:14-cv-14279-TGB-MJH Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 4 of 14

Pg ID 4

out City Council directives. The City Administrator was required to report to the City Council
on “any and all matters” that “may require the Council’s attention and action” and to perform
“such other duties as may be prescribed . . . by ordinance or by direction of the Council.”
14.

The City of Allen Park is located 13 miles from the City of Detroit, Michigan. It

previously has been governed by a City Council consisting of six elected members and the
Mayor. The City is currently in receivership and was governed by an Emergency Manager
whose appointment expired at the end of September 2014. After the Emergency Manager
departed, a Receivership Transition Advisory Board (RTAB) consisting of members appointed
via a final Order of the Emergency Manager was installed to oversee the transition of the City to
home rule. The City ultimately will return to being governed by a seven-member City Council.
15.

In April 2008 the State of Michigan enacted legislation that provided significant

tax credits to film studios conducting business in Michigan. In August 2008 the City was
approached by an owner and operator of a California film and post-production sound studio
(“Producer”) who inquired about building the Studio Project in the City.
16.

The City Council believed that the Studio Project would bring much-needed

economic development to the City. To support the Project, the City Council therefore agreed to
offer what ultimately became a total of $28.275 million of general obligation limited tax bonds
issued on November 12, 2009 (“2009 Bonds”) and another $2.725 million of general obligation
limited tax bonds issued on June 16, 2010 (“2010 Bonds”).
The Public Private Partnership
17.

The City and the Producer planned that the Studio Project would be financed and

built through a Public Private Partnership (“PPP”), consisting of a limited liability corporation
4

2:14-cv-14279-TGB-MJH Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 5 of 14

Pg ID 5

with the City, the Producer and a private developer (“Developer”) as members. The City would
use the municipal bond proceeds to buy land which it then would donate to the PPP to use for the
Studio Project. The Developer would finance and build necessary structures on the land while
the Producer would manage the Project and find investors to fund the film production.
18.

In April 2009 the City issued a press release that included relevant plans about the

Studio Project. These plans, which the City then maintained on its website through at least June
2010, were that the Studio Project would be a full-service film and media production facility that
would employ thousands of union and skilled workers, be located on 104 acres, consist of
750,000 square feet of facilities, have eight sound stages, and be led by a Hollywood production
executive, at a cost of $146 million.
19.

In May 2009, as Defendant Waidelich was preparing the City’s Fiscal 2010

budget, the City faced a deficit of approximately $2 million. The Producer offered to provide up
to $2 million to remove the deficit. Although Waidelich originally understood the $2 million
would be a “financial gift,” the Producer sent Waidelich a letter on May 14, 2009, stating that the
$2 million was a “capital repayment” contingent on the City’s contribution of land to the PPP.
20.

In early June 2009, the Producer, the City, and the Developer signed an agreement for the

PPP, pursuant to which the Developer committed $20 million for the Project’s first phase.
The Collapse of the PPP and the City’s $2 Million Budget Shortfall
21.

In July 2009 the City’s bond counsel advised the City that bond proceeds could

not be used to purchase land that then would be donated to the PPP.
22.

Because the City could not donate assets purchased with bond proceeds, it could

not meet the contribution requirements necessary for membership in the PPP. As a result, the
5

2:14-cv-14279-TGB-MJH Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 6 of 14

Pg ID 6

plans for the PPP collapsed. The collapse of the PPP meant that the Developer, who had pledged
to contribute $20 million, no longer had any obligations to the Studio Project.
23.

The collapse of the PPP also meant that the City had a projected deficit for Fiscal

2010 of $2 million, because the Producer no longer was obligated to pay the City $2 million.
Although Defendant Waidelich knew this, he took steps to create the false impression that the
City would still receive the $2 million. The $2 million purported “donation” represented 8.4% of
the City’s budgeted $22 million in Fiscal 2010 revenue and was instrumental in creating the false
appearance that the City’s budget for Fiscal 2010 had no deficit.
24.

In addition, the Producer’s proposal to attract investors, media producers and

tenants for the Studio Project had been based on the assumption that he would manage and
control the entire Project. When the PPP collapsed, however, the City decided to own and
manage the property itself. By August 2009, the plan was that the Producer was only going to
lease 100,000 square feet and to operate a vocational school to train potential workers in the
movie production business.
Wayne County and the City’s Public Statements
25.

Wayne County originally planned to support the Studio Project by issuing up to

$12 million of municipal bonds and granting favorable tax status to the Studio Property. The
County, however, raised numerous concerns about the viability of the Project from the start,
expressing these concerns in writing and meetings with both Defendant Waidelich and the City’s
mayor.
26.

By August 2009, the County informed the City that it would not grant favorable

tax status to the property.
6

2:14-cv-14279-TGB-MJH Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 7 of 14

27.

Pg ID 7

The City nevertheless issued a press release on August 14, 2009 which announced

that ground breaking for construction was beginning at the Studio Project, that all Studio Project
details, including financing, were complete and that the “all-encompassing film, TV and media
production facility will open in October.” None of these statements was true.
28.

In late September 2009, the County further advised the City that it would not

issue the $12 million municipal bonds without additional information. Defendant Waidelich
advised the mayor that without the County’s municipal bonds, the City could incur up to $4
million of additional interest. On October 6, 2009, the County confirmed that it would not
provide any municipal bond financing for the Studio Project.
29.

In response to concerns raised by a resident during an October 13, 2009 public

City Council meeting, neither the mayor nor Defendant Waidelich discussed any of the negative
developments that were impairing the Studio Project, including the fact that there were no
prospects for building sound stages.
30.

Thus, the City’s plan for the Studio Project deteriorated significantly between

April 2009, when the City issued its first press release, and November 12, 2009, when the City
issued the 2009 Bonds totaling $28.275 million. By the time the 2009 Bonds were issued, the
City no longer had any private investor money in place to build or develop the Studio Project and
the Producer no longer had the ability to lead the development or attract investors.
The 2009 Bond Documents Did Not Disclose Material Negative Information
31.

Defendant Waidelich was the primary source of the information used in drafting

the offering documents for the 2009 Bonds. Waidelich received drafts of the offering documents
and provided comments that were incorporated into the final versions. Waidelich’s electronic
7

2:14-cv-14279-TGB-MJH Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 8 of 14

Pg ID 8

signature certified the offering documents on behalf of the City, stating that to the City’s best
knowledge and belief, the document was “true and correct” and did not “contain, nor omit, any
material facts or info which would make the statements contained herein misleading.”
32.

The offering documents, however, did not disclose any of the adverse

developments regarding the Studio Project. Similarly, the Offering Statements contained no
disclosure or discussions regarding any potential risks.
33.

In fact, the offering documents contained a number of material misstatements.

First, the offering documents for the 2009 Bonds repeated all of the information about the Studio
Project that had been contained in the City’s initial April 2009 press release announcing the
Project, even though the plans for the Studio Project had deteriorated significantly after April
2009.
34.

In addition, the offering documents stated that the City intended initially to repay

the Bonds by leasing facilities at the Studio Project and using the lease revenues towards
payment of the Bonds. This representation was highly relevant to the City’s ability to service
its debt since the expected annual debt service otherwise would have constituted approximately
10% of the City’s budget. The offering documents also stated that the City had existing leases
“under contract” totaling $1.6 million for 48% of the available space and that additional lease
arrangements, representing 27% of the available space, were currently in negotiation.
35.

By the time the 2009 Bonds were issued, however, the projected $1.6 million of

annual lease revenue included at least $300,000 from the Producer which Waidelich knew was
uncertain. Defendant Waidelich also was aware that there were no existing negotiations
regarding 27% of available space.
8

2:14-cv-14279-TGB-MJH Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 9 of 14

36.

Pg ID 9

Finally, the City attached its projected Fiscal Year 2010 budget as an appendix to

both its 2009 and its 2010 offering documents. The budget, which reflected the City’s
expectation that it would have a general fund surplus at the end of Fiscal Year 2010, appeared to
be balanced because it was based on the assumption that the Producer would donate $2 million to
the City. Waidelich, however, knew that the Producer no longer intended to pay $2 million to
the City. The budget attached to the offering documents thus was materially misleading. The
City really faced a projected $2 million deficit for Fiscal Year 2010.
The Bonds were rated “A” and Issued in November 2009
37.

Standard & Poor (“S&P”) reviewed information provided by the City and others

in order to rate the City’s 2009 Bonds. Waidelich did not inform S&P that the Producer no
longer intended to pay $2 million to the City and thus misled S&P regarding the actual condition
of the City’s Fiscal Year 2010 budget.
38.

On October 20, 2009 Standard & Poor (“S&P”) assigned the 2009 Bonds an “A”

rating. S&P’s write-up noted that the FY 2010 budget was balanced only because of the $2
million donation, and pointed out that the City would have to address this structural imbalance.
39.

The “A” rating by S&P was material to investors who purchased the 2009 Bonds.

Additional Adverse Developments Occurred Before the City Issued its June 2010 Bonds
40.

After the 2009 Bonds were issued, the City retained a company to manage the

Studio Project site. On February 12, 2010, the management company advised that the City
would experience a significant decrease in net cash flow at the site at least for the first three
years, rather than the increase from lease revenues it had expected. This was due to hiring agents

9

2:14-cv-14279-TGB-MJH Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 10 of 14

Pg ID 10

to solicit prospective tenants, management companies, providing rent forgiveness and building
out properties.
41.

On May 6, 2010 the City served the Producer with an eviction notice. The City

and the Producer then negotiated an amended lease for only one-half the amount of space at onehalf the price, with rent payments postponed until August 2010.
42.

Despite these additional significant negative developments affecting the Studio

Project, the City issued the 2010 Bonds on June 16, 2010. Although two weeks before the 2010
Bonds were issued, the City Council had adopted a budget for Fiscal Year 2011 which
acknowledged the $2 million budget shortfall, the offering documents for the 2010 Bonds again
incorporated the City’s Fiscal 2010 budget figures which omitted the $2 million shortfall.
43.

The 2010 Bond offering documents misleadingly continued to list tenants at the

Studio Property with purported “total leases under contract represent[ing] approximately $1.6
million of annual revenue.” The 2010 Bond offering documents stated that the total annual debt
service was $2.6 million, an increase from the $2.2 million stated in the 2009 Bonds.
44.

Finally, notwithstanding that the Producer by this time had reduced his presence

at the Studio Project by half, the offering documents falsely continued describing the Studio
Project as a “$146 million, full-service movie, television and new media production studio” that
would consist of 750,000 square feet, eight sound stages, employ thousands of unionized skilled
workers, and be managed by the Producer.
45.

Defendant Waidelich again was the primary source of information for the 2010

Bond offering documents. He also reviewed and approved them and certified, on behalf of the
City, that, to the City’s best knowledge and belief, the document was “true and correct” and did
10

2:14-cv-14279-TGB-MJH Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 11 of 14

Pg ID 11

not “contain, nor omit, any material facts or information which would make the statements
contained herein misleading.”
46.

On September 29, 2010 the Producer advised the City that he was terminating his

lease at the Studio Property. He vacated the site on October 4, 2010. Defendant Waidelich
resigned on February 27, 2011.
The Effect of the Studio Project Collapse on the City
47.

The collapse of the Studio Project had a significant impact on the City’s financial

condition. The City filed a notice on the Electronic Municipal Market Access system
(“EMMA”) on December 29, 2010 that it was not filing an annual report for fiscal year 2010.
48.

On March 8, 2011 S&P downgraded the City’s unlimited tax bonds and its limited

tax GO bonds to BB+.
49.

The City did not file any continuing disclosure until January 4, 2012, at which

time it announced it had received a “going concern” opinion from its auditors. On June 21, 2012
the Michigan State Treasurer began a Preliminary Review of the City, pursuant to State law, and
issued a Final Report on August 8, 2012 recommending the appointment of an Emergency
Manager. The Studio Project was listed as a primary factor in the City’s deteriorating economic
condition. An Emergency Manager was appointed in October 2012.
50.

The City’s most recent annual audit report, dated December 16, 2013, for Fiscal

2013, again includes a going concern opinion because of the City’s general fund deficit of
$694,185 and its Studio Project fund deficit of $10,370,611.
