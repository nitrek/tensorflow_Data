In the Matter of
TIMOTHY J. MCGEE

ORDER DENYING REQUEST TO VACATE BARS
Timothy J. McGee seeks to vacate an administrative order, dated September 17, 2015
(the "Order"), to the extent that it bars him from association with any nationally recognized
statistical rating organization ("NRSRO") or municipal advisor.1
The Order barred McGee from "association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser,
municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent" and from "participating in any offering of a penny
stock, including: acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in
activities with a broker, dealer or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny
stock, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock. . . ." It did
not, however, bar him from association with an NRSRO or a municipal advisor. Accordingly,
Timothy J. McGee's request to vacate NRSRO and municipal advisor bars is denied.
By the Commission.
