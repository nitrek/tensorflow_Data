In the Matter of

Respondent.


On May 31, 2007, the Commission published a notice of the Plan of Distribution (“Plan”)
proposed by the Division of Enforcement in connection with this proceeding (Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 55841). No comments were received and on August 3, 2007 the Plan
was approved (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 56196).
The Plan of Distribution provides that a Fair Fund consisting of $180,575,005 in
disgorgement and civil penalties, plus any accrued interest, be held under the control of the
Commission at the U.S. Treasury Bureau of Public Debt until distributed by the Financial
Management Service, United States Department of Treasury (“FMS”) to injured investors
according to the methodology set forth in the Plan. The Plan provides that the Commission will
arrange for distribution of the Fair Fund by FMS when an electronic payment file validated by
the Independent Distribution Consultant listing the payees with the identification information
required to make the distribution has been received and accepted. The validated electronic

payment file for the third tranche in the amount of $5,111,350.13 has been received and
accepted.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that $5,111,350.13 shall be distributed from the Fair Fund
to the Investment Vehicles as provided for in the Plan of Distribution.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Elizabeth M. Murphy
Secretary
