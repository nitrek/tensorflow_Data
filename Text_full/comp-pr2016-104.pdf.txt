COMPLAINT




Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges as follows:

Case 3:16-cv-00285 Document 1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 1 of 16

I.

INTRODUCTION
1.

The Commission brings this action to enjoin Defendant Richard W. Davis, Jr.

(“Davis”) from violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.
From no later than January 2008 through at least February 2015, Davis, acting through two
unregistered pooled investment vehicles – DCG Real Assets, LLC (f/k/a DCG Real Estate
Holdings, LLC, and DCG Alternatives, LLC) (“Real Assets”), and DCG Commercial Fund I,
LLC (f/k/a Aegis Asset Backed Funds, LLC, Aegis/DCG Asset Backed Fund, LLC, and DCG
Asset Backed Funds, LLC) (“Commercial Fund”) – raised at least $11.5 million from at least 85
investors through the unregistered sale of securities in Real Assets and the Commercial Fund.
2.

While soliciting investments in the securities, Davis stated that he planned to

invest the investors’ money in a variety of “hard assets,” such as real estate or mineral rights.
3.

However, while managing the funds, Davis routinely caused Real Assets and the

Commercial Fund to enter into business transactions with certain of the Relief Defendants, which
he owned and/or controlled, and failed to specifically disclose the existence of these conflicts of
interest to all investors. He also caused money to be transferred away from Real Assets into bank
accounts of the Relief Defendants, without specifically disclosing to investors that he would do
so. From these other bank accounts, Davis routinely used the money to satisfy certain business
expenses. Not all of these expenses were related to the investment strategy of the fund.
Additionally, Davis received direct and indirect payments from Real Assets and these amounts
were in excess of the management fee he was entitled to under Real Assets’ offering materials.
4.

As a result of the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Davis violated Sections 5 and

17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e and 77q(a); Section 10(b)
and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and

-2Case 3:16-cv-00285 Document 1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 2 of 16

17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5; and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-6(1), 80b-6(2), 80b-6(4), and 17 C.F.R. §
275.206(4)-8. Unless restrained and enjoined, Davis is reasonably likely to continue to violate the
federal securities laws.
5.

The Commission therefore respectfully requests the Court enter: (i) a permanent

injunction restraining and enjoining Davis from violating the federal securities laws; (ii) an order
directing Davis and Relief Defendants to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest; (iii) an
order directing Davis to pay a civil money penalty; and (iv) an order appointing a receiver over
the Relief Defendants.
II.

III.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
25.

The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d) and

22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d) and 77v(a); Sections 21(d) and 27(a) of
the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa(a); and Sections 209 and 214 of the Advisers
Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-9 and 80b-14.
26.

The Court has personal jurisdiction over Davis and Relief Defendants, and venue

is proper in this District, because, among other things, Davis offered or sold securities to
investors in this District and because Davis and some or all of the Relief Defendants reside
and/or have their principal places of business in Charlotte, North Carolina. In addition, venue is
proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a substantial part of the events or
omissions giving rise to the Commission’s claims occurred here.
27.

In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Davis, directly and

indirectly, singly or in concert with others, has made use of the means or instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate
commerce, and of the mails.
IV.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
28.

Davis managed the Commercial Fund and created and managed Real Assets, and

solicited investments from investors primarily in the Charlotte, North Carolina region. A
majority of the investors were individuals with retirement accounts, such as individual retirement
accounts (“IRAs”) or “401k” accounts.
29.

Davis instructed the investors with existing retirement accounts to “roll-over”

their accounts into his funds. To do this, investors liquidated their existing accounts and

-6Case 3:16-cv-00285 Document 1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 6 of 16

transferred the funds to a custodial trust account. The custodian promptly transferred the funds
to an account in the name of the funds or their underwriter.
30.

Davis raised at least $1.7 million from at least 20 investors for the Commercial

31.

Davis told prospective investors of the Commercial Fund that he intended to

invest the fund’s capital in short term fully secured loans to real estate developers. He failed to
inform all of the investors, however, that in two out of the four projects the fund invested in
(NLBP and HPP1), the real estate developers on the other side of the transactions were
companies owned and operated by Davis himself.

Davis took no steps to ameliorate this

inherent conflict of interest.
32.

Davis raised at least $9.8 million from approximately 65 investors for Real

33.

Davis told prospective investors of Real Assets that he intended to invest the

Assets.

fund’s capital in “hard” assets such as real estate and natural resources. He failed to inform all
of the investors that, like the Commercial Fund, Real Assets also repeatedly entered into
transactions with certain of the Relief Defendants.
34.

Of the $9.8 million of investor funds Davis received into Real Assets’ bank

account, he transferred at least $7.7 million to bank accounts of the Relief Defendants. Davis
never disclosed that the funds would be handled this way and in doing so violated his fiduciary
duty to the fund.
35.

From the accounts of the Relief Defendants, the money was either spent or

transferred onward, typically to another Relief Defendant, where it was spent or transferred, and
so on until ultimately all of the $7.7 million in investor funds was transferred away from the

-7Case 3:16-cv-00285 Document 1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 7 of 16

accounts or otherwise spent for business expenses or to accounts Davis controlled. The bank
accounts that received these investor funds were used, in part, for personal expenses of Davis.
Davis did not disclose to investors that he would commingle their investments in this manner.
36.

Davis received directly and indirectly at least $1.5 million from the Davis-owned

accounts that received investor funds from 2006 to 2015 or as stated above.
37.

Under the terms of the offering documents of Real Assets, Davis was entitled to a

management fee of .125% of assets under management to be assessed and paid quarterly. Davis
failed to assess and withdraw this fee according to the required procedures. Nonetheless, had he
done so, he would have been entitled to less than $150,000 in management fees over the entire
period of time he managed the fund.
38.

In connection with soliciting investments in Real Assets, neither Davis nor the

offering documents adequately disclosed the vast majority of the funds invested into the fund
would be transferred to bank accounts of entities in which Davis held an ownership stake, or to
entities owned by Davis himself, and subsequently spent.
39.

Davis also misrepresented his professional credentials when soliciting

investments by claiming to be a Registered Financial Consultant, which he was not.
40.

In addition, since 2010, Davis has reported to investors in the Commercial Fund

via their IRA custodian that their investment has not lost any value. This is notwithstanding the
fact that the primary assets held by the Commercial Fund are loans that have been in default for
years. Davis caused the fund to foreclose on at least one of these loans. Davis failed to
reappraise the value of the fund’s investment in light of this.
41.

Since the inception of Real Assets, Davis reported to investors that their

investments were growing year-after-year. However, Davis based this purported growth on

-8Case 3:16-cv-00285 Document 1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 8 of 16

speculative valuations of the fund’s underlying investments and failed to specifically tabulate a
true net asset value for the fund.
42.

In a video presentation prepared for investors in March 2015, Davis also stated of

Real Assets that “undeniably, 100%, hands down, yes, we have in excess of $10 million worth of
assets.” Davis based this statement on speculative valuations of the investments and failed to
reflect that in most cases the fund only held partial ownership of those investments. The video
presentation was used to update investors and to solicit additional funds.
43.

Neither the Commercial Fund nor Real Assets registered any offerings of its

securities with the Commission.
44.

Davis solicited investments from unaccredited investors via general solicitation.

Davis failed to provide these unaccredited investors with audited financial statements at the time
of their purchase. In the case of Real Assets, Davis never obtained an audit notwithstanding the
statements in the offering documents that he would. Further, Davis failed to take the necessary
steps to determine whether the unaccredited investors were capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of the investment, which they were not.
45.

From no later than 2008, as described above, as a result of Davis’ actions, each of

the Relief Defendants received directly or indirectly investor funds. Accordingly, it is necessary
for a receiver to, among other things, marshal the funds in an orderly fashion and determine
whether and to what extent the funds may be repaid to investors.

(Violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act)
