Dear Designated Compliance Officer:
We are sending this letter to all Designated Compliance Officers to remind each nationally
recognized statistical rating organization (“NRSRO”) of the requirement to establish,
maintain and enforce policies and procedures that are in compliance with section
15E(h)(4)(A) 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and to provide the staff’s view on a
particular aspect of that provision.
Section 15E(h)(4)(A), in sum, requires an NRSRO to establish, maintain and enforce policies
and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that:
•

in any case where an employee (1)(i) of an entity subject to a credit rating of the
NRSRO or (ii) of the issuer, underwriter, or sponsor of a security or money market
instrument subject to a credit rating of the NRSRO, (2) was employed by the NRSRO
and (3) participated in any capacity in determining credit ratings for such entity or
such security or money market instrument during the one-year period preceding the
date an action was taken with respect to the credit rating,

the NRSRO will:
•

conduct a look-back review to determine whether any employee conflicts of interest
influenced the rating; and

• revise the rating if appropriate.

1

15 U.S.C. §78o-7(h)(4)(A).

It is the view of staff of the Office of Credit Ratings (“OCR”) that the relevant “action” for
purposes of the phrase “date an action was taken” in section 15E(h)(4)(A) is the most recent
rating action taken by the NRSRO prior to the employee’s departure to work for the rated
entity, or the issuer, underwriter or sponsor of the rated security.
NRSRO policies and procedures specifying any other date or event to determine the
beginning of the one-year period referred to in section 15E(h)(4)(A) (for example, the
employee’s departure date) would not be consistent with the staff’s reading of that section.
OCR staff will be contacting you shortly to discuss this letter.

Sincerely,

Thomas J. Butler
Director
