CIVIL ACTION NO.

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF
Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), files this
Complaint and alleges as follows:
OVERVIEW
1.

This matter involves insider trading by James C. Cope, Esq. (“Cope”),

a Tennessee attorney and former member of the Board of Directors (“Board”) and
Executive Committee of the Board (“Executive Committee”) of Pinnacle Financial
Partners, Inc. (“PNFP”), a Nashville, Tennessee-based bank holding company.
2.

Between January 5, 2016 and January 11, 2016, Cope purchased a

total of 10,179 shares of the common stock of Avenue Financial Holdings, Inc.
(“AVNU”), another Nashville, Tennessee-based bank holding company, while in

Case 3:16-cv-02764 Document 1 Filed 10/21/16 Page 1 of 16 PageID #: 1

possession of the material, non-public information that PNFP and ANNU were
engaged in confidential merger discussions with a goal to complete a merger in the
Third Quarter of 2016.
3.

Cope initiated his purchases of AVNU shares shortly after learning

about the merger negotiations – including that PNFP had made an informal offer to
acquire AVNU at a premium over its current share price – during a January 5, 2016
monthly meeting of PNFP’s Executive Committee. Trading records indicate that
Cope placed his first order to purchase AVNU shares while that meeting was still
in progress. Thereafter, he made seven additional purchases of AVNU shares, for a
total purchase of 6,179 shares that day.
4.

Six days later, on January 11, 2016, Cope purchased another 4,000

AVNU shares. AVNU and PNFP jointly announced the signing of the merger
agreement on Thursday, January 28, 2016, after the markets closed.
5.

By the end of the next trading day, Friday, January 29, 2016, the

closing share price of AVNU stock had increased by $5.53 to $19.24 per share, or
over 40 %, giving Cope unrealized ill-gotten gains of not less than $56,302.
VIOLATIONS

THE DEFENDANT AND RELATED PARTIES
12.

Cope, 67, resides in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. He served on PNFP’s

Board from March 2006 until his resignation in April 2016, as a result of the
conduct alleged in this Complaint. Prior to joining PNFP, Cope served as a
member of the Board of Directors of Cavalry Bancorp, Inc. (“CAVB”), a former
public issuer and bank holding company located in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.
Cope is an attorney and partner in the Murfreesboro, Tennessee law firm of Cope,
Hudson, Reed & McCreary, PLLC. The firm’s website describes his practice as
civil litigation, corporate and governmental law.

company headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, and operating primarily through
its subsidiary, Avenue Bank. Prior to its acquisition by PNFP, which closed on

4

Case 3:16-cv-02764 Document 1 Filed 10/21/16 Page 4 of 16 PageID #: 4

July 1, 2016, AVNU’s common stock was traded on NASDAQ.
14.

Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc. is a bank holding company

headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. PNFP’s shares are traded on NASDAQ.
BACKGROUND
15.

In 2006, PNFP acquired Cavalry Bancorp, Inc. (“CAVB”), a former

public issuer and bank holding company located in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. As
part of the acquisition, two members of CAVB’s Board of Directors joined the
PNFP Board. One of the two was Cope, who remained a Director until April 2016.
In addition to being a Director, in 2015 and 2016, Cope was the Chair of the
Human Resources Subcommittee of PNFP’s Board.
16.

Under PNFP’s Board structure, all Chairs of Board subcommittees,

such as Cope, served on PNFP’s Executive Committee, which had seven members.
During the relevant period, PNFP’s Board met quarterly, on the third Tuesday of
the first month of the quarter. PNFP’s Executive Committee met more frequently,
on the first Tuesday of each month.
17.

At all relevant times, PNFP had a code of conduct, which included an

insider trading policy. That policy was set forth in a “Statement of Policy on
Prevention of Insider Trading” (“Insider Trading Statement”), copies of which
were also transmitted annually to the Board members. In 2016, the Insider Trading

5

Case 3:16-cv-02764 Document 1 Filed 10/21/16 Page 5 of 16 PageID #: 5

Statement was provided to the Board members, including Cope, by a January 1,
2016 interoffice memorandum. The Insider Trading Statement stated that:
It is our policy that if a Director, officer or any employee has material
nonpublic information relating to Pinnacle, he or she may not buy or
sell securities of Pinnacle or engage in any other action to take
advantage of, or pass on to others, that information. . . . This policy
also applies to material information relating to any other company
obtained in the course of your serving as a Director or an employee.
[Emphasis in original]
18.

Board members, such as Cope, were required to sign certifications

yearly, stating that the Director “ha[d] read, underst[ood], and w[ould] comply”
with the insider trading policy. In January 2015 and again in January 2016, Cope
signed such certifications as part of completing his annual Director and Officer
questionnaires for PNFP.

In both years, the certifications contained identical

language, namely:
I acknowledge that I have reviewed the [PNFP] Company Policy
regarding Special Trading Procedures (the Trading Policy) and the
Statement of Company Policy on Prevention of Insider Trading (the
Insider Trading Statement) and certify that I have read, understand,
and will comply with the policies and procedures set forth in such
documents.
19.

On October 19, 2015 - roughly two and half months prior to Cope’s

improper trading here - the PNFP Board members, including Cope, assembled for
special training on PNFP’s insider trading policy.

This training occurred in

conjunction with a Board dinner at a local restaurant and included a power point
6

Case 3:16-cv-02764 Document 1 Filed 10/21/16 Page 6 of 16 PageID #: 6

presentation by a partner of Bass Berry & Sims, PLC, PNFP’s Nashville-based
corporate counsel.

Within the first two pages of the power point, “inside

information” was defined and the duty of the PNFP’s Board members was made
clear. The power point said: “What is inside information? Material, nonpublic
information you learn about [PNFP] or another public company while serving as a
director, officer or employee of Pinnacle…What are my duties with respect to
insider information?

Never buy or sell stock while in possession of inside

information.” [Emphasis in original]
MERGER WITH AVENUE
20.

Since its founding, PNFP has grown its business through, among

other things, a series of acquisitions of local Tennessee banks. On September 14
and 15, 2015, PNFP held a Board retreat to which it invited the investment
banking firm of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (“KBW”), to make a presentation on
possible future acquisitions PNFP should consider. Cope attended this Board
retreat and was present for KBW’s presentation.

In the presentation, KBW

identified and evaluated for PNFP’s Board four potential acquisition targets for
PNFP. Included among the targets was AVNU.
21.

Among the targets presented, AVNU was particularly attractive to

many of the PNFP Board members because it would be a completely “in-market”
7

Case 3:16-cv-02764 Document 1 Filed 10/21/16 Page 7 of 16 PageID #: 7

acquisition.

This meant that all of AVNU’s branches were in geographic

proximity with PNFP’s branches, which in turn meant that a merger would allow
significant consolidation of branches and other operations and permit sizeable cost
savings.
22.

In November 2015, the investment banking firm of SunTrust

Robinson Humphrey published a “Sector Update” (“Robinson Sector Update”)
which modeled various business combinations among local Tennessee banks,
including a favorable modeling of a combination of AVNU and PNFP. Upon
receiving the Robinson Sector Update, PNFP’s President and CEO, Terry Turner
(“Turner”) emailed a copy of it to AVNU’s Chairman and CEO, Ron Samuels
(“Samuels”), who was a long-time acquaintance, with a note suggesting that he
and Samuels meet to discuss it. Turner and Samuels had occasionally discussed
combining PNFP and AVNU and, by sending the email, Turner hoped to renew
those discussions.
23.

PNFP’s Executive Committee meeting in December 2015 occurred on

December 1st (the “December 1 meeting”). During the executive session of that
meeting, which Cope attended, Turner briefed the Executive Committee members
about the Robinson Sector Update and his emailing of it to Samuels. Turner
further noted that he had not yet heard back from Samuels. Unknown to Turner at

8

Case 3:16-cv-02764 Document 1 Filed 10/21/16 Page 8 of 16 PageID #: 8

the time, however, he had sent his email to Samuels to an incorrect email address.
Shortly after the December 1 meeting, this error was discovered, Turner
successfully transmitted the Robinson Sector Update to Samuels, and the two
began discussing a possible combination of AVNU and PNFP.
24.

Those discussions intensified during December 2015. Specifically, in

December, PNFP retained the investment banking firm of Sandler O’Neill to
model the financial transaction and to advise PNFP. Based in part on this advice,
Turner made an informal offer to Samuels to acquire all of AVNU’s outstanding
shares of common stock at $19.00 per share, roughly a $5.34 per share premium
over AVNU’s December 2015 average closing share price. Turner also sent to
Samuels a draft nondisclosure agreement that included an exclusivity provision
that required AVNU to negotiate exclusively with PNFP.
25.

Although Samuels responded to Turner that AVNU would not yet

sign such an agreement, Samuels did inform Turner that AVNU had formed a
special committee of its Board of Directors to evaluate the offer and that the
special committee had the authority to engage KBW as AVNU’s financial advisor.
26.

At the end of December 2015, Samuels communicated to Turner that

AVNU’s special committee was considering the transaction with PNFP but
needed more time to consider it. Turner responded to Samuels that it was PNFP’s

9

Case 3:16-cv-02764 Document 1 Filed 10/21/16 Page 9 of 16 PageID #: 9

preference that the discussions progress promptly given that they were considering
an “in-market” transaction, which would be more difficult to keep confidential.
THE JANUARY 5 EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETING
27.

On January 5, 2016, PNFP held its January Executive Committee

meeting. Since the merger negotiations between PNFP and AVNU had occurred
following the December 1 meeting, Turner and PNFP’s CFO, Harold Carpenter
(“Carpenter”) planned an extensive discussion of the possible merger with the
Executive Committee members. In advance of the meeting, PNFP requested that
Sandler O’Neill prepare a report detailing the financial aspects of the proposed
merger.

This report was made available through a secure web portal, called

Director’s Desk, to the Executive Committee members, including Cope, on or
about December 30, 2015.
28.

The January 5 meeting, including the time allotted for the executive

session, began at approximately 7:30 a.m. CT and last about 2 hours, ending at
approximately 9:30 a.m. CT. Cope attended this meeting.
29.

Using the Sandler O’Neill report, Turner and Carpenter briefed the

Executive Committee members on the details and status of the merger negotiations.
Among other things, they told the Executive Committee members, including
Cope, about PNFP’s informal offer to AVNU to acquire its outstanding shares at

10

Case 3:16-cv-02764 Document 1 Filed 10/21/16 Page 10 of 16 PageID #: 10

$19.00 a share, which was a premium over AVNU’s then average closing share
price and AVNU’s response of forming a special committee of its Board of
Directors to consider the offer. They also discussed with the Executive Committee
members PNFP’s transmittal of a draft non-disclosure agreement with an
exclusivity provision to AVNU, and AVNU’s response that it needed more time to
evaluate the offer.
30.

Additionally, Turner and Carpenter emphasized the particular need for

extra care to keep “in-market” acquisitions confidential. Although the merger
negotiations were discussed during the executive session portion of the Executive
Committee meeting, the discussion lasted at least a full hour of the two hour
meeting.
31.

Moreover, several of the Executive Committee members believed that,

given the status of the negotiations, it was likely the merger would occur.
Additionally, many of them believed that the negotiations were sufficiently
advanced to be sufficiently material and precluded them from trading in AVNU
shares.
COPE’S AVNU PURCHASES
32.

Cope’s trading records indicate that he initiated his purchases of

AVNU shares at 9:03 a.m. on January 5, 2016 - during the Executive Committee

negotiated the final terms of the nondisclosure agreement, which was signed the
same day. The nondisclosure agreement gave PNFP a 30-day period in which to
negotiate exclusively with AVNU, which began providing PNFP with detailed
financial information to complete the analysis of the potential merger of the two
companies.
36.

On January 28, 2016, after the markets closed, AVNU and PNFP

jointly announced the signing of a merger agreement. By January 29, 2016, the
closing share price of AVNU stock had increased by $5.53 to $19.24 per share, or
over a 40% increase from AVNU’s prior day’s closing share price. Through his
trading, Cope obtained unrealized profits of not less than $56,302.
