getting started. Can I ask people to take their seats?
I would like to call this meeting to order.

4
5

You know, welcome to the meeting of the SEC's Advisory

6

Committee on Small and Emerging Companies.

7

Sebastian, do we have quorum?

8

MR. GOMEZ: We do.

9

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay. Well, again welcome

10

everyone. For those around the table that have not had

11

an opportunity yet to have a muffin, they're over there

12

on the table to my left. And I didn't realize I was

13

going to be giving a muffin commercial, but I just want

14

you to know that these pastries are brought to you by a

15

small, local business, something called Lord of the Pies.
CHAIR WHITE: It's one of those things you

16
17

can't make this up I think.
MR. GRAHAM: No, no. They were made just

18
19

blocks away at a place called Union Kitchen, which is an

20

incubator that offers commercial kitchen space, catering,

21

distribution, consulting and more for culinary

22

businesses. So I hate to be trite, but this is just one

23

more example of how a small business makes your life

24

better.
Our agenda today includes three important

matters. The first is the accredited investor definition

2

under the Securities Act. We had an engaging and

3

thoughtful discussion on this important definition during

4

our May 18 meeting and came up with an outline for a

5

recommendation, and I believe that we can finalize that

6

in probably short order.
Secondly we will turn to Regulation A, which is

7
8

timely because a month ago today was the one year

9

anniversary of the new Reg A Rules going into effect. We

10

will hear from Elio Motors and OTC Markets about their

11

experiences in this relatively new space.

12

And as a final matter today we will hear from

13

SEC staff about the Commission's new proposal to amend

14

and update the definition of smaller reporting company, a

15

topic this committee has been interested in for some

16

time.

17

But before we move into our agenda for the day

18

we are honored to start with opening remarks from Chair

19

White and -- welcome, I didn't see you sneak in, and

20

Commissioner Stein.

21
22

Chair White, let me turn it over to you.
CHAIR WHITE: Thank you, Steve, and

23

thank you Steve and Sarah for presiding and welcome back

24

everyone. I guess these dog days of summer you see people

25

fleeing Washington, so it's very good to see you all here

in Washington for this meeting.
I'm just going to make a few very short

Page 8

public comments we receive on the SRC proposal from you

2

and all constituents, including investors and companies,

3

comments on each of your agenda items and then I'll just,

3

as well as the comments that we receive on our Regulation

4

you know, give a word on kind of what we're seeing so

4

SK concept release, which explores the scaled disclosure

5

far, and it's obviously early, but in the crowd funding

5

requirements for SRCs among many other areas.

6

space.

6

7

So your agenda today starts with a discussion

So your input along with the input from

7

investors, issuers and other affected market participants

8

of the accredited investor definition, which is obviously

8

will help inform any changes to the scaled disclosure

9

an issue of great importance which we and you are very

9

system or other changes to our disclosure requirements.

10

focused on. We've received some 40 comment letters on

10

11

the staff's study of the definition, and as the staff is

11

just a word, a very quick update on another of our recent

12

working on further recommendations for the Commission I

12

rules to facilitate small business capital formation, and

13

look forward to your thoughts and recommendation. Your

13

that is Regulation Crowd Funding, which went into effect

14

feedback is obviously very important and helpful to us.

14

May 16th, which I think was just two days actually before

15

your last meeting here.

15

Your agenda today also focuses on Regulation

The word I promised I would give, and really is

16

A+. It was actually just over a year ago, in June of

16

I can report that a diverse range of companies are

17

2015, that the Commission's amendments to Regulation A+

17

using the crowd funding exemption and that as of July

18

went into effect. We have had over a hundred offering

18

18th, which I think is yesterday, there had been over 60

19

statements filed with the Commission, with even more

19

offerings with a total of $4.4 million in funds committed

20

issuers actually taking advantage of provisions in the

20

by investors. Twelve funding portals have registered with

21

rules that allow for non-public staff review of draft

21

the Commission and become members of FINRA, which are

22

offering statements before publicly filing.

22

both requirements. For our part the SEC staff continues

23

to closely monitor the Regulation Crowd Funding, and

23

Since the effective date of the final rules the

24

Commission has qualified nearly 50 of those offering

24

Regulation A+ markets and are available, the staff is

25

statements. So this is obviously a very interesting and

25

available to answer questions.

definition. As you know the SRC definition has been of

7

Always a mouthful to say. I want to take the opportunity

8

really keen interest to this committee for some time and

8

to thank each of you for taking time out of very busy

9

the subject of prior committee recommendations, which

9

schedules to come to Washington to share your best

10

actually go beyond the reach of the Commission's current

10

thoughts with us and I'm looking forward to today's

11

proposal in some respects. If adopted the proposal would

12

expand the number of companies that can qualify for

12

13

certain existing scale disclosures provided in the SEC's

13

the apparent hesitancy of issuers to use Regulation A+.

14

regulations, again by raising the public float threshold

14

Perhaps some of the hesitancy can be attributed to the

15

from its current level of $75 million to up to $250

15

newness of the program, are we yet able to identify the

16

million and the annual revenues threshold in the absence

16

reasons issuers are either self-selecting out of using

17

of a public float from less than $50 million to less than

17

Reg A+ or not even aware of it as a capital raising

18

$100 million.

18

alternative, are there any nascent trends in the data

19

that we should be concerned about.

19

The objective of the proposal, which would

I'm especially interested in hearing more about

raise the financial thresholds and the definition as I

20

I'm also interested in the committee's draft

21

just indicated, is to promote capital formation and

21

recommendations regarding the definition of accredited

reduce compliance costs for smaller companies while

23

maintaining important investor protections, such as those

23

businesses can best raise capital I like you also focus

24

provided by Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley. The

24

on how to best protect investors. How can we increase

25

the ability of companies to raise capital while at the

Finally, the committee this afternoon will

Of course before we begin I need to give the

reporting companies, as the Chair mentioned, registrants

SEC's staff who speaks today that the views they express

with less than $75 million in public float as of the last

discuss today are very important to our work as we

16

It would also change the revenue threshold from $50

17

million to $100 million. I recognizes the committee's

17

18

interest in revising the smaller reporting company

18

is working on fine tuning our review of Regulation A

19

threshold to expand the availability of scaled disclosure

19

filings and we hope we're providing helpful and timely

20

to a larger group of companies. However, it's not clear

20

comments and assistance to smaller companies who are

21

to me that this will actually facilitate innovation and

21

often navigating the SEC disclosure regime and our

22

job creation.

22

registration system or our qualification system for the

23

first time. And our staff has really, you know, taken a

keen interest in making sure that we're getting it right

25

say the whole name out, their empirical findings, which

25

as we review these filings. I know these topics have

Page 11

Page 13

1

are attached to the proposed rule, suggest that

1

been important to the committee over the years and

2

anticipated benefits for newly eligible smaller reporting

2

they're very important to us as well.

3

companies under the proposed revisions may be extremely

3

4

modest. Moreover, the flip side of all of this is an

4

on the small reporting company proposal that the

5

observable cost to smaller reporting companies using

5

Commission recently put out for public comment, and you

6

scaled disclosure. Less disclosure could lead to lower

6

may have seen last week the division has been busy on our

7

liquidity and a higher cost of capital for smaller

7

disclosure effectiveness review, putting out another

8

companies if there's less transparency.

8

proposal on getting rid of redundant, overlapping,

9

superseded and outdated disclosure requirements. And so

9

So I think that's the other part of this that we

We're looking forward to getting your feedback

10

need to at least think about. Is less transparency

10

we're interested in getting feedback from investors, from

11

something that smaller reporting companies benefit from

11

companies, and others on how we can make our disclosure

12

in the long run and, you know, what are the costs. Why

12

system better for everybody.

13

are some smaller reporting companies not using the

13

14

current option they have of scaled disclosure, you know,

14

of Small Business Policy, who of course need no

15

even though they qualify.

Now today I'm joined by members of the Office

15

introduction, Sebastian Gomez, who is our chief of the

16

So I hope you consider these issues in your

16

office, and Julie Davis, who is senior special counsel in

17

discussion of the proposed amendments. That's some of

17

the office. You know them well. With me also is Betsy

18

what I'm struggling with, and as always I look forward to

Murphy. Betsy is associate director in the division who

MR. HIGGINS: Thanks. Am I on? Yeah. Thanks,

for getting back to business.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay, thank you, Keith. And

Page 14

Page 16

I would like to echo your comments, Keith. I know that I

1

income standards that whatever is decided upon does not

2

couldn't do this without Julie and Sebastian's help so -­

2

go above 50 percent of the current levels. So income

3

So let's turn to accredited, the accredited

3

would go to 300, 450 net worth would go to 1.5 million.

4

investor definition. At our last meeting I really

4

So that is a recommendation I would make with respect to

5

appreciated our lively discussion on the subject. As you

5

the current test, that we not jump out and do the

6

know it is a central component of Regulation D, which in

6

inflation based change that would exclude too many

7

turn is central to our unregistered markets.

7

potential investors.

We came up with a strong recommendation at that

8
9

meeting and today hope to finalize it. We distributed

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: You know, at our last

8
9

meeting, you know, I would like to think that the balance

10

drafts. I think you all have had an opportunity to

10

of the committee essentially agrees with you. That

11

review it and I think it reflects where we came out last

11

seemed to be the consensus, that, you know, to resist

12

time. This is an opportunity to supplement that

12

this, maybe this inclination to make changes because the

13

recommendation and to otherwise refine it and finalize

13

question has been raised.

14

it.

14

15

As you all know the concept behind accredited

MR. REARDON: Right.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: You know, certainly it's my

15

16

investor is intended to encompass those individuals and

16

feeling, and I think it's the feeling of the balance of

17

entities with the financial sophistication and ability to

17

the committee, that we concluded that this is a part of

18

sustain risk of loss of investment or the ability to fend

18

the small business capital formation system that wasn't

19

for themselves. The current definition, which was

19

broken, seemed to work, and that we should be careful

20

adopted in 1982, uses only financial measures, income and

20

about doing anything that might reduce the pool of

21

net worth, to serve as a proxy for determining whether an

21

accredited investors and only think in terms of what

22

investor possesses these attributes.

22

might be done to -- might be done to expand the pool.

23

The recent SEC staff study on this topic

So the draft recommendation essentially

23

24

recommended that the Commission revise the definition to

24

reflects the recommendation to maintain the status quo in

25

allow individuals who qualify as accredited based on

25

terms of the numbers, in terms of the thresholds. But we

Page 15

Page 17

1

other measures of sophistication. The study set forth

1

didn't -- we didn't provide much commentary relating to

2

alternative approaches which could be considered to

2

non-financial measures and, you know, before we finalize

3

identify individuals who could qualify as accredited

3

the recommendation I wanted to give everybody an

4

investors based on criteria other than income and net

4

opportunity to weigh in, you know, with respect to those

5

worth.

5

suggestions to see if -- well, to see what your input

6

might be.

6

As the staff and the Commission move forward in

7

this area we think specific feedback on these measures

7

Just to throw them all out on the table,

8

would be helpful. So we would like run through each

8

they're in the study, I'm sure you've all reviewed the

9

potential approach one at a time and briefly hear what

9

study. I don't expect you to have committed the study to

10

you have to say about each of them.

10

memory.

11

The first non-financial measure or proposal if

11

CO-CHAIR HANKS: There's a test later.

12

you will is to permit individuals with a minimum -- with

12

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Yeah, there's a test later says

13

a minimum amount of investments to qualify as accredited

13

Sara.

14

investors. Investors may in some cases -- investments

14

15

may in some cases be more meaningful in terms of

15

I said is to permit individuals with a minimum amount of

16

measuring an individual's experience and exposure than

16

investments to qualify as accredited investors. And my

17

the net worth test or the income test.

17

own thought there is if you don't qualify as an

But let me just throw them out. Number one as

18

Any thoughts on that? Patrick.

18

accredited investor how did you make the investments in

19

MR. REARDON: I'm not aware -- well, I agree

19

the first place, but that's something that maybe someone
can enlighten me on.

20

with your conclusion that we have here that we don't need

20

21

to fix the definition, it's not broken. But knowing that

21

Then number two, permit individuals with

22

once you ask if something should be changed there's

22

certain professional credentials to qualify as accredited

23

sometimes pressure to go ahead and make change.

23

investors, for example those who pass Series 7, Series 65

24

or Series 82 examinations. Someone I think made the

25

suggestion that perhaps all lawyers should automatically

24
25

I would consider a recommendation that if
you're going to change the net worth standards or the

5 (Pages 14 to 17)


Page 18

Page 20

1

be accredited. As a member of the bar I'm not sure if

1

example they retire and they no longer have the income

2

that's a good idea.

2

that would have allowed them to qualify, then because of

3

Number three is permit individuals with

3

the fact that they already had that experience in

4

experience investing in exempt offerings to qualify as

4

previous investments the idea is that experience might

5

accredited investors. And again how did you get this

5

have given them the tools to understand what they need to

6

experience if you -- if they're already screened out.

6

look for in future investments.

7

Again if somebody can maybe explain that to me.

7

8

Number four, permit knowledgeable employees of

8

rule, but I can see how it could be something if you

9

private funds to qualify as accredited investors for

9

previously qualified and you got to the investments but

10

investments in their employer's funds.

10

11

And number five is to permit individuals who

11

12

pass an accredited investor examination to qualify, which

12

13

I find attractive. I think the idea of just having,

13

14

coming up with a test that you either pass or fail that's

14

15

-- that has -- there's simplicity, there's certainty,

15

16

that has some appeal to me.

16

17

So the staff didn't call that a grandfathering

you no longer qualify.
MS. MOTT: Now I understand. Thank you.
That's good.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: I'm not sure if I understand,
Sebastian -­
MS. MOTT: thank you for the clarification.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: -- because you're saying that

So any comments? Catherine.

17

if you qualified before but then you lost all your money

MS. MOTT: Obviously this is a topic near and

18

because you did such a bad job investing and you no

19

dear to my heart. So Stephen, when I looked at the

19

longer qualify, as long as there were ten bad investments

20

numbers here my reactions were very similar to yours.

20

you -­

21

With the minimum amount of investment I just thought

21

MR. GOMEZ: It could have been that you

22

about my colleagues, the group of people that are in our

22

invested it all in artwork and you just had a bad choice

23

investor group in Pittsburgh, is that they likely do have

23

of art.

24

investments. It's something that if they qualify

24

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay.

25

according to the minimum standards of a net worth of a

25

CO-CHAIR HANKS: You just haven't had an exit

18

Page 19

Page 21

1

million or they have $200,000 revenue they tend to be

1

2

sophisticated enough to have these investments anyway.

2

3

Professional credentials, to me it really does

3

there would be some pushback from the industry itself on

4

make sense to include anyone if you're a Series 7, Series

4

an exam. But on the other hand I think that if it was

5

63. I mean, you certainly -- if you pass that test -­

5

clarified managed, accessible, whatever, I think an exam

6

and I've taken that test, so I know. I mean, it

6

might make sense.

7

certainly would make sense.

7

8
9

Experience. When I was reading this I actually
wrote a question down. I actually said does that mean we

8
9

yet.
MS. MOTT: Well, regarding the exam, I think

CO-CHAIR HANKS: It would be always be in
addition to.
MS. MOTT: Yes, right.

10

-- does this -- is this a grandfathering clause, you

10

11

know, instead of -- you know, I don't see how you get the

11

to be very clear that we are not talking about changing ­

12

experience -- if you can't qualify you can't get the

12

- this is accretive as opposed to substituting.

13

experience. So you have to qualify to get the

13

14

experience. So I was a little confused about that so I

14

Yeah, thank you. And then finally my thoughts on

15

wrote down the question grandfathering. Is that -- is

15

experience, whether lawyers -- so you have your CPA, MBA,

16

that what we mean by this? I guess let me go, jump to

16

whatever, again I looked at the -- I looked to our group,

17

the last -­

17

I looked at my colleagues across the country, most of

CO-CHAIR HANKS: I think -- you know, we have

MS. MOTT: Yes, I think that's a good point.

18

MR. GOMEZ: Catherine, if -­

18

them tend to be educated, have some sort of degree, tend

19

MS. MOTT: -- jump to the last one.

19

to fall in that category unless it's simply they got

20

MR. GOMEZ: This is Sebastian, if I may just to

20

lucky and inherited money or got it -- made it big on one

jump in on that one.

21

investment, something like that.

22

MS. MOTT: Okay.

22

But for the most part people, you know, that are

23

MR. GOMEZ: What the staff was thinking is a

23

doing this are already qualified according to the net

24

situation in which someone who had previously invested in

24

worth of a million, and they're making that money, they

25

similar Reg D type deals but subsequently, say for

25

have those credentials, they already have them.

21

6 (Pages 18 to 21)


Page 22

So the only comment I would make is that when I

I would assume that people have gained

2

look at everything that we're going to talk about today,

2

experience -- hey, Greg -- gained experience investing

3

including this, is that the more complex something is

3

maybe through interstate exemptions or 506 offerings

4

made, the more expensive it is made, there's always going

4

where you're one of the 35 non-accredited, or maybe a

5

to be resistance in the market and you're going to reduce

5

504. So there are other options out there for people to

6

the amount of qualified individuals who could potentially

6

have made investments in the private space.

7

participate in investing in particularly, you know, this

7

8

asset class.

8

experience in the private space to translate that into

9

another option to meet the accredited investor

9

So my concerns are about for instance if we

So I like that idea, if you have investment

definition. I'm all for that.

10

include the minimum investment amount is there going to

10

11

be now a procedure by which you will have to report your

11

12

-- I mean, have your CPA, you know, verify or your stock

12

I was at Second Market many moons ago and we were trying

13

advisor to verify that you are -- now we're going back to

13

to figure out who would write the exam, who would police

14

that verification versus self-certification, and then

14

the exam, who would,, you know, give the exam. And we

15

we're talking about cost, and complexity, and resistance

15

kept saying it's probably going to be FINRA. So if FINRA

16

and, you know, because that was really what was holding,

16

doesn't hate the idea then I support that idea as well.

17

you know, the investors back between with, if I remember

17

I've taken the Series 7 as well. It's terrible, but if

18

right, we were talking about 506(b) and (c).

18

you study and you have a little finance expertise then

19

So when I think about the market and how it reacts,

19

you pass. So I like the idea of the exam as well.

20

I think it's just important for us to continue to keep it

20

So again my suggestion would be support

21

simple in order to avoid resistance in the marketplace

21

anything that addresses options, doesn't take away from

22

and impact entrepreneurs, and particularly in this asset

22

the pool that already is able to invest, and just creates

23

class. This is the first place they come besides

23

more money out there for angel networks and companies to

24

incubators. If they don't make it through here they

24

access capital. Because that's really going to -- I

25

don't make it to venture capital.

25

think it's going to be a huge help to private companies

The exam idea, we were thinking about that when

Page 23
1

So if we -- if we decrease the number -- if we

Page 25
1

if there's additional access to capital.

2

decrease this here it will have impact on future rounds

2

3

and other I guess -- and the opportunity in particular

3

include a minimum number of investments as a test is

4

for high growth companies like, you know, I think they've

4

there a number, is it a dollar number, a number of

5

been termed by, as gazelles in the industry, anything

5

investments?

6

that's fast growing. I mean, I'm just worried about

6

7

impacting the marketplace, so as long as we keep it

7

Sara. I have the idea of its -- you have blanket

8

simple and not make it complicated.

8

investments, because I would have a sense that people

9

would want that number to be fairly high. And maybe

10

that's not going to be the case, maybe it's a number of

11

investments. But I don't know what the -- I don't have
an idea in my head of what would be comfortable.

9
10
11

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Thank you, Catherine.
Annemarie.
MS. TIERNEY: I like the idea that I think you

CO-CHAIR HANKS: Annemarie, if we were to

MS. TIERNEY: I don't know the answer to that,

12

expressed of like do no harm, right. So we know from the

12

13

statistics, I think we talked about this before, that

13

I like the idea of, you know, do you have

14

when the accredited investor definition was changed to

14

experience investing, have you invested in maybe five to

15

exclude primary residence from the net worth test it

15

ten offerings over the past five years, and maybe that's

16

decreased the pool of potential investors, I think it was

16

comfortable. But there may not be that many options for

17

like from 9 percent of Americans to 7 percent o

17

non-accredited investors to have made those investments.

18

Americans. That's -- that's a pretty big percentage

18

So I hate to put a number on it that would limit

19

decrease.

19

somebody who maybe has done, you know, two sizeable

20

So the idea of changing the numeric thresholds

20

506(b) investments but only two, but instead of somebody

21

that exist, I think we've all discussed the fact that we

21

who has done five or six teeny investments.

22

probably would not support that, I certainly wouldn't

22

I don't know. I don't know the right -- I don't

23

support that. The idea of adding additional options to

23

know what the right parameter would be.

24

make people accredited obviously is I think very helpful

24

25

to the market.

25

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: You know, I don't know what
the right parameter is either. It seems like that would

7 (Pages 22 to 25)


Page 26

Page 28

1

be a difficult one to come up with. But also keep mind

1

kind of menu that you can go up and down. I would just

2

what Sara said a moment ago, and that is that we're

2

posit this. I was just in Birmingham, Alabama at an

3

talking about adding. And so if one of the things we add

3

incredible accelerated incubator down there and I met a

4

is, you know, you qualify if you've done X number of

4

whole bunch of accredited private investors that are

5

investments over X period, you don't have to really spend

5

supporting this giant incubator and accelerator, which

6

that much time thinking about whether or not that's the

6

took over an old Sears store as a matter of fact.

7

right measure or whether it's too difficult because it's

7

And a bunch of them were saying, effectively said

8

not the only measure.

8

to me I have no idea what I'm doing but I know the

9

business I'm investing in. Like there was a cooking

9

MS. TIERNEY: Well, I think -- what I was

10

getting at, is it the number of investments or is it the

10

business, they were making a special kind of cold coffee

11

amount. I think that it's difficult to -- that's what

11

that was going to be in Whole Foods.

12

I'm saying I have difficulty.

12

So as you went down some of these

13

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Oh, yeah.

13

conversations, knowledge of the company and knowledge of

14

MS. TIERNEY: I'm all for adding it,

14

the industry as opposed to being an accredited investor
who knows the investing business, I think that's another

15

absolutely. I'm just -- when Sara asked me what numbers

15

16

might be comfortable I actually don't have enough data to

16

interesting dynamic and I think you just touched on it as

17

sort of assess what a typical non-accredited investment ­

17

well. I don't know how you put it into the regs and I

18

- non-accredited investor portfolio would look like.

18

don't know how you phrase it, but some of the smartest

19

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: I would agree with that.

19

investors I've ever seen know the company and the

20

MS. TIERNEY: Yes.

20

industry as opposed to the investing community.

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: I mean, is it -- is it the

21

And I'm not sure how we commemorate that, but it is

22

number, the amount, the issuer, the industry. You can go

22

something I would argue to include in the argument of the

23

-- you can go on and on I think.

23

additional things, which is industry knowledge or

21

24

MS. TIERNEY: Right.

24

specific knowledge of the company and the environment, or

25

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Any other comments? Yes,

25

even the geography that it's in, which you sometimes see

Page 27

Page 29

Mark.

when you go to these incubators and accelerators or

2

MR. WALSH: Just to clarify. These things that
you listed are in replacement of the dollar figure -­
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: No.
MR. WALSH: -- they are additional too?
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Additional too.
MR. WALSH: So as long as I have the dollar
amount this would be a separate layer on top of that?
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Exactly.
MR. WALSH: So just a couple of quick thoughts
on that. The -- a couple of I think as you mentioned
were sort of tautological. They were kind of -- they
were self-referential and I think you could probably
purge those pretty rapidly.
But the test idea, I would suggest that whatever
test you make the answers will be shared on the Internet
for everybody so that the issuers will give the answers.
I mean, I know -- I know it's an interesting idea, but I
just don't see where a test for an individual as opposed
to a Series 7, and they're more official and kind of
rigorous ones, I'm not sure that would ever work. So I
would just personally tell you I think that's going -­
that's going to fail.
And as far as number of investments and dollars
and stuff, you're right. I think this is an interesting

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Thank you. Laura.

5

MS. YAMANAKA: Yes, first off I want to say I

6
7

really agree with a lot of the ideas that I'm hearing

8

coming across and I really support the idea of broadening

9

the pool of potential funders for this -- in this area.

10

I also want to comment in light of life and what's

11

happening in the world that it's not just about the

12

investors, but it's about the people who have the

13

opportunity to invest.
So while we want to protect and we want to

14
15

provide Transparency, and we do have to protect those who

16

are not able to protect themselves, on the other hand as

17

we look at the economy, how it's moving forward, how

18

people accumulate wealth, how they save for their

19

retirement, and how all those economics impact how we all

20

live, I think it's really important that we as a

21

committee see what we can do to balance those factors

22

out.

23

Somebody made a comment to me, I was on my way

24

to this trip here and, you know, I told them what I was

25

doing. They were like, oh, my God, you're on this SEC

8 (Pages 26 to 29)


Page 30

Page 32

1

committee, and they don't do anything and who really

1

investing is invest in what you know and this is what

2

cares.

2

small investors do. Yeah, I bet angels have input in it.

3

And, you know, got my dander up a little bit and I

3

How do we put that into words that our friends at the

4

gave them my standard answer, and, you know, who cares.

4

Commission could actually put into a rule?

5

But then when I really thought about it this is exactly

5

MS. MOTT: First of all I probably -- I'll

6

why we're here too. Yes, it's for capitalism, it's for ­

6

speak on behalf of the ACA. I'm sure they would be

7

- to make sure that we continue to fund at all different

7

pleased to help participate in defining that. So let me

8

levels the growth and the innovation of the United

8

ask, was your uncle -- he had the net worth, though,

9

States, but it's also equally and maybe more important

9

right?

10

that we're giving our people the opportunity at the

10

11

broadest possible section to invest in the United States

11

started out he was -- he just saved money on the side,

MS. YAMANAKA: Eventually he did, but when he

12

and in their small companies, in the companies that you

12

you know. No, in the beginning he didn't. He was always

13

talked about.

13

the one who told me, you know, when we were little he

14

My uncle just died. He didn't go to college.

14

goes, "You got to save a little money for the rainy day

15

He worked right out of high school. He started out at an

15

and you save, you know, a couple dollars here for this",

16

electrical company, okay. He put my parents through -­

16

he called it his play fund, right.

17

my father through college. And when he died he had

17

And what happened is over time it -- smart

18

amassed a huge amount of investments. He would have

18

investing he got to be -- he would have qualified, okay.

19

never qualified under any of these rules.

19

But it took him how many years? I mean, he lived a long

20

One time I spoke to him, I go, "Uncle, how are you

20

time, but that's what he said. He goes, hey, if he knew

21

doing this?"

21

that he could be this successful he would have done this

22

He goes, "Well, you know, I can't do it the

22

first instead of the first 30 years and whatever.

23

other way so I just do it by the school of hard knocks."

23

So their group really made investments viable I

24

And I go, "What do you mean?"

24

think after they retired. They retired at 55 and they

25

And he goes, "I knew" -- he knew the electrical

25

could back, you know, union and stuff. And then after

Page 31

Page 33

1

industry, he knew it backward and forwards. He knew what

1

2

would work in the short run and long run. He got his

2

3

buddies together, they made an investment pool, and they

3

both described is -- characterizes the industry of

4

invested in all these little technologies that, hey,

4

private investors because they provide more than their

5

maybe you're not going to see it grow, but he did quite

5

money, they provide their knowledge, their expertise,

6

well, turned over, turned over.

6

their, you know, their connections. They open up their

that that's when they made their real money.
MS. MOTT: Okay. So what you and Mark have

7

And I'm going, that's the kind of intelligence,

7

rolodexes to find vendors, suppliers, advisors. I'm

8

funds, resources that we want to encourage here. And the

8

trying to think. Even when they're doing due diligence

9

fact that -- I like that we're expanding, it's great, I

9

they're looking in their rolodex and they're connecting

10

think it's wonderful. But I'm thinking are there ways

10

to -- and I'll just give you an example.

11

that we can also expand the reach for all those people -­

11

We looked at a device that is going to help us

12

for my uncle out there, for all my uncles out there and

12

understand and manage strokes. And so we were like, we

13

people who are -- they knew their industry, they know it

13

don't have neurosurgeons in our group, but we have

14

backwards and forwards.

14

doctors and doctors who know neurosurgeons. And the next

15

Because the rules that we're setting are not for

15

thing you know, before you know it, we're calling the

16

today or for tomorrow, we're setting the seeds for the

16

head of neurosurgery at Columbia University because one

17

future. And I got to put my one last shout out for we

17

of our doctors knew him, went to med school with him. So

18

really need data. We really, really need more data so we

18

that got us someone who could help advise on making those

19

can make solid decisions and not guess and use my uncle

19

decisions.

20

as evidence. Thank you.

20

21

CO-CHAIR HANKS: In the absence of data, I mean

So my point is here is you've characterized the

21

industry. They want to help these companies be

22

how -- does anyone have any ideas on how we do the

22

successful. It's their own money, it's not someone else's

23

industry specific uncle definition for accredited

23

money, and it's also typically, you know, their neighbor

24

investors? Because I think this is a really excellent

24

or somebody they know down the -- you know, in their

25

point. I mean, one of the best statements about

25

community. So it's a little bit different.

9 (Pages 30 to 33)


Page 34

Page 36
we're talking about private placements.

1

How we can characterize that in a number, Sara? I

1

2

don't know, but I think it would be worth, you know,

2

3

saying you know -- I mean, we could certainly survey our

3

everyone has when we're talking about more regulation

4

membership. It's just a thought.

4

here is investor protection. What does that mean? Are

5

we -- I think what it means, what it ought to mean is

5

MR. WALSH: I have another suggestion in the

I think one of the fundamental problems

6

oft used but rarely achieved synergy amongst government.

6

protecting investors from fraud, not protecting investors

7

At the SBA we have engaged the Library of Congress,

7

from loss. Most businesses don't work out the way

8

which has a for profit research arm, which I did not know

8

they're planned to, and I don't care how much specialized

9

when I arrived there. And we're doing -- they're

9

knowledge somebody has it doesn't mean this deal is going

10

surveying all of our SBIC investments to see what kind of

10

to work out. Because maybe management is not that good,

11

SBIC funds or Latino, African American women managed and

11

maybe the concept is really stupid but they've got a

12

then what kinds of companies that they invest in to see ­

12

really good marketing person or a charismatic individual

13

- to make sure, to validate that we're doing our part to

13

who is able to penetrate the market.

14

get dollars where they often don't go and should go.

14

15

But we're doing another survey with them on

15

essence what investors need to know is that there is risk

So I think it's all about disclosure, and in

16

accelerators and incubators. And -- because we have an

16

here and the risk factors should identify with

17

accelerator, incubator contest that we offer every year

17

particularity the kinds of risk that exists here. And I

18

with hundreds and hundreds of accelerators and incubators

18

think trying to put too precise a point on this we're

19

that submit their plan, and their strategy, and videos

19

simply going to have lots of wordy regulations that are

20

and we hand them cash awards of $50,000. The third one

20

going to be hard to apply.

21

is happening right now. But we're doing research to make

21

22

sure that the accelerators and incubators we choose are

22

have, period. If we're going to add things I think the

23

better than the ones that we don't choose. And I won't

23

specific training, charter financial analysts, the Series

24

bore you with the details, but it's actually a wonderful

24

7 and other FINRA exams are good and the previous

25

story that we're -­

25

investment experience would all be things I would

So I'm -- I'm happy with sticking with what we

Page 35
1

So I'm happy to expand that if you're looking

Page 37
1

support. Thank you.

2

for either hard data across a large audience or anecdotal

2

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Thank you, Greg. Michael.

3

-- not anecdotal, but survey type data, sample type data

3

MR. PIECIAK: Thank you, Stephen. I just

4

across a larger audience, happy to expand that and sit

4

wanted to make a couple of broader policy points from a

5

with you or your teammates to see how the stuff we're

5

state regulator perspective. When we often think of

6

gathering could be of value in this data need.

6

accredited investor we think of wealth and income as a

7

proxy for sophistication, experience, knowledge, which I

8

think we're all discussing today. But in addition the

9

ability to withstand loss as Greg points out, there's

7
8
9

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Thank you for that. Greg,
welcome.
MR. YADLEY: Thank you. I apologize for being

10

late. The date of the meeting was changed and I was on

10

both the risk of the loss, there's a risk of fraud.

11

vacation, didn't get home until last night, didn't have

11

There's also legal risk in my opinion that, you know, the

12

time to shave. But I did find a clean white shirt.

12

terms of the deal might not be quite what you understood

13

So I'm not sure what everyone has said but I -­

13

them to be or you could be put at risk by future rounds

14

the draft recommendations I definitely concur in and

14

of investment, and that's something to be considerate of

15

would underscore the do no harm and the fact that we're

15

as well.

16

talking about additional exemptions.

16

17

I agree with Mark that a test sounds like a good

17

based qualifications to credentials or a test or things

18

idea, but I'm a part-time law professor and I have to

18

of that nature, we move away from the ability to

19

change my homework assignments every year in major ways

19

withstand loss in terms of the individuals that are

20

because otherwise I get the same bad answers back because

20

making the investment. So I just make that point, not to

21

they're shared.

21

make a recommendation but to say, you know, is there some

22

way of protecting those investors that are young, have a

22

I think minimum investments is a good test, but

So when we move away from, you know, asset

23

it's priming the pump. I was -- I lost on my second

23

credential but don't have considerable net worth or

24

investment and did okay on my first one and was back to

24

income protecting their investment, protecting their

25

even. So it shouldn't be that large of a number when

25

future, you know, going forward.

10 (Pages 34 to 37)

know, sophistication goes on both sides of the table and

2

just wanted to make one point there as well. People can

2

you've seen it many, many, times, I've seen it many, many

3

have great experience and great knowledge of a particular

3

times, where you're representing a company and there's

4

industry, but I think as John, and Greg, and Stephen, and

4

certain investors that you just stay away from for those

5

other lawyers would attest it doesn't necessarily mean

5

kinds of reasons.

6

that they understand the deal terms, and just for one

6

7

risk for example do they understand what dilution means

guy goes back to his college reunion, flies in on a

if the next round of investment comes in.

8

helicopter. Have you heard this old joke?

1

9

On the knowledge of the industry perspective, I

So there has to be some level of sophistication

MR. REARDON: There's a joke about that. The

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: No, please tell.

9

MR. REARDON: He gets off with his body guards

10

built into someone's knowledge of a particular industry

10

11

or experience in my opinion.

11

and some of his classmates from the class of whatever go

12

up to him and say, "Gee, Joe, you're -- this is great.

13

How did you make all this money?"

14

And he said, "Well, I make a part for a dollar and

12
13
14

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Thank you, Michael. Anyone
else? Patrick.
MR. REARDON: I'm happy with tests or anything

15

on sophistication. I do think the problem -- we're not

15

I sell it for $4, and that 4 percent interest really adds

16

going to be able to create a test, so we will have to

16

up."

17

rely on somebody else's certification, like a chartered

17

18

financial analyst. Once you have one test there's going

18

19

to be the me too syndrome, that the certified financial

19

that.

20

planners are going to want to come in and -- or the

20

else?

21

accountants take a test and the lawyers take a test.

21

22

Wherever you go there are going to be people

22

(Laughter.)
MR. REARDON: There are a lot of people like
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Yeah. Okay. Anyone
Well, everyone has a copy of the draft
recommendation. I'm not going to read through it again.

23

that may have credentials and there are going to be

23

But what I would like to do is to, you know, move to

24

dummies in there that are going to make bad investments.

24

adopt that recommendation with the following changes that

25

But, I mean, I'm happy as long as -- and Julie pointed

25

we can sort out later this morning or early this

out that this -- we had a discussion of this before the

1

afternoon so we can have a final to look at today. Is

2

meeting, and she's got a mind like a steel trap. She

2

that feasible?

3

immediately said this may be already in there, but there

3

4

needs to be a presumption that if somebody says I'm

4

the pool to include those who have passed the Series 7,

5

sophisticated for this reason that they've got the burden

5

65 or 82 exams, you know, makes sense, and that the

6

if they ever get buyer's remorse of proving they weren't

6

Commission should give some thought to this whole idea

7

sophisticated and there was some reason why the issuer

7

that we're talking about where it's -- and we touched on

8

should have not accepted that self-certification.

8

this a little bit the last time around as well, is that

9

when -- when it seems -- it seems a little bit out of

9

You know, I'll pick on my own profession.

And add to that the suggestion that expanding

10

There are plenty of lawyers and a lot of lawyers will

10

bounds when we start trying to protect people from

11

tell you they know everything. But, you know, if they

11

themselves as opposed to trying to protect people from

12

lose some money it's going to be that they were cheated

12

fraudsters when -- because you come from a certain

13

and deceived and they're going to have remorse over

13

background or a certain income level you're not given the

14

making that investment.

14

opportunity to invest in things that could be very

15

lucrative.

15

So if you're going into the area of

16

subjectivity, and we talked about protecting the

16

17

investor, I worry about protecting the issuer, that the

17

know is investor protection. That's -- I think that's

18

issuer is not set up if they -- if the rule says you're

18

something that needs to be thought about because I think

19

going to -- you're going to take their certification.

19

that's a real issue. I don't know how you get there

20

Well, if I take their certification that's got to be it

20

necessarily, but I think it's something that does deserve

21

and for -- you know, absent fraud and winking and

21

additional thought. If you can somehow define the

22

nodding. But, I mean, there are plenty of people out

22

industry expertise, somehow define the knowledge that you

23

there who for whatever reason don't know things and I see

23

might have with respect to a particular company to enable

24

it all the time.

24

you to qualify I think we should kind of put our heads

25

together and see if there's an answer.

25

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Yeah, you're right. You

The flip side of that is of course as we all

11 (Pages 38 to 41)


Page 42
MS. YAMANAKA: Stephen, that's so important. I

Page 44
1

how many times they're told that they might lose

2

just want to give people the opportunity to play. If we

2

everything, they never believe it. And then when they

3

can be part of a group that broadens that pool in however

3

lose everything then it's -- it's -- you have a difficult

4

way we can do it I don't think it could hurt in that

4

situation. Well, sometimes yes, sometimes no. Sometimes

5

sense, If people have the opportunity to participate in a

5

they -- I mean, there are those that are prone to sue,

6

non-traditional way. Because all the others are, to

6

but there are others who just lose everything.

7

Mark's point, you know, you got to be -- you're in the

7

And so, you know, some sort of balance, and I don't

8

group already. I think that if we can look and see if

8

know what the answer is but, you know, I could -- I can ­

9

there are other ways if you're not in the group how can

9

- in this context I would -- I could see the -- I could

1

10

see room for limits. I don't know what they might be,

11

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Right.

11

but I can see some sort of limitation.

12

CHAIR WHITE: Stephen.

12

13

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Yes, please.

13

It's a tough, it's a tough question, I agree. I just -­

14

CHAIR WHITE: If I may just follow up

14

I think that right now as it stands you're eliminating a

15

with a question. Does that also mean -- I mean,

15

whole category of people that we can bring into the

16

opportunity to participate, I guess I would ask you -- I

16

wealth making process of the United States, and not only

17

think I probably know the answer but, you know, your

17

that but they bring something else to the table, to

18

views on investment limits coupled with the opportunity,

18

Catherine's point and then to Mark's point, regarding

19

broadening the opportunity to participate, I assume -­

19

knowledge and expertise.

20

let me let -- you answer for yourself, okay.

20

I don't think it's our responsibility to prevent

10

you participate. Thank you.

MS. YAMANAKA: I struggle with limits, right,

MS. YAMANAKA: Let's say it's on the table.

21

loss because if not, you know, we're out of business

22

because I think -- let's take my uncle again. He was in

22

before we start. On the other hand I don't think we're

23

a totally different situation. He was a bachelor, he had

23

talking about people who are going to take their first

24

no -- his first big investment was his house that he paid

24

paycheck and put it into this. We're talking about I

25

off early because he had no family obligations. And he

25

think a different level or segment of the population that

21

Page 43

Page 45

1

was in a different financial situation versus my parents

1

has some sort of knowledge and they're not just investing

2

who put their kids through college on their own and all

2

in their 401K at their company level stock.

3

this other kind of things.

3

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Right. It's a difficult

4

I think that when you -- like we had all

4

5

indicated earlier, there's no protection against loss. I

5

6

mean, if there is it would be -- you know, this would be

6

7

a different business. So loss is a very real part of the

7

is. But you don't want -- and I have -- I have said I

8

equation that people have to understand.

8

don't like paternalistic attitudes, but nonetheless I

9

I think that, and I could be wrong, but I'm hoping

9

don't want to see somebody lose their house.

question.
MS. YAMANAKA: It's a line.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: I don't know what the answer

10

that people understand when they have to start thinking

10

MS. YAMANAKA: Yes, yes, absolutely.

11

about investments as a normal course of their whole life

11

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: And it's -- you know, and as

12

directory it's like having a checking account, thinking

12

far as preventing loss is concerned, the idea is to make

13

about retirement, and now, look, they're not going to be

13

people understand, really truly understand the risk

14

taken care of. They have to take care of these things

14

involved and the possibility of loss and not to -- not to

15

for themselves. I think that it's fair to them if they

15

ever hope to prevent loss because that's, that's folly.

16

are going to have that responsibility that they have full

16

MS. YAMANAKA: Right.

17

access to the complement. I'm not saying there has to be

17

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Greg.

18

a lot of education, structure, or whatever those things

18

19

are but, no, we can't protect against loss or limits

19

going to look at limits I would start with the crowd

20

because again by definition you're keeping that pool

20

funding limits only because one of the things we want to

21

small.

21

keep in mind is simplicity there. And I think the

22

Commission has done a good job in the bad actor area

22

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Yeah, we can't do that and I

MR. YADLEY: If we -- if the Commission is

23

don't know what the answer is, but so many investors that

23

about trying to get to one standard. So if we're going

24

are not small investors I don't care how many times, you

24

to do that we may as well at least start with something

25

know, they read through the risk factors, I don't care

25

that we're going to start, be able to gather data on, and

12 (Pages 42 to 45)


Page 46
1

that's Regulation CF.
Personally part of me says, yeah, it's nice

2

Page 48
1

they're not looking for a hundred investors, they're

2

looking for a limited number, a network of SPV,

3

that there should be limits. I'm not a gambler, but

3

something. They don't want to do a lot of small

4

whenever I've been on a cruise ship I've taken the amount

4

investors.

5

of money that I've decided I can lose and gone to play

5

So I think again if you look at crowd funding we've

6

and gone to bed early.

6

always talked about, you know, in kind of the area where

7

And I'll say that my most successful investments

7

I practice a lot of companies aren't going to want to

8

have been those where my conservative nature came through

8

take advantage of crowd funding offerings potentially

9

and I said I trust the people, I think it's a good deal,

9

because they're ending up with a lot of really small

10

I don't want to get over extended, and those have always

10

investors. And we've talked in a conference that I've

11

been the best ones.

11

attended, venture capital firms have said they will

12

probably never come in and invest after a crowd funding

So the next time when I invest in something I

12
13

invest more and it doesn't work out. So I think that's

13

round because there's just going to be too many people on

14

the problem with limits. But at least a percentage of

14

the cap table and too hard to manage.

15

assets or net income, although it's a snapshot at times,

15

So again they do have a small limitation amount.

16

at a moment in time, and it may prevent you, an individual

16

It will impact what they can invest in, it will impact

17

from taking advantage of a deal that you believe in, if

17

issuers' interests in allowing them to invest. So I

18

we're going to do that then I guess that's okay.

18

think we have to be really careful to balance that as
well.

19

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Annemarie.

19

20

MS. TIERNEY: I have a couple of thoughts.

20

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Thank you for that. Again I

First of all I would be adamantly opposed to any kind of

21

-- let's stipulate that we're not doing anything to the

limits that impact the existing structure. So if there

22

core, the core framework, right. And then anything that

23

was a limitation I would think it would need to be on a

23

we might add to that, for example passing a Series 7, et

24

category where there's less comfort, so maybe it's

24

cetera, that we're not talking about applying limits to

25

somebody who has a minimum investment history. But you

25

that either, at least that's not what I'm thinking.

21
22

Page 47

Page 49

1

certainly wouldn't want to tell a financially accredited

1

I'm thinking about -- and again I don't have the

2

investor that they were -- that they needed to be limited

2

answer, but just going back to those individuals that

3

in their investment. I think the -­

3

otherwise would be left out, how do you bring them in in

4

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: No, not at all.

4

a rationale way.

5

MS. TIERNEY: -- thing you need to think about

5

Catherine.

6

when you talk bout limits is that's going to preclude

6

7

limited people from investing in a lot of opportunities

7

Commissioner White's question because, you know, one of

MS. MOTT: So, yes, I wanted to respond to

8

because there's always a minimum investment amount. So

8

the things I've -- you know, my first -- let me talk

9

if you have a minimum investment amount of $25,000 or

9

historically. The industry has changed dramatically over

10

$50,000, Catherine, right, in a normal angel investment ­

10

the past ten years. I made my first investment in 1999,

11

-

11

and it was one of those things where I was sitting,
talking to some folks, sitting at the bar talking bout a

12

MS. MOTT: The average is 20.

12

13

MS. TIERNEY: The average is 20. Then if you

13

deal. It was Smart tech, Smart card technology. It

14

set a limit that precludes people from investing that

14

sounded great and I wrote my check without any due

15

amount then they're already out of -- they're out of the

15

diligence, you know, lost everything. But you know -­

16

network of investing, and then maybe they can only invest

16

But how the industry has changed since that

17

in one opportunity a year.

17

time you know, with dot com and what it's like today. It

18

So I think you have to be really careful with

18

is much more sophisticated. Best practices are out

19

limitations because you're going to shoot yourself in the

19

there. There was not -- there was no Angel Capital

20

foot. You're not going to get -- these people are not

20

Association, there were no portals like Angel List and

21

going to get the opportunity to invest.

21

other things that really help the individual investor

22

with a portfolio approach.

22

Also I think companies that are raising capital

23

probably are tending to look to accumulate the capital

23

Because this is -- as a matter of fact we have an

24

from a limited number of investors, right. Most Reg D

24

orientation, most of the best practices of the ACA has an

25

506 offerings, you know, they're not looking to invest,

25

orientation program and that includes -- we take

13 (Pages 46 to 49)


Page 50

Page 52

1

everything that our financial advisors tell us and say,

1

it. He was smart but, you know, I just think there are a

2

hey, we advise that this -- you know, we're not telling

2

lot of people out there doing those things and to not let

3

you how much to put in here or how much to do, but we

3

them expand -- but however we can do it.

4

advise that you limit it to 10 percent of your investable

4

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay.

5

assets. So we tell them that.

5

CO-CHAIR HANKS: Jonathan.

6

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay, Lisa.

We also say that we -- you should not invest in

6
7

less than ten companies, and even ten may not be right.

7

8

I mean, some of the research that we've done and we've

8

on the -- I don't think that we need to put more limits

9

shown is that it may mean 15 or 18 in order to get a 27

9

on and I know that it is something that was just out

10

percent, you know, return on investment.
So, I mean, so the industry has changed, and so

11

MS. SHIMKAT: I just wanted to add a little bit

10

there and thrown on the table, because I think when we

11

start overstepping back into the -- away from protection

12

even if you're an individual investor like your uncle now

12

of fraud and more protection for themselves. And we have

13

there is information available now that he could just

13

to remember, too, what makes the headlines. What makes

14

search the Internet and with his group of friends say,

14

the headlines is a fraud or -- and that's how somebody

15

oh, gee, we shouldn't put all our eggs in one basket,

15

lost it.

16

although there's a temptation to do that sometimes

16

17

because this is -- this next antibiotic is going to be

17

the 2 percent that had a bad experience but you don't

18

the best thing ever and I'm going to put $300,000 in it

18

hear from the 98 percent that had a wonderful experience.

19

and, you know what I mean. There is a temptation there.

19

And so I think, though, the news media grabs those

20

first and that's what we have to remember, that that is not
the majority hopefully out there.

20

It's just like the customer service. You hear from

21

But as again the information has -- the whole

21

22

industry has changed and you can jump onto Angel List or

22

23

a crowd funding portal, something like that that will

23

different. It's like the whole incubator, the whole

24

help you make some decisions differently than you would

24

industry is inside out now and we're pushing resources to

25

have 12 years ago.

25

it. So I appreciate what we have now and I just want to

Page 51
MS. YAMANAKA: I just want to point out that my

1

Page 53
1

2

uncle didn't know about the ACA. I don't think he got

2

3

the Internet in the last, you know, whatever. But a lot

3

4

-- but the portfolio, the limitation, the expertise, they

4

5

-- his group had all of those in place. So if one of the

5

6

guys said, hey, I got this buddy and he wants to like

6

7

whatever -- and remember they're all kind of similar

7

8

industries. So they would put less money in and if they

8

9

had three of them they would put more money in.

9

10

And they had this whole thing on liquidation, you

10

11

know, as far as how much do they want to get out, when,

11

12

who, the tax situation, the extra money, because they

12

13

would have their meetings in Vegas, right. All of these

13

14

things that -- it's kind of funny because when I started

14

15

reading all the best practices they were already doing

15

16

it.

16

17

So my point is I think there's a lot of people

And we do business differently now, it is so much

17

18

out there that we don't realize who don't have the

18

19

opportunity to sit in this room, who don't have the

19

20

little degrees, haven't gone to college in that way,

20

21

aren't connected, aren't on the Coast, that are doing

21

22

this and we probably don't know about it, which gets back

22

23

to my thing about really with liking to have data to

23

24

either tell me my uncle was the aberration, the only man

24

25

in his group in the United Sates doing that. I doubt

25

make sure that we don't start the conversation again to
where we're trying to protect people from themselves
again.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay. It's about time to
wrap up. Commissioner Stein, did you have something?
COMMISSIONER STEIN: No, Jonathan has -­
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: I'm going to Jonathan.
COMMISSIONER STEIN: I'm fine.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: You're fine, okay. So
Jonathan, wrap it up.
MR. NELSON: Just to kind of dovetail on what
Ms. Mott was saying, has there been any discussion in
terms of protecting investors from bad investments by
encouraging them, like smart defaults would be to
actually help them create portfolios of 20 to 25
companies? From what I understand it's actually -­
unaccredited investors actually can't make those types of
investments, they can't actually invest in funds. But
portfolio diversification is actually one of the best
ways to actually encourage, you know, actually to build
those results in those, have those IRRs.
I also in terms of investor protection was
talking with a friend of mine who runs the largest
secondary fund in Silicon Valley and he was saying that
one of the reasons that there aren't as many publicly

14 (Pages 50 to 53)


Page 54

Page 56

1

listed companies is because frankly the returns on

1

So we should probably think about the financial

2

capital are all in the private markets. Unaccredited

2

designations. And I would even throw in, you know, the

3

investors only have public markets to actually invest in

3

MBA as well as a component for identifying a

4

or they have real estate, and when everybody gets frothy

4

sophisticated investor.

5

about that we've seen what happens there.

5

6

I think it would be interesting to encourage them

6

7

to invest in these other asset classes and actually build

7

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: If not more so. So -­

8

smart defaults by building portfolios. I don't

8

MR. WALSH: They were in my class by the way.

9

necessarily see that listed here, but I was wondering if

9

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: It's -- I don't recall being

10

anybody else had had conversations along those lines.

10

11

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: You know, that might dovetail
into what we've talked about and we'll probably get to in

12

13

later meetings, and that's outreach. I think there's a

13

14

lot of educating that needs to be done on both sides of

14

15

the table.

15

Okay, so we have the -- we have the draft

in your class but -­
So why don't we say 7, 65, 82, CFA or similar?

11

12

16

CO-CHAIR HANKS: I think we all know a lot of
MBAs who are as stupid as JDs.

CO-CHAIR HANKS: Yeah, similar or equivalent,
yeah.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay. Anything else? Can I
get a motion?
(Motion made and seconded.)

16

17

recommendation from last time and I'm suggesting that we

17

18

add to that, that we suggest expanding the pool of

18

19

accredited investors by including those who have passed a

19

(Chorus of ayes.)

20

Series 7, 65 or 82 exams. And I'll also ask the

20

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Opposed?

21

Commission to look for ways to be more inclusive,

21

(No response.)

22

shorthand for what we've been talking about for the last

22

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay, thank you.

23

30 minutes.

23

24

Any -- does that -- does that -­

24

25

MR. REARDON: What about the CFP exam?

25

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Any additional discussion?
All those in favor?

We're just a little bit behind, but let's just
kind of dive into Regulation A.
Sarah.

Page 55

Page 57
CO-CHAIR HANKS: All right. So one of the

1

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: I'm sorry?

1

2

MR. REARDON: CFP, chartered financial -- no,

2

things we were talking about earlier is the fact that a

3

number of us have been distressed by the fact that

3

it's chartered financial analyst, CFA.

4

there's a lot of small businesses out there who really

5

son passed it so I know how hard it is. I would -- and I

5

don't know how many options there are for capital raising

6

mentioned that earlier.

6

outside of the public market. This ties into what we've

4

MR. YADLEY: Yeah, CFA is really -- I mean, my

7

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay.

7

been talking about throughout this committee with respect

8

MR. YADLEY: And I'm not sure that CPAs and law

8

to outreach to small businesses, and I'll get to the

9

investor side of that in a second.

9

degrees really matter.

10

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: No.

10

But we're now celebrating the 13 month

11

MR. YADLEY: But I think the chartered

11

anniversary or so of implementation of one of those

12

exemptions, which is Regulation A, also referred to as

13

Regulation A+ or the mini IPO. And I hadn't realized

14

that -- are you guys okay with calling it a mini IPO? We

15

-­

12
13

financial analyst is a pretty good -­
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: I can assure you they don't.

14
15

CO-CHAIR HANKS: WE all know too many lawyers.

16
17
18

MS. TIERNEY: What were the exam numbers that
you were suggesting? I'm sorry, I heard the 7 and the -­

16

(Laughter.)

17

CO-CHAIR HANKS: I'm going to take that -­

18

A PARTICIPANT: A+ is nice.

19

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: 65.

19

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: It's not okay.

20

MS. TIERNEY: so that's the financial advisor?

20

A PARTICIPANT: Stick with A+.

21

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: And 82.

21

22

MS. TIERNEY: Okay.

22

MR. AGUILAR: Yeah, there's a few exams that I

23

23

CO-CHAIR HANKS: So I personally don't call it
a mini IPO because the implications of public markets.
But those amendments went into effect just over

24

think are tougher than the Series 7, like the CFA, the

24

a year ago and now companies can do offerings up to $50

25

CAIA, which is an alternative investment certification.

11

too burdensome. So well done on hitting the right

11

as amended it consists of two tiers. Tier one for

12

balance there, and all of my clients would have said the

12

offerings of up to $20 million a year and tier two for

13

same thing.

13

offerings of up to $50 million a year.

14

But now that we've got this one year

For offerings of up to $20 million a year a

14

anniversary it's a good time to start thinking about how

15

company can elect to proceed either under tier one or

it's been used. From my own experience I've seen that

16

tier two. Both of those tiers are subject to basic

17

there's a number of filings out there. As the Chair said

17

requirements as to eligibility, disclosure, and other

18

there's been roughly a hundred filings. It looks like

18

matters that were drawn from the current, what existed in

19

roughly half of them are real estate, which is a

19

Reg A before and updated by the Commission.

20

completely different asset class in many ways, and some

20

21

of these that we identify I think don't apply to real

21

draft offering statements for non-public review. That

22

estate. Some of the real estate companies have been very

22

means that a company that wants to start the process

23

successful.

23

doesn't have to actually go live, public in the filing,

24

but can commence a review of that filing behind the

25

scenes with the staff and start getting those comments

15
16

24
25

There have been a lot of really exciting
companies filing who are operating companies, roller

Both tiers also permit companies to submit

coasters for example, virtual reality companies, every

1

from the staff before they actually go public with their

2

sort of three wheeled vehicle that you can imagine. I

3

think there's about five of them testing the waters or

3

4

filing at the moment. So there's some very exciting

4

the filing of the offering circular and while the

5

companies there.

Companies can also test the waters both before

6

But to answer the question that Commissioner

6

the staff. In addition to the basic requirements that

7

Stein raised earlier, she was asking why aren't more

7

applies to both tiers. Tier two offerings are subject to

8

companies using this exemption. And I think part of the

8

some other requirements, including the requirement to

9

answer is the investors don't know it's out there. We've

9

provide audited financial statements, the requirement to

10

already seen a number of these really exciting companies

10

file annual and semi-annual reports, and a limitation on

11

file, not get anywhere, withdraw, and that seems really

11

the number of securities that non-accredited investors

12

disappointing, and especially building on the thing that

12

can purchase of no more than 10 percent of the greater of

13

Laura was talking about earlier about access and the

13

the investor's income or net worth.

14

ability for small investors to build their portfolio.

14

So touching upon the numbers that the Chair

15

I mean, here is a very safe place where investors

15

mentioned this morning, more specifically since the

16

could build their portfolio. These securities have been

issuers have publicly filed 108 offerings with the

18

very risky, but they are less risky in many ways than

18

Commission. A number have taken advantage of this non-

19

some of the Reg D offerings we've talked about before. I

19

public staff review process that I have described. The

20

think it's a real shame that the investors are not yet

20

108 public filings are seeking an aggregate amount of

21

turning up, and I think the fact that the investors are

21

just over $2 billion.

22

not turning up is one of the reasons why the issuers are

22

Of the publicly filed offering statements our data

23

not filing, and you've got a whole chicken and egg thing

23

indicates that there's a largely even divide between tier

going on there.

24

one offering and tier two offerings. And since the

you, Sebastian, on the rulemaking petition we understand

number compared to the total pool.

11

petition.

11

MS. TIERNEY: Thank you.

12

MR. GOMEZ: Sure. For all of those of you who

12

MR. REARDON: Sebastian, can you tell, do you

13

want to take a look at it, anyone can submit a rulemaking

13

happen to know out of the 108 how many had placement

14

petition to the Commission. They're actually posted on

14

agents or underwriters, whatever they're called in these

15

the SEC website. So anyone can go to the SEC website and

15

offerings?

16

look at the specific petition.

16

MR. GOMEZ: That's a great point, Patrick. I

17

don't have the specific numbers, but it is a very small

17

The petition is seeking to expand Reg A with

18

respect to two aspects. One is to permit companies that

18

percentage of them. A lot of them, the vast majority of

19

are already reporting companies to use the exemption.

19

them are self-underwritten. There has been some of those

20

The original Reg A and as amended by the Commission, both

20

offerings that had underwriters or placement agents, but

21

of them excluded from participating in the exemption

21

it's a small percentage of the 108 pool.

22

companies that were already reporting companies, so

22

23

companies that had already done the IPO and were already

23

I mean, to reach out to the small broker/dealers are

24

reporting companies.

24

these done on at best -- I assume they're best efforts?

25

So the petition asked for the Commission to

25

MR. REARDON: That might be an avenue because,

MR. GOMEZ: That's right. And Sara may have

Page 63

Page 65

1

expand the issuer eligibility to allow those companies to

1

some more. She worked on a number of them. So you may

2

use the exemption. In addition to that the petition also

2

have some idea as to the thinking between -- Paul might

asked with respect to resale of the securities for

also have some thoughts as to the thinking between the

4

expansion there as well. I encourage everyone to take a

5

look at it.

efforts.

6

As far as the process itself, once a petition

6

CO-CHAIR HANKS: There's some real challenges

7

comes in the staff will look at it and consider it and

7

there because one of the issues very few of them as

8

provide recommendations to the Commission. The staff is

8

Sebastian says have -- there's several different ways of

9

currently taking a look at that petition.

9

going about it, you know, firm commitment, underwriting,

10

CO-CHAIR HANKS: Thank you, Sebastian.

10

there aren't any best efforts, a person saying that

11

MS. TIERNEY: Can I just ask a question on the

11

they're in underwriting, the selling broker, it's

12

data? So Sebastian, of the 48 companies that have been

12

probably about 10 percent of those filings. And then the

13

qualified do you have a breakdown of how many of those

13

next level down is either completely self-underwritten,

14

were tier two and did any of them also file the 8(a)?

14

or they're going out on their own, or they're using an

15

I'm just curious, though, are they just doing the

15

executing broker/dealer to address state Blue Sky

16

straight tier two or are they doing the tier two with the

16

broker/dealer issues.

17

8(a)? Is there any trend there?

17

18

MS. GOMEZ: So the -- I don't have the specific

So there's very -- various different levels.

18

Part of the problem here from the point of view of

19

numbers, but the divide between tier one and tier two

19

brokers is a lot of these companies -- and we're talking

20

companies for qualification was also largely equal in

20

about operating here as opposed to real estate -- a lot

21

their -- so there wasn't really a big difference with

21

of them are complete startups with negative shareholder's

22

that respect.

22

equity and no revenues. There are a lot of broker/dealers

23

who are not the slightest bit interested in this. So -­

23

The 8(a) for all of you who are not aware of

24

it, it's another form that allows a company that does a

MR. REARDON: Okay, thank you.

Engineering. He is an automotive enthusiast who saw a

2

ask. 48 were qualified with $800 million. The delta -­

2

need for radically different vehicle, and if you've seen

3

or have they been withdrawn? What's the delta, what's

3

them they are really radically different. They are

4

going to happen to the Delta?

4

economical in terms of initial purchase price and ongoing

5

fuel costs as well as safe, environmentally conscious,
and fun to drive.

5

MR. GOMEZ: So part of it is the fact that this

6

is relatively new. So you have a one year period in

6

7

which the companies are going through a process of filing

7

8

the offering document. It goes through the review

8

manufacturing company, to make efficient, low cost, three

9

process with the staff. The ones that are tier one are

9

wheeled vehicles in the United States. In November 2015
he began a Regulation A offering of Elio's common stock.

So in 2009 he founded Elio Motors, the design and

10

also going through the review process at the state level.

10

11

So part of the delta is the fact that it's just

11

They have raised nearly $17 million from the offering.

12

so new. A number of companies that were the earlier

12

The shares are now traded on the OTCQX market and we

13

filers have completed the process and already cleared it.

13

thought it would be interesting to hear both from Elio

14

The 108 also includes companies that have very recently

14

and later OTC Markets about their experiences with Reg A.

15

filed and are just starting the process. So I think the

15

16

delta is something that as time progresses I expect that

16

17

it's going to be compressed and it's just due to the fact

17

MR. ELIO: Thanks for having me. My

18

that this is very new.

18

understanding is you kind of wanted to go through a

19

little overview of the company first and then talk about

20

Reg A+.

19
20

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: So again how much has
actually been raised that we're aware of?

21

This is a very interesting conversation to listen

22

and I'll give you a number, but also want to put that

22

in on. I have to say that the single biggest hurdle in

23

number in context. The rules require a company to report

23

creating Elio Motors was attracting capital. And I don't

24

to the SEC the total amount that has been raised once the

24

think if Reg A+ hadn't happened we would have made it.

25

offering has been completed. And if the company is a

25

This was absolutely key to our success. So I thank you.

21

MR. GOMEZ: So that's a great question, Steve,

And Paul, thank you for joining us and go
ahead.

tier one company they will file a short form that reports

1

2

how much was raised after the offering was completed.

2

basically Elio is about four things: a compelling value

3

The companies that are tier two will report that in

3

proposition, low price and high mileage. So our target

4

sticker price is $6,800 and our target mileage is 84

5

miles per gallon. And either one of those by themselves

4
5

their annual report.
A lot of these offering's costs they are self-

So any forward looking statements. So

6

underwritten. Best efforts by the company are very long

6

is compelling, but when you put them together it's an

7

going. So the company has not completed the offering

7

overwhelming value proposition.

8

itself, so has not reported -- has not been required to

8

It's got to be safe. We're designing it to the

9

report how much they sold because the offering is still

9

highest automotive safety standards. We aren't allowing

10
11

ongoing.
So the data that we have is the data for the

10

any new technology. I believe technology risk is the

11

death now of many pre-revenue startups, right. Even if
you bet on the technology, if it takes you six or nine

12

very small sliver of companies that likely underestimates

12

13

how much has been sold because of the fact that it only

13

months longer to work out the thought and you're working

14

captures those companies that have actually completed

14

off of other people's money bad things happen. So by

15

their offering, meaning they filed, qualified, and

15

using all technology that's already out there, it's

16

completed the offering. The data has been reported as

16

already being made and on other vehicles and executing it

17

$99 million to date, but keep in mind the caveat because

17

on this vehicle, we substantially mitigate that risk.

18

it likely underestimates companies that have started

18

And we're committed to making it in America. We

19

selling but have not completed the offering themselves.

19

control a site that we got out of the GM bankruptcy in
Shreveport, Louisiana. And we have a target of 90

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Thanks.

CO-CHAIR HANKS: All right. We are ready to go

to Paul. So thanks, everyone. We are now pleased to

22

very close to that. So not only is it assembled in

have Paul Elio join us from Phoenix, Arizona. Prior to

24

founding Elio Motors Paul was an engineer at Johnson

24

The basic architecture is it seats two people

Controls, CEO of the Automotive Consultancy ESG

25

front to back. The reason for that seating configuration

18 (Pages 66 to 69)


Page 70

is that's the key to the gas mileage. At highway speeds

1

credit card and every time you charge gas we charge a

2

most of your fuel goes to moving air. We are half as

2

trip. So buy $10 worth of a gas and it shows up as a $30

3

wide and we move half as much air, so we get double

3

charge on your credit card statement and that $20 extra

4

mileage.

4

goes to paying down your loan, right, it's your car

5

payment.

5

It has three wheels, which technically makes it a

6

Motorcycle, but what it does for us is it hides that

6

Now as long as you drove into the dealership in

7

third wheel behind the air stream that you've already

7

something that gets 27 miles to the gallon or less, and

8

moved. So it improves aerodynamics. It's front engine,

8

all 100 million of those old cars do, your monthly fuel

9

front wheel drive. So 70 percent of your mass and all

9

bill actually goes down, right. Three times 27 is 81 and

10

we get 84. So from the consumers' perspective they have

11

This is showing some of the engineering going

12

on behind the scenes. This is the front, side and rear

12

They don't have a car payment and they are guaranteed to

13

impact analysis, the computational fluid dynamics, which

13

spend less on gas. Next month they'll triple the amount

14

is predicting drag, which drives our gas mileage

14

on their brand new Elio than they did single amount on

15

calculations. This is a high speed swerve at 50 miles an

15

their clunker last month on the vehicle they were

16

hour and this is showing the interior finish.

16

struggling to keep on the road. We can literally give

17

cars away with 100 million old cars driving.

10

17
18
19

your traction is happening over those front two wheels.

So this is not a paper napkin sketch. There's
a lot of work that's gone on with this project.

18

We believe that there are four markets that we

The last segment that we create is the third

19

vehicle or the and vehicle, a-n-d. So the premise here

20

can sell Elio into. Two of them exist and two of them we

20

is that Americans buy big vehicles for a reason, right.

21

are going to create all by ourselves, at least for a

21

We like to disparage ourselves as being wasteful and

22

time. The first and most obvious is the new car market.

22

lazy, but the reality is you can't haul plywood in a

23

It's traditionally about 16 million units a year. It's

23

Prius, you can't tow a boat with a Versa, right. And we

24

more this year than probably next year. It's highly

24

buy big vehicles with a specific use in mind and we use

25

developed, highly segmented, with hundred year old

25

that vehicle for that purpose. Five percent of it is

Page 71

Page 73

1

players with great reputations, and quite honestly we

1

minds, right.

2

will get our hats handed to us in that market. We're not

2

And because small cars are too expensive they're

3

going to go in and take 100,000 Toyota, Ford or GM

3

not a choice. And so we end up driving all that metal

4

customers away. So although it's by far the most obvious,

4

back and forth to work all by ourselves to have that

5

it's the least interesting.

5

functionality when we need it.

6

The next market that also exists is the used car

6

7

market. It's traditionally 2-1/2 to 3 times larger than

7

a choice. So you buy and keep the big vehicle for the

8

the new car market and I think we play very well there.

8

reasons that you wanted it and you buy an Elio too. Now

9

If your alternative is a 120,000 mile Civic for $7,000 or

9

we have been preaching that this segment existed and now

At $6,800 and 84 miles per gallon Elio becomes

10

a brand new Elio for $7,000 I think I would win a fair

10

we have data. We pulled our reservations, and this is

11

number of those.

11

about a year, year-and-a-half ago, and asked them if they

12

were going to trade a vehicle. Ninety percent said they

12

Then we have the two markets that we create.

13

First is the clunker market. There's approximately 100

13

were not going to trade in a vehicle, they were just

14

million clunkers on U.S. highways. Now these are

14

going to buy an Elio.

15

different than used cars. These are cars that people are

15

So we've now demonstrated that this vehicle or this

16

using duct tape and bubble gum to keep on the road

16

segment exists and almost of our reservations are coming

17

because they can't afford to trade up to get a better

17

from that segment, which makes sense, right. If you're

18

used car. I think we would do very well in this segment.

18

in the market for a new or used car you need a vehicle

19

today, so you're not putting a reservation on an Elio.
If you're in the clunker market you don't have money to
put down on a vehicle you're not going to see for a year.

19
20

We're going to run a program aimed at those folks

20

21

called let your gas savings make your payments. And the

21

22

way it works is you walk in showroom, sign your name, you

22

So that -- it makes sense that all of our reservations

23

get a brand new vehicle and a credit card with a $300

23

are coming from that one segment. And as we have go into

24

limit on it and we let you walk back out the door. Now

24

production and have vehicles we'll start being able to

25

the deal is you have to charge all your fuel with that

25

sell to the other segments.

7

that. All of the rest of the upscale content that you

We're now over 55,000 reservations. So we have

8

55,000 people who have said I want an Elio and is willing

8

are used to seeing on your vehicle you can get on your

Elio but add it post manufacturer. So if you wanted

power leather seats we can get you that. If you want

13

can get you that.

We recently did a survey on have you ever heard

So the process is you walk into our showroom

of Elio, and it turns out only 6-1/2 percent of America

said, hey, people will buy this low cost, high mileage

So at first blush this system gives the

vehicle with front to back seating and three wheels in

but it does more than that. Most of the content that you

this unproven market, it was very hard to get traction.

see in vehicles today are created by the tier one supply

But as we've gotten more and more people to say, yeah, I

will buy that, that really has helped us in so many other

difficult time getting their new ideas executed on a

8

Our business model is different as well. So

8

9

we're going to do company owned stores, direct sales to

9

The two questions they have the hardest time

10

customers, the same as Tesla. So that's not particularly

10

everybody wants to be second. Nobody wants to be fourth,

11

innovative, but I think it's the right way to go.

11

but nobody wants to be first because if they integrate it

12

What we're really doing different is we are

12

and it doesn't work they're on the hook on repairing that

13

abandoning the package system. So current auto

widget for a decade trying to keep their customer.

14

manufacturers can build millions of configurations of a

14

15

given model. Now they don't because that would cripple

15

designed to put on after the vehicle is made it comes off

16

their inventory. So they've created packages, LX, SX and

16

easily as well. So we will -- we're okay with being

17

VX to constrain their build sequences to 3 to 500.

17

first, and if it doesn't work we're going to have a very

answering is who else has it. Nobody wants to be first,

We don't have that issue. Because it's

18

The problem with that is you get forced to buy

18

liberal return policy and we'll take it back it off and

19

an enormous amount of content you don't want. JD Powers

recently did a survey and consumers were reporting they

don't use 40 percent of the technology embedded in their

answer -- question answering is does my customer actually

want this. Because these things are always packaged in

23

any of us, so they can't just lop it off of the package.

23

with a bunch of other stuff they can't say yes your

So the consequence of the package system is you are

forced to buy thousands of dollars of stuff you neither

Plus system. With the E Plus system now they can go and

1

This is really the story of Elio Motors, it's

2

say are you -- are you first? No, Elio has got it. Does

2

the supply base. So people outside of Detroit look at

3

my customer want it? Yes.

3

who's selling us parts and say of course they'll sell you

4

Seventy percent of Elio customers are putting it on

4

parts. And the answer is no, actually, they won't. They

5

their vehicle and are willing to pay $150. So they want

5

don't like startups and they don't like small companies,

6

it and this is what they're willing to pay. So it's a

6

and particularly right now. So in the downturn a ton of

7

great way for them to test out their new technology and

7

suppliers went out of business. We're now back at record

8

prove that it's viable and drive it through their

8

volumes and every single supplier is resource

9

traditional customer.

9

constrained. So they are telling the big guys no in

10

order to have resources available to work on Elio.

10

What's good for our customers is they get see

11

the new technology first, right. If the big guys get

11

So the fact that they're engaged really means

12

enamored with the technology because of their design

12

something and it's truly the who's who of the global

13

cycle it takes them three years before it shows on the

13

supply base. Continental is the largest auto part

market. Our accessories won't have a model year. So as

14

supplier of any description. They're doing our

15

soon as it's available it will be available on Elio.

15

electronics. Bosch is the second largest auto parts

16

So for the first time ever the lowest priced

16

supplier of any description. They're doing fuel

17

vehicle on the market will have the best technology

17

injection, and safety sensors, and a bunch of other

18

first. That's never happened before and our customers

stuff. Aisin is the world's largest transmission

19

will get a lot better options on how to appoint their

supplier and the fifth largest auto parts supplier of any

vehicle.

description. Comau is our manufacturing partner.

21

The next thing is the vehicle stays relevant

21

They're wholly owned by Fiat/Chrysler. Guardian is the

22

longer. So particularly with electronics, the cycle time

world's largest auto glass supplier. I can go on, but

23

for electronics is much, much faster than the useful life

23

it's truly a who's who of the global supply base.

of a car. Think about how many vehicles are on the road

24

And that's really the story of Elio Motors is

with -- today with cassette players and CD players that

1

designed is through a series of what we call supplier

in your dash. If that weren't integrated in so that when

summits. So we get all these folks together for three

3

the next big technology comes out you can pull that off

3

days, work on the vehicle as a group, break apart, come

4

and add the new thing your vehicle stays relevant for

4

back together, and do it again.

5

much, much longer.

We acquired this site out of the GM bankruptcy.

6

So I think although there's not a huge risk,

6

It's a 4 million square foot building on 500 acres of

we're not going outside the lines too far. This is going

land. To put that number into perspective, the Empire

So it's an enormous site. And GM left all the equipment

behind. We believe or estimate that the -- it reduces

11

our total startup cost by about $400 million or cuts our

So we have more service centers than Volkswagen day one,

startup costs in half. We get out of about $300 million

which is a big win for a startup.

So we have developed our own engine in

this is a very complex, one off organism, and it takes a

5

And I believe that the direct impact of Elio is

MR. YADLEY: We're speechless. Thank you very
much.
MR. ELIO: Oh, there you go.
MR. WALSH: Yes, we are. What's your market
cap?

6

significant, but I believe the indirect impact of Elio is

6

MR. ELIO: About 500 million.

7

even more significant. Just like Roger Bannister didn't

7

MR. WALSH: What was it at issue?

8

get the memo that the human body couldn't run a mile in

8

9

under four minutes, so he went ahead and did it and

9

a share and there was 25 million shares outstanding, so

MR. ELIO: 300. So if we -- the Reg A+ was $12

10

within 90 days I think three or four people did it and

10

it was $300 million pre-money valuation and then 317

11

within two years like 20 people did it. The same thing

11

post.

12

here. We didn't get the memo that you can't build a high

12

13

quality, high mileage, low cost vehicle in this country

13

14

with substantially all North American parts, so we're

14

15

going to go ahead and do it. And when we succeed this is

15

16

a high profile sexy project. Other entrepreneurs will

16

17

follow in our footsteps and make things in America.

17

Patriotic or green, it's both. So after our

MR. WALSH: Thank you.
MR. REARDON: Patrick Reardon here. Did you
have any selling stockholders?
MR. ELIO: I'm sorry, what was that?
MR. REARDON: Did you have any selling
stockholders in your Reg A offering?
MR. ELIO: Selling stockholders?

19

nominal business case volume was 250,000 units. So we're

19

20

fast tightening the line to do 250,000 units on two

20

stockholders, insiders, sell any shares in the Reg A

MR. REARDON: Yes, did any of your existing

21

shifts, five days. We can overrun that obviously. And

21

offering?

22

so after five years of sales we can reduce total U.S. gas

22

MR. ELIO: No, no. We didn't have that

23

consumption by nearly half a percent. That's a

23

facility. I didn't realize the possibility. But, no,

24

meaningful number.

24

that didn't happen.

25

Whether your biggest concern is greenhouse gases

25

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: I've got -- I've got one

and global warming or a trade deficit due to foreign oil,

1

2

the answers are the same, use less oil. And Elio can do

MR. ELIO: But our Reg A+ experience, 64

that better than any other project that I'm aware of.

percent of our Reg A+ shareholders and 68 percent of the

4

dollar value came from people who already have a

immediately leap off the page is if you're struggling in

reservation on the vehicle. So, you know, it looks like

6

this country your biggest issue is mobility. Harvard

an overnight success but a lot of it had to do with, you

economists recently came out with a study that said the

number one predictor on whether you get out of poverty or

9

not is mobility. It correlates better than test scores

And then the last piece that doesn't

question for you.

10

in your community, in your grade schools, the number of

10

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Could you kind of let us know

11

two parent households or crime rates in your community.

11

your thinking in choosing to go the Reg A route?

12

The number one correlator is mobility.

12

MR. ELIO: Well, you know, again I really

13

enjoyed hearing the discussion before my presentation.

13

New Jersey had a study that said some huge

14

percentage of their chronologically unemployed have been

14

Access to capital has been the single most difficult part

15

forced to turn down jobs because they had no way to get

15

of the Elio project. You would think designing a $6,800,

16

to the job, and at $6,800 and 84 miles per gallon people

16

84 miles per gallon car built in this country would be

17

can afford to get to their job. This product really

17

the hard part of the project and it turns out no, finding

18

matters at the end of the day.

18

the money to build it has been the hard part, right.

19

And we were stuck with the institutions before Reg
A+, and as soon as I found out about it, because we had

19

So on financing, we've raised $100 million to

20

date if you allow me to round slightly. $17 million of

20

21

that came from Reg A+, and as I've said $24 million came

21

such good luck with the rewards crowd funding, I thought

22

from rewards crowd funding. We're trading on the OTCQX

22

Reg A+ was a natural fit. And at the time I didn't

23

as I mentioned earlier.

23

understand it. Since then I've read the book "The

25

experience. And if you're not familiar with it the book

Page 88

studies the disc drive industry and then uses what it

1

2

learned there across other industries and proves that it

2

3

seems to fit.

3

question was just kind of give us some insight as to your

4

thinking and choosing to go the Reg A route. And I guess

4

And what -- what happened on the disc drive

track of the question in my answer I think.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Well, I think you did. The

5

industry was in the 60's there were 14 inch disc drives

5

a follow on question might be follow on offerings and

6

and they were for mainframes. And the -- somebody came

6

what are you thinking about, what are your future capital

7

up with an 8 inch disc drive and it was more expensive

7

needs that you're projecting, and then how do you plan on

8

per megabyte, but it was overall cheaper. And what

8

addressing that?

9

characterizes a disruptive technology is a low price

9

MR. ELIO: So this is the -- I'm learning to be

10

point, carryover technology, and an undefined market,

10

a CEO of a public company. I don't know how much of that

11

which describes Elio to a T.

11

I can answer now because if it's not publicly disclosed I

12

can't talk about it. That's been the biggest change for

12

And so the 14 inch disc drive companies were well

13

managed companies, and so they listened to their

13

me because normally I'm a lay all the cards on the table

14

customers and they invested, improving their product in

14

down kind of guy.

15

high margin demonstrable markets and didn't worry about

15

16

these 8 inch disc drives who were aimed at mini

16

has better counsel than -- very smart answer I think,

17

computers, and who knew how big mini computers would ever

17

Paul. You might want to stop there.

18

get anyway.

18

MR. ELIO: Okay, thank you.

MR. GOMEZ: Stephen -- Steve, sounds like Paul

19

These disc drive guys got so good they put all

19

MR. GOMEZ: Yeah.

20

the 14 inch guys out of business. Now they were the

20

MR. WALSH: Can I -- you raised -- if I saw the

21

incumbents. Somebody came up with a 5-1/4 inch drive

21

math right you raised almost 16 million in the round and

22

aimed at a PC. And the same thing, you know, undefined

22

you've raised 99 million or almost 100 million total.

23

market, low price point. The well managed 8 inch drive

23

What made you chose the size of the Reg A+ round that you

24

company listened their customers, plowed money into

24

ended up executing?

25

making their drives better, faster, et cetera, went after

25

MR. ELIO: So we had targeted 25 million. We

Page 87

Page 89

1

the high margin, well defined markets, and those

1

did a test the waters campaign. We got $46 million in

2

previously disruptive companies, their incumbents got put

2

indications of interest. $6 million of that came from 12

3

out of business by the 5-1/4" guys. It happened again at

3

people who had reserved 500,000 shares. None of them

4

3-1/4 with the laptop and then again at 2.2

4

purchased even a share, so I'm going to write those off

5

as not serous. So we had $40 million of actual
indications of interest to raise 25.

So what seems to happen is big companies are

5
6

really good at sustaining technology but horrible at

6

7

disruptive technology. And my experience is big funds

7

8

and VCs are the same. They're looking for the high

8

the SEC right before Thanksgiving, which is not a great

9

margin, well-defined market. They're horrible at

9

time to raise money, but that's okay because we had

Our timing was horrible. We got qualified by

10

identifying disruptive technologies, but the public is

10

January. And then in January the markets collapsed and

11

not.

11

the first time in six years that nobody did an IPO,

12

right, it was the first time in six years.

12

And that was the key is being able to go to the

13

public, do the Reg A+ offering. And on the strength of

13

So I think that had our timing been a little

14

that offering we were able to pick up our E series of

14

different we would have gotten through a little earlier,

15

vehicles. We're in the process of building 23 prototypes

15

we would have raised the full 25. But it was enough to,

16

to do validation on before we kick off the hard tools.

16

you know, get the E1a series going and get us off the

17

We unveiled E1a a couple of weeks ago, and I opened that

17

dime. Does that answer your question?

18

event and said this is an event brought to you by Reg A+.

18

MR. WALSH: It does, thank you.

19

So that was the key to getting us off the dime and

19

MR. YADLEY: Another -- thank you very much,

20

now that we have gone through the process and we're a

20

Paul. I'm a lawyer in Florida, and so the same type of

21

publicly traded company it's a whole new world.

21

question. In terms of trying to decide how to raise the

22

Institutions that didn't want to talk to us and wouldn't

22

capital you didn't use commissioned salespeople. Had you

23

return our phone calls are calling us. So this has been

23

thought about instead of doing Reg A+, a private

24

a critical step for us.

24

placement using general solicitation, what lawyers called

25

a 506(c), had you thought about that as an alternative

25

Did I answer your question? I kind of lost

23 (Pages 86 to 89)


Page 90

Page 92

1

and did you not do that because you planned on trying to

1

2

be publicly traded and therefore this was easier?

2

3

MR. ELIO: Well, there's two parts to that

3

You said that 68 percent of the funders actually were

4

answer. So one is the underwriting piece that I would

4

pre-reservation holders also?

5

like to talk to and the other one is 506(c). We actually

5

6

did do a 506(c) before Reg A+ was available. We raised

6

7

$5 million in that effort.

7

8
9

I think the problem with 506(c), it's better to
be able to publicly disclose that you're trying to raise

MR. YADLEY: Yes, thank you very much.
MS. YAMANAKA: I would like to confirm a stat.

MR. ELIO: No, 64 percent by number, 68 percent
by dollar value.
MR. NELSON: Can you talk about what you -­

8

MR. ELIO: And that's the other thing. And

9

that's -- well, on that point, that's another thing that

10

money, but it's still a very cumbersome process, right.

10

Reg A+ did for the public is I would go to Elio events

11

One, you constrain yourself to 7 percent of the

11

and people would say, "Hey, I would love to invest in

12

population and that 7 percent is over marketed to because

12

Elio."

13

everybody is constrained to that 7 percent of the

13

And I would say, "Are you accredited?"

14

population. And two, because of the check sizes it's one

14

"No."

15

off meetings, right. They have to meet with management

15

"Well, you can't."

16

in order to do a deal.

16

17

And so it's a very slow cumbersome process.

So these people who identified this is a good

17

company and I want to be a part of it and they were

18

It's doable, but it's very difficult. And the nice thing

18

precluded and now when -- and when we did our 506(c) we

19

about Reg A+ is the pool is much bigger, people can

19

marketed to our reservations. So the 6,400 people who

20

invest much less, and you can do -- you know, multiply

20

did Reg A+, assumably the majority were non-accredited,

21

your marketing efforts by using social media and the

21

wanted to be part of Elio, but couldn't and then were

22

Internet, et cetera.

22

allowed to. So -- and if we make it, you know, that will

23

be a great story.

23

On using brokers, I wanted to use brokers in

24

addition to the portals. So we used startengine.com.

24

25

That was a very good experience. But I wanted to also

25

MS. YAMANAKA: So you marketed to 64 -- or you
got 6,400 out of the 54,000 reservations that you have?

Page 91

Page 93

1

have brokers because when you're investing your money

1

2

there's a lot of people who want to talk to somebody.

2

3

They don't want to just click the button, right.

3

MR. ELIO: Correct. At the time it was less,
it was probably 40 something thousand, but yes.
MS. YAMANAKA: Thank you.

4

And we looked into that and the brokers that we

4

5

were talking to said it was going to take an extra 90 to

5

process, how many VCs, angels, different vehicles,

6

120 days for them to do their due diligence, get through

6

methods of trying to raise capital you went through

7

FINRA in order to be able to do it with us. And I was in

7

before settling on Reg A+?

8

a hurry. You know, I needed to keep this company going.

8

9

And so although I wanted to do it that way we chose not

9

10
11

to because it was time prohibitive.
So we self-underwrote, and honestly self-

MR. NELSON: Can you talk about your pitch

MR. ELIO: Yeah. So, you know, we talked to a
lot of different institutions. We're a company that

10

doesn't -- so VCs are comfortable with pre-revenue

11

startups but they want to spend $3 million and create
Facebook, and when you show them a 3 or $400 million
budget their heads pop off.

12

underwriting other than not having live people to talk to

12

13

worked pretty well. I think the one mistake that we made

13

14

if I had it to do over again is we did not get analyst's

14

15

coverage engaged until after we were on the QX. So I

15

comfortable with that check but when you say you're pre-

16

don't know if it was three, four weeks ago Zacks finally

16

revenue and will be for another year their heads pop off.

17

came out with an analyst's report.

17

And both of them like to specialize because their

18

concentration of wealth they get really good at a sector.
Hey, we invest in biotech, we invest in technology.

18

I think there needs to be a cottage industry of

You go to private equity guys, they're

analysts who follow Reg A+ deals. I think the investor

19

20

needs that feedback from professional advisors looking at

20

And so we needed to convince these big

21

companies and doing due diligence and saying I think this

21

institutions to do two things they were uncomfortable

22

one is good, I don't think that one is good. So

22

with. One sector, because there's not enough new vehicle

23

hopefully more and more companies will start looking at

23

startups for anybody to specialize in it and then

24

Reg A+ and following them. Did that answer your

24

depending on whether it was a VC or a private equity we

25

question?

25

had to overcome that other one. And then thirdly was the

24 (Pages 90 to 93)


Page 94
1

whole innovator's dilemma issue that I just spoke about.

2

Page 96
1

the water campaign and startengine.com wanted to put a

2

counter up on, you know, how many people have reserved

3

And it's kind of funny, the last institution I

3

and what the dollar amount was. And so internally our

4

pitched like two weeks before we went live on Reg A+,

4

legal team debated whether it was allowed or not for four

5

about halfway through a very similar presentation to what

5

or five days, and finally we said, well, let's ask the

6

you saw the guy interrupted me and said why would I

6

SEC. We called up the SEC, asked the question. They got

7

invest in you before you build the vehicle?

7

back to us with an answer within days.

8

And I thought to myself, you know, the point of

8

9

the equity markets have gotten lost. You know, in the

9

So within -- and we were told yes it was okay,
and so we put the counter up. And that -- that process

10

1700's where people -- when people were trading

10

happened over and over and over. The SEC encouraged us

11

securities underneath a tree on the corner of Broad and

11

to ask questions. There was a lot of things where it

12

Wall the equity market was a place for companies to raise

12

wasn't clear what we could and should do with a given

13

capital to either start or expand, not a place for VCs

13

situation and it was a very quick and easy feedback loop

14

and private equity firms to cash out their winnings. And

14

of question and answer to get through the process. So -­

15

that kind of has gotten lost with this concentration of

15

16

capital, and I think Reg A+ has a chance to bring it back

16

17

to its roots, where equity is about a place for companies

17

18

to find capital to start and to expand.

18

19
20

MR. NELSON: How many of those conversations
did you have roughly? Did you keep track?
MR. ELIO: I did not keep track. From 2009 to

19

MR. WALSH: Have you personally invested in any
other Reg A companies?
MR. ELIO: No, I'm pretty much all in in Elio
Motors at the moment, so the answer is no.
MS. YAMANAKA: Paul, this is Laurie Yamanaka.

20

I had a question. When you were going through this and

21

you said the hardest thing to do was to find capital,

22

today it had to be hundreds. But in fairness when the

22

when you were starting this process and even all during

23

Dow is at 7,000 it didn't matter what you were pitching

23

the process did you have a lot of professional people who

24

the answer was no, right. So there's a couple of years

24

were coming to you and saying try this, try this, try

25

there where there was a lot of meetings with those types

25

this, and they weren't working or was it just people

21

Page 95

Page 97

1

of institutions that had -- you know, it didn't matter

1

2

what you were pitching so -­

2

What kind of advice -- because I'm presuming you didn't

3

all have -- you didn't do it out of your head.

3

MS. MOTT: Paul, this is Catherine Mott. I

going, well, maybe you could try this but we don't know?

4

just want to commend you on an excellent I guess job

4

MR. ELIO: Right. So it was a combination of

5

raising capital. You went along the path of least

5

both. You know, I just kept trying to figure it out. So

6

resistance in all of these situations and found capital

6

at a couple of different points we engaged different

7

and found successful ways to fund the growth of your

7

firms to go out to the private equity hedge funds and VC

8

company.

8

markets. They would say, hey, we can get this done.

9

We're going to get you a ton of meetings, we're going to

9

And you correctly characterize the VC industry.

10

I'm in that industry, so I know exactly what you're

10

11

talking about. There is a tendency to follow this, you

11

12

know, focus on what you know and understand and also

12

13

focus on the trends. And so when something comes along

13

would spend, depending on the situation because I think

14

that is not trendy and there's, you know, they're risk

14

there was three different ones that we used over the

15

adverse like -- you know, because they're managing other

15

course of the years, they would spend anywhere from two

16

people's money, the key thing that you've done is you've

16

to five months doing due diligence, putting together this

17

found people who are willing to risk their own money and

17

beautiful package to send out and an enormous amount of

18

you went after, you know, potential customers.

18

work. And they would send it out and we would get two

19

meetings.

19

And I think that's brilliant and I just want to

do a road show, because this is a compelling company.
MS. YAMANAKA: Yeah.
MR. ELIO: Right. And they're excited and they

20

commend you on what you've done. I have no question. I

20

21

just wanted to say congratulations.

21

and only get two meetings out of it. Because they were

So we would get tied up for six or nine months

22

MR. ELIO: Oh, thank you. And back at you.

22

shocked too. And I think that dynamic, it was the three

23

So the Reg A+ process was very -- it was a

23

things that we talked about, the innovator's dilemma, the

24

great experience for us. The SEC was incredibly

24

concentration of capital and, you know, that nobody

25

cooperative, and as an example we went live on our test

25

specialized in this.

25 (Pages 94 to 97)


Page 98

Page 100

1

And I think it shocked even the professionals how

1

lost the audio. Can you still hear me?

2

difficult it was to get somebody to write a check for

2

MR. GUTIERREZ: Yes.

3

Elio Motors because we just don't fit.

3

MR. ELIO: Okay. So when we started this is
what the map looked like. Yellow and red are bad, green

4

MS. YAMANAKA: Thank you.

4

5

MR. WALSH: One last question. You say you

5

is good on requiring a helmet to drive an Elio, right.

6

don't fit and you're describing that situation. What

6

Because we are technically a motorcycle. And so what

7

percentage of the time was Tesla brought up as either a

7

we've done is go state by state and create a new category

8

positive or negative example either by you or the person

8

called an auto cycle. An auto cycle is an enclosed three

9

listening to you as an example of what you were trying to

9

wheel vehicle with at least three air bags, seat belts

10

for every occupant position, et cetera, and if you're an

11

MR. ELIO: It doesn't get brought up much but

11

auto cycle you don't need a motorcycle license or a

12

it definitely helps us. You know, I cheer Tesla every

12

helmet.

13

single day because if you take Tesla out of the question,

13

14

out of the equation, the last American vehicle company

14

five states left where if you're under 21 or under 18

15

started and still standing is Walter Chrysler in 1928.

15

that you need a helmet, and there's only one state that

16

So it's been, you know, 90 years since somebody has done

16

over 21 that you still need a helmet and that's West

17

this successfully and that doesn't help the story either.

17

Virginia. The problem there is their legislature only

18

But Tesla having done it and have a $30 billion market

18

works 45 days a year and we missed it and so we've got to

19

cap certainly helps us, so I continue to applaud them.

19

wait for a year.

20

MR. GUTIERREZ: Hey, Paul. I have a quick

20

And then on the licensing the same story.

10

accomplish?

This is the map as of June 27th. So there's

21

question So again I want to echo the congratulations

21

Yellow is bad, green is good. This is where we're at.

22

earlier. I think this is a phenomenal company and the

22

So we're about a year from production, so I suspect by

23

fact that you went through the Reg A process makes it

23

the time we hit production our intent is to have both

24

even more exciting, certainly for us as a real shining

24

maps completely green.

25

example of how this process can be successful.

25

MR GUTIERREZ: Great, thank you.

Page 99
I had a question about that. Did going through

1

Page 101
1

MS. YAMANAKA: Paul, back to a non-sexy

2

that process, and the notoriety, and the marketing of

2

question here. Were you able to track the total costs of

3

going through that with investors help you with your

3

going through the Reg A process versus the anticipated

4

suppliers and the other partners of the company? Was

4

costs for other avenues and how did it line up and did it

5

there -- was there an accretive sort of value that you

5

fall into what your expectations were? I'm talking all

6

saw because of going through the process?

6

in costs.

7

MR. ELIO: Kind of but not really. So most of

7

8

the supply base was already highly engaged before Reg A+,

8

number off the top of my head and I don't. I'm kind of

MR. ELIO: Yes. You know, I should know that

9

but what it did is keep them engaged, right. So you got

9

embarrassed that I didn't prep myself on that one.

10

to keep all the stakeholders engaged. And like I said,

10

MS. YAMANAKA: That's okay.

11

the biggest issue is attracting the capital, and so as

11

MR. ELIO: I apologize. That's something I

12

they saw this being successful their commitment certainly

12

should know. It was cheap relatively to other options,

13

deepened because now they believe that we can market it,

13

you know, to a traditional IPO with a major bank. It was

14

right.

14

certainly doable and rather inexpensive.

15

And that was always the hardest part to

15

MS. YAMANAKA: So going into the process it was

believe. Like they know that we can pull off the stats.

16

obviously less expensive and actually going through the

17

It's like can you find the money to build the car, and

17

process itself it came in under -- within expectations?

18

certainly Reg A+ helped that belief and depend their

18

Even though you didn't hit your 25 million target 17 was

19

commitments.

19

totally fine?

16

20

MR. GUTIERREZ: And another quick question.

20

MR. ELIO: Right, right. So, you know, we had

21

Just as someone who is now very interested in buying one

21

a minimum of 12.6 and a target of 25. And, you know,

22

of these, do I need to have a motorcycle license in order

22

there was different plans on how to run the business

23

to drive or can I use -- and I live in California, so I'm

23

depending on different funding levels. And the 17.6 like

24

assuming it's state specific?

24

I said, or the 17 was certainly enough. I mean, it got

25

us -- it got this whole trading moving and now being

25

MR. ELIO: So I have a slide for that. Oh, I

26 (Pages 98 to 101)


Page 102

Page 104

1

publicly traded there was just a lot more tools in our

1

you have interest credit cards pay those off, go invest

2

tool kit in order to raise capital.

2

in Reg A+. If you don't have three to nine months of

3

savings of salary ins savings, save money, go invest in
Reg A+. You know, and if you do have all these criteria

And it's a different world. You know, I've

3
4

said several times I feel like Reg A+ put us over the

4

5

hump. Now you don't actually get a memo or an email to

5

met invest in five to ten like -- just mirroring the

6

say you're officially over a hump. It's just a sense

6

discussion you had.

7

that we're over the hump. But I feel like it did that.

7

So we put that on both the portal startengine

8

and our website to try to -- you know, people are taking

9

a risk when they buy Elio shares, they are. You know,

MS. YAMANAKA: Well, they're calling you,

8
9

right, that's the hump. So that's good.

10

until we're in production we're not, right. But letting

11

MR. ELIO: Yes. Thank you.

11

people go in eyes wide open I think that's really the

12

CO-CHAIR HANKS: Time for one last question.

12

key.

13

MR. HAUPTMAN: Yeah, Mr. Elio, fantastic

13

14

company. Did you encounter people who heard about this,

14

led off with -- you could have led off with that. That's

15

wanted in, but have never heard of the accredited

15

great. That's something -- you got so many hits on that I

16

investor rule, don't know whether they themselves are or

16

bet, right, as far as people who are checking that out

17

not?

17

and actually checking out the video. It's exactly the

18

kind of marketing you need.

10

18

Congratulations.

MR. ELIO: Yes, I would suspect that the

MS. YAMANAKA: That is great. You could have

19

majority of the people who invested in our Reg A+

19

MR. ELIO: Yeah.

20

offering had never heard of the accredited investor rule

20

MS. YAMANAKA: Thank you.

21

until they read the stuff on startengine.com.

21

22

MR. ELIO: Yeah. So if you want I'm sure we

MR. HAUPTMAN: Okay. If may follow up.

22

can share it with you. I'm sure Motley Fool wouldn't be

MR. ELIO: And the reason I say that is that

23

sad if you had their name somewhere in sharing that

24

even before this was available and reservation holders

24

information.

25

were asking can I invest in your company and I would have

25

23

MS. YAMANAKA: We'll see what we can do, right.

Page 103

Page 105

1

that discussion with them. They were unaware of that,

1

2

right. I'm extrapolating.

2

3

MR. HAUPTMAN: Do you find the accredited rule

3

I'm sure -­
MR. REARDON: One question. You say you're a
car person. What's the 0 to 60 time?

4

to be too stringent or not stringent enough? Do you have

4

5

a view on that?

5

seconds. I don't know that we're going to achieve that

MR. ELIO: Yeah, you know, I -- it's a fine

MR. ELIO: We've been targeting under ten

6

from our current stats. The target has been under 10

7

line to walk. I get you want to protect the little guy

7

seconds.

8

who doesn't know what he's doing, but by the same token

8

9

you preclude him from investing in Uber, and Facebook,

9

6

MR. REARDON: That's not bad for that little
engine.

10

and Elio and, you know, things that can have huge swings.

10

11

And so how do you determine if they really know enough

11

then I think we can get it under five. So there's no

12

that they're taking the risk eyes wide open, right. It's

12

turbo plan, but in the design that I have used doing the

13

not guaranteeing that they're going to win, that they're

13

cylinder wall thicknesses and everything will accept the

14

not going to lose money, but that they understand the

14

stress, the extra stress that would be from a turbo. The

15

risk they're undertaking.

15

inner cooler packaging is protected for and Comau when

16

they designed the engine assembly line left a hole so we

16

And I like some of the discussion. I think the

MR. ELIO: No, and you can turbo charge it and

17

test, although it can be circumvented, was a good idea.

17

could put a turbo in. So although no work has been done

18

Because even if you circumvent it, if you have to

18

on a turbo, because you got to crawl before you walk, we

19

memorize all those answers you know enough to know that

19

have certainly protected for it. And I think that would

20

you're -- the risk that you're taking.

20

be a really fun product.

21

And one of the things we did is we reached out

21

22

to Motley Fool and we asked them to create a video on or

22

23

a paper on how to invest in Reg A+ deals to -- specific

23

24

to Elio. And we put that on startengine.com and on our

24

25

website. And they went through and they say, look, if

25

MR. REARDON: That would be.
CO-CHAIR HANKS: Do we have any more questions
in the room? Well, I don't think so.
Paul, thank you very much for doing this, and I
am so glad that the video held up. I was worried about

27 (Pages 102 to 105)


Page 106

Page 108
What I have observed not only here but my sense

1

that one. So thank you very much for presenting and good

1

2

luck.

2

of, it let's put it this way, and also in very successful

3

crowd funding campaigns is they manage to reach the

4

thanks for accommodating the virtual appearance. I do

4

audience that would be passionate about that product or

5

appreciate it.

5

service and capture them as investors. So they found
their community so to speak.

MR. ELIO: And thank you for having me and

3

6

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay.

6

7

CO-CHAIR HANKS: Do we have any questions on,

7

So he was able to tap into that community,

8

which I think would be the question for those who are

9

interested in this is, and I think we already talked

8

general questions on that?
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: I guess we can -- we're going

9
10

to pick this up after lunch, right?
CO-CHAIR HANKS: Yeah. We've got Reg A after

11
12
13

lunch.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: So unless anyone wants to

10

about it is outreach, you know, how do you -- how do you

11

inform the public that there's another way to support

12

something. And, you know, social media, I mean I'm sure

13

that we've seen communities come together to invest

14

just kind of toss in a comment or two and then we're

14

because there's a social influencer or influencers,

15

going to pick up the Reg A conversation after lunch so -­

15

things like that that are happening.

16

Greg, you just seem itching to -­

16

17

MR. YADLEY: No, I've been theoretically

17

and intrigued on how he was able to build a company,

So, you know, I'm definitely excited about this

18

feeling positive about Reg A+, and as I mentioned last

18

tapping into the community. And it's a capital intensive

19

time our firm did one, got it qualified, ended up not

19

business. It's not one of those that it's a small, you

20

having enough investor interest, spent a lot of money but

20

know, it's a -- it's a cool, one off, you know Sphero,

21

felt the SEC and the states were very cooperative. Now

21

you know what I mean, you know, a little toy. This is a

22

we had a baseline of information, raised money privately,

22

big -- this is a big deal and I think it's going to have

23

and may try something else again in another year.

23

implications on the economy. I mean, you could see how

24

it ripples through various suppliers. I mean, this is -­

25

so that's going to impact, you know, employment. I mean,

24
25

And I think what I heard Mr. Elio say in answer
to his question about why Reg A+ and 506(c), those

Page 107

Page 109

1

answers made a lot of sense. I mean he's really

1

there's just a lot to be said about it. I'm just excited

2

exponentially using his own time and the market out there

2

about it.

3

and cutting through a lot of the I guess rigmarole, and

3

4

the one-on-ones, but he clearly also wanted to be public.

4

bit about liquidity and how realistic additional capital

5

And that's always been sort of a dilemma with me because

5

raises are.

6

I think IPOs are a great idea if that's your plan, and if

6

7

that's your plan why would you do a Reg A+.

7

just playing devil's advocate for a moment here, a lot of

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: And I still worry a little

CO-CHAIR HANKS: On the liquidity issue, I mean

8

So he's an example of somebody that sort of

8

the guys who are buying the car they're not selling those

9

said I could do it quicker within the anticipated budget.

9

shares. I mean, they love that company, they want to

10

His comment about the analysts is something that we

10

hold. They're buy and hold investors, they're not

11

talked about really in the first iteration of this

11

looking for a flip.

12

committee as a reason why the IPOs aren't there, so

12

13

hopefully more will come.

13

this affinity play. I've seen a couple of -- there's a

14

crowd funding company out there that is addressing type

15

I'm becoming more and more intrigued. It's -- I think it

15

one diabetes in children. The people who are investing

16

was -- I think it was a great example.

16

in that really don't care about liquidity. They care
about this thing happening and that company succeeding.

14

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: I have a similar bias, but

And I think a lot of it's the same in a lot of

17

MS. MOTT: So when I think about this in a big

17

18

picture, so I'm like you, Greg, I want to say something.

18

19

When I think about the big picture is he was spot on

19

mean, we're going to talk about liquidity this afternoon,

20

about the industry, the tendency for, you know, the VCs

20

but let's not say that liquidity is driving the

21

to, you know, to be trend oriented. And of course, you

21

investors. If you're -- if liquidity is a precondition

22

know, to some extent, you know, you could say they're

22

to an investment in Reg A then I think that might not be

23

managing other people's money so there's some -- you

23

the ideal investor for that company because this is a

24

know, they have to be to that extent. So he found

24

kind of buy and hold affinity play.

25

another avenue.

25

So I think to a certain extent let's not -- I

So that's my take on the affinity, on the

28 (Pages 106 to 109)


Page 110

Page 112

1

liquidity issue, and this may be somewhere where we just

1

is -- we do need to focus on what the channels for

2

totally disagree.

2

liquidity are.

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: No, I think if you have -- if

3

3

This is why we're pleased to have Dan Zinn from
OTC Markets here to discuss some of these issues. The

4

it really is a buy an hold affinity play then of course

4

5

it works. If you're debating whether you should go this

7

things you think about are attracting the kind of

information that the companies make available. They also

8

investors who are concerned about liquidity and at the

same time they're concerned about as you know, you know,

MR. ZINN: Thank you so much for having me. I

I certainly don't want to overpromise and under

CO-CHAIR HANKS: There's just one thing I

her awake from beginning to end, so I think we may be in

23

wanted to mention before we wind up and I just wanted to

23

for a treat.

24

remind everybody, especially everyone watching out there

24

25

in Internet land, Regulation A changed certain exemptions

25

I like Paul Elio could talk about this sort of
thing for hours and hours, but in the interest of time

under 33 Act. Let's not forget that the broker/dealer

1

I'm going to focus on what I think are a few key points

2

registration rules have not changed and Section 17(b),

2

to note, and then very much looking forward to all of

3

which addresses stock touts for want of a better word,

3

your questions.

4

those things have changed. So make sure you talk to your

lawyers before doing any of this stuff.

MR. YADLEY: Still working on it.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay. Let's break for lunch,

reconvene at 1:30.
(Whereupon, at 11:52 a.m., a luncheon recess
was taken.)
AFTERNOON SESSION
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay. Can I ask everyone to
take their seats. I would like to get started.
For this afternoon as you know we're going to

I'm going start with some background on OTC
Markets. I think Sara set the stage for me nicely there.

6

I want to talk more specifically about, you know, what

7

we do and how that relates to Reg A, and why I'm the one

8

who is here talking to you about secondary trading for

9

Reg A securities ad how we interplay with that.

10

I want to talk a little bit more broadly about

11

issues generally facing Reg A issuers. You get the

12

impression from Paul and all of the entrepreneurs that

13

I've spoken to that the focus, as it should be, is on the

14

offering, is on getting capital in the door. People want

15

to understand how they're going to fund their company and

16

continue on with our Reg A discussion, and I'm going to

16

take that to the next level. But with Reg A's there's

17

hand it back to Sara.

17

this entirely new process for a lot of these companies

18

and entrepreneurs of developing a secondary market and

18

CO-CHAIR HANKS: Well, thanks. As you probably

19

saw towards the end of this morning's session the issue

19

interacting with investors. And there are a lot of steps

20

of liquidity is one that interests this committee a great

20

in that process that need to be considered, and improving

21

deal and the issue of liquidity and Regulation A is not

21

the way that works will I think lead to a little bit more

22

necessarily sort of cut and dried.

22

success in terms of Reg A offerings going forward.

23

We've always focused on the idea of liquidity

23

I will touch on some of my company's

24

in general. People aren't going to put money into a deal

24

initiatives. Sara and Sebastian talked a little bit about

25

if they can't see some way of getting out of it. And it

25

our petition for rulemaking as it relates to Reg A, so

29 (Pages 110 to 113)


Page 114

Page 116

1

I'll touch on that a little bit and of course take any

1

companies that are ready to really engage with investors

2

questions that you all have.

2

and build a much larger potential market for their

3

securities.

3

And I will close briefly with a discussion of

4

the type of market that makes sense for a Reg A company

4

5

or other similarly situated companies, kind of venture

5

been to allow issuers to leverage whatever other

6

stage companies, which has been a big topic of

6

disclosure requirements they might have and best use that

7

conversation both at the SEC and on Capitol Hill.

7

in an efficient manner to interact with investors to meet

8

current requirements. So OTCQX companies can certainly

9

be SEC reporting and current, current in their reporting

8
9

So who are we? OTC Markets as Sara mentioned
operates an SEC registered alternative trading system

The way we've conceived of OTCQX all along has

10

known as OTC Link that brings together about 110 FINRA

10

to a banking regulator, or an insurance regulator, or to

11

member broker/dealer subscribers that use our system to

11

their home country to the extent it's a foreign company.

12

publicly quote and message one another for the purposes

12

We've also built rules to accommodate Reg A

13

of ultimately trading a group of about 10,000 over-the­

13

issuers. So you take the tier two ongoing disclosure

14

counter securities. So that's for the most part

14

that a company is required to provide and add a few extra

15

securities that are not otherwise traded on a listed

15

components that bring that disclosure up to the standard

16

exchange, like the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ.

16

of the remaining OTCQX companies that we have, things

17

Sara mentioned our market structure. We've

17

like quarterly reporting and the annual audit being done

18

separated companies into three markets based largely on

18

by a PCAOB registered auditors, and that company can

19

the disclosure aspect of their interaction with

19

qualify with the ongoing requirements for OTCQX. We did

20

investors, so the timelines and sufficiency. At the top

20

this fairly far in advance of OT -- excuse me of Reg A

21

levels there are some quantitative or qualitative

21

becoming effective with the idea that we wanted companies

22

qualifications as well. Just for context, OTCQX out of

22

to start to understand what their trading market might

23

the 10,000 securities has about 450 or so. OTCQB, which

23

look like.

24

is the next market down, it's what we consider really our

24

You can see on the slide some of the key

25

venture market, has a slightly different set of

25

qualifications, and I'm happy to talk about this more if

Page 115

Page 117

1

quantitative requirements that are maybe more in line

1

there's interest. Some of the things I'll highlight are

2

with what we think of as a venture company starting out,

2

just no penny stocks, and we use penny stocks as that's

3

getting their feet wet in public trading, using this as a

3

defined under the Securities Act, no shell or blank check

4

springboard to build and grow a public market. So there

4

companies. OTCQX really is for operating companies.

5

are about 900 securities on the OTCQB market.

5

The other statistic that I will note from the

6

slide is the $58 million median market cap of OTCQX

6

The remaining securities trade on pink, which

7

I'm not going to focus on all that much for purposes of

7

securities. As you look at other venture markets around

8

our discussion, but it exists as a broker quoted market.

8

the world, the smaller company markets, and I'll touch on

9

So our subscribers have -- customers have potentially

9

this towards the end, something like the TSX Venture in

10

proprietary interest in quoting and trading these

10

Canada has a 5 or $10 million median market cap. So it's

11

securities. They have best execution obligations. You

11

a different kind for security.

12

know, they have -- they have to provide good, efficient

12

13

service to their customers in terms of trading these

13

14

securities.

You see a little bit more of a one-to-one
correlation with OTCQB, which I'll describe in a moment.

14

But I just want to make sure everyone has the

15

A lot of them are quoted on our pink market.

15

appropriate kind of picture of what an OTCQX company is.

16

We will indicate on pink whether a security or a company

16

17

is publishing current information as it relates to their

17

happens with OTCQX companies. This was an independent

18

company, a listed set of information or no information,

18

study through Oxford Metrica that we commissioned. The

19

which actually appears with a stop sign next to the stock

19

general counsel in me feels obligated to say that there

20

symbol on our website. So we do offer the kind of

20

is no guarantee that anybody will trade in any given way

21

investor background and whatever information is made

21

on OTCQX or otherwise, but in a broad based study it's

22

available is obviously there for investors to review.

22

nice to see that there are benefits that most companies

23

Diving in a little bit more to how this

23

realize from trading on a market that has standards, that

We have of course done some studies on what

24

interacts with OTCQX and Reg A. So OTCQX is for more

24

requires this kind of disclosure, that allows investors

25

established over-the-counter companies. So these are

25

and regulators and other market participants to

30 (Pages 114 to 117)


Page 118

understand the steps a company is taking to establish its

2

requirements. Because, you know, as banks they have

3

Things like narrower bid ask spreads and more

3

their plates full with those kinds of things and they use

4

broker/dealers coming to the market are the result of

our markets as a way to continue to engage investors and

5

education and a comfort level, and that's a common theme

5

show that they're providing current information.

6

that I think is going to help drive Reg A securities and

6

I won't get too deep into the weeds unless

7

make people comfortable with how that process works. If

7

people are interested, in which case I'll have to book a

8

you understand what the marketplace is as a broker, or a

8

hotel room for tonight, about how trading actually works,

9

clearing firm, or an advisor you're going to be much more

9

you know, kind of the behind the scenes market structure.

10

likely to engage in that kind of offering or advise your

10

But I think it's instructive just to note the

11

client to do so.

11

differences between the way our market operates versus

12

what most people are familiar with, a traditional

13

here a $12 million median market cap. So that's much

13

exchange.

14

more in line with some of the other venture markets round

14

15

the world. Here because of the types of companies that

15

described earlier. It is a group of FINRA member

16

really would make up the OTCQB profile we've allowed

16

broker/dealers that post attributable quotes, meaning the

17

companies to take their tier two ongoing disclosure and

17

people on the bid side can see who the people on the

18

just use that as their qualifying disclosure for OTCQB.

18

offer side are. They use our facility to communicate.

19

So there is no additional quarterly filing requirement.

19

They can negotiate trades and ultimately it's the broker,

20

As long as they are following the rules set forth by the

20

it's the end point, not us, that is executing the

21

SEC in relation to Reg A they're permitted to quote on

21

transaction. It really helps facilitate communication

22

OTCQB.

22

between liquidity seekers and liquidity providers.

12

23

I'll touch on OTCQB. Again the thing to note

This is one of my favorite slides. One of the

23

Our market is a network model, so it is what I

The exchanges operate in a central limit order

24

things that we think about in terms of the role that our

1

executed. The broker does not know who is on the other

2

We celebrate when companies what we call graduate from

side of it. For the most part they don't care. When

3

our markets and move to the New York Stock Exchange or

3

you're trading Apple, and Google and Microsoft that is a

4

NASDAQ. We've had over 200 of those events over the past

4

perfectly fine way to trade, probably the best model

5

few years and as much as it is in most cases a good, a

5

that's been developed. You pay a little fee to the

6

strong company leaving our markets to go somewhere else,

6

exchange for the privilege of executing the transaction

7

it inevitably leads to two or three phone calls from

and you're on your way.

8

companies in a similar industry or similar geographic

8

Where companies need a little bit more support,

9

location saying that's a great story. That's my end

9

need the dealer support either with their customer base

10

goal. How does -- how do you do that? Can I work with

10

or the dealer proprietary interest, a dealer market

11

your markets in order to achieve that result?

11

allows for that kind of optionality and has proven -­

12

I'll get into some academic studies towards the end, but

12

And we view that as a key component to what we

13

do, and so we're very proud of the way that that's

13

has proven to be a better model for smaller company

14

developed over time. We cite the similar statistics for

14

trading.

15

the LSE's AIM and the TSX Venture Market, which are much

15

16

lower numbers of graduates.

16

a view of what level two quotes look like just to give

17

you a sense of what I mean by attributable quoting. So

18

OTCQX or OTCQB can't be a home. I think banks, and our

18

you can see the market makers and all of the information

19

constituent group of about 75 community banks on OTCQX

19

related to their quotes there. One of the goals with OTC

20

provide a great example of an industry group that really

20

Link and the way we operate is to give investors a

21

seems to be comfortable finding a home on OTCQX. A lot

21

comparable trading experience as if they were trading an

22

of those companies, those banks were exchange listed,

22

exchange listed security. So being able to go on your E

23

used -- excuse me -- some of the provisions of the JOBS

Act to deregister and trade on our markets in a less

type in a stock symbol, click buy or click sell, have

25

costly, less complex manner so that they can focus on

25

that transaction executed.

17

All of this for our markets is not to say that

minds asks a number of questions that go well outside of

2

in this way, but the investor experience is similar if

2

just what kind of information is publicly available. The

3

not identical. And that's a big driver not only for the

3

way that impacts secondary trading and particularly for

4

companies that currently exist on our market but for how

4

Reg A's is that first of all FINRA is not obligated to

5

we perceive Reg A companies trading in the future.

5

clear a 211 at all. So there's no guarantee that they're

6

going to say, okay, go ahead and quote. They're

6

Now on to some more broad based considerations

7

as it relates to secondary trading for Reg A's. Again

7

certainly not obligated to do it in line with when the

8

this is that next step after the offering that I think a

8

offering closes.

9

lot of businesses have not focused on. Sebastian towards

9

So again thinking about Elio their offering

10

the beginning talked about some of the components

10

closes, they distribute shares to investors, investor has

11

generally of Reg A and, you know, what the SEC changed in

11

a share in his or her hands that they would like to

12

this version of the rule. One of the key things for a

12

trade, there's nobody permitted to quote it. You know,

13

market operator is the free trading aspect of shares once

13

that's a very conceivable result from this.

14

they're in the hands of non-affiliates following the

14

15

offering.

15

potentially other markets that may develop for these

Qualification for our OTCQX or OTCQB markets or

16

But just because there's an SEC rule that

16

kinds of securities is often also at least partially

17

permits for that doesn't mean it automatically happens.

17

based on the bid price, you know, how much -- is this

18

There are number of regulatory steps that have to take

18

going to be a tenth of a penny security or is this going

19

place. The most prominent of those is what's called the

19

to be a $2 or $12 security. And until FINRA clears that

20

FINRA Form 211. So in order for a broker to be able to

20

Form 211 you don't know what the bid price is going to be

21

quote a security, and think about Elio as the prime

21

and you can't necessarily qualify it for a particular

22

example as it is for many of these things, before Elio

22

market.

23

could be quoted and traded on our market FINRA had to

23

24

tell a broker/dealer, okay, we allow you to do that.

24

line in order for this to be a smooth process. With all

25

That's the rule if you're not an exchange listed

25

211's, not just Reg A's, once the form has been approved

security.
The FINRA Form 211 is based off of an SEC rule
called 15c211 that basically requires a broker/dealer to
have in its possession and to verify that it is publicly
available certain information about a company before it
can quote on a system like ours publicly. The way the
FINRA rules operate, it acts on its members, on the
brokers, and it's written as a notice filing. So brokers
would submit this form to FINRA, indicate that they had
the required information, and then wait at least three
days before publicly quoting.
In practice the 211 process is a little bit
more of a merit review. It's almost what you would see
in an S-1 qualification process with the SEC. There are
comments back and forth. Under the SEC version of the
rule one of the things that qualifies as enough
information for quoting to begin is a Reg A offering
statement. So in theory the Form 1A, a Reg A offering
statement, should just be linked to in a broker's filing.
They should say here's where it is, it's publicly
available. We have it as does everybody else. FINRA
could theoretically say, okay, that sounds great,
commence quoting.
That's not at all how it works. FINRA, you
know, I think trying to do the right thing in their own

So it's a lot of dominoes that have to fall in

22
23
24
25

there's a single broker/dealer that can quote that
security for 30 days. In theory multiple broker/dealers
could file a 211. That very rarely happens.
But for the first 30 days you don't see the
depth of book, you don't see additional market makers
coming because they're not permitted to. Then after that
30 day period you'll see a little bit more of a market
develop.
I talk here about Blue Sky laws. I'm going to
put that off for a moment because I talk about that in a
few slides.
DTC eligibility really just refers to make sure
that the shares are available for electronic transfer at
DTC. The role of the transfer agent is kind of tied in
with that. There's a transfer agent that has to help
process the transaction, indicate who the owners of all
the securities are, work with the issuer, work with the
investors, work with potentially their brokers to
transfer those shares so that trading can ultimately take
place.
With Elio that was one of the big impediments
early on, it was how are shareholders going to deposit
their shares into their brokerage accounts. You had a
number of excited shareholders who said this is great,
I'm ready to deposit, I hold at any number of brokers.

32 (Pages 122 to 125)


Page 126

Page 128

1

And brokers were saying, no, you can't deposit. We're

1

out into the market for new shareholders. It's also been

2

not accepting that. We're not going to take a Reg A

2

used in M&A activity and that should, you know, go to the

3

share.

3

credit of what Reg A has been able to accomplish.

4

So through a lot of work form Elio, their

4

So I cited here an example of an OTCQX company,

5

advisors, from OTC Markets, we contacted a number of

5

Coastal Banking, that completed a Reg A offering, used

6

brokers, a number of clearing firms and their compliance

6

that as part of an acquisition, and I gave you some of

7

teams approached it probably as they should, which is to

7

the trading statistics there. Again I could probably

8

say they really didn't know what Reg A was. And so they

8

disclaim all of these slides. I can barely help myself.

9

said, no, I'm not going to -- I don't know what the

But I'm looking at it but none of you are.

But you see a nice pattern of trading. People

With a little bit of an education process and,

acquisition was, and things were able to kind of move in

13

you know, thankfully people like Paul Elio are willing to

13

a natural direction.

14

go through this and kind of push the boundaries a little

14

15

bit, most of those brokerage firms said, okay, we get it,

15

couple of minutes here because this is another important

16

we understand, free tradeable share. This is how it's

16

component of what people need to understand in terms of

17

going to work and they put their processes in place.

17

the Reg A secondary market and really the secondary

18

But trading was able to commence at a more

18

market more generally.

19

normal level. You know, brokers look at these kinds of

19

One of the big things that people talked about

20

deals and maybe their first instant is to think it's a

20

around Reg A's adoption was the Blue Sky preemption at

21

pipe or an equity line financing or something else that

21

the offering stage, which certainly got its own -- its

22

may have terms that are not necessarily either apparent

22

own fair share of press. Secondary trading, there are

23

in favor of the issuer or the shareholder, and so

23

also Blue Sky rules that act on secondary trading. So

24

differentiating Reg A from those kinds of offerings was a

24

it's a set of state laws, and Mike Pieciak can probably

25

big part of this.

25

explain it even better that I can, that act on what

Back to the topic of Blue Sky, and I'll spend a

Page 127

brokers can and can't do with respect to advising

2

into Elio's trading activity since they joined OTCQX. As

2

investors in their state about a certain company.

3

Paul noted they closed their offering at $12. Their

3

So if a company is not Blue Sky exempt or

4

initial bid price on OTCQX was actually $14. That spoke

4

compliant in a given state brokers are prohibited from

-- you see very early on was due -- it could be due to a

5

taking certain actions, things like distribution of

6

number of factors, but it was due I think in part to the

6

research, which is considered advice. Again this is

7

amount of interest that Elio generated at the beginning

7

general. The state laws are very unique and things will

8

of the process and that supply/demand shortage created by

8

vary state to state, but generally research is

9

the fact that brokerage firms were not accepting these

9

prohibited, which impacts not only research directed to

1

10
11

You see this is just a little bit more insight

Page 129

shares.
So if you were an interested and motivated

10

people in a specific state but anybody who is thinking

11

about distributing national research will not do so
because no OTC company has Blue sky qualification or
exemption in every state.

12

buyer you had to pay from one of the very few, you know,

12

13

accounts that was offering freely tradeable shares. As

13

14

that smoothed out over time you see a much more normal

14

15

trading partner. They trade give or take at around $20 a

15

never going to stop -- none of the Blue Sky laws to my

16

share now, which is nice growth. And there are eight

market makers, at least as of June 30th there were eight

selling a security. So an investor calls their broker

18

market makers in Elio holding themselves out as able to

and says I'm interested in purchasing Elio Motors or OTC

19

buy or sell the shares. So some of that goes to the

I want to briefly note some of the other uses

for Reg A without using the term mini IPO, which I now

you know, you want to limit the opportunity for brokers

to solicit, which is a separate discussion in and of

1

all in one spot. And to their immense credit NASAA has

itself. The advice portion is just as important.

gotten on board.

So when that self-directed broker calls or a

self-directed investor calls their broker and says I

would really like to buy shares of OTC Markets, the

broker is not permitted to say actually I watched a

first movers in this endeavor, Vermont, which is Mike's

webcast of their general counsel and I think that's a

I'm sure Paul Elio would tell you, it's never easy to be

I want to touch on the petition for rulemaking

considering how you really expand the pool and Exchange

As we approached and now have passed the one

On the positive side of all of this there are a

23

Act companies, Exchange Act reporting companies in

24

number of exemptions and qualifications that Reg A and

24

particular have been in touch with us about their desire

25

other companies can go through to be able to trade, to be

25

to access Reg A and also seem to be the least

Page 131

Page 133

1

able to allow brokers to engage in some of these

1

controversial of the additional issuer types to

2

activities in a given state. The most prominent among

2

potentially gain access to Reg A.

3

those is the manual exemption, meaning the way NASAA has

3

These are companies that are already current in

4

framed it in their uniform Securities Act for companies

4

their SEC reporting requirements, so they're providing

5

that meet a certain set of qualifications as long as a

5

more information than is required under Reg A already.

6

certain amount of information is published in a

6

They are, you know, again current so they're kind of

7

nationally recognized securities manual, the theory being

7

active good citizens already. They are permitted of

8

give investors enough information availability you're

8

course to do more traditional offering types, S-1 and S­

9

able to trade that security or it's exempt from Blue Sky

3. Those are more costly avenues in many cases. They

10

don't have the Blue Sky preemption at the offering stage

11

that Reg A offers. Even S-3, which is obviously a more
streamlined process, has some public float requirements,
75 million in public float.

10
11

rules, limited broker behavior in that state.
The most prominent manual, which was operated

12

by Standard & Poor's, ceased publication earlier this

12

13

year, in May. We've taken that opportunity to -- you

13

14

know, all of this goes to how do you inform issuers what

14

15

the trading market is going to look like. We've taken

15

who might otherwise be able to use this financing tool

16

that opportunity to work with NASAA, with Mike Pieciak

16

not only to kind of raise money as a traditional capital

17

and others to establish OTCQX and OTCQB as manuals so

17

raise but also get that marketing impact, the additional

18

that a company like Elio can say, all right, I'm making

18

impact that Paul Elio was describing of engaging with

19

all of this disclosure available on OTCQX, not just a set

19

their potential customer base, all the things that Reg A

20

of audited financials that are going to sit in a

20

does very well or allows for very well.

21

published book in a library somewhere.

21

Sebastian touched on it briefly, but the

So there are issuers who are kind of left out

22

But this is dynamic information. It's the

22

additional part of our petition is to allow for at the

23

annual audited financials, its quarterly reports, timely

23

market offerings, which more or less means allowing the

24

disclosure of material news and all of the trading

24

offering to adjust to the current trading price of a

25

information that we have because we operate the market

25

company. So if you have securities that are already SEC

34 (Pages 130 to 133)


Page 134

Page 136

1

registered theoretically there's a market, a trading

1

done in that way. That doesn't allow for the dealer

2

market that exists for them already. And so an at the

2

market model that OTC Markets and potentially others may

3

market offering would allow any Reg A offering to be

3

find more useful.

4

priced accordingly.

4

Our point in all of our discussions about this

5

has been you want to allow for competition, particularly
where you have a tool that is clearly useful, like Reg A.

5

And there's -- I noted some public support

6

here. I got an email just before I sat down here that

6

7

there are now a dozen comment letters in support in the

7

It clearly has a lot of applications. You don't want to

8

SEC file. As Sebastian did I encourage everyone to take

8

start prescribing the kind of trading market that needs

9

a look at it, come back with any questions. Obviously

9

to develop around it. Allow these companies to trade in

10

submit comments through the process, and we're looking

10

a number of different markets. Resources will flow to

11

forward to working with the SEC more on that going

11

the ones that work. The market will actually figure this

12

forward.

12

out.

13

I will end, I promise I will end on a couple of

13

Some of the reasoning, at least that we've

14

slides just discussing the type of market that may work

14

heard behind directing these types of discussions towards

15

best for Reg A companies and others that are similarly

15

exchanges specifically are that exchanges get Blue Sky

16

situated. There's been a lot of discussion, a lot of it

16

preemption for secondary trading, they get things like

17

started at the SEC and Commissioner Gallagher was a big

17

margin eligibility. I think when you're talking to a

18

proponent of this kind of conversation. It's moved to

18

regulatory or legislative crowd that has a little bit of

19

the Hill. There have been some legislative proposals

19

control over how these things work the better model, at

20

talking about venture markets or what's really been

20

least I submit the better model, is to establish what you

21

venture exchanges.

21

think of as venture company.

22

I think there's sometimes a lack of

22

What are the companies that you're trying to

23

understanding about what exists now in terms of OTC

23

help with this? I indicate what factors those companies

24

Markets and just what the current regulations would allow

24

need to meet to qualify, and then say, all right, those

25

for in development, things that are not OTC Markets but

25

companies they get Blue Sky preemption, or margin

eligibility, or whatever other treatment the regulator or

2

I promised academic studies and here you go.

2

Congress thinks is appropriate, but don't mandate where

3

There was a study done by Professors Aggarwal and Angel

3

they have to trade. That's -- it's a roundabout way of

4

that was really exploring why the AMEX small company

4

dictating what's going to happen and potentially

5

market, small company marketplace in the 90's failed and

5

foreclosing options that could be a lot more useful.

6

it talked about some of the common characteristics of

6

7

successful small company markets. They grew out of the

7

a slide that I will fully attribute in the spirit of

8

preexisting over-the-counter markets. They operated as

8

transparency to our CEO, Cromwell Coulson. This is one

9

dealer markets and they were separate from the existing

9

of his favorites. And it's just an image to kind of take

1

10

that may develop over time.

Page 137

exchanges.

Again competition is the key. I will close on

10

away about why the auction model, the exchange model is

11

That really is what OTC Markets has built. It

11

not always right for companies that don't have a deep

12

is certainly an available path for others that may hop

12

order book.

13

into the market that may find some sort of market

13

This was Joan Rivers dog's bowl I suppose that

14

structure that works best for these companies. All of

14

sold at auction for about 30 times the low estimate on

15

those things are possible.

15

Christie's, a specialty item like you might think of a

16

The current proposals have focused specifically on the

16

company, a Reg A kind of company that appeals to a

17

exchange model and said we need to have a venture

17

certain kind of investor or consumer base that traded a

18

exchange, meaning a national -- a registered securities

18

little bit out of whack because the model available to it

19

exchange.

19

was auction. If you could have some competing dealers

20

that maybe bring a little more sense to the market you

20

So going back to that market structure

21

discussion from earlier, an exchange has to operate with

21

might not have wound -- although the Rivers' estate is

22

that central limit order book, that fast kind of speed of

22

not complaining, you might not have wound up with a

23

execution based model for the volume. For the trading to

23

$14,000 dog bowl.

24

be considered exchange, done on the exchange, it has to

24

25

be done where the exchange controls it. So it has to be

25

With that I will end the presentation and
certainly I'm happy to answer any questions you all have.

A PARTICIPANT: They're up on the website.

3

The kinds of questions that can come back, and

4

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: They're on the website.

4

just to focus it on Reg A, are sometimes the nature of

5

the purchaser. They want to see subscription agreements

6

from each individual purchaser of the securities. They

5
6

Okay.
MR. ZINN: I can certainly send them around

7

too, to the extent people are interested. I'll make sure

7

want to know from a broker mind you things that really

8

they get distributed to the group.

8

even the issuer is not necessarily permitted to provide.

MR. GOMEZ: Steve, would you like copies now,
is that what you -­
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: No, I should have asked
before but it's -- I'm fine.
MR. ZINN: If there's anything you want me to
reference I'll make sure I get to it.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay. Questions, comments.
Patrick.

So you have this competition between a broker

9
10

who's not allowed to receive compensation for performing

11

the service, this has to be of their own accord, and so

12

really can't have that kind of close relationship with

13

the issuer, being asked to answer questions about

14

insiders and about, you know, where the money came from

15

to purchase shares. It becomes a very sticky process.
And some of that is FINRA going through the

16

MR. REARDON: You referenced these brokers as

17

same process as the brokers and clearing firms I've

18

market makers but they are -- I think I heard you say

18

described before and really learning what it is to be a

19

that they're really matching orders is what they're

19

Reg A security and trying to figure out how they can

20

doing, they're not making a market in these securities.

20

handle that. So they are -- they are open to our

21

outreach in terms of trying to improve the process a

22

little bit. We try to work with them.

21
22
23
24
25

MR. ZINN: Oh, you mean on OTC Link? No, they
are acting as market makers.
MR. REARDON: So they buy for their own
account?
MR. ZINN: Yes, they buy for their own account

MS. MOTT: Can you help me understand. I

23
24

probably got -- it's probably in one of your slides, but

25

if there -- if they're filed with Reg A do they -- are

Page 139

Page 141

or for the account of customers, but they stand ready to

1

they under the QX or the QB? I mean, which is it -- is

2

buy or sell.

2

it -­

3

MR. REARDON: So like a trading balance or

3

MR. ZINN: So it can be either.
MS. MOTT: Okay.

4

something like that they've got to buy into it or -­

4

5

MR. ZINN: Right. So all the brokers that

MR. ZINN: So for QX and QB, you know, an

subscribe to our system are required to be FINRA members.

6

issuer is applying to achieve that designation. At the

7

So they're subject to the entire FINRA rule book, which

7

end of the day what -- QX is the same thing as NASDAQ or

8

gives certain consideration to brokers that act as market

8

New York. It's not the mechanism by which you're raising

9

makers in certain capacities.

9

money, it's just kind of the advertisement for lack of a

10

better word of I've met this standard, I qualify for this
club, and this is where I'm going to trade.

6

10

And so not every broker is required. We would

11

allow an agency broker to participate in the market. But

11

12

to the extent they are holding themselves out as market

12

So somebody like Elio determined to try to meet

13

makers for treatment under the FINRA rules they act as

13

the OTCQX requirements. So there are -- this is why I

14

market makers on our system.

14

could have done this for hours, but there are a whole set

15

MR. REARDON: Okay, thank you.

15

of OTCQX rules, not exactly the same but similar to what

16

MR. ZINN: Sure.

16

you would see on a NASDAQ or New York rule set, based

17

MR. YADLEY: Can you just talk a little bit

17

largely on the NASAA Uniform Securities Act with some

18

more about the initial quotation dialogue between you all

18

other bells and whistles in there.

19

and FINRA and what kind of questions they ask and where

19

20

they give you grief probably in your view?

20

of those markets. If they chose to -- if they don't

So companies can choose to qualify for either

21

MR. ZINN: Right. So it's not a process that

21

chose to go through the process at all and maybe decide

22

we go through. We kind of sit on the sidelines and watch

22

that they don't want to engage investors or they don't

23

as the process unfolds. But a broker will file this Form

23

want to continue to provide information, you know,

24

211, which is a fairly simply form, it's just a few pages

24

brokers can still trade them on the pink market. But

25

long, indicating what information they have about the

25

there may be a stop sign or a yield sign or whatever

appropriate investor indication is necessary based on how

1

of you know are often not necessarily correlated to

2

much they're putting out into the world.

2

record, you know, Dow results, it's a different

3

calculation. So as volumes ebb and flow in the listed
markets we follow a fairly similar pattern.

3

MS. MOTT: Okay. Back to Greg's question, I

4

think it was Greg that asked about the -- or Patrick,

4

5

market maker. So you said they were sort of acting like

5

6

market makers. Can you talk about the big picture of

6

growth, upon growth, upon growth as, you know, our

7

what happens on the OTC, the velocity, how much is

7

electronic capacity expanded a little bit and brokers

8

traded, you know, that kind of thing? Can you give us -­

8

were able to quote more securities and do it faster with

9

I don't think it was one of your slides, but can you give

9

us. There's still distance to be covered there. There

10
11

us a big picture of that?
MR. ZINN: Sure, and I'll do it a little bit

So we've seen -- for many years we experienced

10

are more things that we're constantly introducing that I

11

think will be accretive to these kinds of numbers.

12

through a slide. So over on the -- in the little text

12

13

box there on the right for the OTCQX Market year to date,

13

the speed that brokers want it to happen and quoting is

14

that second number down is $17.5 billion in dollar volume

14

available for as many securities as they want. You know,

15

traded. We look at dollar volume traded as the better

15

our capacity and our consistency is there. So we will

16

metric. Shares are what they are.

16

probably just continue to move more or less with the

17

listed markets. Sure.

17

So that's a picture of OTCQX. For OTCQB it's

But we're at a point where trading happens at

18

significantly different. Even though there are more

18

MR. NELSON: The internet is failing me and so

19

companies it's $4.3 billion in dollar volume. That

19

I was wondering how the daily or annual traded volume

20

speaks in some way to the, you know, the types of

20

number wise, in absolute numbers, compares to like the

21

companies on each market and the trading prices.

21

ASX, or the AIM, or the London Stock Exchange, or some of

22

But to the earlier part of your question, it's

22

the other kind of comparable smaller markets.

23

an electronic market. So our biggest participants are

23

MR. ZINN: So we're a little bit bigger than

24

the same market makers that work with the New York Stock

24

some of those markets. In part, you know, 10,000

25

Exchange and NASDAQ. So KCG and Citadel and firms like

25

securities is more than you see on NASDAQ as well. So

Page 143

Page 145

1

that are also operating in our markets. We also allow

1

it's a larger number. I don't have the specific data in

2

for some smaller brokers.

2

front of me, but I can certainly get it for you.

3

You know, there are brokers that specialize in

4
5

3

But, you know, we look at it both from I

community banks, which is always an example that I use

4

mentioned the market cap aspect of it, but also form the

that maybe don't have the algorithmic trading capacity,

5

depth of book, the number of market makers involved,

6

maybe it's a person clicking a button. So trading can

6

which is generally greater on our markets than you see

7

take place incredibly quickly when you have two

7

there. But some of those are very comparable markets,

8

electronic participants matching off against each other

8

and so to the extent anybody else is interested as well,

9

or working with each other to ultimately execute a trade

9

and honestly in those numbers or anything else, we can

10

through us. And that's an important distinction because

10

11

we -- at no point do we match for them, which is why you

11

12

see a little bit of a time difference.

12

turn those things around pretty quickly.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Laura, I think did you have a
comment?

13

So the speed of trading is there for the most

13

14

part. Again if it was Apple or Google it's probably not

14

which is kind of off topic. But one of the things that

15

where you would want it to be, but for these kinds of

15

came up in discussions among the committee with respect

16

companies, for those that trade, you know, less than a

16

to accredited investors and is a continuing theme of this

17

million times a year it's that kind of market.

17

committee is lack of data about anything. So it seems to

18

me that somebody whose market demographic consists of a

18

Ms. MOTT: Okay. So tell me about how does

CO-CHAIR HANKS: Actually I've got a question

19

that -- the market volume trading, how has that been

19

whole bunch of companies who have recently raised money

20

trending? So talk about the previous three years and how

20

privately might keep some records on people who might be

21

does this look, you know, today

21

potential issuers on the OTC. Do you got anything?

22

MR. ZINN: Sure. And I had a slide, I took it

22

MR. ZINN: I don't have anything offhand. I

23

out, that had the 2015 numbers. It's a little bit

23

have a feeling we can get it for you. We call that

24

slower. You know, we trend as the markets trend more or

24

process a slow PO, what you're describing, which is a Reg

25

less. So as volumes go down, and volumes as I'm sure all

25

D or a traditional private offering held for the

37 (Pages 142 to 145)


Page 146

Page 148

appropriate amount of time under Rule 144. They are six

1

2

months for a reporting company or a year for a non­

2

exchange they basically said, all right, every NASDAQ

3

reporting company, and then a public market developing

3

company is on the OTC margin list. Then NASDAQ became an

4

often through the 211 process. It's not always an issuer

4

exchange and they never picked up the OTC margin list, so

5

that is conscious of that and is creating that public

5

there were no OTC companies that are eligible for margin.

6

market, it is sometimes an investor who says I now have

6

So we have engaged the Fed to the extent we can on that,

7

this security that's publicly available for trade. They

7

but would love to see something like that happen.

8

call their broker, the process kind of proceeds from

8

9

there.

9

10
11
12

So I'll see what we've got and I'll get you
anything that we have.
CO-CHAIR HANKS: That would be great. Because

At some point prior to NASDAQ becoming an

What companies want for the most part is a
comparable experience to what you see on an exchange

10

based on them -- their ability to meet certain

11

requirements, not necessarily just the market on which

12

they trade. So we have talked to the IRS and Treasury

13

I think, you know, as we're trying to pull data together

13

about employee stock ownership plans and the way OTC

14

it's a number of tiny little mismatched jigsaw pieces and

14

securities are viewed and the obligations of an employer

15

the more jigsaw pieces we can get we can see how it works

15

or a company when developing an employee stock ownership

16

together.

16

plan it works differently for OTC companies than it does

17

for exchange listed companies and those are, you know,

17

MR. ZINN: I can look at -- if I could find the

18

camera I'll look directly into it and ask our data

18

you want to help your employees, you want to be able to

19

reporting team to send me that information.

19

run that in an approximate fashion, not always just doing

CO-CHAIR HANKS: Thanks.

a 701 offering.

21

MR. YADLEY: As a follow up to that, liquidity

21

We look at international designations. So, you

22

as Sara said is something that we're interested in.

22

know, this may be a little far afield in terms of what

23

Since research can't be disseminated, I mean what are

23

the committee focuses on, but there are a number of

24

some -- what are some of the constraints to a company

24

designations in Canada, in Europe, in South America and

25

being able to get more of a following? I mean, so you've

25

others for what markets they deem qualified for certain

Page 147

Page 149

1

now done an offering, you have a bunch of investors, you

1

interactions with investors in these countries. It is

2

have a market, your sole purpose is to have activity in

2

consistently an uphill battle for us to get recognition

3

your market, right, and you're trying to be hospitable to

3

for these markets in some of those jurisdictions. Again

4

the brokers. So there's the SEC, FINRA and the states.

4

a lot of these is largely due to education, people not

5

So what are the sort of top five things that even

5

necessarily knowing what the market is now, what OTC

6

understanding that there are issues to work through based

6

markets is, and maybe only having a picture of what it

7

on the jurisdictional issues and the mandates of those

7

was 20 years ago.

8

organizations on your wish list, what are five things

8

9

that you would change so that a company that's just

9

10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17

raised money can have liquidity quicker?
MR. ZINN: That's a great question. This is
fantastic.
MR. YADLEY: Isn't that what you asked me to
ask earlier, right?
MR. ZINN: Yeah, exactly. The check is in the
mail as they say.
So some of the things are what I touched on at

I put it on the slide but didn't mention it.
We're the NASDAQ of the 90's with today's technology.

10

And you see going back through a lot of the securities

11

laws things are permitted to be done or happen on an

12

exchange or NASDAQ because those things were written at a

13

time when NASDAQ was what we are now. So looking at that

14

kind of treatment is really the overall answer.

15

MR. HAHN: You had mentioned toward the end

16

there the ATM vehicle. Was that tone of the wish list

17

items?

18

various points in the presentation. So Blue Sky either

18

19

exemption and state level qualification, that's kind of

19

rulemaking. Because if you're going to allow Exchange

20

MR. ZINN: That's in the petition for

across the board, or preemption to the extent that's the

20

Act reporting companies to participate who have this

21

ultimate solution if necessary. Margin eligibility, I

21

market it's kind of the next logical step.

22

didn't get into it all that much other than a passing

22

23

reference, but the Fed used to keep an OTC margin list

23

24

where they would indicate which OTC companies were margin

24

25

eligible.

25

MR. HAHN: That would be great.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Anyone else? Okay. Well,
thank you, Dan.
MR. ZINN: All right. Thank you very much. I

SB had been modeled after an old form S-18, adopted in

2

the late 70's as an option for non-reporting companies to

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay, onto smaller reporting

3

conduct small offerings without incurring the full range

1

really appreciate the opportunity.

4

companies. For our final agenda item we will turn to

4

of reporting and disclosure obligations. Interestingly

5

this as it's the -- we're going to hear about the recent

5

enough while From S-18 was intended to serve small

6

proposal put out by the Commission regarding that

6

business, it's eligibility was based on the offering size

7

definition.

7

rather than the issuer size. So small issuers and SRCs

8

The SRC definition is of significant interest

8

have focused again on the size of the company that you're

9

to this committee as it determines which companies are

9

talking about.

10

eligible to use scale disclosure requirements. Last year

10

11

the prior iteration of this advisory committee

11

as Steve mentioned SRCs are generally companies with less

12

recommended to the Commission that it revise the SRC

12

than $75 million in public float as of the last business

13

definition to include companies with a public float of up

13

day of their most recently completed second fiscal

14

$250 million, an increase up from the current cap of $75

14

quarter. For companies with zero public float, either

15

million, and we were certainly pleased to see this action

15

because they have no public equity outstanding or because

16

on this front.

16

no market price exists for their equity, they would be

17

companies with annual revenues of less than $50 million
during the most recent fiscal year.

17

Amy Reischauer, who first and foremost is one

So bringing us back to the current definition,

18

of my former colleagues, and she's also special counsel

18

19

from the Office of Small Business Policy, one of the

19

20

primary duties of -- well, I guess she's one of the

20

multiplying the aggregate number of shares of the

21

primary drafters of this particular rule and she's here

21

company's voting and non-voting common by the price at

to kind of explain it to us and just kind of bring us up

which it was last sold, or in the case of an IPO it would

23

be the estimated offering price in contrast to market cap

As a reminder, public float is computed by

MS. REISCHAUER: Thanks, Steve. As we've

1

heard on June 27th the Commission proposed amendments to

1

2

the Smaller Reporting Company definition using the

2

3

Commission's rules and regs. For purposes of your

3

company that doesn't qualify as an SRC wouldn't qualify

4

discussion today I thought I would take a few minutes to

4

again unless or until it had less than $50 million on

5

provide a brief background on the SRC definition and how

5

public float or zero public float and annual revenues of

6

we got to the current definition to identify generally

6

less than $40 million. So a lower threshold would apply

7

the accommodations available to SRCs and to walk through

7

for companies transitioning from non-SRC to SRC in part

8

the proposed amendments, both what they propose to change

8

to limit the fluctuations back and forth.

9

and what they don't propose to change.

9

10

So as background, the Smaller Reporting Company

So under the current definition a reporting

SRCs are eligible to rely on a variety of scale

10

disclosure accommodations. These are all available a la

11

definition was established in 2007 in an effort to

11

carte if you will. They can pick and choose which ones

12

provide general regulatory relief and to simplify the

12

they wish to comply with, with the caveat that if an SRC

13

regulatory framework for smaller companies. Previously

13

disclosure requirement is more stringent than a non-SRC

14

smaller companies had looked to Regulation SB, which was

14

requirement the SRCs must comply with the more stringent

15

the prior integrated reporting and registration system

15

standard. And the prime example of this is related party

16

for small businesses. SB had been created in 1992 as

16

disclosure transactions where the transaction size

17

part of a larger effort, again to facilitate capital

17

threshold is lower for an SRC than it would be for other

18

formation and to reduce compliance burdens for small

18

companies.

19

businesses.

19

20

SB catered to what they called, what were

Other accommodations that I'm sure you're aware

20

of include business disclosure that would cover three

21

called small business issuers, which were issuers with

21

years versus five. and it's slightly less detail than the

22

both annual revenues and public floats of less than $25

22

enumerated requirements. Things like selected financial

23

million. So the SRC definition replaced that small

23

data, supplemental financial data aren't required.

24

business issuer definition.

24

Financial statements and MD&A are required to cover two

25

versus three years generally and there's a reduced comp

25

For those of you that are still interested, Reg

39 (Pages 150 to 153)


Page 154

Page 156

1

disclosure. There's no MD&A, reduced tables, no pay

1

any increase in the SRC definition into the large

2

ratio disclosure, things like that.

2

accelerated filer definition.

3

I would note that the SRCs like all companies

3

So the Commission's proposal wouldn't change

are required to provide, along with the specifically

4

the thresholds in those definitions, but in addition to

required information they must provide any other material

5

avoid that effectively indirect increase the proposed

information that would be necessary to make the required

6

amendment would eliminate that interlocking provision.

7

statements not misleading. So there's still a bit of a

7

So as proposed there could be companies with public

8

catchall even for those eligible for scaled disclosure.

8

floats between 75 million and 250 million what would be

9

So turning to the proposed amendments, again

9

both a smaller reporting company and eligible for

4
5
6

10

these changes are intended to promote capital formation

10

disclosure, but they would also be an accelerated filer

11

and reduce compliance costs for smaller companies by

11

with everything that comes along with that, including the

12

expanding the pool of companies that qualify as SRCs and

12

SOX 404(b) obligations unless they're emerging growth

13

that therefore are eligible to rely on the scale

13

companies who are already exempt. So there's that

14

disclosures, while at the same time maintaining the

14

disclaimer.

15

investor protections of the disclosure system.

15

I would reiterate, though, that while the

16

Commission did not propose to extend the 404(b) exemption

17

SRCs would be companies with less than 250 million in

17

it did specifically request comment in this area, so we

18

public float as we heard, or if they have zero public

18

of course look forward to seeing those comments come in.

19

float it would be annual revenues of less than 100

19

I think those are the highlights from the proposal but

20

million. And then companies that don't qualify as an SRC

20

I'm happy to take questions or stand by and just answer

21

would not qualify until they had less than $200 million

21

them as they come up.

22

in public float or zero public float and annual revenues

22

23

of less than 80 million.

23

at least I for one thought that eliminating 404(b) would

24

have a greater economic impact and it would appear from

25

the study that it's marginal at best.

16

24
25

Under the definition or the proposed definition

So thresholds obviously sound a bit familiar as
they're fairly consistent with the recommendations of the

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: You know, I think intuitively

Page 155

Page 157

1

committee, which the Commission considered. The

1

MR. GOMEZ: So the release has a lengthy

2

Commission could consider recommendations from the Small

2

discussion with respect to 404(b). In 2011 the staff did

3

Business Forum, which again were fairly consistent, as

3

a study on the impact of the 404(b) attestation

4

well as comments received in response to the disclosure

4

requirement and came to certain findings with respect to

5

effectiveness initiative.

5

the question as to whether the threshold should be raised

6

to a higher amount. And in essence the study looked at

6

I also wanted to walk through what the

7

Commission did not propose to change, but where it has

7

on the one side the cost versus the investor protection

8

requested comment. So if you've read it you'll see that

8

that comes from the 404(b) and the staff concluded that

9

the proposal would not increase the accelerated filer

9

there wasn't evidence to support raising the threshold as

10

threshold, or large accelerated filer threshold, or

10

11

extend the exemption from SOX 404(b) requirement to

11

12

provide an auditor attestation.

12

academic research in this area and the academic research

13

has been mixed, some research coming with some

13

So only accelerated and large accelerated

to where the 404(b) would need to apply.
Subsequent to 2011 DERA has been looking at

14

filers as you know are required to comply with SOX

14

conclusions while other research coming with conclusions

15

404(b), and those definitions like the SRC definition are

15

that don't support necessarily a change there. So the

16

based on public float, so 75 million in the case of an

16

Commission looking at all that did not propose changing

17

accelerated filer or 700 million in the case of a large

17

the 404(b) threshold, but it did ask for questions. And

18

accelerated filer. But each definition also contains a

18

I think there's a number of requests for comments in the

19

provision that excludes SRCs however they're defined.

19

release. We encourage people to comment on all aspects

20

So under the current definition SRCs are

20

of the release.

21

generally non-accredited investors, so I don't want to

21

22

say that provision is moot but it's not heavily effective

22

helpful, so any information that commenters provide on

23

because as non-accelerated filers they would already not

23

that would help DERA and the Commission to consider how

24

be subject to 404(b). However this interlocking

24

or whether to move forward.

25

provision as I've been calling it would effectively pull

25

Quantitative data is of course extremely

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: It's -- I don't know what the

40 (Pages 154 to 157)


Page 158

Page 160

1

right answer is. Again as I've said intuitively I just

1

2

assumed that that would ease a significant burden. It

2

in this. There's a lot of biotech companies and other

3

would appear that the burden is less than I assumed it

3

small companies that are in the same boat. I just don't

4

was. But the fact does remain that it's seen as a -- as

4

know what those numbers are.

5

a significant enough burden to give the exemption to

5

6

emerging growth companies for five years. Is that right?

6

could buy a lot of insurance to cover the risks that the

7

404(b) certification is intended to address. Those risks

8

could be covered for insurance costs a lot less than

9

$100,000.

7
8
9

MR. GOMEZ: So keep in mind that the HEC
exemption was statutorily mandate by Congress
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Understood, right.

Now again, you know, I know that I'm not alone

MR. REARDON: I would observe that you probably

10

MR. GOMEZ: But -- and I'm not sure what the

10

11

consideration there was. I think the Commission as it

11

meetings too. I know throughout the whole IPO process

12

was considering the 404(b) was considering on the one

12

and everywhere else all the investors, you know, as far

13

hand the dollar costs, which some of you -- I know Brian

13

as it relates to the financial statements in the biotech

14

you may have some ideas as to dollar costs itself on the

14

world the only question is how much cash do you have and

15

one hand versus on the other hand what's the cost from an

15

how long it's going to last. That's the only two

16

investor protection standpoint. So for example does the

16

questions. So -­

17

fact that you have a 404(b) auditor at the station does

17

18

it result in less restatements, and if so that it's a

18

CO-CHAIR HANKS: I've got a question for

19

benefit that you counter to the cost.

19

clarification. Tell me if I've got this right or wrong.

20

The point at which a company, a Reg A issuer loses the

21

conditional protection form Section 12(g)(4) registration

22

is currently set at the smaller reporting company, right.

20
21
22

So in considering this investor protection -­
but Brian I see your light on, you -­
MR. HAHN: So my question was we talked earlier

MR. HAHN: I think I've said this at past

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Other thoughts?

23

is less restatements. But is that broken out by company

23

And so I think one thing that I find this very welcoming

24

size? So, you know, we've got about two more exempt -­

24

right now is if a Reg A issuer were to prosper, as we

25

two more years of 404(b) exemption through the JOBS Act

25

hope they all do and eventually have more than 10 million

Page 159

Page 161

1

when we went public and I know that in two years from now

1

in assets, more than 2,000 -- or 500 shareholders plus

2

-- you know, we're going to -- we've done the research

2

$50 million in revenue, then they are going to have to

3

with our audit firm. It's going to cost us about

3

become a fully reporting company.

4

$100,000 more a year just to have them sign off on the

4

5

404(b). Audit fees went from $40,000 a year as a private

5

less burdensome Reg A regime straight into the big

6

company to $450,000 now.

Instead of leapfrogging from the relatively

6

grownup company policy this would give them the ability

7

And in two years noting is going to change in

7

to be a smaller company with a lighter regulatory lift,

8

our company. We still cut 125 checks a month. The CEO

8

right?

9

and I are the only two check signers. So for $100,000 a

9

MR. GOMEZ: That's right. So just for everyone

10

year -- and that's just to the auditors, not including

10

else's -- although I'm not sure I can explain it any more

11

the time that my staff have to spend, you know, with, you

11

clearly than Sara did. So currently if you are a Reg A

12

know, the added -- getting all the information to the

12

company that is doing a tier two offering, so you are

13

outside audit firms. So in two years nothing will

13

providing the ongoing reports required by the rules,

14

change, so it's not worth $100,000. There's no more risk

14

there is a -- there is an exemption form, the requirement

15

to the investors as it is today.

15

that that company would have to register the class of

16

securities under the Exchange Act, meaning an exemption

16

We also talked, you know, as an internal policy

17

that because the CEO and I have to sign off on the

17

from the company becoming a reporting company, it's a

18

filings, and we have to report to our audit committee, we

18

conditional exemption and it phases out when the company

19

do do some outside third party testing on our internal

19

reaches a certain size.

20

controls to kind of report internally there, and that's

20

Currently the way that it's set up in Reg A the

21

about 10 to $15,000 a year. So for 10 to 15,000 it gives

21

threshold happens to coincide with the threshold for

22

us comfort, it gives our audit committee comfort, and I

22

losing the SRC status. So I think what Sara is pointing

23

think, you know, that goes a long way. And I can't

23

out is currently in the Reg A a company is going on on

24

really justify spending $100,000 plus a year just to have

24

their reporting obligations and the Reg A pursuant to

25

an auditor sign off on 404(b).

25

this conditional exemption. If they grow into a

41 (Pages 158 to 161)


Page 162

Page 164

1

reporting company they will grow into a reporting company

1

and you had the ability to voluntarily check that box and

2

that is no longer a smaller reporting company.

2

say I'm going to take advantage of the SRC scale

3

The Commission asks the question in the release

3

disclosure and save the 20 to $40,000 in disclosure, is

4

as to whether that threshold should change or not, but it

4

it a penalty from the market standpoint because of the

5

did not propose a change to that threshold. So if the

5

fact that you had put yourself in the box of the smaller

6

Commission were to adopt the rules as currently proposed

6

reporting company?

7

a company that is doing a reporting under Reg A and gets

7

8

to a certain size when it has to actually become an

8

we've had not that I'm aware of. I have never had an

9

Exchange Act reporting company, that company will then

9

investor anywhere in any follow up meetings and anywhere

MR. HAHN: Again, you know, in all the meetings

10

still have the bandwidth from the current SRC threshold

10

else that it's questioned how much disclosure we end up

11

until the proposed $250 million public float is set as

11

doing. We also had a conservative law firm on our IPO

12

the threshold to report using the scale accommodations of

12

and our S-1, so we kind of went a little bit beyond, you

13

the SRC definition before they grow once again out of SRC

13

know, on some of the disclosures. That was more of a,

14

into being a full-fledged reporting company without the

14

you know, a choice from the company's standpoint.

15

ability for that scale disclosure.

15

But at no time did we ever think, oh, you know,

16

MR. HAHN: I also think it's important to note

16

we're going to do this because we think we'll get more

17

-- so right now we would fall in that -- my company would

17

credit from the investors for it. It was just kind of

18

fall in that bucket where we would be below that 200

18

our practice and our decision for that.

19

million for the scaled back reporting. But from our

19

20

standpoint I know that some of the cost savings, I thank

20

consistent with my experience. I mean, it's nice to have

21

it was 20 to $40,000 of that personally we would not

21

the option. There are some things like I think primarily

22

scale back. We would -- we would stick with the same

22

dealing with the financial statements for people who want

23

disclosure that we currently have.

23

to make sure there's more not less. But it's -­
generally speaking it's not a subject that comes up.

24

So if you think about it it would be kind of

24

25

moving forward with companies that go into that

25

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: I think that would be

MS. YAMANAKA: Yeah, I don't think people

Page 163

Page 165

1

threshold. I don't think, personally I don't think you

1

traditionally go, oh, I'm going to increase my market

2

would see many companies scale back their disclosures

2

value of my company by having these three additional

3

because the cost -- we already have everything in place,

3

disclosures.

4

so we're not going to save that money. You know, now

4

5

it's just -- it's a quick box. You know, we've already

5

costs and -- because I come out of that world

6

got that in there. We have the auditors review it, so I

6

historically. And, you know, there used to be a time,

7

don't think we would, again we wouldn't realize those

7

and times were very different, where you could get an

8

savings if we were to scale back.

8

audit and you were going to do an IPO and the cost

9

differential between a, you know, audit of a privately

9

CO-CHAIR HANKS: Would that be -- just because

I did want to make a comment on -- about audit

10

of the issues of cost or non-cost, or to follow up on

10

held entity versus a publicly traded company was

11

what Commissioner Stein said earlier, would you see an

11

significant, but not like this. And now days when you

12

advantage to that additional disclosure which is only

12

look at the cost, if you look at the cost of -- or the

13

costing you a little bit of extra money?

13

gap between what it is for a privately held company, just

14

MR. HAHN: I don't see that much of an

14

for banking, you know, requirements or whatever, and what

15

advantage. My concern would be if I scale back now

15

you're going to have to have -- pay and actually have the

16

hopefully sometime in the future we'll go back up above

16

infrastructure in place for a company to be able to

17

the 150 threshold and it's going to cost me more money to

17

survive an audit and get a good opinion, it's

18

reinstate that than it is just to maintain it between now

18

significant.

19

and then.

19

So I think that it probably does make a little

20

bit of sense to kind of up the ante because, you know, if

20

MR. GOMEZ: If I may ask a question. Your

21

point, Brian, piqued my curiosity as to something in -­

21

you're leaving the numbers as is, you know, 25 million is

22

and I don't know maybe from your standpoint or anyone

22

-- would cover a lot of audit costs before and it's not

23

else on the investment banking side, is there a negative

23

going to in the future. And the gap keeps growing.

24

perception tied to the idea of smaller reporting

24

Because in my mind and I should, you know, speaking as an

25

companies? So for example if the rules were to change

25

ex-auditor, it's all insurance, right. It's a different

42 (Pages 162 to 165)


Page 166

Page 168

1

level of insurance that's being paid as opposed to an

1

2

insurance company and an auditor is assuring or insuring,

2

3

I know that -- I know -- to all the auditors out there I

3

earlier we don't -- you know, we're still a pre-product,

4

know it's really not that case, but in effect the market

4

pre-revenue company. So we don't have inventory, we

5

is different. I have to say that. I'm going to get all

5

don't have a lot of transactions going in and out. We're

6

this email from all -­

6

conducting clinical trials and so we just have cash

that's a zinger that might get you.
And, you know, I think we were talking about

7

MR. YADLEY: Small A assurance.

7

disbursements. So I think it just needs to be a balanced

8

MS. YAMANAKA: Small assurance, correct. That

8

approach.

9

given all these procedures that are done your risk is

9

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: You know, it's -- going back

10

going down theoretically, that anything you would -- you

10

to the cost of 404(b) again, if I remember right the

11

would still want to make the investment based on the

11

proposal, though, indicated that the studies were such

12

information that you have available, but it's not an

12

that it was -- it was a measurable cost savings but it

13

assurance that the value of the company is there. People

13

wasn't monumental and doesn't necessarily outweigh the

14

aren't going to -- it's really a gatekeeper, right, it's

14

investor protection benefit.

15

not a value enhancer in my opinion, and the cost of that

15

I just find that hard to believe. And if that

16

is tremendous.

16

-- is that -- if I'm looking at this way, the -- if you

17

bumped the number from -- if you bumped the threshold

17

So I think that when we're talking about audit

18

costs, which are tremendous, but in order to -- we have

18

from 75 to 250 in terms of, you know, how that affects

19

to look at what the cost is for the company to be able to

19

shares that are being traded it's a relatively low

20

support a clean opinion on the other side and that ends

20

percentage I think.

21

up being just as expensive if not more so having the

21

22

properly trained people, the different processes and

22

23

procedures in place, the attention of the CFO to make

23

24

sure we're in compliance. It's not just the audit fees

24

25

that are that expensive.

25

MR. GOMEZ: That's right. When you look at -­
so it impacts a relatively large number of companies.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: That was my other point.
MR. GOMEZ: But as far as the total market
value for the shares of those companies we're talking

Page 167
MR. HAHN: It's also an operational issue. So,

Page 169
1

about currently less than 1 percent and it will go up to

2

you know, I've spent 18 of the last 20 years at five

2

a little bit more than 1 percent.

3

different -- all startup companies, emerging growth

3

4

companies, and the way you think about it is, you know,

4

market that will invest all in public if you will, that's

5

what processes and procedures do we need in place to let

5

kind of the number I think. But in terms of the number ­

6

the business operate. And if we put too many on right

6

- in terms of the companies involved that's -- it's a

7

away I don't have enough staff to have, go through all

7

large number.

8

these controls and the company is just going to slow down

8

MR. GOMEZ: It's a large number of companies.

9

and just not operate, not work.

9

We're talking about almost half of companies currently

1

So any time you start thinking about, okay,

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Right. So for the overall

10

qualifying and a little more than -- actually 40 percent

11

what controls do we put in place, does it make sense,

11

of them are qualifying.

12

what's the cost, what's the benefit of out of it, and I

12

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: And so if you take that

13

think, you know, going through right now with 404(b)

13

number and you multiply it, both the cost that each one

14

exemption, you know, I think we're in a good spot. We

14

of them would incur, the additional cost each would incur

15

got to the point about two years ago where we said, okay,

15

because they are complying with 404(b), I can't imagine

16

we want to give comfort to management and to the audit

16

that that's not a big number.

17

committee, so we went outside of this.

17

10

MR. GOMEZ: So, Steve, I think the -- so the

18

But again I think going to, forcing us to be

18

question -- like I said, it's not just on the dollar

19

404(b) with the attestation, I think that's just too much

19

savings of the 404(b), there's a cost to the investor of

20

cost and would kind of clog it down. I don't want to get

20

not having the 404(b) attestation. What our comments in

21

too much in the weeds here but, you know, some of the

21

previous studies and some academic research have noted is

22

things that will catch you up is, you know, if you've

22

the fact that other costs, that is not what you're paying

23

got, you know, three way matching on payables and here

23

out of pocket it's what counters the cost of the

24

somebody doesn't initial something here, although it's

24

restatement and -­

25

been reviewed and it's, you know, we signed the check,

25

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Of the restatement and blah,

43 (Pages 166 to 169)


Page 170
1

another staff or two. It's those costs and it's just the

2

MR. GOMEZ: -- paying for it. Restatement,

2

time for, you know, for my department to talk to clinical

3

there's some academic research that have noted that there

3

group, to talk to manufacturing group. It's just the

4

is a potential lower cost of capital for the company that

4

meetings, just to document, you know, the added burden

5

has the 404(b) attestation versus a company that doesn't.

5

there.

6

I think when you look at the costs of not doing 404(b)

6

7

it's harder to put them in the scale compared to just

7

8

looking at how much you're paying the auditor because

8

MR. HAHN: Yeah, so that was the only avenue.

9

that's one bill that you could go back and say, well, it

9

So we were -- we had -- we were -- our lead asset was in

1

10
11

blah, blah.

Page 172

would cost me an extra $100,00 to do it.
The cost from -- on the investor side of not

MR. NELSON: Was going public the cap of the
last resort for you guys?

10

phase 2 and we were funded to complete that phase 2, and

11

basically there was no way to raise money until we had
gotten the results from that.

12

having that comes from academic literature of looking at

12

13

what those potential costs can be, some of it

13

14

qualitative, some of it quantitative. So I think it's

14

doing a partnership with Pfizer to help fund some of that

15

hard for me but, I mean, I encourage everyone to not just

15

to extend our runway. But after we got positive results

16

look at the Commission's release but take a look at the

16

off that phase 2 there it is, what do we do. We talked

17

studies because the academic literature has been mixed

17

about a crossover round but it ended up falling right

18

since that staff study.

18

into the IPO was the only avenue we had.

So we had talked to some folks. We ended up

19

And don't take my word for it, but hopefully

19

20

what the studies will do is highlight additional data

20

speak, other colleagues in the biotech industry can speak

MS. MOTT: Brian, I bet your colleagues could

21

that the Commission could consider in making this

21

to the difficulty of finding capital, you know, to invest

22

determination.

22

in a company, particularly biotech because it's very

23

MR. HAHN: So this cost what five years ago?

23

capital intensive and it's a long tail, so it's very

24

Because I remember the last five years auditors have been

24

challenging to find investors. So often this is the only

25

-- have tried to come down on increasing the fees, so I'm

25

option, right?

Page 171
1
2

just interested what the updated numbers are on that.
MR. NELSON: Brian, can I ask how much the

Page 173
1

MR. HAHN: Right.

2

MS. MOTT: Well, now we have Reg A. But, I

3

regulatory burden actually went into your decision

3

mean, how many, though, of your colleagues would you say

4

whether to IPO or not?

4

have chosen this route or -­

5

MR. HAHN: So just to go public between

5

MR. HAHN: So bio represents about 1,200

6

lawyers, accountants was about $2.4 million. And just to

6

different companies. Now I'll state that large to small,

7

kind of put it into perspective, my payroll back then was

7

but I do know, you know, there is -- I belong to the

8

about $3-1/2 million a year. Payroll now is about $5

8

Association of Bio Financial Officers. So we -- you

9

million. So 2.4 actually just to go public and then it's

9

know, our annual conference we have our meetings, and it

10

probably an added 1.5, 1.6 million a year just to operate

10

is a very similar conversation. You know, our -- we had

11

as a public company.

11

raised $65 million as a private company in three rounds

12

the underwriters discount?

12

from VCs. Our IPO was $65 million and we just completed
a follow on last month for, you know, $20 million.

MR. REARDON: Is that with

13

MR. HAHN: No, no, it doesn't. That's on op of

13

14

it. And it's funny, back to our earlier discussions. You

14

15

know, I talked to a few people on the break here. We

15

16

went public in January of 2014 but in 2012 and 2013 we

16

It's not -- it doesn't work for biotech. You know, it's

17

were looking at all different avenues and Reg A+ would

17

a billion dollars in ten years to get an asset to market.

18

have been huge for us. We definitely would have utilized

18

Our company was founded in 2003. Our first compound

19

that when we were looking at crossover rounds, a way to

19

went in the clinic in late 2007, and where we are now

20

do that stepping stone. So, I mean, that's a great

20

it's midway through a phase 3. So it's not going to be

21

vehicle now.

21

on the market until 2019, 2020.

22

But, yeah, just the cost of a public company.

22

23

And, you know, to your point to add 404(b) it is 100,000

23

24

at the outside potentially but, you know, we may find

24

25

something in there that, you know, I may have to add

25

So where we have -- some of the other
industries can utilize crowd funding or angel investors.

Our second compound now is in a phase 2 and
it's going to be probably 2021 before it's on the market.
MS. MOTT: I think that it's important to take
a look at your industry and how that -- I mean, I think

44 (Pages 170 to 173)


Page 174

Page 176

1

this impacts your industry more so than others I guess is

1

2

the point I was trying to make.

2

MR. HAHN: I put down about 39 percent.
MR. YADLEY: Okay. But from their viewpoint

3

So -- and the need -- so Stephen, the reason I

3

maybe, and this really is a question, that's not bad as

4

wanted to bring this up was the need for that extra

4

opposed to them doing another round perhaps?

5

$100,000 right now goes towards clinical trials or, you

5

6

know, new toxicity studies or, you know, something like

6

looted. So that's always a big major discussion before

7

which is going to be more value, much more valuable to

7

you start to go out and talk about raising more funds.

8

the I guess the accretive exit value of the company than

8

9

$100,000 in a 404(b). That's just -­

9

MR. HAHN: Like any VC they never want to be

MR. REARDON: Could I ask a question and then I
want to make a comment.

10

MR. YADLEY: So Brian, I hate to pick on you,

10

11

but you're a great example of this. Companies that I've

11

year's balance sheets and one year P&L and cash flows; is

12

worked with and taken public that have been able to

12

that right?

13

access capital from the public markets later have been

13

14

happier than companies that just sort of went public and

14

15

then, well, now we're public. You know, why did we do

15

16

it, we're not getting as much value.

16

have -- okay. So -- and then with the full-fledged

17

you've two -- you've got three years of P&L?

17

So you had a follow on round within two years

If you're small reporting company you have two

MS. REISCHAUER: Two years. I'm sorry, two
years of each.
MR. REARDON: Two years of each. And so you

18

it sounds like, and I'm sure that was costly, but leaving

18

19

aside underwriters you did have -- you had the baseline

19

MS. REISCHAUER: Right.

20

of financial information and disclosure. Could you talk

20

about this in perspective. Last meeting we were talking

21

about that and then assuming you have to go back to the

21

about the -- and it was some of the -- it was the

22

market sometime soon how does all that play in?

22

Commissioners who really were talking about this, who

23

MR. HAHN: We actually had a couple of

23

were saying that they're concerned that we -- there's not

MR. REARDON: And I would like to kind of think

24

different things here. So we had -- you know, our market

24

good information or the quality of the information in

25

cap -- so our VCs, our main VC backer still owns about 45

25

private placements and exempt transactions is not the

Page 175

Page 177
quality that registered deals have.

1

percent of the company. So last year after we filed the

1

2

K we actually fell below the -- we filed the S-3 and we

2

And I think, you know, in fairness that's

3

fell below that.

3

probably right. I think you don't get information, you

4

So we were baby shelf rules, so -- which

4

may or may not get periodic reports. But -- and now

5

meaning, you know, we were only able to raise in a 12

5

we've got Reg A+, which I'm really shocked that it's got

6

month period 1/3 of our public float. So it limited us

6

the features it's got. I mean, the selling stockholders

7

to about $20 million a while back.

7

I think is an important feature. I think some of the

8

other things are out there make that attractive.

8

And then, you know -- so we put an ATM in place

And I think -- I think the Commission has got

9

saying, hey, we can try to bring a little bit of money

10

into that. So that cost legal fees, accountant's fees.

10

to do a little marketing to get the word out that -- I

11

That was probably 200, $250,000 just to put the ATM in

11

know marketing is something government is not usually

12

place. Drew down about $3 million worth of that.

12

used to doing, but I tell my -- I told my children when

13

Luckily markets came back up, some good news. We

13

they were growing up, I said there are two types of

14

actually closed one day above the threshold price, so we

14

people, those who know they're in marketing and those who

15

are now out from under the baby shelf rules, full S-3

15

don't. But they are -- we all have to market a little

16

eligible.

16

bit. But -- and I can give you some ideas about some

9

17

And then once again, you know, go through all

17

conferences to go, and Sebastian get you some face time

18

the underwriter meetings, you go through two weeks of the

18

with some of my colleagues -- or Julie.

19

diligence calls. You know, we ended up doing a CMPO, but

19

20

again it was in legal, accounting fees, everything all in

20

We've got private placements, we've got Reg A, which now

21

about $300,000 for those fees before the underwriters

21

has -- which has audited financial. So the quality of

22

discount. So, you know, it's -­

22

information there is better. So then we get to a stage

23

at which we're talking about the small business filer and

23

MR. YADLEY: And you're -- okay, which maybe

But -- so let's look at the continuum here.

24

sounds, maybe it doesn't, and your primary owner is the

24

whether you're going to do that, and how big we're going

25

VC. Which percentage do they own after -­

25

to make that window, and then over here is the real big

45 (Pages 174 to 177)


Page 178
1
2

boys. And so -- or big girls.
And it seems to me that -- and I made the point

Page 180
1

and all of a sudden they're going after bank money and

2

they're saying we have to have a compilation. It just

3

last time that I would like to see more easier to do

3

changes their mentality. Oh, my gosh, we have to have a

4

public offerings. And if you can get your costs down,

4

review and now we have to have a journal of controls, and

5

your compliance costs down, then that is, that's a big

5

they haven't seen nothing yet, right.

6

step. I mean, it's a big step and keeping those

6

7

compliance costs down is a big step toward making public

7

some outside money and they want an audited financial.

8

offerings more attractive. You know, costs, nobody -- I

8

Okay. And then, oh, my gosh, we all have to do filings.

9

doubt -- well, there's somewhere somebody hates having

9

Each one of those is a systematic increase that has

And then, oh, my gosh, you know, we're getting

10

the 404(b) certification done, but if I'm a CEO I'm

10

value, because you can't expect somebody to go from here

11

delighted to have it done because it protects me that

11

to here overnight I don't care how much money you can

12

I've had it done. But, I mean, it becomes an item of

12

throw it at, right, because it's not just buying the new

13

cost and for a small company a cost item of $100,000 is

13

people and the accounting company.

14

significant, just sticking with Brian's number.

14

15

So it seems to me that if you want to pull

So I think it's good that we have this staged

15

level. The questions becomes in between. You don't want

16

people out of the exempt transactions and maybe get them

16

to put the regulatory burden on them that crushes them

17

either directly through IPOs or through Reg A offerings

17

prematurely, but on the other hand they got to start

18

that you make these compliance costs as low as you can

18

doing their, you know, exercising their controls and

19

and expand the window, and then maybe even do some

19

starting to say, oh, what do you mean we have to have a

20

marketing on this. But that's my sense of it. I would

20

PO that we can't back date, right. Or, oh, I'll get you

21

say that I don't know what the incremental cost is to be

21

the documentation before year end, right, which is -- or

22

an accelerated filer. I don't have any idea if it's more

22

after year end but before the audit.

23

expensive or not.

23

So those kinds of things I think -- I know

24

But, you know, it seems counterintuitive that

24

people are going, oh, my gosh, but in reality when you're

25

you would be a small business filer yet you would be an

25

a privately held company and it's just yours it really

Page 179

Page 181

1

accelerated filer. It seems like inconsistent thoughts,

1

doesn't matter as much as -- and people don't understand

2

but I guess that's -- that's just me.

2

that. People have been working there from the beginning
maybe don't understand that.

3

But anyway, those are my thoughts on that.

3

4

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Thank you, Patrick. Laura.

4

5

MS. YAMANAKA: One last comment I think, an

5

approached to the reporting. I think it's excellent. As

So I think it's good to have a staged

6

observation. Nobody denies the value of an audit, right.

6

far as where the cutoff comes, you know, I think it's a

7

And when you look at a company that's publicly traded

7

little onerous. That could go either way.

8

and has the routine in process and procedure for an

8

9

audit, and then you look at the company first starting

9

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: I think I understand what
you're saying, but bear I mind that just because you're

10

out, you know, they're a startup, they've got seven

10

exempt from 404(b) doesn't mean that you aren't doing

11

people, processes and procedures between what's going to

11

your audited financial statements.

12

go -- start here and get here is huge and it doesn't

12

13

happen overnight. They could triple, quadruple,

13

14

gazillion sales.

14

MS. YAMANAKA: No, absolutely. Yeah,
absolutely.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Any other comments?

15

But that mentality of that company to get all

15

16

the way through as far as the things you do when you've

16

many different layers do we have now, different

17

got three people and you're signing your own checks still

17

variations of reporting flavors? Because, you know, it's

18

versus what you do when you're going to have to be an

18

getting super confusing.

19

SEC, you know, publicly traded company is totally

19

20

different.

20

filers, the accelerated filers, and in essence everyone

21

below that it's not defined, but everyone who is not an

21

So it's partly -- it's partially the cost of

CO-CHAIR HANKS: I have just a question. How

MR. GOMEZ: So you have the large accelerated

22

the CPA, but to me it's more the cost of the company

22

accelerated filer. That in many ways primarily goes to

23

culture in which you're building. And so whether -- and

23

when your reports are due and whether 404(b) auditor

24

it's painful, I know it's really painful, but we take

24

attestation is required or not.

25

companies that are -- they've never been audited before

25

You then have the smaller reporting layer that

46 (Pages 178 to 181)


Page 182

Page 184

1

goes to what disclosure accommodations you have. And now

1

2

you also have the emerging growth companies that applies

2

page. If the committee decides to take outreach we can

3

to companies from their time -- or their initial public

3

look at that and you guys can tell us how legalese it is,

4

offering and it has a number of requirements as to when

4

and then I encourage you to provide feedback as to how we

5

that phases out. It could be because of growth of the

6

company, it could be because of the amount of time the

company has been public. So I don't think I missed -­

7

I think as far as comments to this particular proposal we

MS. REISCHAUER: I think that's it. Julie just

8

should kind of keep them -- keep thinking about this, and

9

I think Amy will be receptive to your individual comments

reminded me there's, for visual, folks, there's actually

So we do have a document on the small business

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay. Well, thank you all.

10

a chart in the April 2016 concept release that maps out

10

and will consider whether it makes sense for something to

11

the various buckets, if that helps.

11

come from the committee as a whole.

12

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay.

12

13

MR. NELSON: I was actually going to suggest a

13

is good to go. Does -- so everyone take one last look at

The recommendation that we adopted this morning
the new language.

14

blog post where it's explained like I'm nine years old.

14

15

And this is one of the things, exercises that we actually

15

16

take our CEOs through is when they're actually doing

16

5. Does that work in terms of -- okay, right -- at least

17

marketing is if you as a CEO can't really explain your

17

tentatively put down October 5 for the next meeting.

18

idea and your product to a nine year old and get them

18

19

excited about it chances are you're probably not going to

19

20

raise money. Because the people just need to understand

20

(Draft document distributed.)

21

what you're doing in plain English.

21

CO-CHAIR HANKS: Is that a could or a would?

22

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Would.
CO-CHAIR HANKS: That's would

I think I'm fairly intelligent. I still kind

22
23

of struggle to keep up with some of you guys who are in

23

24

this from day-to-day. I would love it explained like I'm

24

25

nine years old kind of, you know, the exemptions for Reg

25

And our next meeting we're thinking of October

So the new language is paragraph 3. If you
could take a quick look at that.

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Would. Okay, Sara changed
could in the last line to would. Any other wordsmithing?

1

D, the, you know, A+ small reporting company and that

1

2

sort of stuff just so I can see the smorgasbord of

2

3

options available to me as an entrepreneur of how to

3

4

actually raise money and what I have to do to raise that

4

5

money. If that exists I would -- please someone point me

5

6

to it.

6

7

CO-CHAIR HANKS: I'm trying to find that.

7

8

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: If there was one I think this

8

9

relates to our outreach. If there isn't one we can

MR. AGUILAR: What's the Series 82? I'm not
familiar with that.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Series 82 anyone? It was one
of the -- one of the tests mentioned in the proposal.
A PARTICIPANT: 82 is what's listed -- I mean,
what is in the steps on page 95.
A PARTICIPANT: Just make sure that you use
the mike.
CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: I'm seeing 7, I'm seeing 7

9

10

certainly do one. And of course every prospectus we

10

and 82 and 96. 95 as well. I'm not seeing where 65 is

11

draft we draft that with that in mind.

11

mentioned.

12

(Laughter.)

12

13

MR. GOMEZ: There is -- there is a document on

13

14

the small business page that describes the different

14

15

capital -- the different exemptions that are available.

15

16

I wonder whether my six year old daughter that would be

16

17

able to hold her interests.

17

MS. TIERNEY: It was a combination of two other
exams. Wasn't -- is -- 63 and something else, wasn't it?
MR. AGUILAR: Yeah, the 65 is the registered
investment advisor exam.
CO-CHAIR HANKS: It's appropriate. I have that
one.

18

I think -- John, you make a good point. I mean,

18

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay.

19

often we live in this area and for us 506(b) versus (c)

19

MS. TIERNEY: If Sara has it we're good.

20

versus Reg A, it all makes sense. But when I got to

20

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: Okay. Well, we'll make sure

21

events to talk about the different capital raising

21

22

options you do realize at that point that we may not be

22

23

the example for what's typical out there. People who are

23

24

very good at making widgets, but they don't know the

24

25

securities laws.

25

that's right.
MR. GOMEZ: We put it up on the screen, the
description of the Series 82.
MR. AGUILAR: Yeah, it looks like it's a
private securities offering.

PROOFREADER'S CERTIFICATE

This is to certify that I, Nicholas Wagner,


10

(the undersigned), do hereby swear and affirm that the

11

May the tick mark pilot started. I wondered if we could

attached proceedings before the U.S. Securities and

get an update on that study, right. Didn't that pilot

study start in May? Right?

that this is the original, complete, true and accurate

transcript that has been compared to the reporting or

up, I think the first group took up the first time.

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: It's on the list.

25

MR. YADLEY: I also ask that you confirm the

October 5th date as soon it is finalized. We should at

2

least make sure that's okay with everybody here. And I

3

guess our next meeting would then be in January? I know

4

advance planning is hard, but the earlier the better.

5

CO-CHAIR GRAHAM: You remind me of my wife who

starts talking about dinner halfway through lunch.

MR. YADLEY: And your point is?
