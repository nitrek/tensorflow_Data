Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Sections
203(e), 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) against West
Coast Asset Management, Inc. (“WCAM”) and Lance W. Helfert (“Helfert” and collectively with
WCAM, “Respondents”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, each Respondent has submitted an
Offer of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order Instituting
Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of
1933 and Sections 203(e), 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making

Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth
below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds 1 that
Summary
1.
This matter involves untrue statements by WCAM and Helfert to an advisory client
regarding a hedge fund WCAM managed, the West Coast Opportunity Fund (“WCOF” or the
“Fund”). In September and October 2008, as the financial crisis was unfolding, the client was
considering an additional $4 million investment in the Fund. In response to a question from the
client’s representative, Respondents stated that there had been only two minor redemptions from
WCOF, and that there had been net inflows into the Fund, neither of which was true. In reality, a
WCAM affiliate had requested a $5 million redemption from WCOF just a month before that
resulted in net outflows from the Fund. As a result, Respondents violated Section 17(a)(2) of the
Securities Act and Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8(a)(1)
thereunder as set forth below.
Respondents
2.
West Coast Asset Management, Inc. (“WCAM”), is a California corporation
with its principal place of business in Montecito, CA. WCAM is registered with the Commission
as an investment adviser and currently has approximately $190 million in assets under
management. WCAM is also the managing member of and investment adviser to WCOF.
3.
Lance W. Helfert (“Helfert”), age 40, resides in Thousand Oaks, CA. Helfert is
the president, director and 40% owner of WCAM.
Facts
4.
On November 4, 2008, a family trust (the “Fund Investor”) invested $4 million into
WCOF. This was the Fund Investor’s second investment in the Fund, having invested $2 million
in the Fund earlier in 2008. The Fund Investor also had a separately managed account with
WCAM, over which WCAM had discretionary control. In connection with both of its investments
in WCOF, the Fund Investor was represented by an individual (the “Investor’s Representative”)
who performed due diligence regarding the investment opportunity, provided a summary of his
thoughts to the Fund Investor, and ultimately recommended that it make each of its two
investments in the Fund.
5.
In conducting his due diligence, the Investor’s Representative regularly
communicated with Helfert and others at WCAM regarding the Fund. Helfert understood that the
1

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers of Settlement and are not binding
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

2

Investor’s Representative was representing the Fund Investor and that the information Helfert
provided the Investor’s Representative was for his assessment of whether the Fund Investor should
invest in WCOF.
6.
WCAM marketed the Fund, in part, by emphasizing that WCAM’s principals had
“skin in the game,” accounting for approximately 40% of WCOF’s assets.
7.
On October 31, 2008, as the financial crisis unfolded, the Investor Representative
sent an email to Helfert inquiring about redemption activity in WCOF. Specifically, he posed the
following question: “One thing that we didn’t touch on was how your investors are reacting. Are
funds being pulled to any large extent, from their SMA’s, or the early investors in WCOF who are
out of their lockups?”
8.
Helfert responded by email on November 3, 2008: “We have had net inflow in
both the SMA’s and the WCOF the past couple of months. We have had no full redemptions in the
WCOF, just 2 minor partial redemptions that we were informed of months ago.”
9.
This response, however, was not true because it did not include a redemption by a
WCAM affiliate. In particular, it excluded the WCAM affiliate’s $5 million redemption request
made on September 30, 2008 (and that was deemed effective on October 31, 2008—the same day
as the Investor Representative’s inquiry). Second, when including the $5 million redemption, there
was actually a net outflow from the Fund since July 1, 2008 of over $3.4 million. The $5 million
redemption represented approximately 5% of WCOF’s total value.
10.
Minutes after Helfert sent his November 3, 2008 email, the Investor Representative
confirmed to Helfert that the Fund Investor would invest an additional $4 million into WCOF. The
Fund received the $4 million the next day.
Violations
11.
By offering and selling interests in WCOF through the untrue statements in the
November 3, 2008 email described above, Respondents willfully violated Section 17(a)(2) of the
Securities Act, which makes it unlawful, in the offer or sale of securities, to obtain money or
property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act does not require a showing
of scienter; negligence is sufficient. Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 701-02 (1980).
12.
As a result of the untrue statements in the November 3, 2008 email described
above, Respondents willfully violated Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act, which prohibits
investment advisers - such as Respondents - from, directly or indirectly, engaging in any
transaction, practice or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or
prospective client. Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act does not require a showing of scienter;
negligence is sufficient. SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d 636, 643 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (citing SEC v.
Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 195 (1963)).

3

13.
As a result of the untrue statements in the November 3, 2008 email described
above, Respondents willfully violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8(a)(1)
thereunder. Section 206(4) prohibits investment advisers from engaging in “any act, practice, or
course of business which is fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative,” as defined by the Commission
by rule. Rule 206(4)-8(a)(1) prohibits an investment adviser to a “pooled investment vehicle” such as Respondents with respect to WCOF - from, directly or indirectly, making false or
misleading statements to investors or prospective investors in those pools. Section 206(4) of the
Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8(a)(1) thereunder do not require a showing of scienter; negligence
is sufficient. Steadman, 967 F.2d at 647.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondents’ Offers.
Accordingly, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and Sections 203(e), 203(f) and
203(k) of the Advisers Act it is hereby ORDERED that:
