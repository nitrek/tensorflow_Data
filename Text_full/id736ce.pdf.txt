INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
AS TO TWO RESPONDENTS
January 13, 2015

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement, Securities and
Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Cameron Elliot, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision revokes the registrations of the securities of Respondents
Bingo.com, Inc., and Biocol, Inc., (collectively the Two Respondents). The revocations are
based on the Two Respondents’ failure to timely file required periodic reports with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (Commission).
INTRODUCTION
On November 26, 2014, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative
Proceedings (OIP) against Respondents, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (Exchange Act). The OIP alleges that Respondents each have a class of securities
registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic filings. The Two
Respondents were served with the OIP by December 9, 2014, and their Answers were due by
December 22, 2014. Bingo.com, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 2176, 2015 SEC
LEXIS 5 (Jan. 2, 2015). Following the Two Respondents’ failure to timely file Answers, I
ordered the Two Respondents to show cause by January 12, 2015, why this proceeding should
not be determined against them due to their failures to file Answers or otherwise defend this
proceeding, warning that failure to show cause would result in default and the revocations of the
registrations of their securities. Id. To date, neither of the Two Respondents has filed an Answer
or responded to the Order to Show Cause.

FINDINGS OF FACT
The Two Respondents are in default for failing to file Answers or otherwise defend the
proceeding. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, as authorized by
Rule of Practice 155(a), I find the following allegations in the OIP to be true.
Bingo.com, Inc., Central Index Key (CIK) No. 1087853, is an Anguilla corporation
located in Anguilla, British West Indies, with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-QSB
for the period ended March 31, 2005.
Biocol, Inc., CIK No. 1101373, is a dissolved Wyoming corporation located in Irvin,
Texas, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having
not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-QSB for the period ended June 30, 2005,
which reported a net loss of over $300,800 for the prior nine months.
In addition to their repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, the Two Respondents
failed to heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation
Finance requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations or, through their failure to
maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not
receive such letters.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require public corporations to
file annual and quarterly reports with the Commission. Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers
to file annual reports and Rule 13a-13 requires domestic issuers to file quarterly reports. See 17
C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1, .13a-13. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and may not
be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied, Exchange
Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not required to
establish violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13. See SEC v.
McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C.
1978). There is no genuine issue of material fact that the Two Respondents failed to timely file
required periodic reports. As a result, the Two Respondents failed to comply with Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13.
SANCTIONS
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an opportunity for hearing,
that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the Exchange Act or
rules thereunder. In proceedings pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j) against issuers that
2

violated Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13, the determination “of what
sanctions will ensure that investors will be adequately protected . . . turns on the effect on the
investing public, including both current and prospective investors, of the issuer’s violations, on
the one hand, and the Section 12(j) sanctions, on the other hand.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19 (May 31, 2006). The
Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s violations, the
isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved, the extent of the
issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and the credibility of
its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Id. at *19-20.
The Two Respondents’ failure to file required periodic reports is serious because it
violates a central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is “to supply
investors with current and accurate financial information about an issuer so that they may make
sound [investment] decisions.” Id. at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that
Congress fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate
misrepresentations in the sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st
Cir. 1977). The Two Respondents’ violations are also recurrent in that each repeatedly failed to
file periodic reports. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268,
2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21, 2009) (respondent failed to file seven required periodic
reports due over a two-year period); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008
SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008) (respondent’s failure to make eight filings over an
eighteen-month period considered recurrent). The Two Respondents are culpable because they
failed to heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Division of Corporation Finance or,
through their failure to maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by
Commission rules, did not receive such letters, and they were therefore on notice, even before
the OIP issued, of their obligation to file periodic reports. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that
revocation may be warranted even without proof that a respondent was aware of its reporting
obligations). Finally, the Two Respondents have not answered the OIP or otherwise participated
in the proceeding to address whether they have made any efforts to remedy their past violations,
and have made no assurances against further violations.
Considering these delinquencies, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of
investors to revoke the registrations of each class of registered securities of the Two
Respondents.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registrations of each class of registered securities of Respondents Bingo.com, Inc., and
Biocol, Inc., are hereby REVOKED.
This Initial Decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Rule of Practice 360. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, a party may file a petition
for review of this Initial Decision within twenty-one days after service of the Initial Decision. A
party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the Initial
3

Decision, pursuant to Rule of Practice 111. 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a
manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then that party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition
for review from the date of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest
error of fact.
This Initial Decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion
to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
Initial Decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the Initial Decision shall not become
final as to that party.
Respondents are notified that they may move to set aside the default in this case. Rule of
Practice 155(b) permits the Commission, at any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in
order to prevent injustice and on such conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b).
A motion to set aside a default shall be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the
failure to appear or defend, and specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
