In the Matter of
Multi-Corp. International, Inc.,
Pan American Goldfields Ltd., and
Sky Harvest Energy Corp.

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Multi-Corp. International,
Inc. (CIK No. 1405260), a defaulted Nevada corporation with its principal place of
business listed as Las Vegas, Nevada, with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously, “Pink
Sheets”) operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. (“OTC Link”) under the ticker symbol
MULI, because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended March 31,
2013. On June 6, 2014, Multi-Corp. International, Inc. was sent a delinquency letter sent
by the Division of Corporation Finance requesting compliance with its periodic filing
obligations, but did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid
address on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule 301 of
Regulation S-T, 17 CFR 232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual).
It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Pan American Goldfields

Ltd. (CIK No. 1046672), a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business
listed as Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with stock quoted on OTC Link under the ticker
symbol MXOM, because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended
November 30, 2013. On March 25, 2015, Pan American Goldfields Ltd. was sent a
delinquency letter by the Division of Corporation Finance requesting compliance with its
periodic filing obligations, and Pan American Goldfields Ltd. received the delinquency
letter on April 10, 2015, but failed to cure its delinquencies.
It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Sky Harvest Energy Corp.
(CIK No. 1332445), a revoked Nevada corporation with its principal place of business
listed as Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with stock quoted on OTC Link under the
ticker symbol SKYH, because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended
May 31, 2013. On January 26, 2015, Sky Harvest Energy Corp. was sent a delinquency
letter by the Division of Corporation Finance requesting compliance with its periodic
filing obligations, but did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a
valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule 301 of
Regulation S-T, 17 CFR 232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual).
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of
investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.

Therefore, it is ordered, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on August 31, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on September
