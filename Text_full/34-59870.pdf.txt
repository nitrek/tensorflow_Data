On September 23, 2004, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Cease-and

Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against John W. Adams (“Adams”) and
AIP, LLC (“AIP”), Exchange Act Release No. 50427 (the “Order”). Among other things,
the Order directed AIP to pay $2,466,287 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and
Adams to pay $4,184 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest into an interest bearing
escrow account and that the escrowed funds be disbursed only pursuant to an order of the
Commission.
On February 20, 2009, the Commission issued an Order Approving Publication of
Notice of Proposed Distribution Plan and Opportunity for Comment, Approving Plan
Administrator, and Approving Administrative Bond, Exchange Act Release No. 59431.

On February 23, 2009, the Commission published a “Notice of Proposed Plan of
Disgorgement Distribution and Opportunity for Comment” (“Notice”) in connection with
this proceeding pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103, Exchange Act Release No. 59433. The Notice
advised interested parties that they could obtain a copy of the proposed plan of distribution
of monies in In the Matter of John W. Adams and AIP, LLC (“Distribution Plan”) by
printing a copy from the Commission’s public website or by submitting a written request to
Tracy L. Davis, Assistant Regional Director, United States Securities and Exchange
Commission, 44 Montgomery Street, Suite 2600, San Francisco, CA 94104.
The Notice also advised that all persons desiring to comment on the Distribution
Plan could submit their views, in writing, no later than March 25, 2009, to the Office of the

The Distribution Plan states that monies from the disgorgement fund will be
distributed to eligible recipients who were harmed by Adams’ and AIP’s conduct, utilizing a
methodology delineated in the Distribution Plan. The Distribution Plan describes the
procedures that will be used to identify the eligible recipients that will receive distributions.
The Distribution Plan further describes the procedures that will be used to calculate and
distribute the total amounts to be paid to eligible recipients from the disgorgement fund.
The Division of Enforcement requests that the Commission approve the Distribution
Plan as written.

The Commission finds that the Distribution Plan provides for an appropriate
distribution of the monies paid by Adams and AIP pursuant to the Order.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 1104 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. §201.1104, that the
Distribution Plan is approved.
