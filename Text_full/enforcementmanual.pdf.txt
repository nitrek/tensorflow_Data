Introduction
1.1

Purpose and Scope

The Enforcement Manual (“Manual”) is a reference for staff in the Division of
Enforcement (“Division” or “Enforcement”) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC” or “Commission”) in the investigation of potential violations of the federal securities
laws. It contains various general policies and procedures and is intended to provide guidance
only to the staff of the Division. It is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to
create any rights, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any matter, civil
or criminal.
1.2

Origin

The Manual was prepared under the general supervision of the Division of Enforcement’s
Office of Chief Counsel (“OCC”). This Manual expresses the views and policies of the Division
of Enforcement and does not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission or any of the
individual Commissioners. OCC coordinates periodic revision of the Manual. The Manual is
intended to provide general guidance, but decisions about particular individual investigations,
cases, and charges are made based on the specific facts and circumstances presented.
1.3

Public Disclosure

The Manual is United States Government property. It is to be used in conjunction with
official SEC duties. This Manual is publicly available on line at www.sec.gov.
1.4

Fundamental Considerations

1.4.1

Mission Statement

The Division’s mission is to protect investors and the markets by investigating potential
violations of the federal securities laws and litigating the SEC’s enforcement actions. Values
integral to that mission are:
•

Integrity: acting honestly, forthrightly, and impartially in every aspect of our work.

•

Fairness: assuring that everyone receives fair and respectful treatment, without regard to
wealth, social standing, publicity, politics, or personal characteristics.

•

Commitment: recognizing the importance of and caring deeply about our mission of
protecting investors and markets.

•

Teamwork: supporting and cooperating with colleagues and other Divisions and Offices
at the SEC and fellow law enforcement professionals.

1.4.2

Updating Internal Systems

The Division uses several internal systems, including the Hub and the TCR System, to
help manage case information. The reliability and usefulness of each of the Division’s internal
systems is dependent upon timely and accurate entry of information by the staff.
1.4.3

Consultation

Although this Manual is intended to be a reference for the staff in the Division who are
responsible for investigations, no set of procedures or policies can replace the need for active and
ongoing consultation with colleagues, other Divisions and Offices at the SEC, and internal
experts. Investigations often require careful legal and technical analysis of complicated issues,
culminating in difficult decisions that may affect market participants, individuals, and issuers.
Therefore, any time an issue arises for which colleagues or other Divisions or Offices may hold
particular expertise, the staff should consider consultation. In addition, staff should keep other
Divisions and Offices informed regarding issues of interest that arise during investigations, and
consult with interested Divisions and Offices before making recommendations for action to the
Commission.
1.4.4

Ethics

Maintaining and fostering a culture of integrity and professionalism is an essential
priority for the Division. The Office of Government Ethics (“OGE”) “Standards of Ethical
Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch” lays out the basic obligation of public service:
“Each employee has a responsibility to the United States Government and its citizens to place
loyalty to the Constitution, laws and ethical principles above private gain. To ensure that every
citizen can have complete confidence in the integrity of the Federal Government, each employee
shall respect and adhere to the principles of ethical conduct . . . .” 5 C.F.R. Part 2635.101. The
SEC has a number of resources from which Division staff can obtain guidance on questions
regarding ethical conduct. Prominent among the resources available are the SEC ethics officials.
Staff should not hesitate to consult with the attorney staff in the SEC’s Ethics Office on any
question of ethics, and may consult the written Ethics Office bulletins and applicable statutes and
regulations available from the Ethics Office. Attorneys can also consult with the Commission’s
Professional Responsibility Counsel on compliance with applicable bar association rules.
Considerations:
•

If staff is uncertain about an ethical issue, staff should seek guidance from an SEC ethics
official before acting.

•

Staff should remain alert to new rules and updates posted by the Ethics Office.

•

Staff should be aware of ethical issues that may arise, including policies on:
o Confidentiality and the Protection of Nonpublic Information
o Attorney Responsibility (under the OGE Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees
of the Executive Branch, the Rules of Professional Responsibility of the state in
2

which the attorney is licensed to practice law, and the Rules of Professional
Responsibility of the state in which the attorney is appearing on behalf of the
Commission before a tribunal or otherwise engaging in such other behavior as may be
considered the practice of law under that state bar’s ethical and disciplinary rules).
o Securities Transactions by Employees
o Conflict of Interest (including Financial and Personal Interests)
o Recusals (including the one year recusal policy for Division staff)
o Referral of Professional Misconduct
o Publication Guidelines
o Gifts and Invitations
o Outside Employment and Activities
o Requirements under the Hatch Act
o Misuse of Public Office for Private Gain
o Pro Bono Activity
o Seeking and Negotiating Employment Outside the SEC

A Guide to Matters Under Inquiry (“MUIs”) and the Stages of Investigations
2.1

General Policies and Procedures

2.1.1

Ranking Investigations and Allocating Resources

Introduction:
The Division of Enforcement handles a number of investigations that vary in their size,
complexity, and programmatic importance. Devoting appropriate resources to investigations that
are more significant will help ensure high quality investigations and maximize desired program
outcomes. To make effective decisions regarding resources and priorities, on a quarterly basis
the Director of the Division or his or her designees identify matters having potential
programmatic significance, which are deemed “National Priority Matters.”
Considerations When Ranking an Investigation:
In designating an investigation a National Priority Matter, the Director or his or her
designees may consider one or more criteria, including but not limited to the following:
•

Whether the matter presents an opportunity to send a particularly strong and effective
message of deterrence, including with respect to markets, products and transactions that
are newly developing, or that are long established but which by their nature present
limited opportunities to detect wrongdoing and thus to deter misconduct.

•

Whether the matter involves particularly egregious or extensive misconduct.

•

Whether the matter involves potentially widespread and extensive harm to investors.

•

Whether the matter involves misconduct by persons occupying positions of substantial
authority or responsibility, or who owe fiduciary or other enhanced duties and obligations
to a broad group of investors or others.

•

Whether the matter involves potential wrongdoing as prohibited under newly-enacted
legislation or regulatory rules.

•

Whether the potential misconduct occurred in connection with products, markets,
transactions or practices that pose particularly significant risks for investors or a
systemically important sector of the market.

•

Whether the matter involves a substantial number of potential victims and/or particularly
vulnerable victims.

•

Whether the matter involves products, markets, transactions or practices that the Division
has identified as priority areas.

•

Whether the matter provides an opportunity to pursue priority interests shared by other
law enforcement agencies on a coordinated basis.

4

Although determining the overall significance of an investigation should take the above
factors into consideration, the ranking of an investigation is a judgment to be made based on all
of the facts and circumstances known to date.
Considerations When Allocating Resources Among Investigations:
Allocating resources among investigations requires that Associate Directors, Unit Chiefs,
and Assistant Directors 1 exercise flexibility and creativity. Associate and Assistant Directors
and Unit Chiefs will normally assign staff to more than one investigation at a time, specifying
the priorities of competing investigations so that staff members may plan their work.
Priorities among investigations may change rapidly depending on the stage of the
investigation. For example, two significant investigations may compete for resources, but staff
may be assigned to review and analyze evidence in one investigation while waiting for
documents to be produced in another investigation. Therefore, when allocating resources among
competing investigations, Associate and Assistant Directors and Unit Chiefs should take into
account not only the significance of the investigation, but the phase of the investigation,
considering, among other things:
•

Whether there is an urgent need to file an enforcement action, such as an investigation
into ongoing fraud or conduct that poses a threat of imminent harm to investors.

•

The volume of evidence that the staff must collect and review, such as trading records,
corporate documents, and e-mail correspondence.

•

The level of analysis required for complex data and evidence, such as auditor
workpapers, bluesheets, or financial data.

•

The number and locations of witnesses and the scheduling of testimony.

•

Travel requirements.

•

Timelines for preparing internal memoranda, evaluation of the case by pertinent SEC
Offices and Divisions, and the Commission’s consideration of recommendations from
Enforcement.

•

Coordination with and timing considerations of other state and federal authorities.

For investigations designated as National Priority Matters, Associate and Assistant
Directors and Unit Chiefs should consider assigning a minimum of two permanent staff attorneys
to ensure that there is continuity on the investigation in the event of absences or staff transitions.
1

“Assistant Director” is used to refer both to Assistant Directors in the Home Office and Assistant Regional
Directors in the Regional Offices. Similarly, “Associate Director” is used to refer both to Associate Directors in the
Home Office and Associate Regional Directors in the Regional Offices. The term “Unit Chief” refers to the heads
of the Division’s five national specialized units: the Asset Management Unit, the Municipal Securities and Public
Pension Unit, the Complex Financial Instruments Unit, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Unit and the Market Abuse
Unit.

5

In addition, the assignment of at least two attorneys may contribute to a collaborative approach
that improves the quality of the investigation and promotes accountability. Additional attorneys
may be assigned depending on the phase of the investigation.
2.1.2

Quarterly Reviews of Investigations and Status Updates

Introduction:
The Division has established a system of quarterly case reviews that are designed to
facilitate communication among staff members and enhance the quality and effectiveness of our
investigations. Quarterly reviews are not intended to substitute for the ongoing case meetings
and discussions between Associate Directors, Unit Chiefs, Assistant Directors and staff members
that take place in the ordinary course of investigations.
Quarterly Case Review Meetings by Assistant Directors
Each Assistant Director will conduct a quarterly case review meeting with each staff
member under the Assistant Director’s supervision. As a preliminary matter, unless a decision
has been made not to prepare an investigative plan, Assistant Directors should instruct staff
members under their supervision to prepare a written investigative plan for each active matter to
assist with case tracking and planning. The investigative plan should be shared with team
members and periodically revised, and should provide a vehicle for productive conversations
during quarterly reviews.
The purpose of the quarterly review is to ensure that investigations are proceeding on
course, to revise investigative plans as appropriate and to provide an opportunity for dialogue on
major open issues. Prior to each quarterly review, the Assistant Director should confirm that
staff members under his or her supervision have updated the Hub to reflect the current status of
each investigation listed in inventory. Suggested topics to cover during quarterly case review
meetings include:
•

Progress in meeting investigative goals and objectives for each investigation
assigned to the staff member.

•

Identification of major issues in open investigations that need further attention
or discussion.

•

Whether target deadlines are being met, and identification of causes for any
delay and development of a plan to address that delay and move the
investigation toward resolution.

•

Allocation of staff member’s time among assigned investigative matters,
matters in litigation, and other responsibilities.

•

Any other topics that the Assistant Director or staff member would like to raise
for discussion.

6

Quarterly Case Review Meetings Between Assistant Directors and Associate Directors or Unit
Chiefs
In addition, each Associate Director/Unit Chief should conduct a quarterly case review
meeting with each Assistant Director under the Associate Director/Unit Chief’s direct
supervision. These reviews should focus on significant investigations assigned to the Assistant
Director. Suggested topics to cover during these meetings include investigation status, a
discussion of any major issues presented, estimated completion time of investigation, and the
need for any assistance or additional resources to advance investigations to completion.
Quarterly Case Review Meetings Between Associate Directors/Unit Chiefs and
Director/Regional Director
Finally, the Director and/or Deputy Director should conduct a quarterly case review
meeting with each Associate Director/Unit Chief. Regional Directors also should conduct such
meetings with Associate Regional Directors in their office. Topics to be covered may include
the status of significant cases, any major issues presented, coordination with other law
enforcement agencies, estimated completion time of investigations, and the need for any
assistance or resources to advance investigations to completion.
Processes, Confirmation and Reporting
For each quarterly review period, Associate Directors/Unit Chiefs should record the
current status of each matter in inventory on a Quarterly Review Check Sheet form that will be
generated based on Hub data. Associate Directors/Unit Chiefs should return completed
Quarterly Review Check Sheet forms before the end of each calendar-year quarter to a person
designated by the Office of the Director.
Ongoing Updates to Hub System:

•

•

The assigned staff should review the investigation and periodically update in Hub the
status of an ongoing investigation.

•

The Executive Summary in Hub should summarize what the matter is about, the activity
to date, current status, and plans for the upcoming period. For example, the staff might
note that they are taking testimony, that they are conducting settlement negotiations, or
that a potential defendant has been indicted.

Any inaccurate or out-of-date information should be corrected.
2.2

Tips, Complaints, and Referrals

2.2.1

Complaints and Tips from the Public
2.2.1.1

Processing Tips and Complaints from the Public

Public complaints and tips are primarily received through the SEC’s online web form
(http://www.sec.gov/complaint.shtml) or through contact with staff at any of the SEC’s offices.

7

The vast majority of complaints and tips received by the Division are in electronic form and the
Division encourages the public to communicate with it through the online web form. Every
complaint is carefully reviewed by Division staff for apparent reliability, detail and potential
violations of the federal securities laws. After review, the complaint or tip generally is processed
according to the guidelines below.
Guidelines for Processing of Public Complaints and Tips:
•

Complaints that appear to be serious and substantial are usually forwarded to staff in the
Home Office or the appropriate regional office for more detailed review, and may result
in the opening of a MUI.

•

Complaints that relate to an existing MUI or investigation are generally forwarded to the
staff assigned to the existing matter.

•

Complaints that involve the specific expertise of another Division or Office within the
SEC are typically forwarded to staff in that particular Division or Office for further
analysis.

•

Complaints that fall within the jurisdiction of another federal or state agency may be
referred to the SEC contact at that agency. Information that may reasonably identify a
whistleblower is generally not shared with other agencies, and the staff should consult
with the Office of the Whistleblower before sharing any complaint that may contain such
information.

•

Complaints that relate to the private financial affairs of an investor or a discrete investor
group are usually forwarded to the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (“OIEA”).
Comments or questions about agency practice or the federal securities laws are also
forwarded to OIEA.

Searching the TCR System
Staff members are required to search the TCR System periodically to ensure that they are aware
of tips, complaints and referrals related to their MUIs and investigations. Staff members should
search the system as frequently as needed during an investigation and before making material
decisions about a matter, including whether to open a MUI or investigation, or add a related
party. Prior to closing a matter, staff members should use their best judgment in considering
whether to search the TCR system, taking into account whether the existence of a related TCR
potentially could affect the decision to close the matter. Staff members may request the
assignment of any related tip, complaint or referral discovered as a result of their search.
Further information:
Staff should address any questions regarding the handling of tips, complaints and
referrals to their group’s TCR point of contact.

8

2.2.1.2

Whistleblower Award Program

Section 922 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
provides that the Commission shall pay awards to eligible whistleblowers who voluntarily
provide the SEC with original information that leads to a successful enforcement action yielding
monetary sanctions of over $1 million. The award amount is required to be between 10 percent
and 30 percent of the total monetary sanctions collected in the Commission’s action or any
related action such as in a criminal case. The Dodd-Frank Act also expressly prohibits retaliation
by employers against whistleblowers and provides them with a private cause of action in the
event that they are discharged or discriminated against by their employers in violation of the Act.
Further information:
For further information on the SEC’s whistleblower award program staff should consult
the Office of the Whistleblower.
2.2.2

Other Referrals
2.2.2.1

Referrals Involving Bank Secrecy Act Material

Enacted in 1970 and amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act
(“BSA”) is designed to prevent financial institutions, including broker-dealers, from being used
as vehicles through which criminals hide the transfer of illegally obtained funds. The
recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the BSA create a paper trail for federal, state and
local law enforcement to investigate the movement of funds in money laundering and other
illegal schemes. The BSA is codified at 31 U.S.C. § 5311, et seq. The regulations implementing
the BSA are located at 31 C.F.R. Part X.
For the SEC, the primary mechanism for enforcing compliance by brokers and dealers
with the requirements of the BSA is Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(“Exchange Act”) and Rule 17a-8. Under Rule 17a-8, every registered broker or dealer must
comply with the reporting, recordkeeping and record retention provisions of 31 C.F.R. Part X. In
the investment company context, the registered “funds” must comply with Rule 38a-1 of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”). Rule 38a-1 states that funds
must adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent
violation of the “Federal Securities Laws,” which, for purposes of that rule, include the BSA.
Rule 38a-1(e)(1), 17 C.F.R. § 270.38a1(e)(1).
BSA information is highly confidential, and subject to the strict limitations set out by the
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), a bureau in the Department of the
Treasury. Enforcement staff has access to and reviews certain electronic reports filed under the
BSA.
The Division’s BSA Review Group handles, evaluates and assigns BSA information for
consideration by offices within the Commission. Enforcement staff may receive information
from the BSA Review Group about Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) or other BSA reports
that either relate to open Enforcement matters or warrant further Enforcement consideration.

9

Handling Referrals Based on Bank Secrecy Act Information
Certain BSA information, particularly SARs and related materials that would reveal the
existence of a SAR, is highly sensitive and must be handled with great care. All SAR materials
must be segregated and marked to indicate that they contain sensitive SAR information.
Further Information:
•

Staff should contact the Division’s BSA Review Group for specific information and
guidance about how to handle BSA materials properly.

•

See also Sections 3.2.9 and 4.7 of the Manual.
2.2.2.2

Referrals from the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board

The Basics of Receiving a Tip from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board:
The enforcement staff of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”)
may forward tips it receives to the staff of the Division. This is normally done through the
Enforcement Chief Accountant’s office, which makes an initial assessment regarding whether
future investigation is warranted. If the staff receives a referral through the Enforcement Chief
Accountant’s office:
•

Staff and their supervisors should notify the Enforcement Chief Accountant’s office
about obtaining documents and information regarding the tip.

•

If appropriate, staff should then get approval to open a MUI on the matter (see Section
2.3.1 of the Manual regarding Opening a MUI).

Considerations:
Consider calling the enforcement staff of the PCAOB to discuss the tip with them.
Further Information:
Please refer any questions about receiving a tip from the PCAOB to Enforcement’s Chief
Accountant.
2.2.2.3

Referrals from State Securities Regulators

The Basics of Receiving Referrals from State Securities Regulators:
State securities regulators enforce state-wide securities laws known as “blue sky laws.”
The Division receives information and referrals from state securities regulators. Most of the state
securities regulators have relationships with the SEC regional office which covers the territory in
which they are located and the state regulators direct their referrals to that office. Pursuant to
Rule 2 of the SEC’s Rules Relating to Investigations, the staff at the Assistant Director level or

10

higher can discuss nonpublic information, including whether the staff has or will commence an
investigation, with state regulatory agencies, and can show (but not release) documents. 17
C.F.R. § 203.2. See Section 5.1 of the Manual.
Considerations:
•

Staff should discuss the information received from state securities regulators promptly
with their supervisors.

•

Consider ongoing coordination with the state securities regulator, as appropriate.

Further Information:
If the opening of a MUI is appropriate, see Section 2.3.1 of the Manual.
2.2.2.4

Referrals from Congress

The Basics of Receiving a Referral from Congress:
The SEC frequently receives complaints and other information from members of
Congress on behalf of the constituents whom they represent. Most of these letters are directed to
the Office of Legislative Affairs or the Office of the Chairman and then assigned to the
appropriate SEC division or regional office. The Office of the Chairman tracks the responses to
congressional letters. As with complaints and other information received from other sources,
each complaint and tip received by the Division from Congress and congressional constituents is
carefully reviewed by staff.
Considerations:
•

Staff should not share nonpublic information, including whether the staff has or will
commence an investigation, with the complainants or members of Congress.

•

Staff should provide timely responses to congressional letters, using the appropriate
format and meeting the deadlines required by the Office of Legislative Affairs or the
Office of the Chairman.

•

If staff believes the information obtained from the congressional letter warrants the
opening of a MUI, staff should follow the instructions for opening a MUI in Section 2.3.1
of the Manual.

Further Information:
Staff should consult the Office of Legislative Affairs and the Office of the Chairman
when drafting responses to congressional correspondence.

11

2.2.2.5

Referrals from Self-Regulatory Organizations

The Basics of Receiving Referrals from Self-Regulatory Organizations:
The Division’s Office of Market Intelligence (“OMI”) is the primary point of contact for
trading-related referrals by domestic self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”). Each equity and
option exchange is responsible for monitoring its own markets and enforcing exchange rules and
regulations and the federal securities laws. If the SRO discovers potentially violative conduct
and believes that it has jurisdiction, it will conduct its own investigation. If the SRO determines
that it does not have jurisdiction, it will refer the potential violations to the SEC.
Considerations:
Consider ongoing consultation with SROs, as appropriate.
Further Information:
If the referring SRO continues with a parallel investigation, please refer to the policy on
parallel investigations in Section 3.1.4 of the Manual.
2.3

Matters Under Inquiry and Investigations

2.3.1

Opening a MUI

Introduction:
The purpose of the procedures and policies for the review and approval of new MUIs is
to help ensure efficient allocation of resources.
Opening a MUI requires that the staff assigned to a MUI (at the Assistant Director level
and below) first conduct preliminary analyses to determine: (1) whether the facts underlying the
MUI show that there is potential to address conduct that violates the federal securities laws; and
(2) whether the assignment of a MUI to a particular office will be the best use of resources for
the Division as a whole. If the preliminary analyses indicate that a MUI should be opened, then
the staff should follow the procedures below for opening a MUI within the internal system and
seeking approval of the assigned Associate Director or Regional Director. Prior to any other
considerations, the staff should consult HUB or the Name Relationship Search Index (“NRSI”)
for related investigations. Staff should also search the TCR System for related TCRs. If a
related investigation or TCR is found, the staff assigned to that investigation or TCR should be
consulted.
Prior to opening a MUI, the assigned staff (Assistant Director and below) should
determine whether the known facts show that an Enforcement investigation would have the
potential to address conduct that violates the federal securities laws. The Division receives
information from a variety of sources that may warrant the opening of a new MUI, including
newspaper articles, complaints from the public, whistleblowers, and referrals from other agencies
or SROs. Assigned staff are encouraged to use their discretion and judgment in making the
preliminary determination of whether it is appropriate to open a MUI. The considerations

12

described below are suggestions only and should not discourage the opening of a MUI based on
partial information. MUIs are preliminary in nature and typically involve incomplete
information. The threshold determination for opening a new MUI is low because the purpose of
a MUI is to gather additional facts to help evaluate whether an investigation would be an
appropriate use of resources.
To determine whether to open a MUI, the staff attorney, in conjunction with the Assistant
Director, should consider whether a sufficiently credible source or set of facts suggests that a
MUI could lead to an enforcement action that would address a violation of the federal securities
laws. Basic considerations used when making this determination may include, but are not
limited to:
• The statutes or rules potentially violated
• The egregiousness of the potential violation
• The potential magnitude of the violation
• The potential losses involved or harm to an investor or investors
• Whether the potentially harmed group is particularly vulnerable or at risk
• Whether the conduct is ongoing
• Whether the conduct can be investigated efficiently and within the statute of limitations
period
• Whether other authorities, including federal or state agencies or regulators, might be better
suited to investigate the conduct
As always, the presence or absence of US investors should not, in itself, control whether
to open a MUI. After determining that a MUI has the potential to address conduct that violates
the federal securities laws, the assigned staff should evaluate whether from a resources
standpoint, it is reasonable for their office to handle the investigation. Basic considerations used
when making this determination may include, but are not limited to:
• The location of the wrongful conduct
• The location of the potential wrongdoers
• The location of the issuer’s, entity’s, or SRO’s headquarters
• The location of most witnesses or victims
• The resources and expertise of the office
If an office believes it has compelling reasons to handle a MUI or investigation for which
another office may have a substantial nexus, it should consult with the other office to determine
13

which office should pursue the MUI or investigation. Exceptions to the general guidance
include:
• Relation to a previous investigation: If a MUI is closely related to a previous
investigation, a determination should be made whether the office that handled the previous
investigation should handle the new MUI, regardless of whether that office has a nexus to
the new MUI.
• Insufficient resources to investigate: The Home Office may open a MUI when a regional
office has a nexus if that regional office determines that it cannot devote sufficient
resources to pursuing the MUI or if the regional office has other concerns that prevent it
from pursuing the matter.
If it later becomes clear that the MUI or investigation is centered in a specific region,
consideration should be given to referring the investigation to that regional office, depending on
available staff in the regional office and the stage of the investigation. In some situations, such
as where witnesses are dispersed or where an office has special expertise, it may make sense for
staff from more than one office to work together on a matter.
Procedures for Opening a MUI:
(1) To open a MUI: Log into Hub and select “Open a MUI/INV.”
(2) Fill out the required and other applicable fields to request the opening of a MUI, including
a MUI Opening Narrative, primary classification, origin, etc. Click Submit.
(3) The request will be routed to the designated Associate Director/Regional Director/Unit
Chief for consideration.
(4) The Associate Director/Regional Director/Unit Chief should review the request promptly
and, if satisfied that the MUI has the potential to address violative conduct, approve the
opening of the MUI in Hub.
(5) Senior officers will receive a weekly report of all MUIs opened during the prior week.
Considerations:
As a general matter, MUIs should be closed or converted to an investigation within sixty
days. Staff should follow the policies and procedures for closing a MUI, or converting a MUI, in
Section 2.3.2 of this Manual.
Further Information:
For more information on filling out MUI forms, please check for instructions on the
internal tracking systems or contact a Case Management Specialist.

2.3.2

Opening an Investigation and Converting or Closing a MUI

Introduction:
Investigations are opened in two ways: (1) the investigation is opened when a MUI is
converted to an investigation, or (2) an investigation is opened independent of a MUI. In both
cases, the opening of an investigation requires that the assigned staff (at the Assistant Director
level and below) conduct an evaluation of the facts to determine the investigation’s potential to
address conduct that violates the federal securities laws. The analysis for whether to convert a
MUI to an investigation, or open an investigation, differs from the analysis for whether to open a
MUI. While a MUI can be opened on the basis of very limited information, an investigation
generally should be opened after the assigned staff has done some additional informationgathering and analysis. It may also be appropriate at this time to revisit whether the office has a
nexus to the MUI.
Analysis: Will the Investigation Have the Potential to Substantively and Effectively Address
Violative Conduct?
The assigned staff, in consultation with the assigned Associate Director, should evaluate
the information gathered to determine whether it is an appropriate use of resources to open an
investigation (either through conversion of the MUI or independent of a MUI). While the
threshold analysis for opening a MUI is relatively low, determining whether the MUI should be
converted to an investigation or whether to open an investigation is typically a more detailed
evaluation that is based on additional information.
The evaluation for whether to convert a MUI to an investigation (or open an
investigation) turns on whether, and to what extent, the investigation has the potential to address
violative conduct. Threshold issues to consider when evaluating the facts include:
(1) Do the facts suggest a possible violation of the federal securities laws involving fraud or
other serious misconduct?
(2) If yes, is an investment of resources by the staff merited by:
(a) the magnitude or nature of the violation,
(b) the size of the victim group,
(c) the amount of potential or actual losses to investors,
(d) for potential insider trading, the amount of profits or losses avoided, or
(e) for potential financial reporting violations, materiality?
(3) If yes, is the conduct:
(a) ongoing, or

15

(b) within the statute of limitations period?
In addition to the threshold issues identified above, one way to determine whether the conduct is
serious is to consider the following supplemental factors:
• Is there a need for immediate action to protect investors?
• Does the conduct affect the fairness or liquidity of the U.S. securities markets?
• Does the case involve a recidivist?
• Has the SEC or Division designated the subject matter to be a priority?
• Does the case fulfill a programmatic goal of the SEC and the Division?
• Does the case involve a possibly widespread industry practice that should be addressed?
• Does the matter give the SEC an opportunity to be visible in a community that might not
otherwise be familiar with the SEC or the protections afforded by the securities laws?
• Does the case present a good opportunity to cooperate with other civil and criminal
agencies?
As always, the presence or absence of US investors should not, in itself, control whether
to open an investigation.
Considerations:
Assigned staff is encouraged to revisit whether the office still has a sufficient nexus under
the new facts learned during the period of the MUI. If the facts have changed, assigned staff
should consider whether it is appropriate to contact another office that may be better suited to
handle the investigation.
Procedures for Converting a MUI to an Investigation:
As a general matter, MUIs should be closed or converted to an investigation within sixty
days as follows:
(1) The assigned staff, in consultation with an assigned senior officer as necessary, should
evaluate the facts gathered during the MUI, using the factors listed above, to determine
whether, and to what extent, the investigation will have the potential to address violative
conduct.
(2) If it is determined that it is appropriate to proceed with the investigation, then the
assigned staff should request approval to convert the MUI to an investigation in Hub by
completing an Investigation Opening Narrative and clicking Convert. The request will be
routed to the designated Associate Director/Regional Director/Unit Chief for
consideration.

16

(3) The Associate Director/Regional Director/Unit Chief should review the request promptly,
and, if satisfied that an investigation has the potential to address violative conduct,
approve the conversion of the MUI to an investigation in Hub.
(4) If the assigned staff, in consultation with an assigned Associate Director/Regional
Director/Unit Chief, determines that the investigation does not have the potential to
address violative conduct, or there is another reason that the investigation would be an
inappropriate use of resources, then the assigned staff, in consultation with the assigned
Associate Director/Regional Director/Unit Chief, should close the MUI. To close the
MUI, the assigned staff should enter a closing narrative in Hub explaining why the matter
is being closed and request that their Case Management Specialist designate the MUI
closed in Hub.
Procedures for Opening an Investigation, Independent of a MUI:
In certain circumstances, it is appropriate to open an investigation without having opened
a MUI (for example, in a case in which emergency action is necessary). To do so:
•

Log into Hub and select “Open a MUI/INV.”

•

Fill out the required and other applicable fields to request opening of an Investigation,
including an Opening Narrative, primary classification, origin, etc. Click Submit.

•

The request will be routed to the designated Associate Director/Regional Director/Unit
Chief for consideration.

•

The Associate Director/Regional Director/Unit Chief should review the request promptly,
and, if satisfied that the investigation has the potential to address violative conduct,
approve the opening of the investigation in Hub.

•

Senior officers will receive a weekly report of all investigations opened independent of a
MUI during the prior week.
2.3.3

Formal Orders of Investigation

The federal securities laws authorize the SEC, or any officer designated by the SEC, to
issue subpoenas requiring a witness to provide documents and testimony under oath. See,
Section 19(c) of the Securities Act, Section 21(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, Section 209(b)
of the Advisers Act, and Section 42(b) of the Investment Company Act. The Commission
designates members of the staff to act as officers of the Commission in an investigation by
issuing a Formal Order of Investigation (“formal order”).
2.3.4

Formal Order Process

Introduction:
Pursuant to delegated authority, certain senior officers of the Division (including the
Director, Deputy Director, Chief Counsel, Chief Litigation Counsel and all supervisors
17

responsible for Enforcement matters at or above the level of Associate Director or Associate
Regional Director) may, in their discretion, issue a formal order when a formal investigation is
appropriate and necessary to determine whether a violation of the federal securities laws may
have occurred or may be occurring. The formal order serves two important functions. First, it
generally describes the nature of the investigation that has been authorized, and second, it
designates specific staff members to act as officers for the purposes of the investigation and
empowers them to administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their
attendance, take evidence, and require the production of documents and other materials. Formal
investigative proceedings are nonpublic unless otherwise ordered by the Commission.
Basics of the Formal Order Process:
The Commission has delegated authority to issue formal orders to the Director of the
Division of Enforcement. This authority was sub-delegated to additional senior officers in the
Division. To seek a formal order of investigation, staff should draft a memo for review by the
senior officer, as well as a proposed order. If authorized by the senior officer, the formal order
will be issued by the Office of the Secretary. A MUI should be converted to an investigation in
HUB before issuance of a formal order.
2.3.4.1

Supplementing a Formal Order

Once a formal order has been issued, the Division has delegated authority to issue
supplemental orders naming additional staff members as officers empowered to act pursuant to
the order or removing previously named staff. 17 C.F.R. § 200.30-4(a)(1) and (4). A supervisor
at the Assistant Director level or above may authorize the Division’s issuance of a supplemental
order.
2.3.4.2

Requests for a Copy of the Formal Order

Basics:
Rule 7(a) of the SEC’s Rules Relating to Investigations provides that a person who is
compelled or requested to furnish documentary evidence or testimony at a formal investigative
proceeding shall, upon request, be shown the Commission’s formal order. However, a copy of
the formal order shall not be furnished to that person for their retention without the express
approval of a Division official at the level of Assistant Director or higher. 17 C.F.R. § 203.7(a).
Procedures for Responding to a Request for a Copy of the Formal Order:
When a member of the staff receives a request for a copy of the formal order, staff should
keep in mind the following procedures when determining whether the request should be granted:
•

The request must be made by a person or counsel for a person who has been asked to
furnish documents or testimony in the formal investigation for which the person is
requesting a copy of the formal order.

•

The request for a copy of the formal order must be in writing. A copy of the formal order
may not be provided on the basis of an oral request. Therefore, staff should advise the
18

person to submit their request in writing to the Assistant Director assigned to the
investigation.
•

The written request for the formal order must include representations to show that
approval of the request is “consistent both with the protection of privacy of persons
involved in the investigation and with the unimpeded conduct of the investigation.” 17
C.F.R. § 203.7(a).

•

Only an Assistant Director or higher level Division official may approve a written request
for a copy of a formal order. There may be circumstances that warrant denial of the
request, such as when there is evidence that the requester intends to use the formal order
for purposes outside the representation in the matter, or does not intend to keep the
formal order confidential.

•

Keep in mind that even if a request for a copy of the formal order is denied, a requesting
person who is compelled or requested to furnish documentary evidence or testimony at a
formal investigative proceeding is still entitled to review the formal order without
retaining a copy. 17 C.F.R. § 203.7.
2.4

The Wells Process

The Commission’s Wells Rule
Rule 5(c) of the SEC’s Rules on Informal and Other Procedures states that “[p]ersons
who become involved in . . . investigations may . . . submit a written statement to the
Commission setting forth their interests and position in regard to the subject matter of the
investigation.” The rule further provides that, “[u]pon request, the staff, in its discretion, may
advise such persons of the general nature of the investigation, including the indicated violations
as they pertain to them, and the amount of time that may be available for preparing and
submitting a statement prior to the presentation of a staff recommendation to the Commission for
the commencement of an administrative or injunction proceeding.” 17 C.F.R. § 202.5(c).
The practice reflected in Rule 5(c) evolved from recommendations made by an advisory
committee chaired by John Wells. The objective of the practice is, as the Commission stated in
the original Wells Release, for the Commission “not only to be informed of the findings made by
its staff but also, where practicable and appropriate, to have before it the position of persons
under investigation at the time it is asked to consider enforcement action.” See Securities Act of
1933 Release No. 5310, “Procedures Relating to the Commencement of Enforcement
Proceedings and Termination of Staff Investigations.” As the Commission stated in the Release,
“[t]he Commission, however, is also conscious of its responsibility to protect the public interest.
It cannot place itself in a position where, as a result of the establishment of formal procedural
requirements, it would lose its ability to respond to violative activities in a timely fashion.” The
Commission made clear in the Release that the practice is “informal” and involves the exercise
of discretion by the staff.

19

The Wells Notice:
A Wells notice is a communication from the staff to a person involved in an investigation
that: (1) informs the person the staff has made a preliminary determination to recommend that
the Commission file an action or institute a proceeding against them; (2) identifies the securities
law violations that the staff has preliminarily determined to include in the recommendation; and
(3) provides notice that the person may make a submission to the Division and the Commission
concerning the proposed recommendation.
Providing a Wells Notice:
The staff is required to obtain an Associate Director or Regional Director’s approval
before issuing a Wells notice or determining to recommend an enforcement action without
issuing a Wells notice.
As the Commission explained in the Wells Release, it has a “responsibility to protect the
public interest” and “often is called upon to act under circumstances which require immediate
action if the interests of investors or the public interest are to be protected.” To determine
whether or when to provide a Wells notice, staff should consider all of the relevant facts and
circumstances, including but not limited to:
•

Whether the investigation is substantially complete as to the recipient of the Wells notice.

•

Whether immediate enforcement action is necessary for the protection of investors. If
prompt enforcement action is necessary to protect investors, providing a Wells notice and
waiting for a submission may not be practical (for example, a recommendation to file an
emergency action requesting a temporary restraining order and asset freeze to stop an
ongoing fraud).

•

Whether providing a Wells notice may alert potential defendants to a possible asset
freeze or otherwise put at risk investor funds that the recommendation is intended to
protect.

•

Whether there is a parallel criminal investigation that may be adversely affected by
providing a Wells notice.

The Content of the Wells Notice:
A Wells notice should be in writing when possible. If a Wells notice is given orally, it
should be followed promptly by a written confirmation. If the staff intends to provide a written
Wells notice, the staff may give advance notice of the intention to the recipient or his or her
counsel by telephone. As in a Wells notice, the substance of a Wells call should follow the
general guidance below, but the staff also may refer to specific evidence regarding the facts and
circumstances that form the basis for the staff’s recommendation.
The written Wells notice or written confirmation of an oral Wells notice should:

20

•

Identify the specific charges the staff has made a preliminary determination to
recommend to the Commission.

•

Accord the recipient of the Wells notice the opportunity to provide a voluntary statement,
in writing or on videotape, setting forth the recipient’s position with respect to the
proposed recommendation, which in the recipient’s discretion may include arguments
why the Commission should not bring an action or why proposed charges or remedies
should not be pursued, or bring any relevant facts to the Commission’s attention in
connection with its consideration of the matter.

•

Set reasonable limitations on the length of any submission made by the recipient
(typically, written submissions should be limited to 40 pages, not including exhibits, and
video submissions should not exceed 12 minutes), as well as the time period allowed for
the recipient to submit a voluntary statement in response to the Wells notice.

•

Advise the recipient that any submission should be addressed to the appropriate Assistant
Director.

•

Inform the recipient that any Wells submission may be used by the Commission in any
action or proceeding that it brings and may be discoverable by third parties in accordance
with applicable law.

•

Include a link to a copy of the Wells Release, Securities Act Release No. 5310, which is
posted on the Commission’s website at: http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/wellsrelease.pdf.

•

Include a link to (or attach a copy of) the SEC’s Form 1662 (“Supplemental Information
for Persons Requested to Supply Information Voluntarily or Directed to Supply
Information Pursuant to a Commission Subpoena”), which is posted on the Commission’s
website at: http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/sec1662.pdf.

Acceptance of a Wells Submission:
As discussed above, a Wells notice informs a recipient that they may make a voluntary
submission to the Commission regarding the Division’s proposed recommendation. However,
there are limited circumstances in which the staff may reject a Wells submission:
•

If the Wells submission exceeds the limitations on length specified in the Wells notice,
the staff may reject the submission.

•

If the Wells submission is submitted after the deadline, including any extensions of time
granted by the staff, the staff may reject the submission. Requests for extensions of time
should be made in writing, clearly state the basis for the request, and be directed to the
appropriate Assistant Director. The staff may determine not to grant a Wells notice
recipient’s request for an extension of time.

21

•

The staff may reject a Wells submission if the person making the submission seeks to
limit its admissibility under Federal Rule of Evidence 408 or the Commission’s ability to
use the submission for the purposes described in Form 1662.

•

The staff may reject a Wells submission if the submission contains or discusses a
settlement offer. Offers of settlement should not be combined with, or included in, Wells
submissions, and instead may be made in a separate document.

Wells submissions that are accepted by the staff will be provided to the Commission
along with any recommendation from the staff for an enforcement action against the recipient of
the Wells notice. Wells submissions that are rejected on one of the bases above generally will
not be provided to the Commission
The Post-Notice Wells Process:
• Recipients of Wells notices occasionally request to review portions of the staff’s
investigative file. On a case-by-case basis, the staff has discretion to allow the recipient of
the notice to review portions of the investigative file that are not privileged. In considering
a request for access to portions of the staff’s investigative file, the staff should keep in
mind, among other things:
• Whether access to portions of the file would be a productive way for both the staff and
the recipient of the Wells notice to assess the strength of the evidence that forms the
basis for the staff’s proposed recommendations.
• Whether the prospective defendant or respondent failed to cooperate, invoked his Fifth
Amendment rights, or otherwise refused to provide information during the
investigation.
• The stage of the investigation with regard to other persons or witnesses, including
whether certain witnesses have yet to provide testimony, and whether there is a
parallel criminal or regulatory investigation or proceeding that may be adversely
affected by granting access to the staff’s file.
• Recipients of Wells notices may request meetings with the staff to discuss the substance of
the staff’s proposed recommendation to the Commission. Assigned staff should consult
with supervisors if a request is made. A Wells recipient generally will not be accorded
more than one post-Wells notice meeting.
• The staff may engage in appropriate settlement discussions with the recipient of the Wells
notice. However, the staff may choose to inform the recipient that the staff will not engage
in ongoing settlement discussions that would delay timely consideration of the matter by
the Commission.
Further Information:
Staff should consult with OCC concerning any questions relating to the Wells process.

22

2.5

Enforcement Recommendations

2.5.1

The Action Memo Process

The filing or institution of any enforcement action must be authorized by the
Commission. In addition, while the Commission has delegated certain authority to the Division
Director or the Secretary, most settlements of previously authorized enforcement actions, as well
as certain other aspects of civil litigation, among other things, require Commission authorization.
Staff should consult with senior managers, OCC, and, if appropriate, OGC, before taking action
to ensure that proper authorization is requested.
Commission authorization is sought by submitting an action memorandum to the
Commission that sets forth a Division recommendation and provides a comprehensive
explanation of the recommendation’s factual and legal foundation.
Prior to submitting an action memorandum to the Commission, staff should solicit review
and comment from OCC, OGC, and other interested Divisions or Offices.
2.5.2

Commission Authorization

After the Division presents a recommendation to the Commission, the Commission will
consider the recommendation and vote on whether to approve or reject the recommendation.
The Commission’s consideration of the recommendation takes place in a closed Commission
meeting, by seriatim consideration, or by Duty Officer consideration.
Before any recommendation is considered by the Commission, the staff must identify the
counsel representing the subjects of the proposed enforcement action, so that the Commissioners
may determine whether to recuse themselves from considering the matter.
2.5.2.1

Closed Meetings

The Commission considers and votes on some of the Division’s recommendations in
“closed meetings,” which are meetings that the Commission, pursuant to exemptions in the
Government in the Sunshine Act (“Sunshine Act”), 5 U.S.C. § 552b, has voted to close to the
public. For each matter which will be considered in a closed meeting, the staff prepares a
Sunshine Act certification, to be signed by the General Counsel of the Commission, certifying
that the matter falls within one of the exemptions provided by the Sunshine Act and the
Commission’s Sunshine Act regulations, 17 C.F.R. § 200.402(a). Generally, recommendations
that are eligible to be considered at a closed meeting include recommendations to institute,
modify, or settle an enforcement action or to consider an offer of settlement or other proposed
disposition of an enforcement action.
At a closed meeting, Division staff orally presents a recommendation to the Commission
and answers any questions before the Commission votes on the recommendation. Except in
unusual circumstances, the Commissioners receive a copy of the Division’s written
recommendation prior to the closed meeting. Staff should be prepared to answer the questions
that are likely to be asked by the Commissioners and should contact the Commissioners’ offices
prior to the meeting to learn of any particular concerns or questions about the recommendation.
23

2.5.2.2

Seriatim Consideration

If the Chairman or the Duty Officer (see Section 2.5.2.3 of the Manual), determines that
consideration of a recommendation at a closed meeting is “unnecessary in light of the nature of
the matter, impracticable, or contrary to the requirements of agency business,” but that the
recommendation should be the subject of a vote by the entire Commission, the recommendation
may be acted upon separately by each Commissioner in turn – in other words, by seriatim
consideration. 17 C.F.R. § 200.42.
Seriatim consideration is often used when the date of a closed meeting is too distant to
meet the timing needs of a particular recommendation, or the matter is routine. Matters that
urgently require action before the next available closed meeting, but raise issues sufficient to
warrant consideration by the entire Commission, may circulate on an expedited basis for rapid
seriatim consideration. Staff should consult OCC and OS for the specific procedures required
for submitting seriatim items.
Each participating Commissioner will report his or her vote on the recommendation to
the Secretary of the Commission, using a seriatim coversheet prepared by the staff and approved
by the Secretary. Even if a majority of the Commission has voted in favor of a seriatim
recommendation, the matter is not authorized until each Commissioner has either recorded a vote
or indicated that he or she is not participating. Any member of the Commission may pull a
recommendation from seriatim circulation and instead place it on a closed meeting agenda for
further consideration.
2.5.2.3

Duty Officer Consideration

The Commission delegates one of its members (other than the Chairman) as the Duty
Officer on a rotating basis, empowering the Duty Officer to act, in his or her discretion, on behalf
of the entire Commission when urgent action is required before a recommendation can be
considered at a closed meeting or by seriatim. 17 C.F.R. § 200.43. All decisions of the Duty
Officer subsequently circulate among the other Commissioners for affirmation.
Generally, requests for Duty Officer consideration should result from an unavoidable and
pressing external need. Typically, Duty Officer consideration is sought when the staff has
recently become aware of imminent potential harm to investors, and the Division intends to
recommend an emergency enforcement action, such as an immediate trading suspension or a
civil action for a temporary restraining order. Duty Officer consideration should, as a general
matter, not be sought where an enforcement recommendation presents close legal issues
regarding jurisdiction or liability. Additionally, Duty Officer consideration is generally not an
appropriate means to obtain approval of a proposed settlement. Staff should consult with OCC
and OS to determine if Duty Officer consideration might be appropriate.
2.5.3

Delegations of Commission Authority

The Commission has delegated certain limited aspects of its authority to the various
Divisions and Offices, including delegations to the Director of the Division of Enforcement to
issue formal orders of investigation, submit witness immunity order requests and file subpoena

24

enforcement actions, and to the Secretary of the Commission to issue orders instituting or
settling certain administrative proceedings. 17 C.F.R. § 200.30, et seq.
Formal Orders of Investigation:
To expedite the investigative process, the Commission has delegated authority to the
Director of the Division to issue formal orders. 17 C.F.R. § 200.30-4(a)(13). This authority was
sub-delegated to additional senior staff in the Division (Deputy Director, Chief Counsel, Chief
Litigation Counsel and supervisors responsible for enforcement matters at or above the level of
Associate Director or Associate Regional Director).
Witness Immunity Order Requests:
To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its investigations, the Commission has
delegated authority to the Director of the Division to submit witness immunity order requests to
the Department of Justice with respect to individuals who have provided or have the potential to
provide substantial assistance in the Commission’s investigations and related enforcement
actions. 17 C.F.R. § 200.30-4(a)(14). This authority was sub-delegated to senior officers in the
Division.
Subpoena Enforcement Actions:
If a person or entity refuses to comply with a subpoena issued by the staff pursuant to a
formal order of investigation, the Commission may file a subpoena enforcement action in federal
district court, seeking an order compelling compliance. See Section 21(c) of the Exchange Act.
The Commission has delegated the authority to file such an action to the Director of the
Division. 17 C.F.R. § 200.30-4(10). This authority was sub-delegated to senior officers in the
Division.
Follow-on Administrative Proceedings:
The Commission has delegated authority to the Secretary of the Commission to issue
certain orders in administrative proceedings. 17 C.F.R. § 200.30-7. Most significantly, the
Secretary may issue orders instituting previously authorized “follow-on” administrative
proceedings to determine whether barring a person from association with a broker-dealer or
investment adviser is appropriate based on the entry of a civil injunction or criminal conviction
against that person. The Secretary may also, pursuant to delegated authority, enter an order
imposing an unqualified bar (i.e., a bar that does not provide a right to reapply after a specified
period) in such cases, if the respondent consents. 17 C.F.R. § 200.30-7(12).
In practical terms, this means that it is not necessary to prepare an action memorandum
recommending that the Commission institute an order to impose follow-on administrative relief
under Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act or Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of
1940 (“Advisers Act”) if: (1) the Commission previously authorized a “follow-on”
administrative proceeding as part of a prior recommendation, and (2) the injunction or criminal
conviction has been entered. Further, the Commission has delegated authority to the Secretary to
institute a settled order if the person consents to the full administrative relief authorized by the
Commission (an unqualified bar). Because it is critically important to determine that the
25

conditions above have been met and that the order to be issued falls clearly within the
Secretary’s delegated authority, staff should consult with OCC and OS before submitting an
order for issuance pursuant to delegated authority.
2.6

Closing an Investigation

2.6.1

Policies and Procedures

Basics:
Properly closing an investigation is an important part of managing investigations and
making the best use of our resources. Closing investigations where there has been enforcement
action is relatively easy; the staff simply makes sure that it has followed through on every step
authorized by the Commission. Closing investigations where no enforcement action will be
recommended can be a harder judgment call. The staff is encouraged to close an investigation as
soon as it becomes apparent that no enforcement action will be recommended. Staff is
encouraged to make this decision when appropriate so that resources can be redirected to
investigations that will be more productive.
Generally, factors that should be considered in deciding whether to close an investigation
include:
•

the seriousness of the conduct and potential violations

•

the staff resources available to pursue the investigation

•

the sufficiency and strength of the evidence

•

the extent of potential investor harm if an action is not commenced

•

the age of the conduct underlying the potential violations

As always, the presence or absence of U.S. investors should not, in itself, control whether to
close an investigation.
Considerations:
Once a decision has been made to close an investigation, there are several steps that the
staff must take. These steps create the official record and ensure that documents obtained during
the investigation are handled properly:
•

Check with the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) Office. If the FOIA office
determines that records should be retained, they will advise the staff on the proper
disposition of the case files. For example, the staff may be asked to include records
subject to a pending FOIA request in the files going to storage even though the records
would otherwise not have to be retained after the case is closed.

•

Determine whether any current litigation hold notices apply to the case files.

26

•

If the FOIA office does not indicate a need for retention and there are no applicable
litigation hold notices, the staff may prepare the files for disposition.

•

Prepare a closing recommendation. The closing recommendation is a short memorandum
and serves as the basic historical record summarizing what the staff did in the
investigation and action.

•

Prepare the files for disposition. Remember that electronic records obtained or generated
during the investigation will also require proper disposition.

•

Prepare and send appropriate termination notices.

An investigation that has resulted in an enforcement action cannot be closed until all
enforcement actions in the case are complete. This requires (1) a final judgment or Commission
order and (2) all ordered monetary relief is accounted for, meaning:
•

all disgorgement and civil penalties have been paid in full or the Commission has
authorized the staff to terminate collection of any unpaid amounts;

•

all funds collected have either been distributed to investors or paid into the Treasury; and

•

all money has been properly recorded.

Further, an investigation cannot be closed if any debts of a defendant or respondent are
the subject of collection activity by the Commission or on the Commission’s behalf (e.g., by the
Department of the Treasury’s Financial Management Service or the Department of Justice), or if
any funds are being held pending final distribution.
Further Information:
Staff should contact OCC with questions about closing a case.
2.6.2

Termination Notices

Basics:
The Division’s policy is to notify individuals and entities at the earliest opportunity when
the staff has determined not to recommend an enforcement action against them to the
Commission. This notification takes the form of a termination letter. The staff may send
termination letters to individuals or entities before the investigation is closed and before a
determination has been made as to every potential defendant or respondent. Termination letters
should be sent regardless of whether the investigation was pursuant to a formal order.
A termination letter must be sent to anyone who:
•

is identified in the caption of the formal order;

•

submitted or was solicited to submit a Wells submission;

27

•

asks for such a notice (assuming the staff has decided that no enforcement
recommendation will be recommended against that person or entity); or

•

to the staff’s knowledge, reasonably believes that the staff was considering
recommending an enforcement action against them.

The Director, Deputy Director, or appropriate Unit Chief, Deputy Unit Chief (if a Senior
Officer), Associate Director, or Associate Regional Director must approve any decision not to
send a termination letter to persons or entities that fall into any of the above categories. The
termination letter should be signed by staff at the Assistant Director level or above and a copy of
the Commission’s Wells Release (Securities Act Release No. 5310), which authorized
termination notices, should be referenced in each termination letter. As noted in the
Commission’s Wells Release, the provision of a termination notice “must in no way be construed
as indicating that the party has been exonerated or that no action may ultimately result from the
staff’s investigation of that particular matter. All that such a communication means is that the
staff has completed its investigation and that at that time no enforcement action has been
recommended to the Commission.”
Considerations:
Staff should also consider sending termination letters to companies who provided
information concerning their securities in connection with insider trading investigations.

A Guide to Investigative Practices
3.1

Special Considerations

3.1.1 External Communications Between Senior Enforcement Officials and
Persons Outside the SEC Who Are Involved in Investigations
Introduction:
The purpose of these best practices is to ensure that external communications between
senior enforcement officials (at the Associate Director level and above) and persons outside the
SEC are handled with the appropriate care, sensitivity and transparency. These best practices
concern only external communications that are: (1) material; (2) relate to ongoing, active
investigations; and (3) occur between senior enforcement officials and persons outside the SEC
who are involved with investigations (other than persons at agencies or organizations with which
the SEC cooperates).
Staff at all levels of the Division of Enforcement play an essential role in seeking and
receiving the information required to discharge their investigative and decision-making
responsibilities, and it is important that outside persons involved in investigations feel that they
may contact the staff in the Division without hesitation, including senior officials. In fact, a
senior official may obtain particularly valuable information through material external
communications. To present one consistent Division position to persons involved in
investigations, and continue to maintain the Division’s impartiality and history of handling
investigations with integrity, senior officials should take into consideration the best practices
28

described below. Underlying these best practices is the recognition of the importance of the
investigative team’s responsibility to gather evidence, raise questions, and manage relationships
with outside persons during an investigation. The best practices reflect the practical realities of
the teamwork required by all staff involved in an investigation (from staff attorney to the most
senior official), while taking into account the flexibility necessary to engage in communications
in situations and under circumstances that may present unforeseen variables.
Best Practices:
These best practices should be applied to all situations in which senior officials engage in
material communications with persons outside the SEC relating to ongoing, active investigations:
•

Generally, senior officials are encouraged to include other staff members on the
investigative team when engaging in material external communications, and should try to
avoid initiating communications without the knowledge or participation of at least one of
the other staff members. However, “participation” could include either having another
staff member present during the communications, or having a staff member involved in
preparing the senior official for the communications. For example, if the investigative
team believes that a communication could be more productive as a one-on-one
communication between the senior official and the outside person, members of the team
could participate by discussing the case with the senior official prior to the meeting, or
assisting in preparing talking points for the senior official to use during the
communication.

•

Although senior officials are encouraged to include other staff members on the
investigative team when engaging in a communication, there are circumstances in which
none of the staff members are available to participate when an outside person initiates a
communication. Under those circumstances, the senior official may need to balance
several factors to determine whether to entertain the communication without the
participation of other staff members, including:
o Whether the senior official is familiar with the context and facts that are the
subject of the communication;
o Whether the investigative team is aware that the outside person planned to initiate
a communication with the senior official;
o Whether the outside person had previously discussed the matter with others on the
investigative team (and how the team responded);
o Whether the senior official was briefed by the investigative team regarding the
communication; and
o Whether the communication involves a matter of urgency, a routine issue, or a
more complex situation in which the outside person is seeking an agreement or
representation regarding a material aspect of the investigation.

29

•

If a senior official entertains a communication without the participation or presence of
other staff members, then the senior official should indicate to the outside person that the
senior official will be informing other members of the investigative team of the fact of
the communication, along with any pertinent details, for their information and
consideration, and should consider:
o Indicating to the outside person that the fact that the senior official is entertaining
the communication does not imply acquiescence or agreement; and
o Indicating to the outside person that the senior official is not in a position to reach
an agreement or make a representation without reviewing the circumstances with
other investigative team members (however, the senior official need not avoid
reaching an agreement or making representations if any of the staff prepared the
senior official for the communication in anticipation that agreements or
representations might be discussed).

•

Within a reasonable amount of time, the senior official should document material
external communications related to the investigation involving, but not limited to,
potential settlements, strength of the evidence, and charging decisions. The official may
take contemporaneous notes of the communication, send an e-mail to any of the assigned
staff, prepare a memo to the file, or orally report details to any of the assigned staff (who
may then take notes or prepare a memo to the file).

•

The senior official should at all times keep in mind the need to preserve the impartiality
of the Division in conducting its fact-finding and information-gathering functions.
Propriety, fairness, and objectivity in investigations are of the utmost importance, and the
investigative team cannot carry out its responsibilities appropriately unless these
principles are strictly maintained. The senior official should be particularly sensitive that
an external communication may appear to be or has the potential to be an attempt to
supersede the investigative team’s judgment and experience.

Considerations:
•

There may be circumstances in which a senior official and an outside person find it
necessary to discuss the professionalism of assigned staff or allegations regarding
questionable conduct by the assigned staff. Even if the communication could be
considered a material communication about the investigation itself, the senior official
may choose not to inform any of the assigned staff about the communication. The senior
official, however, should be sensitive to the possibility that allegations about questionable
conduct may serve as a pretext to complain about minor events or annoyances during the
investigative process, to gain an advantage in the investigation or to undermine the
progress of the investigation. Depending on the apparent motivation of the
communication, the senior official should consider whether to inform the staff of the
communication, following the best practices above.

•

If any of the investigative team members learn that a person outside the SEC might
contact a senior official, the staff member should alert the senior official as soon as

30

possible and provide all pertinent details concerning the anticipated subject matter of the
communication.
•

In addition to the best practices above and the typical considerations that apply when an
SEC employee communicates with someone outside the agency involved in an
enforcement investigation, senior officials and other investigative team members should
recognize the discretion and judgment inherent in balancing all the circumstances of a
potential communication with outside persons, including:

•

the time, place, and context of the communication;

•

the availability and accessibility of any of the assigned staff to participate in the
communication;

•

the expected or anticipated subject matter of the communication ;

•

the priority, phase and sensitivity of the investigation, including the status of the Wells
process or any pending settlement discussions;

•

the complexity and circumstances of the suspected securities law violations at issue;

•

the need to further the Commission’s interests in the investigation and in the protection of
investors;

•

the level of cooperation of witnesses and their counsel; and

•

the existence of criminal interest.

Further Information:
For questions concerning the applicability of these best practices, staff should contact
OCC.
3.1.2

Statutes of Limitations and Tolling Agreements

Basics:
•

28 U.S.C. § 2462 states that “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by Act of Congress, an
action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture,
pecuniary or otherwise, shall not be entertained unless commenced within five years from
the date when the claim first accrued if, within the same period, the offender or the
property is found within the United States in order that proper service may be made
thereon.” The statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that is waived if it is not
raised in timely fashion. See Canady v. SEC, 230 F.3d 362, 363 (D.C. Cir. 2000).

•

If the assigned staff investigating potential violations of the federal securities laws
believes that any of the relevant conduct arguably may be outside the five-year
limitations period before the SEC would be able to file or institute an enforcement action,
31

the staff may ask the potential defendant or respondent to sign a “tolling agreement.”
Such requests are occasionally made in the course of settlement negotiations to allow
time for sharing of information in furtherance of reaching a settlement. By signing a
tolling agreement, the potential defendant or respondent agrees not to assert a statute of
limitations defense in the enforcement action for a specified time period. A tolling
agreement must be signed by staff at the Assistant Director level or above. Tolling
agreements may not be entered without the approval of the Director of Enforcement.
Considerations:
•

Consider the statute of limitations issue early in the investigation.

•

Take into account the amount of time needed for third parties to complete Wells
submissions, for staff to prepare recommendations to the Commission, for interested
Divisions and Offices at the SEC to review recommendations, and for the Commission to
consider the recommendation.

•

Staff should take care not to delay or slow the pace of an investigation based on the
potential availability or existence of a tolling agreement. Swift investigations generally
are most effective and enhance the public interest.

•

28 U.S.C. § 2462 sets forth a five year statute of limitations, but certain conduct or
circumstances may have tolled the statute, depending on the common law developed in a
particular jurisdiction. In such situations, staff should contact a member of the Division’s
trial unit or OCC for further information.

•

Keep in mind that certain claims are not subject to the five-year statute of limitations
under Section 2462, including claims for injunctive relief and disgorgement.
3.1.3

Investigations During Ongoing SEC Litigation

Basics:
The Division may continue to investigate and issue investigative subpoenas pursuant to a
formal order of investigation while simultaneously litigating a related civil action if there is an
independent, good-faith basis for the continued investigation. An independent, good-faith basis
may include the possible involvement of additional persons or entities in the violations alleged in
the complaint, or additional potential violations by one or more of the defendants in the
litigation.
Considerations:
While the SEC has broad investigative authority, Division staff should exercise judgment
when deciding whether to continue investigating while litigating a related case. The staff should
consider the following:
•

In assessing whether to issue subpoenas, the staff should consider all relevant facts and
circumstances, including the degree of factual and legal overlap, the prior course of the
32

litigation and investigation, and the likely views of counsel and the judge assigned to the
case.
•

If the staff obtains testimony or documents in the investigation that are properly
discoverable in the litigation, the SEC must produce them in the litigation in accordance
with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

•

Although there is some case law to support the practice, staff should not use investigative
subpoenas solely to conduct discovery with respect to claims alleged in the pending
complaint. A court might conclude that the use of investigative subpoenas solely to
conduct discovery is a misuse of the SEC’s investigative powers and circumvents the
court’s authority and the limits on discovery in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

•

In addition, there are special considerations and restrictions on continuing an
investigation following the institution of an administrative proceeding (“AP”). In the AP
context, continuing investigations are subject to Rule 230(g) of the SEC’s Rules of
Practice, which requires the Division to inform the hearing officer and each party
promptly if the staff issues any new subpoenas under the same formal order. The rule
also directs the hearing officer “to order such steps as [are] necessary and appropriate” to
assure that the subpoenas are not issued “for the purpose of obtaining evidence relevant
to the proceedings.” The hearing officer must ensure that any relevant documents
obtained through the use of such subpoenas are produced to each respondent “on a timely
basis.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.230(g).

Further Information:
Before continuing an investigation while there is related pending litigation, or if the staff
is going to recommend simultaneously that the Commission file a civil action and issue a formal
order of investigation, the staff should discuss the issue with trial counsel and should revisit the
issue whenever contemplating the service of investigative subpoenas that could be seen as
relating to pending litigation.
3.1.4

Parallel Investigations and the State Actor Doctrine

Basics of the State Actor Doctrine and When It Applies:
The State Actor Doctrine may be implicated when action by a private entity (e.g., an
SRO) is fairly attributable to a government entity. The action may be fairly attributable if there
is a sufficiently close nexus between the state, or government entity, and the challenged action of
a private entity.
The State Actor Doctrine may apply to a wide variety of private actions in which
government is in some way concerned. It has been analyzed under a two-prong test, and
satisfying either prong can result in a finding of state action:
•

Under the “joint action” prong, private entities may engage in state action when they are
willful participants in joint action with state officials.

33

•

Under the “government compulsion” prong, coercive influence or significant
encouragement by the state can convert private conduct into state action.

After a witness asserts the Fifth Amendment privilege during investigative testimony and
declines to respond to potentially incriminating questions, the issue may arise if the same witness
is then summoned to testify about the same or related conduct by a private entity. When
providing testimony to a private entity, asserting the Fifth Amendment may result in
consequences other than the ability to draw an adverse inference at trial.
Basic Guidelines:
When staff is aware that a private entity is investigating conduct that is the same or
related to the conduct involved in the staff’s investigation, staff should keep the following
guidelines in mind:
•

In fact and appearance, the SEC and the private entity’s investigations should be parallel
and should not be conducted jointly. Staff should make investigative decisions
independent of any parallel investigation that is being conducted by a private entity.

•

Do not take any investigative step principally for the benefit of the private entity’s
investigation or suggest investigative steps to the private entity.

•

In SEC investigations in which a witness has asserted or indicated an intention to assert
the Fifth Amendment in testimony, do not suggest any line of questioning to the private
entity conducting a parallel investigation, and do not provide to the private entity any
document or other evidence for use in questioning a witness other than pursuant to an
approved access request.

Further Information:
Staff should consult with OCC staff concerning any questions relating to the State Actor
Doctrine.
3.2

Documents and Other Materials

3.2.1

Privileges and Privacy Acts

In connection with any request for document production, staff must comply with the
Privacy Act of 1974 (“Privacy Act”), the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (“RFPA”), and
the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (“ECPA”) and the rules regarding the
assertion of privileges are discussed in Section 4 of the Manual. In addition, staff must comply
with policies on contacting witness’s counsel (see Section 3.3.6 of the Manual), parallel
proceedings (see Section 3.1.4 of the Manual), and ongoing litigation (see Section 3.1.3 of the
Manual).

34

3.2.2

Bluesheets

Basics:
•

Bluesheeting is the process by which the SEC requests and obtains trading data from the
broker-dealer community. Member firms are required to provide trading information
pursuant to Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-25 thereunder. Although the
process is now handled electronically through the SEC’s Bluesheet application, the name
derives from the fact that blue paper was once used to make such requests.

•

Bluesheet data provides information identifying the account holder for whom specific
trades were executed and indicates whether the transaction was a buy or a sell and long or
short, among other data elements. The data also identify proprietary and customer trades
executed on all domestic or foreign markets, all “in-house cross” transactions,
transactions cleared for introducing brokers, and prime broker transactions.

•

It may be appropriate to obtain and review Bluesheet data in a variety of investigations,
but it is typically obtained in matters involving possible insider trading or market
manipulation violations.

Considerations and Mechanics:
•

Prior to requesting bluesheet data, the assigned staff must identify which securities they
have an interest in reviewing (equities, options, etc.). Staff must also determine the
period for which they would like to obtain data. Once these decisions are made, the
assigned staff should use the Bluesheet application to obtain Equity Cleared Reports
and/or Option Cleared Reports to identify which broker-dealers traded the security at
issue.

•

Equity and Options Cleared Reports provide essential information such as the clearing
firm that reported the trades, volume at each firm, and number of transactions on a daily
or specified period. The information can be sorted on a volume basis which allows the
staff to quickly determine the largest participants in the marketplace.
o In a takeover situation, consider organizing the data according to buy volume.
o If there is suspicious trading before bad news, such as a poor earnings report, it
may be appropriate to sort the data by sell volume.

Further Information:
For additional information on bluesheeting, staff should consult with the Market
Surveillance Group in OMI.

35

3.2.3

Voluntary Document Requests

Basics:
During an inquiry or investigation, the staff may request the voluntary production of
documents. The staff also may request the voluntary creation of documents, such as chronologies
of events. In an inquiry or investigation, the staff can also request that witnesses agree to
voluntary interviews and testimony (a member of the staff can issue subpoenas only after being
designated an officer upon the Commission’s issuance of a formal order of investigation, as
described in Section 2.3.3 of the Manual).
When the staff begins an inquiry, voluntary document requests can be a principal means
of gathering documents, data, and other information. Often the fruits of these requests will help
the staff assess the merits of an investigation at its earliest stages before the staff opens an
investigation or a senior officer approves the issuance of a formal order.
Considerations:
•

Many issuers, individuals, and other parties are willing to provide significant materials to
the staff voluntarily, without a subpoena. And, as discussed in Section 3.2.4 of the
Manual below, regulated entities are required to produce certain records without a
subpoena.

•

Staff can consider, on a case by case basis, whether and how a voluntary document
request as opposed to a subpoena may affect a witness’s diligence in his or her search for
documents and the witness’s responsiveness.

•

Staff should also keep in mind that a subpoena is required in some situations, such as
when seeking certain information covered by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act
or the Right to Financial Privacy Act.
3.2.3.1

Forms 1661 and 1662

When requesting documents or information other than pursuant to a subpoena, the staff
provides all regulated persons or entities with a copy of Form SEC 1661 (entitled “Supplemental
Information for Entities Directed to Supply Information to the Commission Other Than Pursuant
to a Commission Subpoena”).
When requesting documents or information (including interviews, voluntary or
subpoenaed document productions, and testimony) from any witness, the staff provides the
witness with a copy of Form SEC 1662 (entitled “Supplemental Information for Persons
Requested to Supply Information Voluntarily or Directed to Supply Information Pursuant to a
Commission Subpoena”).
The Supplemental Information Forms provide information on the following topics:
•

False Statements and Documents

36

•

Fifth Amendment

•

Right to Counsel

•

Going Off the Record

•

Consulting with Counsel

•

•

Privacy Act Notices:
o Authority Pursuant to Which Information is Being Solicited
o Effect of Not Supplying Information
o Principal Uses of Information
o Routine Uses of Information
3.2.3.2 White Papers and Other Materials (excluding Wells
Submissions)

During an investigation, persons may produce to the staff, on a voluntary basis,
substantive materials other than in response to Wells notices, including, for example, white
papers, PowerPoint decks, legal memos, or letter briefs (collectively “White Papers”). The
Commission may use the information contained in a White Paper as an admission, or in any
other manner permitted by the Federal Rules of Evidence, or for any of the Routine Uses of
Information described in Form 1662, “Supplemental Information for Persons Requested to
Supply Information Voluntarily or Directed to Supply Information Pursuant to a Commission
Subpoena.” (Form 1662 can be found at http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/sec1662.pdf.) White
Papers also may be discoverable by third parties in accordance with applicable law.
Staff may reject a White Paper if:
•

the person producing the White Paper seeks to limit its admissibility under Federal Rule
of Evidence 408 or the Commission’s ability to use the White Paper for the purposes
described in Form 1662.

•

the White Paper contains or discusses a settlement offer. Offers of settlement should not
be included in White Papers that also address other topics, and instead, may be made in a
separate document.

37

Further Information:
•

Staff should consult with OCC concerning any questions relating to acceptance of White
Papers.

•

See Section 2.4 of the Manual for information relating to Wells Submissions.
3.2.4

Document Requests to Regulated Entities

Basics:
•

The staff may request information from regulated entities, such as registered investment
advisers and broker-dealers. Pursuant to Sections 17(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act and
Section 204 of the Advisers Act and the rules thereunder, regulated entities must provide
certain information to the staff even without a subpoena.

•

Records from regulated entities – especially broker-dealers, transfer agents, and
investment advisers – are often essential cornerstones of an investigation. Because
regulated entities must produce certain records without a subpoena, the staff can often
obtain documents, such as brokerage account statements or account opening documents,
which might otherwise require a subpoena to obtain from an individual.

Considerations:
•

For reasons of efficiency and strategy, consider what types of records to obtain from a
regulated entity. For example, in addition to customer account statements, a brokerdealer will have documents such as order tickets, order confirmations, trading blotters
and transfer records.

•

Some regulated entities have specific policies regarding whether (and, if so, when) to
notify a client or customer that the staff has requested documents related to their account.
Even if there is no formal policy in place, the customer or client might be provided some
informal notice. Depending on the conduct, potential for investor harm, or other
circumstances, consider requesting that a firm not disclose the request for documents, at
least for a certain limited period of time.

Further Information:
•

See Sections 2.2.2.1 and 4.7 of the Manual for information relating to Bank Secrecy Act
materials.

•

For additional information on documents that may be requested from broker-dealers, and
what information such documents can provide, contact the Market Surveillance Group in
OMI.

3.2.5

Document Requests to the News Media

Basics:
The “Policy statement of the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning subpoenas
to members of the news media” can be found in the Commission’s “Informal and Other
Procedures.” 17 C.F.R. § 202.10.
Text of the Policy Statement:
Freedom of the press is of vital importance to the mission of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Effective journalism complements the Commission’s efforts to ensure that
investors receive the full and fair disclosure that the law requires, and that they deserve. Diligent
reporting is an essential means of bringing securities law violations to light and ultimately helps
to deter illegal conduct. In this Policy Statement the Commission sets forth guidelines for the
agency’s professional staff to ensure that vigorous enforcement of the federal securities laws is
conducted completely consistently with the principles of the First Amendment’s guarantee of
freedom of the press, and specifically to avoid the issuance of subpoenas to members of the
media that might impair the news gathering and reporting functions. These guidelines shall be
adhered to by all members of the staff in all cases:
(a) In determining whether to issue a subpoena to a member of the news media, the approach in
every case must be to strike the proper balance between the public’s interest in the free
dissemination of ideas and information and the public’s interest in effective enforcement of the
federal securities laws.
(b) When the staff investigating a matter determines that a member of the news media may have
information relevant to the investigation, the staff should:
(1) Determine whether the information might be obtainable from alternative non-media
sources.
(2) Make all reasonable efforts to obtain that information from those alternative sources.
Whether all reasonable efforts have been made will depend on the particular
circumstances of the investigation, including whether there is an immediate need to
preserve assets or protect investors from an ongoing fraud.
(3) Determine whether the information is essential to successful completion of the
investigation.
(c) If the information cannot reasonably be obtained from alternative sources and the information
is essential to the investigation, then the staff, after seeking approval from the responsible
Regional Director or Associate Director, should contact legal counsel for the member of the
news media. Staff should contact a member of the news media directly only if the member is not
represented by legal counsel. The purpose of this contact is to explore whether the member may
have information essential to the investigation, and to determine the interests of the media with
respect to the information. If the nature of the investigation permits, the staff should make clear

39

what its needs are as well as its willingness to respond to particular problems of the media. The
staff should consult with the Commission’s Office of Public Affairs, as appropriate.
(d) The staff should negotiate with news media members or their counsel, consistently with this
Policy Statement, to obtain the essential information through informal channels, avoiding the
issuance of a subpoena, if the responsible Regional Director or Associate Director determines
that such negotiations would not substantially impair the integrity of the investigation.
Depending on the circumstances of the investigation, informal channels may include voluntary
production, informal interviews, or written summaries.
(e) If negotiations are not successful in achieving a resolution that accommodates the
Commission’s interest in the information and the media’s interests without issuing a subpoena,
the staff investigating the matter should then consider whether to seek the issuance of a subpoena
for the information. The following principles should guide the determination of whether a
subpoena to a member of the news media should be issued:
(1) There should be reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is essential
to successful completion of the investigation. The subpoena should not be used to obtain
peripheral or nonessential information.
(2) The staff should have exhausted all reasonable alternative means of obtaining the
information from non-media sources. Whether all reasonable efforts have been made to
obtain the information from alternative sources will depend on the particular
circumstances of the investigation, including whether there is an immediate need to
preserve assets or protect investors from an ongoing fraud.
(f) If there are reasonable grounds to believe the information sought is essential to the
investigation, all reasonable alternative means of obtaining it have been exhausted, and all efforts
at negotiation have failed, then the staff investigating the matter shall seek authorization for the
subpoena from the Director of the Division of Enforcement. No subpoena shall be issued unless
the Director, in consultation with the General Counsel, has authorized its issuance.
(g) In the event the Director of the Division of Enforcement, after consultation with the General
Counsel, authorizes the issuance of a subpoena, notice shall immediately be provided to the
Chairman of the Commission.
(h) Counsel (or the member of the news media, if not represented by counsel) shall be given
reasonable and timely notice of the determination of the Director of the Division of Enforcement
to authorize the subpoena and the Director’s intention to issue it.
(i) Subpoenas should be negotiated with counsel for the member of the news media to narrowly
tailor the request for only essential information. In negotiations with counsel, the staff should
attempt to accommodate the interests of the Commission in the information with the interests of
the media.
(j) Subpoenas should, wherever possible, be directed at material information regarding a limited
subject matter, should cover a reasonably limited period of time, and should avoid requiring

40

production of a large volume of unpublished material. They should give reasonable and timely
notice of their demand for documents.
(k) In the absence of special circumstances, subpoenas to members of the news media should be
limited to the verification of published information and to surrounding circumstances relating to
the accuracy of published information.
(l) Because the intent of this policy statement is to protect freedom of the press, news gathering
functions, and news media sources, this policy statement does not apply to demands for purely
commercial or financial information unrelated to the news gathering function.
(m) Failure to follow this policy may constitute grounds for appropriate disciplinary action. The
principles set forth in this statement are not intended to create or recognize any legally
enforceable rights in any person.
3.2.6

Subpoenas for Documents

Basics:
The Commission, or the staff it designates as officers in a formal order of investigation,
may issue subpoenas for documents or witnesses, pursuant to Section 19(c) of the Securities Act,
Section 21(b) of the Exchange Act, Section 209(b) of the Advisers Act, and Section 42(b) of the
Investment Company Act. The Commission or its designated officers may require the
production of any records deemed relevant or material to the inquiry and may require their
production from any place in the United States.
•

To issue a subpoena for documents, a staff member must be named as an officer for
purposes of an investigation in the Commission’s formal order. Once the Commission
has issued a formal order, the staff named as officers in the order may issue subpoenas.

•

Some documents cannot be obtained without issuing a subpoena, such as records from
telephone companies or banks.

•

A subpoena for documents should be accompanied by a Form 1662.

•

Rule 7(a) of the SEC’s Rules Relating to Investigations provides that any person who is
compelled or required to furnish documents or testimony at a formal investigative
proceeding shall, upon request, be shown the formal order. Such a person may also
obtain a copy of the formal order by submitting a written request to the Assistant Director
supervising the investigation. See 17 C.F.R. § 203.7(a).

•

A subpoena for documents should include an attachment to the subpoena listing the
documents requested (generally by category or type of document).

41

Further Information:
•

Subpoenas to financial institutions such as banks and credit card issuers are subject to the
Right to Financial Privacy Act. For more information on this Act, see Section 4.5 of the
Manual.

•

For procedures on granting a request for a copy of the formal order, see Section 2.3.4.2 of
the Manual.

•

For more information about Forms 1661 and 1662, see Section 3.2.3.1 of the Manual.
3.2.6.1

Service of Subpoenas

Under Rule 8 of the SEC’s Rules Relating to Investigations (17 C.F.R. § 203.8), service
of subpoenas issued in formal investigative proceedings shall be effected in the manner
prescribed by Rule 232(c) of the SEC’s Rules of Practice (17 C.F.R. § 201.232(c)). Rule 232(c),
in turn, states that service shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Rule 150(b) through (d) of
the SEC’s Rules of Practice (17 C.F.R. §§ 201.150(b) through (d)).
Rule 150 provides that service of subpoenas may be effected:
(b) Upon a person represented by counsel. Whenever service is required to be made upon
a person represented by counsel who has filed a notice of appearance pursuant to
§ 201.102, service shall be made pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section upon counsel,
unless service upon the person represented is ordered by the Commission or the hearing
officer.
(c) How made. Service shall be made by delivering a copy of the filing. Delivery means:
(1) Personal service--handing a copy to the person required to be served; or leaving a
copy at the person’s office with a clerk or other person in charge thereof, or, if there is
no one in charge, leaving it in a conspicuous place therein; or, if the office is closed or
the person to be served has no office, leaving it at the person’s dwelling house or usual
place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein;
(2) Mailing the papers through the U.S. Postal Service by first class, registered, or
certified mail or Express Mail delivery addressed to the person;
(3) Sending the papers through a commercial courier service or express delivery
service; or
(4) Transmitting the papers by facsimile transmission where the following conditions
are met:
(i) The persons so serving each other have provided the Commission and the
parties with notice of the facsimile machine telephone number to be used and the
hours of facsimile machine operation;

42

(ii) The transmission is made at such a time that it is received during the
Commission’s business hours as defined in § 201.104; and
(iii) The sender of the transmission previously has not been served in accordance
with § 201.150 with a written notice from the recipient of the transmission
declining service by facsimile transmission.
(d) When service is complete. Personal service, service by U.S. Postal Service Express
Mail or service by a commercial courier or express delivery service is complete upon
delivery. Service by mail is complete upon mailing. Service by facsimile is complete
upon confirmation of transmission by delivery of a manually signed receipt.
3.2.7

Form of Production

Basics:
•

The following guidelines for production should be set out in the subpoena or in the cover
letter accompanying the subpoena.

•

Generally, all documents described in the attachment to the subpoena should be produced
by the date listed on the subpoena to the Division’s Centralized Processing Unit or to the
particular staff member identified in the subpoena.

•

The subpoenaed entity or individual is required to produce all subpoenaed items that are
in its possession, custody or control. This includes items under the subpoenaed entity or
individual’s control or custody, but that are not in its immediate possession.

•

The staff is encouraged to request document production in electronic format, in an SEC
preferred format, and to include OCR text. Electronic production is preferable, especially
large productions from entities, because it is less costly, the information may be stored
more efficiently, it may allow the staff to search for specific terms, and it may provide the
ability to tag and review data more easily. Requesting the production in an SEC
preferred format and to include OCR text also reduces costs.

•

In an electronic production, the subpoenaed entity or individual must maintain the
originals of all documents responsive to the subpoena in the event production of the
original documents is required at a later date.

•

If the subpoenaed entity or individual produces documents in electronic format, the
subpoenaed entity or individual should advise the staff, as soon as possible, of the size of
the document production, the software used to store the document, and the medium of
production.

•

The staff may allow the subpoenaed entity or individual to produce documents in hard
paper copies. In the event that the subpoenaed entity or individual produces documents
in hard paper copies, the subpoenaed entity or individual must maintain the originals of

43

all documents responsive to the subpoena in the event production of the original
documents is required at a later date.
•

If copies of a document differ in any way, they are to be treated as separate documents
and the subpoenaed entity or individual must produce each copy. For example, if the
subpoenaed entity or individual has two copies of the same letter, but only one of them is
marked with handwritten notes, the subpoenaed entity or individual must send both the
clean copy and the copy with notes.

•

The subpoenaed entity or individual should produce hard copy documents in a unitized
manner (e.g., delineated with staples or paper clips to identify the document boundaries),
and electronic documents in accordance with the SEC Data Delivery Standards.

•

The subpoenaed entity or individual should enclose a list briefly describing each item it
has sent. The list should include the paragraph(s) in the subpoena attachment to which
each item responds.

•

The subpoenaed entity or individual should also include a cover letter stating whether it
believes it has met its obligations under the subpoena by searching carefully and
thoroughly for all documents or materials required by the subpoena, and by producing all
of the required documents and materials.

•

The term “document” in the context of a production responsive to a subpoena includes,
but is not limited to, any written, printed, or typed matter in the possession, custody or
control of the subpoenaed entity or individual including, but not limited to all drafts and
copies bearing notations or marks not found in the original, letters and correspondence,
interoffice communications, slips, tickets, records, worksheets, financial records, accounting
documents, bookkeeping documents, memoranda, reports, manuals, telephone logs,
telegrams, facsimiles, messages of any type, telephone messages, voice mails, tape
recordings, notices, instructions, minutes, summaries, notes of meetings, file folder
markings, and any other organizational indicia, purchase orders, information recorded by
photographic process, including microfilm and microfiche, computer printouts,
spreadsheets, and other electronically stored information, including but not limited to
writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, sound recordings, images, and other data or
data compilations that are stored in any medium from which information can be retrieved,
obtained, manipulated, or translated.

•

The subpoenaed entity or individual must produce all of the materials described in the
subpoena. If, for any reason, the subpoenaed entity or individual does not produce
something required by the subpoena, the subpoenaed entity or individual should submit a
list of what it is not producing. The list should describe each item separately, noting: its
author(s); its date; its subject matter; the name of the person who has the item now, or the
last person known to have it; the names of everyone who ever had the item or a copy of
it, and the names of everyone who was told the item’s contents; and the reason the
subpoenaed entity or individual did not produce the item.

44

•

If the subpoenaed entity or individual withholds an item based on a claim of privilege, the
list of withheld items should specify the privilege claimed. If the subpoenaed entity or
individual withholds anything on the basis of a claim of attorney-client privilege or
attorney work product protection, the subpoenaed entity or individual should identify the
attorney and client involved.

•

If any documents responsive to the subpoena no longer exist because they have been lost,
discarded, or otherwise destroyed, the subpoenaed entity or individual should identify
such documents and give the date on which they were lost, discarded or destroyed.

•

Many larger accounting firms maintain and create their workpapers electronically.
Electronic workpapers are often a rich source of metadata and may be easier to navigate
than hard copies. Firms may raise concerns about producing electronic workpapers and
other audit documents, citing to intellectual property rights in what they view as
proprietary programs. The staff does not necessarily agree with the concerns but as an
accommodation, may consider alternative approaches such as web-based production and
production on a dedicated laptop computer. These requests may be evaluated on a caseby-case basis to determine whether an alternative approach is appropriate in the
investigation.

Further Information:
•

Staff should refer any questions about the form of production to the Enforcement Office
of Technical Services.

•

For more information on privilege logs, see Section 3.2.7.4 of the Manual.

•

For information on the format for electronic production, see Section 3.2.7.3 of the
Manual.

•

For information on certifications of completeness of production, see Section 3.2.7.6 of
the Manual.

•

For more information about when and how to request electronic workpapers, staff should
contact the Enforcement’s Chief Accountant.
3.2.7.1

Accepting Production of Copies

Basics:
The staff may allow a subpoenaed entity or individual to produce photocopies of the
original documents required by a subpoena. Acceptable productions of photocopied documents
should follow these guidelines:
•

The copies must be identical to the originals, including even faint marks or print.

•

The subpoenaed entity or individual should put an identifying notation on each page of
each document to indicate that it was produced by the subpoenaed entity or individual,
45

and number the pages of all the documents submitted. (For example, if Jane Doe sends
documents to the staff, she may number the pages JD-1, JD-2, JD-3, etc., in a blank
corner of the documents). However, if the subpoenaed entity or individual sends the staff
original documents, the subpoenaed entity or individual should not add any identifying
notations.
•

The subpoenaed entity or individual should make sure the notation and number do not
conceal any writing or marking on the document.

•

In producing a photocopy of an original document that contains post-it(s), notation
flag(s), or other removable markings or attachments which may conceal all or a portion
of the markings contained in the original document, photocopies of the original document
both with and without the relevant post-it(s), notation flag(s), or removable markings or
attachments should be produced.

Considerations:
In producing photocopies of original documents, the subpoenaed entity or individual
should be aware that:
•

The SEC cannot reimburse the subpoenaed entity or individual for copying costs, except
in the case of RFPA subpoenas or certain productions under the ECPA.

•

The subpoenaed entity or individual must maintain the originals of all copied documents
responsive to the subpoena in a safe place in the event production of the original
documents is required at a later date.

•

If it appears that a photocopy of an original document may not represent the original
document in its entirety, whether by means of post-it(s), notation flag(s), removable
markings, erroneous copying, or for any other reason, the staff should request the original
document so that the staff can verify that the photocopy represents the original document
in its entirety, including all of the markings contained within it.

Further Information:
•

Staff should refer any questions about the production of photocopied documents
responsive to subpoenas to the Trial Unit.

•

For more information concerning Bates stamping of photocopied documents, see Section
3.2.7.2 of the Manual.
3.2.7.2

Bates Stamping

Introduction:
Bates stamping (also known as Bates numbering or Bates coding) refers to the use of
identifying numbers or date and time marks on images and documents as they are scanned or
processed.
46

Bates stamping is commonly used as an organizational method to label and identify
documents. Marking each document with a unique number is a useful tool both at the
investigative stage and in litigation and provides an efficient and clear way to identify documents
on the record in testimony and depositions.
Basics:
•

Original documents should be kept in pristine condition and no documents should be
altered for any reason. Original documents should be copied or imaged and the copies
or images (not the originals) should be Bates stamped.

•

Bates stamping assigns a unique identifier to each page produced or received during the
course of an investigation or discovery. Such numbering may be solely numeric or may
contain a combination of letters and number (alphanumeric).

•

Although there is no standard method for numbering documents, the best practice is to
place an identifying notation on each page of each document (1) to indicate the source of
the production and (2) to number the pages of all the documents submitted.

•

In cases of multiple productions by the same source, a production date (mm/dd/yy) may
be stamped in addition to the letters used to identify the source of the production. For
several productions from the same source, the best practice is to continue the numbering
from the previous production.

•

The notation and number should not conceal any writing or marking on the document.

•

Manual Bates stamping involves the use of a self-inking stamp with six or seven
numbered wheels that automatically increment each time the stamp is pressed down on a
page. Preprinted, self-adhesive labels can also be used, as well as electronic document
discovery (EDD) software that can electronically stamp documents stored as computer
files by superimposing numbers on them. If produced documents are imaged, they can be
Bates stamped as they are imaged.

•

If documents are produced already Bates stamped, there is no need to Bates stamp them a
second time, unless the existing Bates stamp is duplicated in other documents. In that
case, the best practice is to Bates stamp them with a new sequence.
3.2.7.3

Format for Electronic Production of Documents to the SEC

Introduction:
The staff is encouraged to request document production in electronic format. Documents,
information, and data produced electronically may be delivered as: (1) scanned collections; (2)
e-mail; or (3) native files. The formats for these types of productions should be communicated
to parties wishing to produce documents, information, and data electronically. Staff should not
accept electronic production of documents and information in any format other than these three

47

formats (including databases) without prior discussions with, and approval from, the Division’s
IT staff.
Basics:
•

Staff should request that each party producing documents and other information
electronically organize each submission by custodian. Producing parties should also
provide a summary of the number of records, images, e-mails, and attachments in the
production so that the staff can confirm that the complete production has been loaded
onto the SEC’s computer system.

•

All electronic productions should conform to the technical requirements of the SEC’s
Data Delivery Standards.

•

Data can be delivered on CD, DVD, or hard drive. The smallest number of media is
preferred. If the collection is large enough, the SEC can provide a hard drive to the
producing party, if needed.

•

For scanned collections, each scanned file must contain four components: (a) an image
file; (b) a delimited text file; (c) optical character recognition (OCR) text; and (d) an
image cross-reference file. For further explanation and other information about the
required four components, staff should contact the Division’s IT staff.

•

For electronic e-mail productions, there are several formats available, but it is preferable
to request the producer of the e-mails to load them into a central repository or database
and convert them into a searchable format that is compatible with the SEC’s Document
Review Platform. This method allows for the staff to run its own searches using its own
search terms on the population of e-mails requested.
o The preferred format for receiving electronically-produced e-mail is delimited text
with images and native attachments.
o The staff may also accept the following formats for electronic production of e-mails:


PST – a personal storage file native to Microsoft Office Outlook.



NSF – a personal storage file native to Lotus Notes.

o The staff should include the data standards described above in their document
requests to ensure that the format of produced e-mails is loadable into the SEC’s
Document Review Platform and that the most relevant data fields are captured. If the
producer of the e-mails wishes to negotiate alternative delivery standards, the staff
should contact Division IT staff so that they can participate in the related discussions.
•

Native files should be produced with an ASCII delimited file containing the media
associated with the files, text extracted from the native file, and a directory path to the
native file.

48

•

A subpoena or document request should include the standard specific guidelines and
instructions containing technical criteria to follow for producing documents electronically
to the SEC.

Further Information:
For information on any aspect of electronic production, staff should consult the
Division’s IT staff and the Data Delivery Standards.
3.2.7.4

Privilege Logs

Basics:
With respect to each document that has been withheld from production on the grounds of
any privilege or protection, the staff should request that a detailed privilege log be produced at
the same time as the responsive documents.
Considerations:
Staff should keep in mind the following considerations when requesting and reviewing
privilege logs:
•

Document requests or subpoena attachments should contain instructions to provide a
privilege log for any documents withheld.

•

After the initial production is received, the staff should ask for written confirmation that
all requested materials have been produced and that any document withheld based upon
an assertion of any privilege has been noted in the privilege log. The privilege log also
should note assertions of privilege for any portion of a document that has been redacted.

•

The staff should carefully review the privilege log to determine whether the privilege has
been properly asserted. In addition, the staff should compare redacted documents against
the privilege log to determine whether a privilege has been properly asserted for each
redacted portion.

•

The staff should obtain additional information where entries in the privilege log are
incomplete or do not otherwise provide sufficient information to determine whether the
privilege has been properly asserted.

•

If a documentary privilege is asserted during testimony, the staff should stay on the
record. The staff should exercise care when inquiring into potentially privileged matters
by making clear on the record that they are not intending to obtain the disclosure of
confidential communications between attorney and client. However, the staff should
indicate on the record that they intend to establish whether the predicate facts for the
assertion of the privilege are present.

49

3.2.7.5

Business Record Certifications

Basics:
•

At the time a company produces business records (e.g., telephone records, bank account
statements, brokerage account records), the staff should simultaneously obtain from a
custodian of records or other qualified person a declaration certifying that the documents
are records of regularly conducted business activities.

•

A certification should eliminate the need to have a custodian of records testify at
deposition or civil trial because the records can be authenticated by the certification under
Rules 902(11) and 902(12) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. A certification may also
avoid the need for testimony by the custodian in an administrative proceeding.
3.2.7.6.

Confirming Completeness of Production

Introduction:
When recommending that the Commission accept a settlement offer from an entity or
individual, it is important to obtain an executed Certification as to Completeness of Document
Production from the settling party. In the Certification, the settling party acknowledges that the
Commission has relied upon, among other things, the completeness of his or her production.
Basics:
•

A settling individual must declare under penalty of perjury that he or she has made a
diligent search of all files in his or her possession, custody, or control that are reasonably
likely to contain responsive documents and that those documents have either been
produced or identified in a privilege log.

•

The Certification applies to SEC subpoenas, document requests and requests for
voluntary production of documents.

•

In the case of an entity, the Certification should contain similar language, but require a
representative to declare that the representative has made a diligent inquiry of all persons
who reasonably had possession of responsive documents, and that those documents have
been produced or identified in a privilege log.
3.2.8

Forthwith Subpoenas in Investigations

Basics:
Forthwith subpoenas, which call for the immediate production of information, are one of
many tools we can use to compel the production of evidence during an investigation. However,
they should only be used in exigent circumstances. For example, a forthwith subpoena may be
appropriate where records are sought from a witness or custodian who: (i) we have specific
reason to believe may destroy or falsify records, (ii) is a flight risk, or (iii) has been
uncooperative or obstructive during the investigation.
50

Also, a forthwith subpoena, as with any of our subpoenas, is not self-enforcing. Absent a
court order, we cannot compel a witness or custodian to comply with any subpoena, including a
forthwith subpoena. Staff should expect courts to scrutinize closely subpoenas that demand
immediate production.
Further Information:
If the staff believes there may be a need to issue a forthwith subpoena due to exigent
circumstances, the staff should consult with the Trial Unit immediately.
3.2.9

Maintaining Investigative Files

Various federal laws, the Commission’s internal rules and policies, and the Division’s
procedures require proper maintenance of investigative files.
Objectives for Maintaining Investigative Files:
•

Following procedures to maintain investigative files helps ensure that any loss of or
damage to the Division’s offices, files, or equipment will cause minimal disruption to the
work of the Division.

•

Uniformity in document management practices helps facilitate information sharing and
limit loss of information associated with staff turnover.

•

Maintaining investigative files in a systematic way increases the likelihood of success in
litigation. Investigative files need to be properly maintained so they can be shared with
other law enforcement agencies. Rule 30-4(a)(7) of the SEC’s Rules of Organization
delegates to the Director of the Division of Enforcement authority to grant access
requests to the SEC’s nonpublic enforcement and regulatory files. An access grant
generally provides authority to disclose both existing information and information
acquired in the future to those entities listed in Rule 24c-1(b) of the Exchange Act.

The Basics of Maintaining Original Documents:
•

Original documents received by the staff, whether voluntarily or through subpoenas,
should be segregated from the staff’s personal notes, copies of the staff’s e-mails, or any
other documents. “Original” documents received may include copies of documents
produced pursuant to subpoena.

•

Original documents should be kept in pristine condition and no documents should be
altered for any reason. Original documents should be copied or imaged and the copies or
images (not the originals) should be Bates stamped, if not already stamped.

•

In the event documents require additional protections (e.g., if they come from a foreign
government and are not supposed to be transmitted pursuant to an access request), they
should be kept separate and well marked.

51

The Basics of Maintaining Files:
•

When either a MUI or an investigation that was not preceded by a MUI is opened, the
staff should implement a system for handling originals and hard copies of documents,
including, but not limited to, correspondence, subpoenas, and third-party document
productions. (For more information regarding Document Control, see Section 3.2.9.1 of
the Manual.)

•

When either a MUI or an investigation that was not preceded by a MUI is opened, the
staff should contact Enforcement IT staff to set up a specific sub-directory on
Enforcement’s shared drive for the case. This subdirectory will include automaticallygenerated folders labeled with categories of documents typically created or received
during investigations and litigation (e.g., Investigative Files/Document Requests &
Subpoenas, Investigative Files/Investigative Correspondence, Litigation Files/Discovery,
Litigation Files/Experts). Staff should maintain electronic files in accordance with the
folder structure in the case’s shared drive sub-directory.

Using Shared Drives:
Staff should maintain work product (e.g., subpoenas, internal memoranda, chronologies,
pleadings), transcripts provided in electronic form, and documents produced to the staff in
electronic form on shared drives.
Maintaining Internet Documents:
During the course of certain investigations, evidentiary issues may arise concerning
authentication and preservation of internet documents, particularly pertaining to pages from the
internet. Website publishers may, at any time and within seconds, edit, alter, or even remove the
contents of their websites. Upon discovering relevant evidence on a website, the staff
immediately should take steps to preserve each individual relevant web page. For information
on how to preserve website evidence, see Section 3.2.9.6 of the Manual.
Preserving Electronically Stored Information (“ESI”):
Steps should be taken to preserve ESI in enforcement investigations. For further
information on the preservation of ESI, see Section 3.2.9.4 of the Manual.
Special Considerations Pertaining to the Bank Secrecy Act:
All Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) information is sensitive; in particular, Suspicious Activity
Reports (“SARs”), and related information that would reveal the existence of a SAR, must be
protected from inadvertent disclosure. SARs and SAR material must be segregated, labeled as
sensitive, and stored securely. Steps must be taken to avoid inadvertent dissemination of these
documents or inadvertent disclosure of the existence of these documents.

52

Further Information on the BSA:
•

Staff should contact the BSA Review Group for specific information and guidance about
how to handle BSA materials properly.

•

See also Sections 2.2.2.1 and 4.7 of the Manual.
3.2.9.1

Document Control

Basics:
In implementing good document management and control during an investigation or
litigation, the staff should have a structured and consistent system for labeling, storing, and
keeping track of documents, which should indicate:
•

what documents respondents, witnesses, or defendants have produced;

•

when they produced the documents;

•

which subpoena or voluntary request sought the documents; and

•

whether the response to the subpoena or request is complete.

To that end, the staff should follow the procedures below, adjusted as appropriate for the
particular circumstances of the production:
Labeling Documents:
•

Subject to the considerations discussed below, all hard-copy productions should be Bates
stamped, either by the party producing them, or, if not, by the staff. For more
information on Bates stamping, see Section 3.2.7.2 of the Manual.

•

If it is an electronic production, it is important to address labeling issues up front with the
producing party, before the documents are produced. For more information on the format
for the electronic production of documents, see Section 3.2.7.3 of the Manual.

Keeping Track of Documents:
•

The staff should index all documents after receipt, including those received in production,
testimony transcripts, documents sent to off-site storage, etc. Each index should be saved
on the appropriate sub-folder in the investigation’s folder on Enforcement’s shared drive.

•

The staff should maintain logs or indexes of subpoenas issued, documents produced to
the staff, testimony transcripts, etc., on the investigation’s sub-directory located on the
Division’s shared drive.

53

Storage and Maintenance of Documents:
Among other things, staff should clearly label documents, segregate privileged
documents from documents produced by third parties, and label and index documents to be
stored off-site.
Use of Documents:
Original documents should not be used for any reason except as necessary to present
evidence in court or at a hearing. Therefore:
•

Original documents should not be used as working copies. They should not be marked or
altered from the state they were in at the time of their original production.

•

The staff should make a copy if necessary to work with, mark up, or introduce as an
exhibit in testimony.

•

Electronic data can be printed out or loaded onto the shared drive, which is a specially
created queue to accept larger quantities of documents, with which the staff can work.
The staff should keep an original, clearly labeled version of electronic production (CD or
otherwise).

Further Information:
The staff should also consult with trial counsel regarding any concerns regarding the
future use of documents in litigation.
3.2.9.2

Document Imaging in Investigations

Introduction:
The Division, in coordination with the SEC’s Office of Information Technology (“OIT”),
has implemented a program to image evidentiary documents in investigations. The SEC’s
Electronic Documents program consists of two data management projects: the Electronic
Production Project and the National Imaging Project.
The Electronic Production Project involves the loading of evidentiary materials from
Division cases into a review platform, which allows authorized staff to retrieve and view the
documents. The National Imaging Project provides data back-up and disaster recovery for the
program. It provides for the removal of voluminous evidentiary documents from Division
premises in Headquarters and the regional offices. OIT, in consultation with the Division,
manages the Electronic Documents program.
Basics:
•

When evidentiary documents need to be imaged, the staff should submit a request to a
Document Management Specialist (“DMS”), including the following information: (1)

54

case name; (2) location of documents; (3) case number; (4) priority; (5) source or
producing party; and (6) any instructions or other specifics.
•

The DMS will confirm the information, conduct any additional preparation of the
documents, and either arrange to have the documents imaged onsite or outsource the
imaging to a designated outside contractor.

•

The DMS will send e-mail notification to the appropriate staff, which will provide the
necessary confirmation information.

•

The documents will be scanned by the requested date, and will be hand delivered to the
SEC for loading into the SEC’s Document Review Platform shortly thereafter. The staff
will receive notice when the imaging process has been completed.

•

If the staff requests return of the documents, the imaging processing center will first
retain the documents for 45 days after receipt, where they will be stored in a secured,
limited access area so that random quality assurance checks can be done. However, if the
staff requests immediate return of the documents, they will be returned after the scanning
has been completed.

•

If the staff doesn’t request the return of documents, the documents will be shipped to the
Iron Mountain storage facility after the 45 day period, and confirmation and tracking
information will be sent to the staff.

Further Information:
Staff should contact the Division’s IT staff or OIT for further information on document
imaging.
3.2.9.3

Electronic Files

Introduction:
The procedures discussed below provide guidance and suggestions on how the Division
staff should maintain files and records produced in electronic formats during the course of their
investigations. The staff should strive to maintain and preserve all electronic files received from
outside parties in an orderly manner during the course of their investigations and should not alter
the original media and files.
Basics:
The staff may receive production of information in the form of CDs, DVDs, videotapes,
audiotapes, and other electronic media, during the course of its investigations. Upon receipt of
any type of electronic media, staff should follow the below best practices, as appropriate:
•

First, have a duplicate made by a qualified technician. The staff should consult with the
Division’s IT staff to determine which technician should duplicate a particular medium.

55

•

Next, verify the type of information contained on the electronic medium to determine the
best way to work with the files.
o Text Files: If the information is in the form of text files, the staff will complete
an “Electronic Data Submittal Form” and will submit the form, along with the
duplicate medium, to the appropriate technician in OIT at the Home Office, who
will load the contents of the duplicate medium onto the Home Office server.
Both the original and duplicate will be returned to the staff. The information
produced as the electronic file will be accessible to the staff via the Home Office
server and on the duplicate medium.
o Audio and Video Files: If the electronic medium contains audio or video files,
the staff may have a transcript prepared of each duplicate recording. The
transcript should identify the source of the recording (e.g., meeting, presentation,
news video), each speaker, the speaker’s location, and the dates and times the
original recording was made. The transcript should also identify the name of the
person who prepared it, the date the transcript was prepared, and any information
sufficient to describe the specific medium (e.g., disc, tape) transcribed. The
original and duplicate will be returned to the staff.

•

Maintain all original files in a secure central location within each Assistant Director
group. The Assistant Director assigned to the investigation should be the designated
custodian of the original files. Original files should not be used until necessary at trial or
similar proceeding.

•

Create and maintain a log for each original file. In the event an original file is to be
removed from its secure central location, the staff member removing the file should sign
the log and indicate the date and time the file was removed, as well as the date and time
the file was returned to its secure location.

•

The staff may access the electronic files on the duplicate copy itself and may also choose
to load a copy of the duplicate recording onto the case file on the master drive of its
office’s computer system. The staff should use the duplicate files or transcripts, and not
the original files or transcripts, during the investigation and discovery phase of litigation.

Considerations:
Staff should keep in mind that original files may ultimately be used at trial or during a
similar litigation proceeding. Thus, the staff should take steps to avoid alteration to original
electronic files.
Further Information:
•

Staff should refer any questions about receiving, using, storing, and disposing of,
electronic files to Enforcement’s IT staff or OIT.

•

For further information regarding audiotapes, see Section 3.2.9.8 of the Manual.

56

•

For further information on the format for electronic productions, see Section 3.2.7.3 of
the Manual.
3.2.9.4

Complying with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)
Requirements and Preserving Evidence in Anticipation of
Litigation

Basics:
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1) requires the SEC to make certain disclosures at
the onset of litigation. Additionally, the SEC is required to conduct a reasonable search of
documents within its possession, custody, or control to respond to discovery requests pursuant to
Rule 34 of the FRCP. Failure to produce documents during discovery can result in sanctions,
including an order precluding the SEC from using those documents as evidence.
Creating and maintaining an accurate contact list and document index will help the
investigative staff effectively manage a complex investigation and greatly assist the SEC’s trial
attorneys when compiling initial disclosures pursuant to Rule 26(a)(1) and in responding to
subsequent discovery requests.
•

Contact list – The contact list should include the name, address and telephone number of
each individual likely to have discoverable information.

•

Document index - The document list should include all documents, electronically stored
information, and tangible things that the staff obtains during its investigation and provide
at least the following:
o A description of the documents by category;
o Location of the documents;
o Identity of the party that produced the documents;
o Identification of the request or subpoena and correspondence relating to the
documents; and
o Bates numbers, if possible.

Considerations:
Since the investigative staff may receive electronic production or scan a paper production
into an SEC database, once the documents are uploaded it is particularly important to keep an
accurate document index to satisfy the initial disclosure requirement in a timely manner.
Duty to Preserve Evidence:
A duty to preserve ESI and paper records generally arises when litigation is reasonably
anticipated or foreseeable, as well as when litigation is pending. Failure to preserve ESI and

57

paper records can result in Court sanctions. When there is a duty to preserve, Enforcement staff
should make reasonable and good faith efforts to preserve ESI and paper records relevant to an
investigation or litigation, including issuing a litigation hold notice to those individuals working
for the SEC who are most likely to have relevant information directing them to preserve relevant
ESI and paper records.
ESI is a broad term that includes word processing files, spreadsheets, databases, e-mail,
and voicemail.
3.2.9.5

Iron Mountain

Documents received by the staff in MUIs or investigations must be organized in boxes
for transfer to Iron Mountain for storage:
•

The boxes should include a detailed description of all contents to facilitate storage and
retrieval.

•

The staff should maintain tracking logs to include the date and location when boxes are
sent to or received from Iron Mountain, and when boxes are destroyed or sent to Records
Management.

•

Each office should use a database to standardize the tracking process.
3.2.9.6

Preserving Internet Evidence

Basics:
The most common form of internet evidence is a website page. However, website
owners may, at any time and within seconds, alter, edit or even remove contents of a website.
Thus, upon discovering relevant evidence on a website, the staff immediately should seek to
preserve that website evidence to capture information as it existed at the time the staff discovered
the information.
Website downloading and preservation must be completed by Enforcement’s IT staff, to
help ensure a forensically-preserved copy of the relevant information.
Further information:
The staff should direct any questions about preserving internet evidence to Enforcement’s
IT staff.
3.2.9.7

Preserving Physical Evidence

The two most widespread forms of physical evidence in SEC investigations are
audiotapes and electronic media hardware, such as computer hard drives. Usually, the staff will
obtain copies of this data from the producing party in a commonly accessible format, such as
cassette tapes for analog audio recordings, WAV files for electronic audio recording, and TIF or
PDF files for electronic data stored on a hard drive.

58

However, there may be circumstances when the staff may need to obtain the original
media source or obtain a copy that fully captures all data on the original media source, such as an
image of an entire hard drive. The staff should consider obtaining originals when there is a risk
that the original media source may be destroyed or where the producing party cannot be relied
upon to produce all relevant data on a media source. The original hardware also contains
residual data, which can include deleted files.
Whether the staff obtains originals or copies, the staff generally should follow the
procedures in Sections 3.2.9.8 and 3.2.9.9 of the Manual so that this physical evidence is
preserved to ensure its authenticity.
3.2.9.8

Preserving Audio Recordings

Audio recordings are usually produced in one of two ways. For digital recordings, audio
recordings are produced as WAV files on CD-ROMs or DVDs. For analog recordings, the
recordings are often produced on audio cassette tapes. In either format, the staff should be able
to trace the receipt and custody of audio recording data from the time they are received through
their use at trial and demonstrate that the audio recordings were securely stored once they came
into the staff’s possession. The goal is to ensure the admissibility of the recording by
establishing its authenticity and the requisite preservation of its condition.
To maintain authenticity, the staff should follow these procedures:
•

When obtained, audio recordings should be affixed with a Bates or control number.

•

Testimony of the recording’s custodian should establish the producing party’s procedures
for making and maintaining audio recordings, the procedures used to produce the audio
recordings to the SEC and the location of the originals (if copies were produced). The
custodian should also be asked to identify the date and time of the recordings, and the
speakers and the source of the recording, such as the telephone numbers associated with
the recording. This information is often available in digital recordings by retrieving data
files created at the time the recording was made that capture this information.

•

If copies are produced, the staff should ensure the custodian testifies on the record that he
or she understands the obligation to maintain the originals in a place and manner
sufficient to preserve their authenticity.

•

If original recordings are produced, the staff should keep the originals in a safe location
and use copies during the course of the investigation. A log should be created and
maintained that requires any individual that retrieves the originals to document the date
and time that the originals were checked out and in.

•

The staff should have transcripts prepared of all audio recordings with evidentiary value.

59

3.2.9.9

Preserving Electronic Media

Basics:
Electronic media hardware that may be useful during an investigation includes computer
hard drives, CDs or DVDs, backup tapes, USB flash drives, smartphones and cellular phones,
and personal data assistants. The staff should establish the authenticity of the hardware and
prevent against any alteration or destruction of information as follows:
•

When obtained, electronic media hardware should be affixed with a Bates number.

•

The staff should store original hardware in a safe location, use only copies of the data
during the investigation, and create a log to document all circumstances when the
originals are removed from their storage location.

•

Through the testimony of the owner of the hardware or the custodian charged with
maintaining hardware, the staff should seek to establish the authenticity of the original
hardware, including information regarding the procedures utilized for storing and
maintaining data on the hardware

Considerations:
The staff may also obtain an image of all data located on the hardware instead of the
original. Imaging is a copying process that produces an exact digital replica of the original data
on the hardware and preserves the structure and integrity of the data. The staff should confer
with Enforcement’s IT staff to ensure proper imaging of data. To be deemed reliable, the
imaging of electronic media information must meet industry standards for quality and reliability,
must ensure that no data is altered during the imaging process, and must be tamper proof. The
Enforcement IT staff has established specific procedures and guidelines for imaging data. The
staff should also ensure that the producing party has stored the originals in a safe location,
including by confirming details of such storage through the testimony of a custodian or owner of
the hardware.
Further Information:
•

Staff should refer any questions about preserving electronic media evidence to the
Division’s IT staff.

•

See Section 3.2.9.2 of the Manual for more information on imaging.

•

See Section 3.2.9.9 of the Manual for more information on electronic files.
3.3

Witness Interviews and Testimony

3.3.1

Privileges and Privacy Acts

In connection with any witness interviews or testimony, staff must comply with the
Privacy Act of 1974, the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, and the Electronic

60

Communications Privacy Act of 1986, among other requirements. These statutes are discussed
in Section 4 of the Manual.
3.3.2

No Targets of Investigations

Unlike the grand jury process in which targets of an investigation are often identified, the
SEC investigative process does not have targets. Thus, the SEC is not required to provide any
type of target notification when it issues subpoenas to third parties or witnesses for testimony or
documents in its nonpublic investigations of possible violations of the federal securities laws.
The Supreme Court, in SEC v. O’Brien, 467 U.S. 735, 750 (1984), noted that “the imposition of
a notice requirement on the SEC would substantially increase the ability of persons who have
something to hide to impede legitimate investigations by the Commission.” Citing the SEC’s
broad investigatory responsibility under the federal securities laws, the Court found no statutory,
due process, or other standard regarding judicial enforcement of such subpoenas to support the
proposition that notice is required.
Although some parties involved in investigations eventually may be named as defendants
or respondents in subsequent litigation, the SEC does not have targets of its inquiries or
investigations.
3.3.3

Voluntary Telephone Interviews
3.3.3.1

Privacy Act Warnings and Forms 1661 and 1662

Basics:
•

The Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, requires, among other things, certain disclosures to
individuals from whom the SEC’s staff solicits information.

•

When the staff contacts a person to request a voluntary telephone interview, before
asking any substantive questions, the staff should provide an oral summary of at least the
required Privacy Act information described below.

•

The Privacy Act requires that the staff provide the following information:
o That the principal purpose in requesting information from the witness is to determine
whether there have been violations of the statutes and rules that the SEC enforces.
o That the information provided by members of the public is routinely used by the SEC
and other authorities, to conduct investigative, enforcement, licensing, and
disciplinary proceedings, and to fulfill other statutory responsibilities.
o That the federal securities laws authorize the SEC to conduct investigations and to
request information from the witness, but that the witness is not required to respond.
o That there are no direct sanctions and no direct effects upon the witness for refusing
to provide information to the staff.

61

Considerations:
When appropriate, the staff also sends a Form 1661 or 1662 (along with a cover letter) to
the witness after the telephone interview has taken place. If the staff contacts the witness and the
witness asks to delay the interview to a later date, the staff may send Form 1661 or 1662 in
advance of the telephone interview.
3.3.3.2

Documenting the Interview

Basics:
While conducting a voluntary telephone interview, the staff may take written notes of the
interview. With the witness’s consent, the staff also may make an audio recording of the
interview.
Considerations:
A minimum of two staff members are encouraged to be present to conduct a witness
interview. Advantages to having a minimum of two staff members present to conduct a witness
interview include having more than one person who can ask questions and later have
recollections and impressions of the interview. Moreover, one of the staff members may
subsequently need to serve as a witness at trial. Staff also should consider having only one staff
member take notes during the interview. If the staff intends to make an audio recording of the
interview, Division policy requires the staff to obtain the witness’s consent before initiating the
recording.
3.3.4

Voluntary On-the-Record Testimony

Basics:
The staff may request voluntary transcribed (“on the record”) testimony from witnesses.
The staff cannot require and administer oaths or affirmations without a formal order of
investigation. Nevertheless, the staff can conduct voluntary testimony with a court reporter
present and a verbatim transcript is produced. Voluntary testimony may be recorded by audio,
audiovisual, and/or stenographic means. Staff should identify the potential method or methods
of recording to be used in writing to the witness prior to the occurrence of the voluntary
testimony.
If a witness is voluntarily willing to testify under oath, the staff, after obtaining the
witness’s consent, will have the court reporter place the witness under oath. If the witness is
placed under oath, false testimony may be subject to punishment under federal perjury laws. In
addition, 18 U.S.C. § 1001, which prohibits false statements to government officials, applies
even if a witness is not under oath.
While conducting voluntary on-the-record testimony, the witness may have counsel
present. Also, at the beginning of the testimony, the staff should consider asking the witness
questions on the record to reflect that the witness understands: (1) that the witness is present and

62

is testifying voluntarily; (2) that the witness may decline to answer any question that is asked,
and (3) that the witness may leave at any time.
Considerations:
Staff can otherwise conduct the voluntary on-the-record testimony as it would any other
testimony, including providing the witness with the Form 1662 prior to testimony.
3.3.5

Testimony Under Subpoena
3.3.5.1

Authority

The SEC may require a person to provide documents and testimony under oath upon the
issuance of a subpoena. Prior to issuing any subpoenas in a matter, the staff must obtain a formal
order of investigation. See Section 2.3.3 of the Manual.
In authorizing the issuance of a formal order, the Commission delegates broad factfinding and investigative authority to the staff. Various statutes provide for the designation of
officers of the Commission who can administer oaths, subpoena witness, take testimony, and
compel production of documents. See Section 19(c) of the Securities Act, Section 21(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act, Section 209(b) of the Advisers Act, and Section 42(b) of the
Investment Company Act. These statutory provisions do not limit the designation of
Commission officers to attorneys. Non-attorneys, such as staff accountants, analysts, and
investigators, also may be designated as officers and empowered to take testimony and issue
subpoenas.
Testimony may be recorded by audio, audiovisual, and/or stenographic means. Staff
should identify in the subpoena or subpoena cover letter the potential method(s) for recording the
testimony. With reasonable prior notice to the witness, staff may designate another method or
methods for recording the testimony in addition to that specified in the subpoena or subpoena
cover letter.
Rule 7(a) of the SEC’s Rules Relating to Investigations, 17 C.F.R. § 203.7(a), provides
that any person who is compelled or required to furnish documents or testimony at a formal
investigative proceeding shall, upon request, be shown the formal order of investigation. A
witness also may submit a written request for a copy of the formal order; the request may be
granted, at the discretion of Enforcement staff responsible for the investigation at the Assistant
Director level or higher, provided there are “reasons consistent both with the protection of
privacy of persons involved in the investigation and with the unimpeded conduct of the
investigation.” Id.
3.3.5.2.

Using a Background Questionnaire

Basics:
The background questionnaire is a document that the SEC staff uses to obtain important
background information from a witness. The questionnaire solicits a variety of personal
information from the witness, including, among other things, the witness’s date and place of

63

birth, the names and account numbers for all securities and brokerage accounts, a list of all
educational institutions attended and degrees received, and an employment history. The
information solicited in the background questionnaire is routinely asked for in testimony.
Considerations:
•

The witness is not required as a matter of law to comply with the SEC staff’s request to
complete the written background questionnaire. Disclosure of the information is entirely
voluntary on the witness’s part. There are no direct sanctions and thus no direct effects
for failing to provide all or any part of the requested information, although it should be
explained that this information will then be asked for in testimony.

•

If the witness chooses to provide a background questionnaire, the witness should be
examined about the document. For example, the witness should be asked to authenticate
the document, by requiring the witness to testify about its preparation, the source of
information contained in the document and the accuracy of the information.

•

Information provided pursuant to a background questionnaire is subject to the SEC’s
routine uses as listed in Form 1662. The witness also is liable, under Section 1001 of
Title 18 of the United States Code, if he or she knowingly makes any false statements in
the background questionnaire.

•

Background questionnaires, as exhibits to testimony transcripts, may become public if
they are produced during discovery in a subsequent litigation. To safeguard sensitive
personal information, such as a witness’s Social Security number, the staff may consider
omitting it from the Background Questionnaire. Rather than obtaining or confirming a
witness’s Social Security number in testimony, staff may elect instead to request that it be
submitted outside of testimony. e.g., in a letter.
3.3.5.3

Witness Right to Counsel

Basics:
•

Any person compelled to appear, or who appears by request or permission of the SEC, in
person at a formal investigative proceeding may be accompanied, represented and
advised by counsel, provided, however, that all witnesses shall be sequestered, and unless
permitted in the discretion of the officer conducting the investigation no witness or the
counsel accompanying any such witness shall be permitted to be present during the
examination of any other witness. See Rule 7(b) of the SEC’s Rules Relating to
Investigations, 17 C.F.R. § 203.7(b). Any person appearing with a witness in a formal
investigative proceeding may be asked by the officer conducting the examination to
confirm on-the-record that he or she is representing the witness as his or her counsel.

•

This means that a testifying witness may have an attorney present with him or her during
any formal investigative proceeding, and the attorney may (1) advise the witness before,
during and after the testimony; (2) question the witness briefly at the conclusion of the
testimony to clarify any of the answers the witness gave during testimony; and (3) make

64

summary notes during the witness’s testimony solely for the witness’s use. See Rule 7(c)
of the SEC’s Rules Relating to Investigations, 17 C.F.R. § 203.7(c). If the witness is
accompanied by counsel, he or she may consult privately.
•

“Counsel” is defined as any attorney representing a party or any other person
representing a party pursuant to Rule 102(b) of the SEC’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.102(b). See Rule 101(a) of the SEC’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.101(a).

•

Rule 102(b) of the SEC’s Rules of Practice states that in any proceeding a person may be
represented by an attorney at law admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the
United States or the highest court of any State (as defined in Section 3(a)(16) of the
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(16)); a member of a partnership may represent the
partnership; a bona fide officer of a corporation, trust or association may represent the
corporation, trust, or association; and an officer or employee of a state commission or of
a department or political subdivision of a state may represent the state commission or the
department or political subdivision of the state.

Considerations:
•

If a witness is not accompanied by counsel, the witness may advise the SEC employee
taking the testimony at any point during the testimony that he or she desires to be
accompanied, represented and advised by counsel. Testimony will be adjourned once to
afford the witness an opportunity to arrange for counsel.

•

The witness may be represented by counsel who also represents other persons involved in
the SEC’s investigation. For more information on Multiple Representations, see Section
4.1.1.1 of the Manual.
3.3.5.4

Going off the Record

The SEC employee taking the testimony controls the record. If a witness desires to go
off the record, the witness must indicate this to the SEC employee taking the testimony, who will
then determine whether to grant the witness’s request. The reporter will not go off the record at
the direction of the witness, or counsel for the witness. See Form SEC 1662 and Rules 6 and 7 of
the SEC’s Rules Relating to Investigations, 17 C.F.R. §§ 203.6 and 203.7.
3.3.5.5

Transcript Availability

Basics:
Rule 6 of the SEC’s Rules Relating to Investigations, 17 C.F.R. § 203.6, provides that:
Transcripts, if any, of formal investigative proceedings shall be recorded solely by the
official reporter, or by any other person or means designated by the officer conducting
the investigation. A person who has submitted documentary evidence or testimony in a
formal investigative proceeding shall be entitled, upon written request, to procure a copy
of his documentary evidence or a transcript of his testimony on payment of the
appropriate fees: Provided, however, That in a nonpublic formal investigative
65

proceeding the Commission may for good cause deny such request. In any event, any
witness, upon proper identification, shall have the right to inspect the official transcript of
the witness’s own testimony.
Persons requested to supply information voluntarily are allowed the rights provided by
Rule 6. If a witness wishes to purchase a copy of the transcript of his or her testimony, the
reporter will provide the witness with a copy of the appropriate form. Rule 6 does not permit a
witness to obtain or review documentary evidence provided by anyone other than the witness.
Further Information:
Assigned staff should consult with his or her supervisor for the procedures to be followed
to make a recommendation that the SEC deny a witness’s request for a transcript copy.
3.3.6

Special Cases
3.3.6.1

Contacting Employees of Issuers and Other Entities

When communicating with officers, employees and other constituents of issuers and
other organizations, staff should follow Rule 4.2 of the ABA Model Rules of Professional
Conduct, unless the applicable state version of that Rule is more restrictive or otherwise
determined to be more appropriate to the situation. All states have adopted rules of professional
conduct similar to Model Rule 4.2 to govern a lawyer’s communications with constituents of
represented organizations. Although the staff’s communications in the course of an investigation
will be governed by one or more state versions of Model Rule 4.2 (rather than the Model Rule
itself), communications that comply with the Model Rule and its commentary usually will
comply with applicable state counterparts to Model Rule 4.2.
Under the ABA Model Rules, contacts with represented persons are addressed by Model
Rule 4.2, which states:
In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the
representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by another
lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is
authorized to do so by law or a court order.
The Rule is made applicable to represented organizations through Comment [7] to Rule
4.2, which states:
In the case of a represented organization, this Rule prohibits communications with a
constituent of the organization who supervises, directs or regularly consults with the
organization’s lawyer concerning the matter or has authority to obligate the organization
with respect to the matter or whose act or omission in connection with the matter may be
imputed to the organization for purposes of civil or criminal liability. Consent of the
organization’s lawyer is not required for communication with a former constituent. If a
constituent of the organization is represented in the matter by his or her own counsel, the
consent by that counsel to a communication will be sufficient for purposes of this Rule.
Compare Rule 3.4(f). In communicating with a current or former constituent of an
66

organization, a lawyer must not use methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal
rights of the organization. See Rule 4.4.
If staff have questions about application of Model Rule 4.2, or a state’s version of that
rule, to a particular situation, they should contact OCC or the Professional Responsibility
Counsel in OGC.
3.3.6.2

Contacting Witnesses Residing Overseas

Basics:
The staff is encouraged to consult with the SEC’s Office of International Affairs (“OIA”)
as soon as the staff suspects any foreign connection to an investigation. Because countries have
varying requirements for contacting witnesses, staff should contact OIA before attempting to
contact a witness residing overseas. OIA can provide advice on the existence of any information
sharing mechanism in the country in which the witness resides, the uses to which information
can be put, and practical considerations, such as likely response time for the assistance needed
from a particular country. OIA also can prepare requests to foreign authorities and review drafts
for compliance with the requirements of any information sharing mechanism that exists and or
foreign law and practice. Depending on the needs of a particular case, OIA may arrange
conference calls or other meetings with the foreign counterpart, sometimes in advance of sending
a formal request for assistance.
Considerations:
As a general matter, the Division is able to obtain testimony from witnesses residing
overseas through a variety of mechanisms. These mechanisms include: information sharing
arrangements with foreign counterparts such as memoranda of understanding; mutual legal
assistance treaties; letters rogatory; ad hoc arrangements; and voluntary cooperation. OIA can
advise the staff as to which of these mechanisms is available in a particular foreign jurisdiction.
•

Memoranda of Understanding (“MOUs”)
MOUs are regulator-to-regulator arrangements regarding information sharing and
cooperation in securities matters. The SEC has entered into over 30 such sharing
arrangements with its foreign counterparts. The SEC is also a signatory to the
International Organization of Securities Commissions Multilateral MOU. This MOU is
the first global information sharing arrangement among securities regulators.
The scope of information that the SEC can obtain pursuant to an MOU varies depending
on the legal abilities of the particular foreign authority. Some, but not all, MOUs allow
the SEC to obtain witness statements.

•

Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (“MLATs”) (Criminal Matters)
Generally, MLATs are designed for the exchange of information in criminal matters and
are administered by the Department of Justice (“DOJ”). Although MLATs are primarily
arrangements to facilitate cross-border criminal investigations and prosecutions, the SEC
67

may be able to use this mechanism in certain cases. Some jurisdictions permit the SEC to
obtain information, including sworn testimony, through MLATs. U.S. criminal interest
in the matter may be a prerequisite to the ability of the SEC to obtain information through
MLATs. DOJ has signed numerous MLATs with foreign criminal authorities. MLATs
may be an effective mechanism to obtain assistance when an MOU with a particular
country either does not exist or does not permit the type of information sought from a
witness residing overseas.
•

Letters Rogatory
A letter rogatory is a formal request from a court in one country to the appropriate
judicial authority in another county. Generally, a letter rogatory is used in litigation to
request compulsion of testimony or other evidence, or to serve process on a person
located abroad. The execution of a request for judicial assistance by the foreign court is
based on comity between nations, absent a specific treaty such as the Hague Convention
on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters. Because a letter
rogatory generally can only be used to gather evidence in litigation, a letter rogatory may
have limited utility where a case is in the investigative stage.

•

Ad Hoc Arrangements
Even if no formal information sharing mechanism exists with respect to a particular
jurisdiction, the SEC nevertheless may be able to secure assistance in contacting a
witness overseas by working on an ad hoc basis with foreign authorities. Such ad hoc
arrangements often prove particularly helpful with emerging markets, whose securities
legislation continues to develop.

•

Voluntary Cooperation
Depending on the jurisdiction, it may be possible to request information directly from
persons located abroad on a voluntary basis. However, in some countries such efforts
may violate local statutes and laws. In still other jurisdictions, advance notice to the local
regulator and relevant authorities may be required. Division staff should consult OIA
even where the staff seeks only voluntary cooperation from a witness. Where seeking
voluntary cooperation, the staff should stress the voluntary nature of the inquiry.

Further Information:
For more information on contacting witnesses residing overseas, staff should contact
OIA.
3.3.7

Proffers and Proffer Agreements

Proffers of information and evidence by witnesses, including potential cooperating
witnesses, are an important method used by the staff to assess the potential value of information
and evidence. A proffer is generally required to evaluate whether to recommend that a
cooperation agreement be entered by the Division. Offering to proffer is often a method for
individuals and entities to initiate a discussion concerning the potential benefits of cooperation in
68

connection with an investigation or proceeding. Proffers are generally made directly by a
witness, but at times are preceded by a proffer by an attorney for the witness.
A proffer agreement is a written agreement generally providing that any statements made
by a person, on a specific date, may not be used against that individual in subsequent
proceedings, except that the Commission may use statements made during the proffer session as
a source of leads to discover additional evidence and for impeachment or rebuttal purposes if the
person testifies or argues inconsistently in a subsequent proceeding. The Commission also may
share the information provided by the proffering individual with appropriate authorities in a
prosecution for perjury, making a false statement or obstruction of justice.
Procedures:
Proffer agreements must be signed by a supervisor at or above the level of Assistant
Director. The staff uses a standard proffer agreement. Modifications to the standard agreement
should not be made without first consulting with OCC.
Considerations:
•

In most cases, the staff should require a potential cooperating individual to make a
detailed proffer before the use of the cooperation tools discussed in Section 6 of the
Manual.

•

To avoid potential misunderstandings, with few exceptions, proffer sessions with
witnesses should be conducted pursuant to written proffer agreements. Written
agreements are not necessary for proffers of information given by counsel to a witness.

•

If the staff conducts a joint proffer session with criminal authorities, the staff should
address any potential substantive or procedural issues with his or her supervisors, as well
as the Assistant United States Attorney or state prosecutor on the case, before the proffer
begins. In cases where the staff participates in a proffer with the criminal authorities and
the cooperating individual has not asked for a proffer letter from the Commission, the
staff should remind the individual that the proffer agreement with the criminal authorities
does not apply to the Commission.

4.

Privileges and Protections
4.1

Assertion of Privileges

4.1.1

Attorney-Client Privilege

Basics:
•

The attorney-client privilege protects from disclosure confidential communications
between attorney and client made when the client is seeking legal advice. The purpose of
the privilege is to encourage free and candid communication between attorney and client.

69

•

Elements necessary to establish the attorney-client privilege include:
o it is a communication
o the communication was made in confidence
o the communication was to an attorney
o the communication was by a client
o the communication was for the purpose of seeking or obtaining primarily legal advice

Considerations:
•

In order for the staff to credit an advice-of-counsel defense in an investigation, the party
asserting the defense must provide evidence sufficient to enable the staff to evaluate the
validity of the defense, even if this requires disclosure of privileged information. To
assert a valid advice-of-counsel defense, courts have held that the defendant must
establish that he or she (1) made complete disclosure to counsel; (2) requested counsel’s
advice as to the legality of the contemplated action; (3) received advice that it was legal;
and (4) relied in good faith on that advice.

•

Information that typically does not involve a confidential communication and therefore is
not privileged includes:
o identity of the client
o existence of the attorney-client relationship
o general reason why the attorney was retained
o fee arrangement between attorney and client
o billing statements, unless they include narrative descriptions that satisfy the elements
of a privilege

•

Crime-fraud exception to attorney-client privilege: Most courts require the party wishing
to invoke the crime-fraud exception to demonstrate that there is a factual basis for a
showing of probable cause to believe that a crime or fraud has been committed and the
communications in question were in furtherance of the crime or fraud. This burden is
normally not met by showing that the communications in question might provide
evidence of a crime or fraud but rather that the communication itself was in furtherance
of the crime or fraud and was intended to facilitate or conceal the crime or fraud.

•

Corporations asserting the attorney-client privilege: The attorney-client privilege can be
asserted by a corporation to protect communications between corporate employees and
in-house or outside counsel. Courts have held that to assert the attorney-client privilege,
a corporation must show that the communication came from a person who was employed

70

with the corporation at the time of the communication, the employee was seeking legal
advice from an attorney, and the communication was made within the scope of the
employee’s duties.
•

Questions to consider asking to test the assertion of the attorney-client privilege include:
o Who prepared the document?
o Who sent the document?
o To whom was the document sent?
o What was the date of the communication?
o What was the date on the document? What date was the document prepared, sent, or
received?
o Who are the attorney and client involved?
o What was the nature of the document (i.e., memorandum, letter, telegram, etc., and
generic subject matter)?
o Who are parties indicated on the document through carbon copy notations or
otherwise who were to receive the document, and all parties that in fact received or
saw the document?
o Who was present during the communication?
o Who are the parties to whom the substance of the communication was conveyed?
o Would all of the communication, if disclosed to the staff, reveal or tend to reveal a
communication from a client (made with the intention of confidentiality) to his or her
attorney in connection with clients seeking legal services or legal advice at a time
when the attorney was retained by that client?
o Would any segregable part of that communication not reveal or tend not to reveal
such a confidential communication?
o Did a retention agreement between the attorney and client exist and if so, what is the
date of such agreement?
o During what period of time did the attorney-client relationship exist?
o Was a legal fee charged the client by the attorney in connection with the matter
involving the communication, and if so, how much, and how, when and by whom was
it paid? If no fee was charged, was one discussed?
o What was the general nature of legal services rendered, and during what time period
were they rendered?
71

o Did the communication primarily involve a business dealing between the attorney and
client?
o Did the communication involve the client’s seeking business advice?
o Was the communication a grant of authority or instruction for the attorney to act
upon?
4.1.1.1

Multiple Representations

Basics:
It is not unusual for counsel to represent more than one party (employees of the same
company, for example). Representing more than one party in an investigation does not
necessarily present a conflict of interest, although it may heighten the potential for a conflict of
interest.
Considerations:
When an attorney represents multiple parties, staff in testimony typically informs the
party of the following statement in Form 1662:
You may be represented by counsel who also represents other persons involved in the
Commission’s investigation. This multiple representation, however, presents a potential
conflict of interest if one client’s interests are or may be adverse to another’s. If you are
represented by counsel who also represents other persons involved in the investigation,
the Commission will assume that you and counsel have discussed and resolved all issues
concerning possible conflicts of interest. The choice of counsel, and the responsibility for
that choice, is yours.
Further Information:
For additional information on representation of more than one party in testimony,
see Section 3.3.5.3 of the Manual.
4.1.2

Attorney Work Product Doctrine

Basics:
•

A party or the representing attorney may refuse to provide information on the basis that
the information requested is protected by the attorney work product doctrine. If the
documents or information requested were prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial,
or directly related to preparation for trial, then the work product doctrine generally
applies and the party seeking discovery has the burden of proving substantial need and
undue hardship. For material to be prepared in “anticipation of litigation,” the prospect
of litigation must be identifiable, although litigation need not have already commenced.

72

•

Elements of the doctrine as set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3) are the
following:
o documents and tangible things
o prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial
o by or for another party or by or for that party’s representative, including attorney,
consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent

•

Work product may be discovered, however, if “the party shows that it has substantial
need for the materials to prepare its case and cannot, without undue hardship, obtain their
substantial equivalent by other means.” Rule 26(b)(3)(A)(ii).

Considerations:
•

Voluntary disclosure of work product to the SEC generally constitutes a waiver for all
purposes as to the disclosed document or information.

•

In order for the staff to credit an advice-of-counsel defense in an investigation, the party
asserting the defense must provide evidence sufficient to enable the staff to evaluate the
validity of the defense, even if this requires disclosure of attorney work product. To
assert a valid advice-of-counsel defense, courts have held that the defendant must
establish that he or she (1) made complete disclosure to counsel; (2) requested counsel’s
advice as to the legality of the contemplated action; (3) received advice that it was legal;
and (4) relied in good faith on that advice.
4.1.3

The Fifth Amendment Privilege Against Self-Incrimination

Basics:
•

A witness testifying before the SEC may assert his or her Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination.

•

If a previous grant of immunity, or the expiration of the time limits for criminal
prosecution prescribed by the statute of limitations, eliminates the danger of selfincrimination, the witness may not invoke the privilege.

Considerations:
•

Staff typically will require testimony by or a declaration from the witness to assert the
witness’s Fifth Amendment privilege. Staff typically will not accept a letter from counsel
as an alternative to testimony or a declaration.
o Reasons for requiring a witness to appear in person to assert the Fifth Amendment
privilege include, but are not limited to, obtaining a clear and specific privilege
assertion on the record, allowing the staff to probe the scope of the privilege

73

assertion, and allowing the staff to determine whether there are grounds to challenge
the assertion.
o A witness may not make a blanket assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege.
o In some cases, allowing assertion of the privilege by declaration may be more
appropriate, for example, when time is of the essence.
•

The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination protects individuals and sole
proprietorships, but does not protect a collective entity, such as a corporation, or papers
held by an individual in a representative capacity for a collective entity.

•

Under the required records doctrine, the Fifth Amendment privilege against selfincrimination does not apply to records required to be kept by an individual under
government regulation, such as tax returns.

•

During litigation, the SEC can assert that an adverse inference should be drawn against a
defendant who has asserted the Fifth Amendment privilege.

•

If a witness testifying before the SEC asserts his or her Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination, the staff should state on the record that the staff member has
no authority to confer immunity, that the staff member has no intention of doing so, and
that any questions asked from that point on in the testimony will be with the
understanding that the witness may decline to answer on the basis that the response may
tend to incriminate the witness. Without compulsion to testify, there can be no claim that
immunity was granted. U.S. v. Orsinger, 428 F.2d 1105, 1114 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied,
400 U.S. 831 (1970) (witness who refused to testify under Commission subpoena, and
who was not compelled to testify, acquired no immunity from criminal prosecution). See
also U.S. v. Abrams, 357 F.2d 539, 549 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 1001 (1966).
4.2

Inadvertent Production of Privileged or Non-Responsive Documents

Basics:
Under Rule 502(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, 2 a disclosure to a federal agency of
information covered by the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection does not operate
as a waiver in a federal (or state) proceeding if:
(1)

the disclosure is inadvertent;

(2)

the holder of the privilege or protection took reasonable steps to prevent disclosure;
and

(3)

the holder promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error.

2

Rule 502 became effective on September 19, 2008, and applies in all proceedings commenced after that date
and, to the extent just and practicable, in all proceedings that were then pending.

74

Whether an inadvertent production is first identified by staff or by the producing party,
before determining how to proceed, staff should consult with his or her supervisor(s) and, if
appropriate, the Regional Director, Unit Chief, Chief Counsel, Chief Litigation Counsel, and/or
the Professional Responsibility Counsel in OGC. Generally, if an inadvertent production is
discovered by staff, staff will notify the party through his or her counsel of its receipt of
inadvertently produced documents.
Considerations:
•

Whether the staff should return (or sequester) an inadvertently produced document or has
a legally sound basis for using it is, in part, a function of applicable state professional
responsibility rules, as well as, in many cases, the applicable law of privilege and rules of
evidence. Under some states’ professional responsibility rules, the staff’s options may
depend on whether he or she was made aware of the inadvertent production before or
after reviewing the document.

•

Staff should determine how to proceed in consultation with his or her supervisors and/or
the others described above. Once a determination is made, staff typically informs the
party whether the staff intends to return, sequester, or use the document. Staff also may
inform the party whether and to whom staff has provided copies of the document outside
the SEC (e.g., a judge).

•

If it is determined that, based on a claim of privilege, a document should be returned to
the party, staff should require that the party promptly submit a privilege log for the
document.
4.2.1

Purposeful Production Without Privilege Review

Basics:
In some instances, a party may seek to produce documents to the staff before reviewing
them for privilege, while also seeking to preserve any claims of privilege on the materials. If it
will benefit the investigation, staff can choose to accept such a production by entering a written
agreement (the Model Agreement for Purposeful Production without Privilege Review) with the
producing party. Under the agreement, responsibility for identifying any privileged materials
resides solely with the party, and acceptance of the production is not an agreement to shift such
responsibility to the staff. Further, under the terms of the written agreement, the party must
agree, among other things, not to assert that the staff’s investigation has been tainted by the
staff’s receipt, review, examination, or use of any material later determined to be privileged.
Considerations:
•

The Division typically uses a Model Agreement for Purposeful Production without
Privilege Review. Staff should consult with OCC concerning any request to modify the
Model Agreement.

75

•

In determining whether to accept such a production and enter a written agreement, staff
should consider whether doing so will advance the investigation by expediting
production.

Further Information:
Staff should refer any questions about this issue to their supervisors and to OCC.
4.3

Waiver of Privilege

Basics:
The staff must respect legitimate assertions of the attorney-client privilege and attorney
work product protection. As a matter of public policy, the SEC wants to encourage individuals,
corporate officers and employees to consult counsel about the requirements and potential
violations of the securities laws. Likewise, non-factual or core attorney work product – for
example, an attorney’s mental impressions or legal theories – lies at the core of the attorney work
product doctrine.
A key objective in the staff’s investigations is to obtain relevant information, and parties
are, in fact, required to provide all relevant, non-privileged information and documents in
response to SEC subpoenas. The staff should not ask a party to waive the attorney-client
privilege or work product protection without prior approval of the Director or Deputy Director.
A proposed request for a privilege waiver should be reviewed initially with the Assistant
Director supervising the matter and that review should involve more senior members of
management as appropriate before being presented to the Director or Deputy Director.
Both entities and individuals may provide significant cooperation in investigations by
voluntarily disclosing relevant information. Voluntary disclosure of information need not
include a waiver of privilege to be an effective form of cooperation and a party’s decision to
assert a legitimate claim of privilege will not negatively affect their claim to credit for
cooperation. However, as discussed below, if a party seeks cooperation credit for timely
disclosure of relevant facts, the party must disclose all such facts within the party’s knowledge.
Corporations often gather facts through internal investigations regarding the conduct at
issue in the staff’s investigation. In corporate internal investigations, employees and other
witnesses associated with a corporation are often interviewed by attorneys. Certain notes and
memoranda generated from attorney interviews may be subject, at least in part, to the protections
of attorney-client privilege and/or attorney work product protection. To receive cooperation
credit for providing factual information obtained from the interviews, the corporation need not
necessarily produce, and the staff may not request without approval, protected notes or
memoranda generated by the attorneys’ interviews. To earn such credit, however, the corporation
must produce, and the staff always may request, relevant factual information—including relevant
factual information acquired through those interviews.
A party may choose to voluntarily disclose privileged communications or documents. In
this regard, the SEC does not view a party’s waiver of privilege as an end in itself, but only as a
means (where necessary) to provide relevant and sometimes critical information to the staff. See
76

Report of Investigation Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Commission Statement on the Relationship of Cooperation to Agency Enforcement Decisions,
Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 44969 n.3 (Oct. 23, 2001) (“Seaboard 21(a) Report”). In the
event a party voluntarily waives the attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the staff
cannot assure the party that, as a legal matter, the information provided to the staff during the
course of the staff’s investigation will not be subject to disclosure pursuant to subpoena, other
legal process, or the routine uses set forth in the Commission’s Forms 1661 and 1662.
Considerations:
•

The SEC encourages and rewards cooperation by parties in connection with staff’s
investigations. One important measure of cooperation is whether the party has timely
disclosed facts relevant to the investigation. Other measures of cooperation include, for
example, voluntary production of relevant factual information the staff did not directly
request and otherwise might not have uncovered; and requesting that corporate
employees cooperate with the staff and making all reasonable efforts to secure such
cooperation. The SEC’s policies with respect to cooperation are set forth in the Seaboard
21(a) Report, and in the Policy Statement concerning cooperation, 17 C.F.R. § 202.12
(see Section 6.1 of the Manual), which outline other factors that may be considered in
assessing whether to award credit for cooperation.

•

A party’s decision to assert a legitimate claim of attorney-client privilege or work product
protection will not negatively affect that party’s claim to credit for cooperation. The
appropriate inquiry in this regard is whether, notwithstanding a legitimate claim of
attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the party has disclosed all relevant
underlying facts within its knowledge.

•

By timely disclosing the relevant underlying facts, a party may demonstrate cooperation
for which the staff may give credit, while simultaneously asserting privilege. The timely
disclosure of relevant facts is considered along with all other cooperative efforts and
circumstances in determining whether and the extent to which the party should be
awarded credit for cooperation. See id.

•

In order for the staff to credit an advice-of-counsel defense in an investigation, the party
asserting the defense must provide evidence sufficient to enable the staff to evaluate the
validity of the defense, even if this requires disclosure of privileged information. To
assert a valid advice-of-counsel defense, courts have held that the defendant must
establish that he or she (1) made complete disclosure to counsel; (2) requested counsel’s
advice as to the legality of the contemplated action; (3) received advice that it was legal;
and (4) relied in good faith on that advice. Staff at the Assistant Director level or higher
should attempt to explore the possibility of an advice-of-counsel defense with a party’s
counsel at an early stage in the investigation. It is important to obtain all relevant
documents and testimony at the earliest possible date.

•

Staff should consider whether there may be circumstances that negate assertions of
privilege, such as the crime-fraud exception and prior non-privileged disclosure. These

77

and other such circumstances should be considered in analyzing the legitimacy of a
party’s assertion of privilege.
Further Information:
•

For more information on the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine, and
related exceptions, consult Sections 4.1.1 (Attorney-Client Privilege) and 4.1.2 (Attorney
Work Product Doctrine) of the Manual.

•

For information on the inadvertent production of privileged materials, consult Section 4.2
of the Manual.

•

For information on the production of privileged materials pursuant to a Confidentiality
Agreement, consult Section 4.3.1 of the Manual.

•

For more information on the factors considered by the Commission when crediting
cooperation, staff should consult the Seaboard 21(a) Report, with respect to corporations,
or Section 6.1 of the Manual with respect to individuals.
4.3.1

Confidentiality Agreements

Basics:
A confidentiality agreement is an agreement between the staff of the Division of
Enforcement and, typically, a company subject to investigation pursuant to which the company
agrees to produce materials that it considers to be privileged (such as reports of internal
investigations, interview memoranda, and investigative working papers). For its part, the staff
agrees not to assert that the entity has waived any privileges or attorney work-product protection
as to any third party by producing the documents, and agrees not to assert that production
resulted in a subject matter waiver. The staff also agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the
materials, except to the extent that the staff determines that disclosure is required by law or that
disclosure would be in furtherance of the SEC’s discharge of its duties and responsibilities. The
basis for the agreement is the interest of the staff in determining whether violations of the federal
securities laws have occurred, and the company’s interest in investigating and analyzing the
circumstances and people involved in the events at issue.
Considerations:
•

The Division typically uses a Model Confidentiality Agreement. The staff should not
agree to modifications to the Model Confidentiality Agreement without first consulting
with OCC and/or the Chief Litigation Counsel. The agreement must be signed by a
supervisor at or above the level of Assistant Director.

•

While obtaining materials that are otherwise potentially subject to privilege or the
protections of the attorney work-product doctrine can be of substantial assistance in
conducting an investigation, the staff should exercise judgment when deciding whether to
enter into a confidentiality agreement with a company under investigation.
Considerations include the following:
78

o Some courts have held that companies that produce otherwise privileged materials to
the SEC or the U.S. Department of Justice, even pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement, waived privilege in doing so.
o Some companies have important pertinent operations in one or more foreign
jurisdictions, which may have data privacy and other laws that will restrict the staff’s
ability to obtain evidence. The company itself may have access to the persons in such
jurisdictions (especially if they are still employees) and to other sources of evidence
(such as documents and e-mails). In such instances, the company may be able to
convey important information to the staff by producing interview memoranda and
through reports of findings derived from otherwise restricted sources.
4.4

Compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974

Basics:
•

The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, establishes requirements for the solicitation
and maintenance by agencies of personal information regarding members of the public.

•

When obtaining information from the public, the statute generally requires the staff to
provide notice with respect to the authority for the solicitation and whether disclosure is
voluntary or mandatory; the principal purposes for seeking the information; the effect of
refusing to provide the information; and the “routine uses” of the information. The
statute generally prohibits any disclosure of personal information unless the disclosure is
within one of the statute’s exemptions (including the exemption for “routine uses”).

Considerations:
The Privacy Act notice requirement referred to above is generally met by providing a
copy of Form 1661 or Form 1662 to the person or entity from which information is sought. The
forms contain the list of uses that may be made of personal information. Generally, disclosures
in aid of the staff’s investigations will be covered by one or more of the routine uses.
Further Information:
•

For questions relating to the Privacy Act, staff should contact OCC.

•

For further information on Forms 1661 and 1662, see Section 3.2.3.1 of the Manual.

•

For further information on how to meet the Privacy Act requirements when conducting
voluntary telephone interviews, see Section 3.3.3.1 of the Manual.
4.5

Compliance with the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978

Basics:
•

The Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. §§ 3401 to 3422) provides
individuals with a privacy interest in their banking records held by a financial institution.

79

Section 21(h) of the Exchange Act contains additional RFPA procedures available only to
the SEC.
•

The RFPA applies when staff seeks the financial records of a “customer” (i.e., an
individual or partnership of five or fewer individuals) from a “financial institution” (e.g.,
a bank, mortgage lending company or trust company, but not regulated entities, such as
broker-dealers or investment advisers). Generally, the staff may only obtain customer
records from a financial institution pursuant to subpoena, after providing the customer
with notice of the subpoena and an opportunity to challenge production in court. Notice
must also be provided when the staff discloses information obtained pursuant to the
RFPA to another federal agency (absent an exemption, such as that for disclosure to the
Department of Justice).

Considerations:
•

To avoid inadvertent non-compliance, the staff should be aware of RFPA restrictions
whenever seeking banking records, including banking records of corporate entities.

•

In certain situations, including where notice to the customer may impede an investigation
or result in the movement of funds out of U.S. jurisdiction, staff may consider seeking a
court order under Section 21(h) of the Exchange Act to delay notice; the staff may also
consider filing an emergency action to obtain a freeze order to protect investor funds.

•

The staff should also be aware of RFPA restrictions whenever disclosing information
obtained from a financial institution to another federal agency.

Further Information:
For further information about the RFPA and its requirements, staff should contact OCC.
4.6

Compliance with the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986

Basics:
•

The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510 to 2711,
expanded the wiretap laws to protect the contents of electronic communications (e.g., email) and other subscriber or customer records held by third-party electronic
communications service providers.

•

As drafted, the ECPA provides that the content of communications held by a third-party
service provider for 180 days or less can be obtained only by criminal law enforcement
authorities pursuant to a warrant or court order, but that contents held for more than 180
days may be obtained by a government agency pursuant to a subpoena. However, staff
should consult with OCC before issuing a subpoena to any service provider for the
content of e-mails or other stored electronic communications.

•

The staff can obtain the content of communications either directly from the sender or
intended recipient, or from a service provider with subscriber or customer consent.
80

•

The ECPA also authorizes agencies to obtain telephone records and e-mail records (other
than content) by subpoena. This information includes the name, address, local and long
distance telephone connection records, or records of session times and durations; length
of service (including start date) and types of service utilized; telephone or instrument
number or other subscriber number or identity, including any temporarily assigned
network address; and the means and source of payment for such service (including any
credit card or bank account number). No subscriber or customer notice is required when
obtaining such records.

Considerations:
•

The staff should be aware of ECPA restrictions whenever seeking information or records
from persons who provide computerized communication services to the public. These
service providers include online information services, national and local entities that
permit customers to gain access to the internet, and any other person that permits
customers to communicate via e-mail or bulletin boards. Access to information and
records from any of these entities may be subject to the ECPA.

•

All requests for information from service providers (except telephone companies when
seeking telephone records) must be coordinated with OCC.

•

The ECPA applies only to records held by third-party service providers, and hence does
not apply to e-mail held by the sender or addressee, or held on the servers of a company
that provides internal e-mail services for its own employees.

•

As a result of changes in the language of Section 2703 of the ECPA, and in telephone
billing practices, service providers have increasingly submitted requests for
reimbursement for production of transactional records regarding telephone and electronic
communication services. The staff continues to believe that such reimbursement was not
contemplated at the time the statute was enacted; however, reasonable invoices submitted
after compliance with staff subpoenas may be considered. Assigned staff should consult
with their supervisors and OCC if they receive a request for reimbursement.

Further Information:
For further information on whether the ECPA may apply and the procedures to follow
when it does, staff should consult OCC.
4.7

Handling Bank Secrecy Act Material

Bank Secrecy Act information can provide valuable leads in investigations. However,
BSA information often contains sensitive data or Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”). In
addition, Suspicious Activity Reports (“SARs”) are protected by the BSA and related regulations
that prohibit improper disclosures. 3 The purpose of a SAR is to report known or suspected
3

31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(2)(A); see, e.g., 31 C.F.R. § 1023.320 (disclosure of SARs filed by brokers
or dealers in securities).
81

violations of law or suspicious activity observed by financial institutions. Information obtained
from SARs provides an additional resource for identifying regulated entities and individuals that
may be engaged in conduct that constitutes potential violations of the federal securities laws or
poses an increased risk of harm to the investing public.
Staff generally may share SARs and SAR information with other SEC staff when
required in the context of an investigation. However,
•

All SAR materials must be segregated, marked to indicate that they contain sensitive
SAR information, and properly secured.

•

In investigations and litigation, SEC production of SARs or documents identified by the
filer as supporting the filing of a SAR is generally prohibited.

•

Staff may share SARs and SAR information with certain other government agencies only
under very limited circumstances and after implementing appropriate safeguards.

•

SAR materials cannot be shown to witnesses or marked as exhibits in testimony.

•

Staff may not disclose SAR information or its existence to persons who may be assisting
in a matter, such as an Independent Compliance Consultant or Receiver.

Further Information:
•

Staff should contact the Division’s BSA Review Group for specific information and
guidance about how to properly handle SARs and other materials filed pursuant to the
BSA.

•

Working with Other Agencies and Organizations
5.1

Disclosure of Information and Access Requests

Basics:
All information obtained or generated by SEC staff during investigations or examinations
should be presumed confidential and nonpublic unless disclosure has been specifically
authorized. The SEC’s rules permit the staff, by delegated authority, to grant access to nonpublic
information to domestic and foreign governmental authorities, SROs, and other persons specified
in Section 24(c) of the Exchange Act and Rule 24c-1 thereunder. Disclosures of such
information to members of the general public will normally be made only pursuant to the
Freedom of Information Act.

82

Rule 2: The Discussion Rule:
Cooperation and coordination with other law enforcement agencies often require the staff
to engage in discussions of nonpublic information prior to the grant of a formal access request.
Rule 2 of the SEC’s Rules Relating to Investigations was adopted to permit discussions with
those persons who may obtain access to nonpublic information through the SEC’s access
program. Discussions under Rule 2 must be authorized by officials at or above the level of
Assistant Director. Rule 2 extends only to the conduct of discussions and not to the furnishing of
nonpublic documents. See Rule 2 of the SEC’s Rules Relating to Investigations, 17 C.F.R.
§ 203.2.
The Access Program:
Section 24(c) of the Exchange Act and Rule 24c-1 authorize the SEC to grant access to
nonpublic information in enforcement files. Note, however, that work product and other
privileged information is rarely disclosed, even when third-parties are granted access to the other
materials in nonpublic files, and should not be disclosed without specific supervisory approval.
In addition, information obtained by the SEC from other agencies should be safeguarded, and the
staff should comply with all conditions placed on the information by the agency that provided
access.
Rule 24c-1 authorizes disclosure to the following classes of requestors:
•

Federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities

•

self-regulatory and similar organizations

•

foreign financial regulatory authorities

•

Securities Investor Protection Corporation and its trustees

•

trustees in bankruptcy

•

trustees, receivers, masters, special counsels, or others court-appointed persons charged
with performing functions arising from securities litigation

•

professional licensing or oversight authorities that are government-sponsored (e.g., bar
associations that are part of a state’s court system)

•

agents, employees or representatives of the above persons

Access Procedures:
The SEC’s rules require that all access requests be in writing and signed by an official
who is in a sufficiently senior or supervisory position to make and enforce required
representations. Requestors are generally expected to use the Division’s template access letters
and direct the letter to the assigned Assistant Director.

83

The access request should be entered into the Hub. The authority to grant access has
been sub-delegated to senior officers at or above the level of Associate Director or Associate
Regional Director. When an access request has been approved, the staff should prepare an
access grant letter for signature by assigned supervisory staff at the Assistant Director level or
higher. Staff should retain the original access request and grant letters.
Disclosure of Whistleblower Identifying Information
There are strict limitations on the Commission’s authority to disclose information that
could reasonably be expected to reveal the identity of a whistleblower (“whistleblower
identifying information”) to other government agencies, either orally (pursuant to the Discussion
Rule) or in response to an Access Request. The Exchange Act expressly provides the
Commission with the authority to disclose whistleblower identifying information to certain
regulatory and law enforcement authorities when “necessary to accomplish the purposes of [the
Exchange Act] and to protect investors.” Exchange Act § 21F(h)(2)(D). Making such a
disclosure requires Commission authorization, which can be granted by the Division Director
exercising delegated authority. Disclosure to an agency not enumerated in Exchange Act Section
21F(h)(2), whether orally or in response to an Access Request, cannot be approved using
delegated authority. If staff propose to disclose whistleblower identifying information to an
agency not enumerated in Exchange Act Section 21F(h)(2), they should contact OCC or OWB.
Further Information:
For further information regarding the access program and procedures, staff should consult
with OCC. For further information regarding disclosure of whistleblower identifying
information to another regulatory or law enforcement authority, staff should consult with OWB.
5.2

Cooperation with Criminal Authorities

Cooperating with criminal authorities is an important component of the SEC’s
enforcement mission. The SEC is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with
upholding the federal securities laws. The SEC has authority to bring civil, but not criminal,
actions to enforce those laws. This authority is not compromised when the Department of Justice
or state criminal authorities conduct a criminal investigation and/or make a determination to
bring criminal charges concurrent with the SEC’s investigation and/or civil action. Nonetheless,
there are certain unique considerations that arise when cooperating with criminal authorities, as
discussed in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 of the Manual.
5.2.1

Parallel Investigations

Basics:
Parallel civil and criminal proceedings are not uncommon. 4 In furtherance of the SEC’s
mission and as a matter of public policy, the staff is encouraged to work cooperatively with
4

The Supreme Court recognized in United States v. Kordel, 397 U.S. 1, 11 (1970) that parallel civil and criminal
proceedings are appropriate and constitutional. As the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit put it in the leading case
of SEC v. Dresser, 628 F.2d 1368, 1377 (D.C. Cir. 1980), “effective enforcement of the securities laws require that

84

criminal authorities, to share information, and to coordinate their investigations with parallel
criminal investigations when appropriate. There are, however, a number of considerations the
staff should be mindful of when conducting a parallel investigation and when determining
whether to seek authorization to bring a case that involves a parallel criminal investigation.
Because each case presents a unique set of circumstances, assigned staff should consult with
supervisors whenever they are involved in parallel proceedings.
Considerations:
While every situation is different, the staff typically should keep the following
considerations in mind when conducting a parallel investigation and when determining whether
to seek authorization to bring a case that involves a parallel criminal investigation:
•

It is important that the civil investigation has its own independent civil investigative
purpose and not be initiated to obtain evidence for a criminal prosecution. This does not
prevent the staff from taking an action if the action will provide a benefit to both the
SEC’s case and the parallel criminal matter. It does mean, however, that staff should not
take an SEC civil investigative action for which the sole aim is to benefit the criminal
matter.

•

The staff should make its own independent decision about what documents to request,
what investigative testimony to take, what questions to ask during testimony, the location
of testimony and similar matters.

•

If asked by counsel or any individual whether there is a parallel criminal investigation,
staff should direct counsel or the individual to the section of Form 1662 dealing with
“Routine Uses of Information,” 5 and state that it is the general policy of the Commission
not to comment on investigations conducted by law enforcement authorities responsible
for enforcing criminal laws. Staff should also invite any person who raises such issues to
contact criminal authorities if they wish to pursue the question of whether there is a
parallel criminal investigation. Should counsel or the individual ask which criminal
authorities they should contact, staff should decline to answer unless authorized by the
relevant criminal authorities.

the SEC and [the Department of] Justice be able to investigate possible violations simultaneously.” Other courts
have issued opinions to the same effect. E.g., SEC v. First Financial Group of Texas, 659 F.2d 660, 666-67 (5th Cir.
1981) (“The simultaneous prosecution of civil and criminal actions is generally unobjectionable.”); United States v.
Stringer, 521 F.3d 1189, 1191 (9th Cir. 2008) (“There is nothing improper about the government undertaking
simultaneous criminal and civil investigations. . .”). Moreover, the federal securities laws themselves expressly
provide that the SEC can share information gathered in a civil investigation with other government agencies and
provide information to the Department of Justice for a determination whether to institute criminal proceedings. See
Section 20(b), Securities Act; Section 21(d), Exchange Act; 17 C.F.R. § 240.24c-1 (access to nonpublic
information).
5
This section of Form 1662 states that “The Commission often makes its files available to other government
agencies, particularly United States Attorneys and state prosecutors. There is a likelihood that information supplied
by you will be made available to such agencies where appropriate. Whether or not the Commission makes its files
available to other government agencies is, in general, a confidential matter between the Commission and such
governmental agencies.”

85

•

Supervisors must be involved in all significant discussions and written communications
with criminal authorities.

•

Generally, sharing information with criminal prosecutors is permissible, even though the
sharing of information is intended to and does in fact assist criminal prosecutors. (For
more information regarding the Discussion Rule and access requests, see Section 5.1 of
the Manual.) In addition, in certain circumstances it is appropriate for criminal
authorities to ask SEC staff to refrain from taking actions that would harm the criminal
investigations, and likewise it can be appropriate for SEC staff to ask criminal authorities
not to take action that would harm our investigations. Each case is unique and assigned
staff should discuss these and other considerations with their supervisors.

Further Information:
•

For more information on joint proffer sessions, see Section 6.2.1 of the Manual.
5.2.2

Grand Jury Matters

Basics:
The SEC is generally not privy to grand jury matters. Grand jury matters are subject to
the confidentiality restrictions set forth in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) and
analogous state rules of criminal procedure. Rule 6(e) provides for secrecy of all “matter(s)
occurring before the grand jury,” subject to certain exceptions.
Considerations:
•

Subject to the limitations in Rule 6(e) and similar state rules, the staff may receive
information from the criminal authorities about the status of the criminal investigation
and the future investigative plans of the criminal authorities.

•

Before receiving information from the criminal authorities in an investigation, staff
should inquire whether any of the information provided comes directly or indirectly from
grand jury proceedings, including subpoenas.

•

If staff comes into possession of grand jury materials, he or she should immediately
inform his or her supervisor to take appropriate steps.
5.3

Cooperation with the Food and Drug Administration

Authority:
•

Section 331(j) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act prohibits the Food and Drug
Administration (“FDA”) from disclosing trade secrets, even to other federal agencies
such as the SEC.

•

The FDA may share other nonpublic records with other federal agencies, but before
disclosing such information the FDA must receive a written agreement that the
86

information will not be further disclosed without written permission from the FDA. See
21 C.F.R. § 20.85.
•

The FDA will not agree to further disclosure of confidential commercial information
without the consent of the owner or submitter of the information.

•

Before the FDA will grant permission for any further disclosure, the agency will review
each document to identify potentially privileged or otherwise protected information.

•

The Commissioner of Food and Drugs must authorize any investigative testimony by
FDA employees. See 21 C.F.R. § 20.1(c).

Basics:
Staff may seek information from the FDA in investigations arising from referrals by the
FDA, or in which the FDA may have relevant information. For example, a company’s public
statements about the status for FDA approval of its product may cause the staff to seek
information from the FDA about its review of the product. Before making any request to the
FDA, staff should review the statutes and regulations that govern the FDA’s ability to disclose
information to SEC staff. Staff should also consult with their supervisors about the scope of the
request and the appropriate addressee. The designated Enforcement FDA liaison should be
informed of requests.
To obtain nonpublic information or records, staff can prepare a written request, including:
•

identification of the type of information requested

•

whether the request is the result of an ongoing investigation

•

acknowledgement that trade secret information cannot be disclosed

•

agreement not to further disclose the nonpublic information without written consent from
the FDA, or, in the case of confidential commercial information, the submitter of the
information
The written request should be addressed to an appropriate FDA contact person.

To obtain investigative testimony from an FDA employee, staff can prepare a written
request, including:
•

identification of the employee whose testimony is sought

•

the subject matter of the requested testimony and why the testimony is appropriate under
21 C.F.R. § 20.1

•

how the testimony would serve the public interest and promote the objectives of the FDA

87

The written request should be addressed to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. Before
requesting testimony from an FDA employee, staff should contact the appropriate FDA lawyer.
To request FDA permission to make further disclosure of nonpublic records or
information that was provided by the FDA, staff should prepare a written request and attach
copies of the documents or transcripts it wishes to disclose.
Considerations:
•

Documents relating to FDA consideration of applications for new drugs or biologics can
be extremely voluminous—sometimes millions of pages—so staff should consider the
extent to which they are relevant to its investigation before making broad requests for all
documents relating to a product.

•

When preparing to litigate a case in which nonpublic FDA documents or testimony
transcripts will be part of the SEC’s initial disclosure, staff should keep in mind that
before the FDA consents to further disclosure, it will conduct a review of each page to
determine whether any of the material is privileged. Because this review can take a very
long time, staff should allow ample time for that review before filing a case or in the
litigation discovery schedule.

•

If staff expects to charge a defendant who is not the owner of the information (for
example, a current or former employee of the company), staff should seek consent from
the company for the disclosure as early as practical, because the FDA will not agree to
further disclosure of confidential commercial information without the consent of the
owner or submitter of the information.

Further information:
•

Staff should refer any questions about FDA matters to the designated Enforcement
Division liaison or OCC.

•

For more information on the FDA, see Inside the FDA, a manual available on the FDA’s
public website, www.fda.gov.
5.4

Cooperation with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board

Basics:
The SEC and the PCAOB have a mutual interest in ensuring that investigations relating
to the audit profession are properly coordinated. This will help to promote, among other things,
consistent regulatory approaches as well as efficient and cost effective investigations and
enforcement actions.

88

Considerations:
•

The SEC and PCAOB generally have concurrent jurisdiction over auditors but there may
be instances in which it may be preferable for one organization to be principally
responsible for investigating an auditor’s conduct.

•

Some of the factors the staff may wish to evaluate when coordinating investigations with
the PCAOB include differences between possible charges and remedies, the nature of the
conduct, and the standards involved.
5.5

Coordination and Consultation with Banking Agencies

Basics:
Under Section 241 of Subtitle D of Title II of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the SEC
“shall consult and coordinate comments with the appropriate Federal banking agency before
taking any action or rendering any opinion with respect to the manner in which any insured
depository institution or depository institution holding company reports loan loss reserves in its
financial statement, including the amount of any such loan loss reserves.” Therefore, staff
should contact the relevant banking agency prior to contacting a bank about a loan loss
allowance matter:
•

For national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies of
foreign banks, contact the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

•

For bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, or commercial lending
companies, contact the Federal Reserve.

•

For State savings associations, contact the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
5.6

Informal Referrals from Enforcement

Introduction:
The staff may informally refer a matter to federal or state criminal authorities, SROs, the
PCAOB, or state agencies. The decision to make an informal referral should be made in the
Home Office by officials at or above the level of Associate Director. In the regional offices, the
decision to make an informal referral should be made by officials at or above the level of
Associate Regional Director.
The staff may also determine that it is appropriate to refer a matter or information
concerning potential professional misconduct to state bar associations or other state professional
associations or licensing boards. Such referrals, however, are considered Commission actions
and the staff must consult with the Office of the General Counsel, to which the Commission has
delegated this authority, in order for a referral to be made.

89

Authority:
A number of SEC rules grant the Commission the authority to make informal referrals, which
authority the Commission has delegated to staff.
•

Rule 5(b) of the SEC’s Informal and Other Procedures, 17 C.F.R. § 202.5(b):
After investigation or otherwise the Commission may in its discretion take one or
more of the following actions: Institution of administrative proceedings looking to
the imposition of remedial sanctions, initiation of injunctive proceedings in the
courts, and, in the case of a willful violation, reference of the matter to the
Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. The Commission may also, on
some occasions, refer the matter to, or grant requests for access to its files made
by, domestic and foreign governmental authorities or foreign securities
authorities, SROs such as stock exchanges or the [Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, Inc.], and other persons or entities.

•

Rule 2 of the SEC’s Rules Relating to Investigations, 17 C.F.R. § 203.2:
Information or documents obtained by the Commission in the course of any
investigation or examination, unless made a matter of public record, shall be
deemed non-public, but the Commission approves the practice whereby officials
of the Divisions of Enforcement, Corporation Finance, [Trading and Markets],
and Investment Management and [OIA] at the level of Assistant Director or
higher, and officials in Regional Offices at the level of Assistant Regional
Director or higher, may engage in and may authorize members of the
Commission’s staff to engage in discussions with persons identified in Section
240.24c-1(b) of this chapter concerning information obtained in individual
investigations or examinations, including formal investigations conducted
pursuant to Commission order.

•

Rule 24c-1(b) of the Exchange Act, 17 C.F.R. § 240.24c-1(b):
The Commission may, in its discretion and upon a showing that such information
is needed, provide nonpublic information in its possession to any of the following
persons if the person receiving such nonpublic information provides such
assurances of confidentiality as the Commission deems appropriate:
(1) A federal, state, local or foreign government or any political subdivision,
authority, agency or instrumentality of such government;
(2) A [SRO] as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Act, or any similar organization
empowered with self-regulatory responsibilities under the federal securities laws
(as defined in Section 3(a)(47) of the Act), the Commodity Exchange Act (7
U.S.C. § 1, et seq.), or any substantially equivalent foreign statute or regulation;
(3) A foreign financial regulatory authority as defined in Section 3(a)(51) of the
Act;
90

(4) The Securities Investor Protection Corporation or any trustee or counsel for a
trustee appointed pursuant to Section 5(b) of the Securities Investor Protection
Act of 1970;
(5) A trustee in bankruptcy;
(6) A trustee, receiver, master, special counsel or other person that is appointed by
a court of competent jurisdiction or as a result of an agreement between the
parties in connection with litigation or an administrative proceeding involving
allegations of violations of the securities laws (as defined in Section 3(a)(47) of
the Act) or the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. Part 201, or otherwise,
where such trustee, receiver, master, special counsel or other person is specifically
designated to perform particular functions with respect to, or as a result of, the
litigation or proceeding or in connection with the administration and enforcement
by the Commission of the federal securities laws or the Commission’s Rules of
Practice;
(7) A bar association, state accountancy board or other federal, state, local or
foreign licensing or oversight authority, or a professional association or selfregulatory authority to the extent that it performs similar functions; or
(8) A duly authorized agent, employee or representative of any of the above
persons.
5.6.1

Informal Referrals to Criminal Authorities

Basics:
Staff inquiries or investigations may reveal conduct that warrants informal referral to
criminal law enforcement authorities – including federal, state or foreign criminal law
enforcement authorities. If there is a matter or conduct that appears to warrant an informal
referral, staff generally should follow the procedures below:
•

Assigned staff should consult with their direct supervisors and obtain approval at the
Associate Director, Unit Chief, or Associate Regional Director level to informally refer
the matter or conduct. Informal referrals to foreign criminal authorities should also first
be discussed with OIA so that consideration is given to the policies and procedures of the
foreign authorities.

•

Once given approval by an Associate Director, Unit Chief, or Associate Regional
Director, assigned staff, along with their supervisors, may notify the appropriate criminal
authorities.

•

Staff then may invite the criminal authorities to make an access request (see Section 5.1
regarding access requests). When the access request has been approved, staff may share
documents from the investigative file. Staff may not forward documents to the criminal
authorities prior to the approval of the access request.

91

•

After an informal referral to criminal authorities is made, staff is encouraged and
expected to maintain periodic communication with the criminal authorities concerning
the status of any criminal investigation. See Section 5.2 of the Manual for information
relating to parallel investigations, the grand jury secrecy rule, and other concerns when
cooperating with criminal authorities.

Considerations:
•

In determining whether to make an informal referral to criminal law enforcement
authorities, the staff may consider, among other things, the egregiousness of the conduct,
whether recidivism is a factor, and whether the involvement of criminal authorities will
provide additional meaningful protection to investors.

•

In determining whether to make an informal referral to federal, state, or foreign criminal
authorities, the staff may also consider jurisdictional factors, such as where the conduct
occurred or the domicile of the possible violators or victims.
5.6.2

Informal Referrals to Self-Regulatory Organizations

Basics:
In the course of conducting an inquiry or investigation, the staff may determine that it
would be appropriate to refer the matter, or certain conduct, informally to one or more SROs. In
particular, if an inquiry or investigation concerns matters over which SROs have enforcement
authority (e.g., financial industry standards, rules and requirements related to securities trading
and brokerage), staff should evaluate whether to contact the SRO about the matter and assess
whether it would be appropriate for the SRO to consider investigating the matter in lieu of, or in
addition to, an SEC Enforcement investigation. Because SROs may impose disciplinary or
remedial sanctions against their members or associated individuals, staff generally should make
an effort to apprise the SRO about conduct that may violate the rules of the SRO. Internally,
staff generally should consult as needed with OMI and/or the Division of Trading and Markets in
evaluating potential informal referrals to SROs.
If there is a matter or conduct that appears to warrant an informal referral, staff generally
should follow the procedures below:
•

Assigned staff should consult initially with their direct supervisors, as well as OMI and/or
the Division of Trading and Markets, as appropriate.

•

Assigned staff must obtain approval at the Associate Director, Unit Chief, or Associate
Regional Director level to refer the matter or conduct informally.

•

Once given approval, assigned staff, along with their supervisors, may notify the
appropriate liaison at the SRO to discuss the matter or conduct, and a possible informal
referral.

92

•

Staff then may invite the SRO to make an access request (see Section 5.1 of the Manual
regarding access requests). When the access request has been approved, staff may share
documents from the investigative file. Staff may not forward documents to the SRO
prior to the approval of the access request.

•

After an informal referral to an SRO is made, staff should maintain periodic
communication with the SRO concerning the status of the SRO inquiry or investigation
and periodically assess whether any or additional SEC Enforcement measures should be
taken.

Considerations:
•

Staff should evaluate whether an informal referral is warranted in the early stages of an
inquiry or investigation. As the investigation progresses, the staff should periodically
review the record to determine whether a new or additional informal referral may be
appropriate.

•

Staff should make efforts to continue communicating with SRO staff throughout the
SRO’s inquiry or investigation to determine whether SEC staff and SRO staff are
investigating the same conduct, and so that SEC staff is aware of any determination by
the SRO not to pursue an investigation or certain avenues of investigation.

Further information:
•

Staff should contact their supervisors and/or OMI with any questions about making an
informal referral to an SRO.

•

For guidance regarding receiving referrals from an SRO, see Section 2.2.2.5 of the Manual.
5.6.3 Informal Referrals to the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board

Basics:
In certain instances, Enforcement staff may refer matters regarding auditor misconduct
informally to the PCAOB, which is authorized, under Section 105 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to
conduct investigations, and impose disciplinary or remedial sanctions against registered public
accounting firms and their associated persons. If there is a matter that may be appropriate for
referral, assigned staff generally should follow the procedures below:
•

Assigned staff should consult initially with their supervisors.

•

Assigned staff should then get approval at or above the Associate Director, Unit Chief, or
Associate Regional Director level to refer the matter informally.

•

Assigned staff then should discuss the matter with the Chief Accountant of Enforcement,
and secure his or her approval for making the referral.

93

•

Assigned staff then should, along with their supervisor, or through the office of
Enforcement’s Chief Accountant, call the head of enforcement, or another designated
official, at the PCAOB, and discuss the matter.

•

Staff then can invite the PCAOB to make an access request (see Section 5.1 of the
Manual). Once the access request has been approved, staff can share documents from the
investigative file. Staff should provide a copy of the access request to the Chief
Accountant of Enforcement.

Considerations:
Staff should keep in mind the following considerations when making a referral to the
PCAOB:
•

Staff should consider evaluating whether to refer a matter as early as the inception of an
investigation, and in any event, as the investigation progresses.

•

Staff should continue communication with PCAOB staff throughout the PCAOB’s
investigation, to determine whether SEC staff and PCAOB staff are investigating the
same conduct, and so that SEC staff are alerted to any determination by the PCAOB not
to pursue its investigation.

Further Information:
•

Staff should refer any questions about making an informal referral to the PCAOB to the
Chief Accountant of Enforcement.

•

For guidance regarding receiving tips from the PCAOB, see Section 2.2.2.2 of the
Manual.
5.6.4

Informal Referrals to State Agencies

Basics:
Congress created a dual securities regulatory system in which both federal and state
agencies serve specific, valuable functions in protecting investors. In the course of conducting
an inquiry or investigation, the staff may determine that it would be appropriate to refer the
matter, or certain conduct, informally to state regulators. It may be appropriate for the state
agency to investigate the matter in lieu of, or in addition to, an SEC Enforcement investigation.
If there is a matter or conduct that appears to warrant an informal referral, staff generally
should follow the procedures below:
•

Assigned staff should consult with their direct supervisors and obtain approval at the
Associate Director, Unit Chief, or Associate Regional Director level to refer the matter or
conduct informally.

94

•

Once approval has been obtained, assigned staff along with their supervisors may contact
the state agency and discuss with them the relevant findings of the inquiry or
investigation to date and explain why the staff is referring the matter informally.

•

Staff may then invite the state agency to make an access request (see Section 5.1 of the
Manual regarding access requests). When the access request has been approved, staff
may share documents from the investigative file. Staff may not forward documents to the
state agency prior to the approval of the access request.

Considerations:
Assigned staff should discuss with their supervisors whether it may be appropriate to
refer a matter or certain conduct to the state informally. For example, a state may have a
particular interest in a case or type of case, the victims or parties may be concentrated in a
particular geographic location, the conduct may be limited, though significant, or there may be
no federal jurisdiction. In the early stages of an inquiry or investigation, staff should evaluate
whether an informal referral is warranted. As the investigation progresses, the staff is
encouraged to periodically review the record to determine whether a new or additional informal
referral may be appropriate. Staff should continue communicating with the state agency after an
informal referral has been made.
6.

Cooperation

The staff should carefully consider the use of different tools to encourage and facilitate
cooperation by individuals and companies to advance its investigations and related enforcement
actions.
6.1

Analytical Frameworks

6.1.1

Framework for Evaluating Cooperation by Individuals

In January 2010, the Commission issued a policy statement articulating a framework for
evaluating cooperation by individuals in the Commission’s investigations and actions. Policy
Statement of the Securities and Exchange Commission Concerning Cooperation by Individuals
in its Investigations and Related Enforcement Actions, Securities Exchange Act Release No.
61340 (Jan. 13, 2010) (http://www.sec.gov/rules/policy/2010/34-61340.pdf). This policy
statement can be found at 17 CFR § 202.12. The policy statement identified four general
considerations to use in assessing cooperation:
(a)

Assistance provided by the individual. The Commission assesses the assistance
provided by the cooperating individual in the Commission’s investigation or
related enforcement actions (“Investigation”) by considering, among other things:
(1)

The value of the individual’s cooperation to the Investigation including,
but not limited to:
(i)

Whether the individual’s cooperation resulted in substantial
assistance to the Investigation;
95

(2)

(ii)

The timeliness of the individual’s cooperation, including whether
the individual was first to report the misconduct to the Commission
or to offer his or her cooperation in the Investigation, and whether
the cooperation was provided before he or she had any knowledge
of a pending investigation or related action;

(iii)

Whether the Investigation was initiated based on information or
other cooperation provided by the individual;

(iv)

The quality of cooperation provided by the individual, including
whether the cooperation was truthful, complete, and reliable; and

(v)

The time and resources conserved as a result of the individual’s
cooperation in the Investigation.

The nature of the individual’s cooperation in the Investigation including,
but not limited to:
(i)

Whether the individual’s cooperation was voluntary or required by
the terms of an agreement with another law enforcement or
regulatory organization;

(ii)

The types of assistance the individual provided to the Commission;

(ii)

Whether the individual provided non-privileged information,
which information was not requested by the staff or otherwise
might not have been discovered;

(iv) Whether the individual encouraged or authorized others to assist
the staff who might not have otherwise participated in the Investigation;
and
(v)
(b)

Any unique circumstances in which the individual provided the
cooperation.

Importance of the underlying matter. The Commission assesses the importance of
the Investigation in which the individual cooperated by considering, among other
things:
(1)

The character of the Investigation including, but not limited to:
(i)

Whether the subject matter of the Investigation is a Commission
priority;

(ii)

The type of securities violations;

(iii)

The age and duration of the misconduct;

96

(2)

(c)

(iv)

The number of violations; and

(v)

The isolated or repetitive nature of the violations.

The dangers to investors or others presented by the underlying violations
involved in the Investigation including, but not limited to:
(i)

The amount of harm or potential harm caused by the underlying
violations;

(ii)

The type of harm resulting from or threatened by the underlying
violations; and

(iii)

The number of individuals or entities harmed. 6

Interest in holding the individual accountable. The Commission assesses the
societal interest in holding the cooperating individual fully accountable for his or
her misconduct by considering, among other things:
(1)

The severity of the individual’s misconduct assessed by the nature of the
violations and in the context of the individual’s knowledge, education,
training, experience, and position of responsibility at the time the
violations occurred;

(2)

The culpability of the individual, including, but not limited to, whether the
individual acted with scienter, both generally and in relation to others who
participated in the misconduct;

(3)

The degree to which the individual tolerated illegal activity including, but
not limited to, whether he or she took steps to prevent the violations from
occurring or continuing, such as notifying the Commission or other
appropriate law enforcement agency of the misconduct or, in the case of a
violation involving a business organization, by notifying members of
management not involved in the misconduct, the board of directors or the
equivalent body not involved in the misconduct, or the auditors of such
business organization of the misconduct;

(4)

The efforts undertaken by the individual to remediate the harm caused by
the violations including, but not limited to, whether he or she paid or
agreed to pay disgorgement to injured investors and other victims or
assisted these victims and the authorities in the recovery of the fruits and
instrumentalities of the violations; and

6

Cooperation in Investigations that involve priority matters or serious, ongoing, or widespread violations will be
viewed most favorably.

97

(5)

(d)

The sanctions imposed on the individual by other federal or state
authorities and industry organizations for the violations involved in the
Investigation.

Profile of the individual. The Commission assesses whether, how much, and in
what manner it is in the public interest to award credit for cooperation, in part,
based upon the cooperating individual’s personal and professional profile by
considering, among other things:
(1)

The individual’s history of lawfulness, including complying with
securities laws or regulations;

(2)

The degree to which the individual has demonstrated an acceptance of
responsibility for his or her past misconduct; and

(3)

The degree to which the individual will have an opportunity to commit
future violations of the federal securities laws in light of his or her
occupation -- including, but not limited to, whether he or she serves as: a
licensed individual, such as an attorney or accountant; an associated
person of a regulated entity, such as a broker or dealer; a fiduciary for
other individuals or entities regarding financial matters; an officer or
director of public companies; or a member of senior management -together with any existing or proposed safeguards based upon the
individual’s particular circumstances.

The policy statement also noted that these principles are not listed in order of importance;
they are not intended to be all-inclusive; and that facts and circumstances of a particular case
may render some of the principles inapplicable or worthy of lesser or greater weight.
6.1.2

Framework for Evaluating Cooperation by Companies

In October 2001, the Commission issued a Report of Investigation and Statement
explaining its decision not to take enforcement action against a public company it had
investigated for financial statement irregularities. Report of Investigation Pursuant to Section
21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Commission Statement on the Relationship of
Cooperation to Agency Enforcement Decisions, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 44969 and
AAER-1470 (Oct. 23, 2001) (http://www.sec.gov/litigation/investreport/34-44969.htm). In this
report, commonly referred to as the Seaboard Report, the Commission articulated an analytical
framework for evaluating cooperation by companies. The report detailed the many factors the
Commission considers in determining whether, and to what extent, it grants leniency to
investigated companies for cooperating in its investigations and for related good corporate
citizenship. Specifically, the report identifies four broad measures of a company’s cooperation:
•

Self-policing prior to the discovery of the misconduct, including establishing
effective compliance procedures and an appropriate tone at the top;

•

Self-reporting of misconduct when it is discovered, including conducting a
thorough review of the nature, extent, origins and consequences of the
98

misconduct, and promptly, completely and effectively disclosing the misconduct
to the public, to regulatory agencies, and to self-regulatory organizations;
•

Remediation, including dismissing or appropriately disciplining wrongdoers,
modifying and improving internal controls and procedures to prevent recurrence
of the misconduct, and appropriately compensating those adversely affected; and

•

Cooperation with law enforcement authorities, including providing the
Commission staff with all information relevant to the underlying violations and
the company’s remedial efforts.

Since every enforcement matter is different, this analytical framework sets forth general
principles but does not limit the Commission’s broad discretion to evaluate every case
individually, on its own unique facts and circumstances. Similar to the Commission’s treatment
of cooperating individuals, credit for cooperation by companies may range from taking no
enforcement action to pursuing reduced charges and sanctions in connection with enforcement
actions. For greater detail regarding the analytical framework used by the Commission to
evaluate cooperation by companies, the staff should review the Seaboard Report.
6.2

Cooperation Tools

There is a wide spectrum of tools available to the staff for facilitating and rewarding
cooperation in its investigations and related enforcement actions. A non-exclusive list of
cooperation tools appears below. Since every enforcement matter is unique, the appropriate use
of a cooperation tool invariably depends upon a careful analysis of the facts and circumstances of
each case. In some cases, multiple cooperation tools may be appropriate.
As a preliminary matter, staff should consider the use of proffers of information as a
means to obtain cooperation. Staff should consult the information in Section 3.3.7 of the Manual
for information concerning proffers and the use of proffer agreements.
For assistance in drafting agreements discussed in this section, staff should consult OCC.
6.2.1

Cooperation Agreements

Basics:
A cooperation agreement is a written agreement between the Division of Enforcement
and a potential cooperating individual prepared to provide substantial assistance to the
Commission’s investigation and related enforcement actions. Specifically, in a cooperation
agreement, the Division agrees to recommend to the Commission that the individual receive
credit for cooperating in its investigation and related enforcement actions and, under certain
circumstances, to make specific enforcement recommendations if, among other things: (1) the
Division concludes that the individual has provided or is likely to provide substantial assistance
to the Commission; (2) the individual agrees to cooperate truthfully and fully in the
Commission’s investigation and related enforcement actions and waive the applicable statute of
limitations; and (3) the individual satisfies his/her/its obligations under the agreement. If the

99

agreement is violated, the staff may recommend an enforcement action to the Commission
against the individual without any limitation.
Procedures:
•

Prior to seeking authority to enter into cooperation agreements, the staff should collect
sufficient information regarding their ability to provide substantial assistance to the
Commission’s investigations or related enforcement actions. Staff are encouraged to use
proffer agreements to collect this information.

•

The Director and those senior officers designated by the Director have the authority to
enter into cooperation agreements on behalf of the Division.

•

The staff should retain a copy of each cooperation agreement and the memorandum
documenting the basis for entering into the agreement.

Considerations:
•

Cooperation agreements are primarily intended to be used with individuals. In general,
staff should use the factors in the Seaboard Report to assess cooperation by public
companies or entities regulated by the Commission, rather than seeking to employ
cooperation agreements. (See Section 6.1.2 regarding the Framework for Evaluating
Cooperation by Companies).

•

The staff should advise potential cooperators that cooperation agreements entered into
with the Division do not bind the Commission and that the Division cannot, and does not,
make any promise or representation as to whether or how the Commission may act on
enforcement recommendations made by the Division.

•

The Division uses a standard form of cooperation agreement to be adapted to the specific
circumstances of the investigation or related enforcement action.

•

Cooperation agreements should generally include the following terms:
o the cooperating individual agrees to cooperate truthfully and fully, as directed by
the Division’s staff, in investigations and related enforcement proceedings
including, but not limited to, producing all potentially relevant non-privileged
documents and materials to the Commission, responding to all inquiries,
appearing for interviews, and testifying at trials and other judicial proceedings as
requested by the staff, and waiving the territorial limits on service contained in
Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;
o the cooperator agrees to enter a tolling agreement if requested by the staff;
o the cooperator agrees not to violate the securities laws;
o the cooperator acknowledges that the agreement does not constitute a final
disposition of any potential enforcement action;
100

o subject to full, truthful, and continuing cooperation, the Division will bring the
assistance provided by the cooperator to the attention of the Commission and
other regulatory and law enforcement authorities requested by the cooperator; and
o the cooperator acknowledges that, although the Division has discretion to make
enforcement recommendations, only the Commission has the authority to approve
enforcement dispositions and accept settlement offers.
Related Tool:
•

Cooperation Letters—Upon the written request of cooperating individuals and
companies, supervisors at or above the level of Associate Director may submit letters
describing the fact, manner and extent of assistance provided by such cooperating
individuals and companies to the attention of courts, regulatory organizations, or law
enforcement authorities. Requests for cooperation letters and copies of the letters sent by
Commission staff should be retained with the case file.
6.2.2

Deferred Prosecution Agreements

Basics:
A deferred prosecution agreement is a written agreement between the Commission and a
potential cooperating individual or company in which the Commission agrees to forego an
enforcement action against the individual or company if the individual or company agrees to,
among other things: (1) cooperate truthfully and fully in the Commission’s investigation and
related enforcement actions; (2) enter into a long-term tolling agreement; (3) comply with
express prohibitions and/or undertakings during a period of deferred prosecution; and (4)in most
cases, agree either to admit or not to contest underlying facts that the Commission could assert to
establish a violation of the federal securities laws. If the agreement is violated during the period
of deferred prosecution, the staff may recommend an enforcement action to the Commission
against the individual or company without limitation for the original misconduct as well as any
additional misconduct. Furthermore, if the Commission authorizes the enforcement action, the
staff may use any factual admissions made by the cooperating individual or company to file a
motion for summary judgment, while maintaining the ability to bring an enforcement action for
any additional misconduct at a later date.
Procedures:
•

Deferred prosecution agreements must be approved by the Commission.

•

Staff should retain with the case file a copy of each deferred prosecution agreement and
the memorandum documenting the basis for entering into the agreement.

•

Unless the Commission directs otherwise, deferred prosecution agreements will be made
available on the Commission’s website.

101

Considerations:
•

To determine whether to recommend that the Commission enter into a deferred
prosecution agreement, the staff should use the standard cooperation analysis set forth
in Section 6.1 of the Manual.

•

An admission or an agreement not to contest the relevant facts underlying the alleged
offenses generally is appropriate.

•

A deferred prosecution agreement should generally include the following terms:
o the cooperating individual or company agrees to cooperate truthfully and fully, as
directed by the Division’s staff, in investigations and related enforcement
proceedings including, but not limited to, producing all potentially relevant nonprivileged documents and materials to the Commission, responding to all
inquiries, appearing for interviews, and testifying at trials and other judicial
proceedings as requested by the staff, and waiving the territorial limits on service
contained in Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;
o the cooperating individual or company agrees to toll the applicable statute of
limitations period;
o the cooperating individual or company agrees not to violate the securities laws;
o the cooperating individual or company shall make any agreed upon disgorgement
or penalty payments;
o if the cooperating individual or company satisfies the terms of the deferred
prosecution agreement during the term of the agreement, the Commission will not
pursue any further enforcement action concerning the matter referenced in the
agreement;
o if the individual or company violates the agreement during its term, the Division
may recommend and the Commission may pursue an enforcement action against
the individual or company without limitation;
o the cooperating individual or company agrees that the Commission may use
statements, information, and materials provided pursuant to the agreement against
him/her/it if the individual or company violates the terms of the agreement; and
o additional prohibitions and undertakings designed to protect the investing public.

•

The term of a deferred prosecution agreement should not exceed five years. In
determining the appropriate term, the staff should consider whether there is sufficient
time to ensure that the undertakings in the agreement are fully implemented and the
related prohibitions have adequately reduced the likelihood of future securities law
violations.

102

6.2.3

Non-Prosecution Agreements

Basics:
A non-prosecution agreement is a written agreement between the Commission and a
potential cooperating individual or company, entered in limited and appropriate circumstances,
that provides that the Commission will not pursue an enforcement action against the individual
or company if the individual or company agrees to, among other things: (1) cooperate truthfully
and fully in the Commission’s investigation and related enforcement actions; and (2) comply,
under certain circumstances, with express undertakings. If the agreement is violated, the staff
retains its ability to recommend an enforcement action to the Commission against the individual
or company without limitation.
Procedures:
•

Non-prosecution agreements must be approved by the Commission.

•

Staff should retain with the case file a copy of each non-prosecution agreement and the
memorandum documenting the basis for entering into the agreement.

•

Unless the Commission directs otherwise, non-prosecution agreements will be made
available on the Commission’s website.

Considerations:
•

In virtually all cases, for individuals who have previously violated the federal securities
laws, non-prosecution agreements will not be appropriate and other resolutions should be
considered.

•

An admission or an agreement not to contest the relevant facts underlying the alleged
offenses generally is appropriate.

•

A non-prosecution agreement should generally include the following terms:
o the cooperating individual or company agrees to cooperate truthfully and fully, as
directed by the Division’s staff, in investigations and related enforcement
proceedings including, but not limited to, producing all potentially relevant nonprivileged documents and materials to the Commission, responding to all
inquiries, appearing for interviews, and testifying at trials and other judicial
proceedings as requested by the staff, and waiving the territorial limits on service
contained in Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;
o the cooperating individual or company shall make any agreed-upon disgorgement
or penalty payments;
o additional undertakings designed to protect the investing public; and

103

o if the individual or company violates the agreement, the Division may recommend
and the Commission may pursue an enforcement action against the individual or
company without limitation and not subject to the applicable statute of
limitations; and
o the cooperating individual or company agrees that the Commission may use
statements, information, and materials provided pursuant to the agreement against
him/her/it if the individual or company violates the terms of the agreement.
6.2.4

Immunity Requests

Introduction:
In certain circumstances, individuals may not be willing to provide testimony or
cooperate without receiving protection against criminal prosecution. In appropriate
circumstances, to obtain testimony and/or facilitate cooperation that will substantially assist in
the enforcement of the federal securities laws, the staff may seek immunity orders or letters to
obtain testimony and/or witness cooperation.
Basics:
When witnesses assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in
enforcement proceedings, the Commission may seek one of two types of immunity: statutory
immunity or letter immunity. Statutory immunity permits the Commission, pursuant to 18 U.S.C
§§ 6001-6004, to seek a court order compelling the individual to give testimony or provide other
information that may be necessary to the public interest, if the request is approved by the U.S.
Attorney General. In contrast, letter immunity is immunity conferred by agreement between the
individual and a U.S. Attorney’s Office. Both types of immunity prevent the use of statements
or other information provided by the individual, directly or indirectly, against the individual in
any criminal case, except for perjury, giving a false statement, or obstruction of justice. Neither
an immunity order nor an immunity letter, however, prevents the Commission from using the
testimony or other information provided by the individual in its enforcement actions, including
actions against the individual for whom the immunity order or letter was issued.
Procedures:
•

Prior to seeking approval to request an immunity order or letter from the Department of
Justice, the staff should preferably receive a proffer of the individual’s expected
testimony or have significant and reliable evidence regarding his or her ability to provide
substantial assistance to the Commission’s investigation or related enforcement actions.

•

The Commission has delegated authority to the Director and authority has been subdelegated to senior officers to make immunity requests to the Department of Justice. 17
C.F.R. § 200.30-4(a).

•

Prior to requesting authorization to seek an immunity order or letter from the Director of
Enforcement or a designated senior officer, unless exigent circumstances exist, the staff

104

should complete the Department of Justice witness immunity request form found
at http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00721.pdf.
•

This form will be used for three purposes.
o First, the form will help the staff document its basis for seeking an immunity
order or letter.
o Second, the completed form will assist senior leadership in the Division and the
U.S. Department of Justice in evaluating the appropriateness of seeking an
immunity order or letter.
o Finally, if an immunity order is appropriate, the completed form will be submitted
by the relevant federal prosecutor’s office to the Witness Immunity Unit of the
Office of Enforcement Operations at the Department of Justice for approval—
expediting the processing of the Commission’s witness immunity requests.

•

Upon receiving a letter of authority to seek an order to compel the testimony of a witness
from the Department of Justice, a motion and proposed immunity order may be filed with
the court ex parte. Alternatively, after receiving approval from the Department of
Justice, the Commission may issue an order requiring the individual to give testimony or
provide other information which he or she has refused to give or provide on the basis of
his or her privilege against self incrimination. 18 U.S.C. § 6004.

•

A copy of the draft Department of Justice witness immunity request form submitted to
the Director of Enforcement or a designated senior officer and a copy of the immunity
order or letter should be maintained with the case file.

Considerations:
•

As a general rule, immunity orders or letters should not be requested in the early stages of
an investigation when the role of the cooperating individuals and the benefits of their
cooperation may be unclear.

•

Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 6001-6004, an immunity order should be sought only if:
o the testimony or other information from the witness may be necessary to the
public interest; and
o the witness has refused, or is likely to refuse, to testify or provide other
information on the basis of his or her privilege against self-incrimination.

•

When attempting to determine whether to recommend that an immunity order or letter be
sought, the staff should conduct the standard analysis set forth in Section 6.1 of the
Manual.

•

Since the Supreme Court has interpreted the Fifth Amendment privilege against selfincrimination to include the act of producing business records by a sole proprietorship,
105

the Commission may request immunity for the limited purpose of obtaining such
documents. United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605 (1984). However, the witness immunity
request form submitted to the Department of Justice should expressly state the purpose of
the application.
Further information:
For additional information regarding cooperation with the criminal authorities, please
consult Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 of the Manual.
6.2.5

Oral Assurances

Basics:
•

Where the available evidence indicates that an individual or company has not violated the
federal securities laws such as to warrant an enforcement action, the staff may orally
inform the individual or company that the Division does not anticipate recommending an
enforcement action against the individual or company based upon the evidence currently
known to the staff.

Procedures:
•

The decision to deliver an oral assurance must be made with the approval of a supervisor
at or above the level of Associate Director.

•

Oral assurances are only authorized when the investigative record is adequately
developed. Accordingly, prior to providing an oral assurance, the staff should preferably
receive proffers from the potential cooperating individuals and companies or have
sufficient information regarding the potential cooperators’ conduct.

•

Whenever oral assurances are provided, the staff should clearly inform the potential
cooperating individual or company that oral assurances are based upon the evidence
currently known to the staff, the Division’s enforcement recommendations may change if
new evidence is subsequently discovered and that the Commission has final authority to
accept or reject enforcement recommendations.

•

After an oral assurance has been provided, the staff should contemporaneously prepare
and retain a brief memorandum to file summarizing the assurance provided.
6.2.6

•

Termination Notices

When an investigation has been completed as to a potential cooperator and the Division
has determined, for any reason, not to recommend to the Commission an enforcement
action against the potential cooperator, the staff may, and in some cases is required, to
send a letter informing the potential cooperator of the determination. These notices may
be provided before the Commission’s investigation is closed or before a determination
has been made as to every other potential defendant or respondent in the case.

106

•

For additional information about termination notices, see Section 2.6.2 of the Manual.
6.2.7

Settlement Recommendations

Even in the absence of a cooperation agreement, the staff may take into account an
individual or company’s cooperation in connection with recommending sanctions or charges
associated with the alleged misconduct and, under certain circumstances, forgoing enforcement
actions against a cooperating individual or company. In doing so, the staff should consider the
settlement terms of other similar cases to identify prior precedent involving similar alleged
misconduct and apply the factors outlined in Section 6.1 of the Manual.
Where cooperation credit is being recommended to or has been authorized by the
Commission in settlements, the staff should include standard language relating to cooperation in
the related Offers or Consents, unless such disclosure would not advance the goals of the
Commission’s cooperation program or would adversely affect related ongoing investigations or
proceedings. Modifications to this standard language should not be made without first
consulting with staff in OCC.
6.3

Publicizing the Benefits of Cooperation

Basics:
The staff should provide sufficient information to the public about the nature of the
Commission’s cooperation program and its significant benefits.
Procedures:
Where cooperation credit is being recommended to the Commission in settlements, the
staff should include standard language relating to cooperation in Offers, Consents, or other
dispositions. In such cases, the cooperation should be referenced in related litigation and/or
press releases, unless such disclosure would not advance the goals of the Commission’s
cooperation program or would adversely affect related ongoing investigations or proceedings.
Considerations:
•

In most cases, the Commission’s enforcement program is enhanced by publicizing the
benefits associated with cooperating in a Commission investigation or related
enforcement actions. Nevertheless, the staff retains discretion regarding whether and
how to disclose the fact, manner, and extent of an individual or company’s cooperation in
documents filed or issued by the Commission in connection with an enforcement action.

•

Since information obtained or generated during Commission investigations is generally
confidential, the staff should ensure that its public statements and releases do not
inadvertently disclose non-public information.

•

The staff should take care to protect the identity of any cooperating individual and
company whose identity is not being disclosed elsewhere, such as in an Order, Consent,

107

or Deferred Prosecution Agreement, unless the individual or entity has consented to
disclosure by the Commission.
