In the Matter of

ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE

CAPITAL PREFERRED YIELD FUND-III, LP,
CLEARLY CANADIAN BEVERAGE CORP., and
DIVERSINET CORP.

On September 22, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondents pursuant to Section 12( j) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission
and are delinquent in their periodic filings.
On September 29, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
establishing that the OIP was served on Respondents by September 28, 2016, in accordance with
17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2). Respondents’ answers were therefore due by October 11, 2016. OIP
at 3; see 17 C.F.R. § 201.160(a)-(b), .220(b). To date, Respondents have not filed answers.
I ORDER Respondents to SHOW CAUSE by October 24, 2016, why the registrations of
their securities should not be revoked by default due to their failure to file answers or otherwise
defend this proceeding. If Respondents fail to respond to this order, they will be deemed in default
and the registrations of their securities will be revoked. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2),
.220(f ).
