Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or
denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject

not publicly quoted or traded.

DMNM has failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it necessary and appropriate for the
protection of investors to impose the sanction specified in Respondent’s Offer.
