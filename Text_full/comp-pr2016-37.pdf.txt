JURY TRIAL
DEMANDED

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) alleges the following
against defendants Rhode Island Commerce Corporation (formerly known as Rhode Island
Economic Development Corporation) (“EDC”), Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“Wells Fargo”),
Peter M. Cannava (“Cannava”), Keith W. Stokes (“Stokes”), and James Michael Saul (“Saul”):
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
1.

This case involves misconduct by the EDC and Wells Fargo relating to an

offering of municipal securities. On November 2, 2010, the EDC issued $75,000,000 of taxable
revenue bonds to investors in a private placement (the “38 Studios Bonds”). The EDC loaned
most of the money it received from selling the 38 Studios Bonds to 38 Studios, LLC (“38
Studios”), a pre-revenue video gaming company headed by a former professional baseball player.
The disclosure document provided to the investors who were offered the 38 Studios Bonds was
materially misleading. This document failed to disclose that the project being financed by the

1

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 2 of 29 PageID #: 2

Bonds, the development of a video game, could not be completed with the financing the Bonds
would provide. The document did not disclose that even with the proceeds of the loan financed
by the 38 Studios Bonds, 38 Studios faced a known shortfall in funding. In light of the other
disclosures made in the offering document, this omission was significant, and rendered the
offering document a misleading half-truth.
2.

The offering document was misleading in a second way. It failed to disclose the

full amount of compensation that the offering’s lead placement agent, Wells Fargo, was
receiving as a result of the 38 Studios Bond offering. Wells Fargo’s actual compensation from
the offering was almost double that which was disclosed, as the result of a side deal that Wells
Fargo had with 38 Studios. This undisclosed compensation, which created a potential conflict of
interest, was material and should have been disclosed.
3.

The offering document’s failures were the result of misconduct by both the EDC,

the issuer of the 38 Studios Bonds, and by Wells Fargo, the lead placement agent for the 38
Studios Bonds. These entities’ failures, in turn, were caused by the recklessness or negligence of
their employees.
4.

Stokes and Saul were executives of the EDC, who through recklessness or

negligence were responsible for the EDC’s failure to make complete and truthful disclosures in
the offering document for the 38 Studios Bonds. As discussed below, at the time of the offering,
Rhode Island was experiencing high unemployment and the loan to 38 Studios was intended to
increase employment opportunities in the state. While the EDC’s Board may have been
influenced by the star power of 38 Studios’ personnel, or anxious to take action to address the
significant unemployment in Rhode Island, Stokes and Saul had the obligation as EDC

2

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 3 of 29 PageID #: 3

executives to disclose to investors the known financial truths about 38 Studios’ inability to
complete the project the Bonds would finance with the funds the Bonds would provide.
5.

Cannava, who was Wells Fargo’s lead banker on the 38 Studios Bonds transaction,

was responsible for Wells Fargo’s failure to ensure that the offering document for the 38 Studios
Bonds contained complete and truthful disclosures both about the need for additional funding -beyond the Bonds -- to complete the project being financed, and Wells Fargo’s compensation.
Cannava, like Stokes and Saul, knew that 38 Studios would be unable to complete the project the
Bonds would finance with the funds the Bonds would provide.
6.

By recklessly or negligently engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint,

defendants EDC and Wells Fargo violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act of
1933 (the “Securities Act”), which prohibit fraud in the offer or sale of securities. Defendants
Stokes, Saul and Cannava aided and abetted those violations by their respective employers. In
addition, defendant Wells Fargo violated Section 15B(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rules G-17 and G-32 promulgated by the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board (the “MSRB”). These provisions proscribe rules for fair dealing and
disclosure by municipal securities professionals. Defendant Cannava aided and abetted Wells
Fargo’s violations of both the Exchange Act and the MSRB Rules.
7.

Against all defendants, the Commission seeks injunctions against future violations,

and civil penalties. Against defendants EDC, Wells Fargo and Cannava, the Commission also
seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest thereon. The Commission also
seeks injunctions that would prohibit Stokes, Saul and Cannava from participating in the future
issuance, underwriting, offer or sale of municipal securities.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Background on 38 Studios
17.

During 2010, 38 Studios, LLC (“38 Studios”) was a limited liability company

headquartered in Maynard, Massachusetts. It was in the business of developing video games. At
the time, it was a start-up stage company and had no revenue.
18.

The Chairman of 38 Studios’ Board of Directors, and its majority shareholder,

was Curt Schilling, a former professional baseball player. Other creative personnel working with
38 Studios were well-known in the video gaming industry, and the science fiction and comic
book industries.
19.

During 2010, 38 Studios was developing a single-player, role-playing video game

that was scheduled to be released for sale in the fall of 2011. 38 Studios had entered into a
publishing and distribution agreement with a large and well-known video gaming company for
that single-player game, under which the large company would fund the development costs for
that game, and distribute it to the public, in exchange for a significant share of the revenues that
game generated.
20.

During 2010, 38 Studios was also developing a “massively multi-player” online

video game that was code-named Project Copernicus. During 2010, 38 Studios had not entered
into a publishing and distribution agreement under which another entity would fund its
development costs for Copernicus. 38 Studios anticipated that it would need $75 million or more
to complete the development of Copernicus. It was thus seeking financing to fund those
development expenses.
21.

In early 2010, 38 Studios was pursuing two potential options for the financing it

needed: (i) selling about $25 million in equity through a private placement to venture capital and

6

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 7 of 29 PageID #: 7

similar investors, and (ii) obtaining a loan from the EDC that would be funded through the
proceeds of bonds issued by the EDC.
The EDC Issued the 38 Studios Bonds
22.

The EDC is authorized by Rhode Island state law to issue bonds. The proceeds of

those bonds may be lent to businesses to encourage economic development in Rhode Island.
When the proceeds of municipal bonds are lent to a private party, those bonds are typically
referred to as “conduit bonds” and the private entity receiving the funds is known as the “conduit
borrower.”
23.

The 38 Studios Bonds were conduit bonds, and 38 Studios was a conduit

borrower.
24.

The EDC was governed by a Board of Directors, which had up to thirteen

members, including the Chair, who was the Governor of the State of Rhode Island. The
Governor, with the advice and consent of the Rhode Island Senate, appointed the other members
of the Board.
25.

On June 11, 2010, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed a law authorizing

the EDC to provide credit enhancement on its conduit bonds, in the form of a guaranty of the
payment of debt service, under a new program, named the Jobs Creation Guaranty Program, in a
principal amount of up to $125,000,000 outstanding at any time. That law stated that “Rhode
Island continues to suffer from continuing high unemployment and other ill effects from the most
recent national recession” and that the EDC bonds were intended “to induce lending to
companies growing their employment in Rhode Island.”

7

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 8 of 29 PageID #: 8

26.

The EDC determined that it would use over half of the authorization allotted to it

through the Jobs Creation Guaranty Program to guaranty the payment of debt service on conduit
bonds that would fund a loan to 38 Studios.
27.

On July 26, 2010, the EDC’s Board voted to authorize the issuance of the 38

Studios Bonds and issued a resolution to that effect. Attached to the resolution was a Term Sheet
between the EDC and 38 Studios which outlined the terms on which the EDC would loan the
Bonds’ proceeds to 38 Studios. The Term Sheet was signed by Stokes on behalf of the EDC, and
stated that the purpose of the loan was to “provide the necessary financing to relocate 38 Studios
to Rhode Island, complete production of [its video game called] Copernicus, and capitalize the
company’s growth and expansion in Rhode Island.”
28.

On November 2, 2010, the EDC sold $75,000,000 worth of the 38 Studios Bonds

to investors through a private placement (the “38 Studios Offering”). The EDC loaned
approximately $50 million of the $75 million in proceeds it received from investors to 38 Studios.
The remainder of the $25 million in proceeds from the 38 Studios Offering was used to pay
expenses related to the Offering, and to establish both a reserve fund (about $12.7 million) that
could be used to make some future payments to investors, and a capitalized interest fund (about
$10.6 million) to pay interest on the bonds for their first year.
29.

The 38 Studios Bonds were offered to investors through a Private Placement

Memorandum dated October 22, 2010 (the “Bond Placement Memo”). The Bond Placement
Memo was the key disclosure document that described to potential investors the Bonds that they
were being offered. It described the sources and uses of proceeds of the Bonds, the security for
the Bonds, and other terms of the Bonds. It also described the EDC and 38 Studios, including
the 38 Studios project that would be financed with the Bonds’ proceeds. The Bond Placement

8

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 9 of 29 PageID #: 9

Memo also described some of the risks of investing in the 38 Studios Bonds, and contained
descriptions of the other entities involved in issuing the Bonds.
30.

The Bond Placement Memo stated that 38 Studios would make loan payments to

the EDC from the revenues it earned from selling its video games. The EDC would then use
those loan payments to make principal and interest payments to bondholders.
31.

The Bond Placement Memo cautioned investors that, in the event of a default by

38 Studios, the principal and interest payments due on the Bonds were not liabilities of the State
of Rhode Island. However, to the extent the EDC had insufficient funds to satisfy its payment
obligations to bondholders, the Governor was obligated to ask the State’s General Assembly to
appropriate money as part of its budget to pay the shortfall to the EDC, so that the EDC could
make principal and interest payments to bondholders. The General Assembly was not obligated
to make those appropriations. The State’s commitment to provide funds to the EDC was
therefore considered a “moral obligation” of the State. In exchange for its “moral obligation”
guaranty, the State required an up-front fee of $375,000, plus an annual fee equal to 1.5% of the
outstanding principal amount of the bonds.
32.

The 38 Studios Bonds paid investors significantly higher interest rates than

general obligation bonds issued by the State of Rhode Island at about the same time. Unlike the
“moral obligation” behind the 38 Studios Bonds, Rhode Island’s general obligation bonds were
backed by the full faith and credit of the State.
33.

The Bond Placement Memo also stated that the 38 Studios Bonds were insured by

a private insurance company. That means that the insurance company would guarantee that
bondholders would be paid principal and interest on the 38 Studios Bonds under the terms of the
insurance policy if neither 38 Studios made its loan payments nor the State appropriated the

9

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 10 of 29 PageID #: 10

funds needed to make the scheduled payments. In return, the private insurance company
received an up-front premium payment of $562,935, which was paid from the proceeds of the 38
Studios Bonds.
Stokes and Saul Played Key Roles in the EDC’s Issuance of the 38 Studios Bonds
34.

Stokes was the EDC’s Executive Director. He was the agency’s head, and was

the person primarily responsible for communicating with the EDC’s Board. He also had the
authority to bind the EDC, and was the individual who signed both the Bond Placement Memo,
and the Term Sheet with 38 Studios, on behalf of the EDC.
35.

When the EDC was considering whether to make the loan to 38 Studios, and to

issue the 38 Studios Bonds, Stokes was heavily involved in both communications to EDC Board
members about the potential transaction and in presentations at EDC Board meetings. He
participated on behalf of the EDC in meetings related to the potential transaction with
representatives from 38 Studios, Wells Fargo, the EDC’s financial advisor and consultants, and
other members of Rhode Island State government. For the meetings that Stokes did not attend,
he was briefed by his staff about what took place at the meetings.
36.

Saul was the EDC’s Deputy Director. He has a background in accounting. He

reported to Stokes. Saul had primary responsibility at the EDC for overseeing the analysis and
reporting on the financial aspects of the potential 38 Studios Bond transaction. He was the
EDC’s lead representative to the Bond Working Group, the group of people who communicated
regularly about the transaction. He also made presentations to the EDC’s Board about the terms
of the potential 38 Studios transaction, and in particular, led presentations that described 38
Studios’ financial projections and the anticipated likelihood that 38 Studios would be able to
repay an EDC loan.

10

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 11 of 29 PageID #: 11

37.

Both Stokes and Saul reviewed the Bond Placement Memo for the EDC, and

Stokes signed the Bond Placement Memo on behalf of the EDC.
Wells Fargo’s Dual Roles
38.

Wells Fargo was involved in two ways in trying to obtain financing for 38 Studios.

First, its investment banking group was hired by 38 Studios to conduct an equity private
placement. Second, its public finance group was hired by the EDC to be the lead placement
agent for the 38 Studios Bond Offering. Wells Fargo’s work on these two financing options
overlapped during the spring of 2010.
The Equity Offering
39.

In the spring of 2010, 38 Studios and Wells Fargo had discussions about how

Wells Fargo could assist the company in obtaining financing. Options discussed at the time
included both an equity offering and financing obtained through a Rhode Island bond issuance.
38 Studios was interested in pursuing both sources of potential financing.
40.

On May 20, 2010, 38 Studios signed an engagement letter (the “May 20

Agreement”) with Wells Fargo’s investment banking group to raise money for 38 Studios by
selling equity. In recognition of the fact that 38 Studios might elect to proceed with a potential
financing through the EDC and cease its attempts to raise equity financing, the May 20
Agreement specified that Wells Fargo would be paid “Alternative Financing Fees” based on
certain milestones related to the 38 Studios Bond Offering. Specifically, 38 Studios agreed to
pay Wells Fargo the following fees:
(a) A “RIEDC consulting fee” of $25,000 that was “earned on the day after
the first meeting” between the EDC, 38 Studios and Wells Fargo to discuss “the issuance
of municipal bonds on behalf of” 38 Studios;

11

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 12 of 29 PageID #: 12

(b) A “structuring fee” of $75,000 that was “earned upon the decision by [38
Studios] at its sole discretion, to actively pursue” a transaction in which the EDC issued
bonds on behalf of 38 Studios; and
(c) An “alternative financing option closing fee” of $300,000 “payable upon
the closing” of a transaction in which the EDC issued bonds on behalf of 38 Studios.
41.

The May 20 Agreement also obligated 38 Studios to “use its best efforts, . . . to

engage Wells Fargo Securities as sole-, lead-, and book-running agent or underwriter” for any
contemplated bond transaction involving the EDC.
42.

Pursuant to the May 20 Agreement, Wells Fargo engaged in significant efforts to

obtain equity financing for 38 Studios. Wells Fargo conducted due diligence on 38 Studios and
prepared an Equity Private Placement Memorandum which contained extensive detail about the
company. Wells Fargo sent that Equity Private Placement Memorandum to approximately 200
potential investors, and engaged in follow-up activities in an attempt to interest those prospects
in an investment in 38 Studios.
43.

The Equity Private Placement Memorandum did not attract any investors, and in

June 2010, 38 Studios and Wells Fargo ceased working on the attempted equity financing in
favor of pursuing financing through an EDC bond offering.
The Bond Offering
44.

The EDC retained Wells Fargo as the lead placement agent on the 38 Studios

Bond Offering. A “placement agent” in a private placement like the 38 Studios Bond Offering
has a role similar to that of an underwriter in a public bond offering. Wells Fargo had an
obligation under the federal securities laws to conduct an investigation into the 38 Studios Bond
Offering, in order to obtain a reasonable belief in the truthfulness and completeness of the key

12

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 13 of 29 PageID #: 13

representations in the Bond Placement Memo. This investigation is commonly referred to as
“due diligence.”
45.

Wells Fargo also found investors for the 38 Studios Bonds and arranged for the

bonds to be sold to those investors. One other broker-dealer had a more limited placement agent
role than Wells Fargo, and arranged for the sale of some of the 38 Studios Bonds to investors.
46.

Cannava had primary responsibility for Wells Fargo on the 38 Studios Bond

Offering. Cannava had the authority to sign contracts and agreements on behalf of Wells Fargo
relating to the 38 Studios Bond Offering. He reviewed and signed all of the major agreements
relating to Wells Fargo’s participation in that offering, including the Bond Placement Agreement,
and the Private Placement Agent’s Certificate. He also approved the Bond Placement Memo on
behalf of Wells Fargo.
47.

In the course of preparing the Bond Placement Memo, Cannava relied heavily on

the Equity Private Placement Memorandum that Wells Fargo had prepared several months earlier
for the potential equity financing. Cannava also relied on the due diligence that others at Wells
Fargo had performed in connection with the potential equity offering to satisfy his obligation to
perform due diligence in connection with the 38 Studios Bond Offering.
38 Studios’ Funding Gaps
48.

Throughout its negotiations with the EDC during 2010, 38 Studios emphasized its

need for at least $75 million in order to complete Project Copernicus. 38 Studios also informed
the EDC, Wells Fargo, and others involved in discussions about the potential bond issuance, that
it would require additional funds, beyond the $75 million that it needed to finish Copernicus, to
move to Rhode Island and to fund its operations.

13

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 14 of 29 PageID #: 14

49.

To explain its need for $75 million, 38 Studios prepared and sent to the EDC a set

of financial projections for the 2010-2015 time period that detailed the company’s projected
revenues and expenses, and provided an income statement, a cash flow statement and a balance
sheet for those periods. Those financial projections included the assumption that 38 Studios
would receive $75 million in proceeds as the result of an outside debt financing. If the outside
debt financing number were changed to reflect the approximately $50 million that 38 Studios
actually received from the EDC’s financing, the projections would indicate that 38 Studios
would run out of cash by the end of December 2011.
50.

Stokes and Saul both received and reviewed 38 Studios’ financial projections.

Both Stokes and Saul knew that the financial projections assumed that 38 Studios would receive
$75 million in proceeds from the EDC offering. Saul analyzed these financial projections, and
presented various scenarios based on these financial projections, to the EDC’s Board.
51.

As part of the closing of the 38 Studios Bond Offering, Stokes signed a

“Certificate Regarding Financial Projections Required by Section 2.06 A(b)(iv)” of the Loan and
Trust Agreement between the EDC and 38 Studios which certified that the financial projections
provided to the EDC by 38 Studios were authentic and would be relied upon to perform
calculations required by the parties’ loan agreement.
52.

In June 2010, Saul wrote a memorandum to Stokes and another member of the

EDC’s Board that specifically noted, given that the net proceeds of the bond would be less than
$75 million, that he needed to revisit 38 Studios’ financial projections and assess “the impact
closing costs may have [on] the Copernicus development budget.” Saul thus knew, or should
have known, that when corrected to reflect the approximately $50 million that 38 Studios would
receive from the bond issuance, the financial projections would show 38 Studios running out of

14

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 15 of 29 PageID #: 15

money by the end of 2011. Stokes also knew or should have known of this possibility because
he was on notice that 38 Studios’ financial projections assumed greater than the actual net
proceeds from the bond issuance.
53.

When considering whether to make a loan to a company, the EDC typically

prepared a credit memorandum that analyzed the creditworthiness of the potential borrower.
Saul supervised the EDC analyst who was assigned to analyze 38 Studios’ creditworthiness.
After that analyst looked at the financial projections provided by 38 Studios, and some other
information provided by the company, he expressed significant concerns to Saul, including
concerns about whether the assumptions underlying 38 Studios’ financial projections were
realistic. Shortly after expressing those concerns, the analyst was excluded from further
communications about the potential 38 Studios transaction. Neither that analyst, nor anyone else
at the EDC, prepared a credit memorandum that analyzed 38 Studios’ ability to repay the EDC
loan.
54.

By mid-August 2010, at the latest, the EDC and Wells Fargo knew that 38 Studios

would only receive about $50 million in net proceeds from the bond offering. The balance of the
proceeds would be used to fund certain reserves and to pay for expenses associated with the
offering. The net proceeds that 38 Studios would receive from the offering had been discussed
between the EDC, 38 Studios, and Wells Fargo for several months before August.
55.

Stokes knew that 38 Studios would receive less in proceeds from the 38 Studios

Bond Offering than 38 Studios needed to complete Project Copernicus. On July 26, 2010, on
behalf of the EDC, Stokes signed a term sheet with 38 Studios which stated that the EDC
understood that 38 Studios’ “capital needs to bring project Copernicus to completion to be

15

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 16 of 29 PageID #: 16

approximately $75,000,000.” At about that time, Stokes also knew that 38 Studios was going to
receive about $25 million less than it needed, in proceeds from the EDC’s bond offering.
56.

Saul also knew that 38 Studios would receive less in proceeds from the 38 Studios

Bond Offering than 38 Studios needed to complete Project Copernicus. He knew that 38 Studios
had consistently expressed its need for $75 million to complete Project Copernicus. Saul also
knew, during the summer of 2010, that 38 Studios would only receive about $50 million in net
proceeds from the offering.
57.

Wells Fargo and Cannava knew that 38 Studios would receive less in proceeds

from the 38 Studios Bond Offering than 38 Studios needed to complete Project Copernicus.
Cannava knew that 38 Studios needed at least $75 million to complete Project Copernicus. He
also knew, by July 2010, that 38 Studios would only receive about $50 million in net proceeds
from the bond offering.
The Bond Placement Memo Failed to Disclose 38 Studios’ Funding Gaps
58.

Even though the EDC and Wells Fargo knew that 38 Studios would only receive

about $50 million from the Bond Offering when it needed at least $75 million to complete
Project Copernicus, the Bond Placement Memo failed to disclose this significant funding gap.
59.

38 Studios’ funding gap was known at the time the Bond Placement Memo was

sent to investors. It was not speculative. It was an existing risk that should have been disclosed
to potential investors in the offering.
60.

38 Studios’ funding gap meant that 38 Studios would need to raise at least $25

million in new financing within a year of the Bond Offering. That immediate need for more
funding was a material risk, particularly in light of 38 Studios’ failure to attract any equity
investors when it sought, through Wells Fargo, to raise equity investments earlier in 2010.

16

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 17 of 29 PageID #: 17

61.

The Bond Placement Memo’s omission of the fact that 38 Studios would need

additional financing in order to complete Project Copernicus was material. If 38 Studios were
not able to obtain additional financing it would face a significant risk of default on its loan
payments to the EDC and insolvency.
62.

The Bond Placement Memo also included statements about 38 Studios’ financial

condition that were rendered misleading by its significant omission that 38 Studios would need
financing in addition to the proceeds of the Bond Offering in order to complete Project
Copernicus. In particular:
a. The Bond Placement Memo stated that 38 Studios “is a development stage
video game and entertainment company with no revenues and is dependent on the
proceeds of the 2010 Bonds for future the [sic] development of Project CopernicusT M.”
This disclosure was misleading because it suggested that the proceeds of the 2010 Bonds
would be sufficient to develop Project Copernicus.
b. The Bond Placement Memo also stated that, on July 6, 2010, 38 Studios’
auditor “issued a ‘going concern’ opinion in connection with the Company’s most recent
audited financial statements stating that the Company will require additional financing to
fund future operations and raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern.” This disclosure was misleading because it suggested that
the proceeds of the Bond Offering were sufficient “additional financing to fund future
operations” and failed to disclose that additional financing on top of the Bonds’ proceeds
would be needed.

63.

Stokes and Saul were responsible for the failure of the Bond Placement Memo to

disclose 38 Studios’ funding gap. They both knew about the funding gap and knew or should
have known that it was not disclosed in the Bond Placement Memo.
64.

Cannava was also responsible for the failure of the Bond Placement Memo to

disclose 38 Studios’ funding gap. Cannava was the person at Wells Fargo responsible for
reviewing and approving the Bond Placement Memo on behalf of Wells Fargo. He knew about
38 Studios’ funding gap, and knew or should have known that it was not disclosed in the Bond
Placement Memo.
The Bond Placement Memo Failed to Disclose Wells Fargo’s Extra Fees
65.

The Bond Placement Memo specified that Wells Fargo and another broker dealer

were acting as placement agents for the 38 Studios Bond Offering and would be compensated
through a “placement agents’ fee” of $634,065. Wells Fargo’s share of that “placement agents’
fee” was $406,250. The balance of the “placement agents’ fee” was paid to the other brokerdealer who acted as a placement agent in the 38 Studios Offering.
66.

The Bond Placement Memo also stated that Wells Fargo would be paid $50,000

by 38 Studios “in connection with their disclosure and due diligence of the Company with
respect to this transaction.” No other fees or compensation to Wells Fargo were disclosed in the
Bond Placement Memo.
67.

A separate Bond Placement Agreement, which was referenced in the Bond

Placement Memo, was entered into between Wells Fargo, the EDC and 38 Studios. Cannava
signed the Bond Placement Agreement on behalf of Wells Fargo. That agreement stated that the
“Placement Agent does not anticipate any remuneration with respect to the 2010 Bonds other
than the Placement Agent’s discount of $634,065 and the disclosure fee of $50,000.”

18

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 19 of 29 PageID #: 19

68.

Wells Fargo’s statement about its compensation in the Bond Placement Memo

was a misleading half-truth, and its statement in the Bond Placement Agreement about its
compensation was false.
69.

In fact, soon after the Bond Offering closed, and pursuant to the May 20

Agreement, 38 Studios paid Wells Fargo an additional $400,000 as a result of meeting
milestones with respect to the 38 Studios Bond Offering. 38 Studios also paid Wells Fargo about
$23,000 in expenses it had incurred. 38 Studios made that payment with proceeds it received
from the Bond Offering. If the 38 Studios Bond Offering had not closed, Wells Fargo would not
have received $300,000 of that $400,000 fee payment. That extra $400,000 was nearly equal to
the disclosed compensation of $406,250 that Wells Fargo received.
70.

Cannava was responsible for Wells Fargo’s failure to disclose its additional fees

in the Bond Placement Memo and its misstatement about the fees it would receive in the Bond
Placement Agreement. He reviewed and approved the Bond Placement Memo on behalf of
Wells Fargo, and signed the Bond Placement Agreement on behalf of Wells Fargo.
71.

Cannava was aware that Wells Fargo’s investment bankers were working with 38

Studios to obtain equity financing, that an agreement between 38 Studios and Wells Fargo
governed that work, and that 38 Studios had agreed to pay Wells Fargo a fee after the Bond
Offering closed. Before the Bond Offering closed, Cannava was present at a meeting where this
arrangement was discussed. Cannava also used substantial portions of the due diligence
performed by his investment banking colleagues to satisfy his and Wells Fargo’s due diligence
obligations relating to the 38 Studios Bond Offering. The May 20 Agreement was also available
to Cannava, both from Wells Fargo’s files, and as part of the contract summaries in the due
diligence files compiled for purposes of the 38 Studios Bond Offering. It was also a document

19

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 20 of 29 PageID #: 20

he should have reviewed in performing due diligence on the section of the Bond PPM that
described 38 Studios’ “Commitments, Contingencies and Outstanding Debt Obligations.”
Cannava thus knew or should have known that Wells Fargo was receiving substantial additional
compensation with respect to the 38 Studios Bonds, and he acted recklessly or negligently in
failing to disclose that additional compensation.
72.

Wells Fargo’s and Cannava’s failure to disclose the additional compensation that

Wells Fargo was receiving in connection with the 38 Studios Bond Offering was material. The
undisclosed compensation was nearly equal to the disclosed compensation. Underwriters in
municipal securities offerings are required by MSRB Rules to disclose the compensation they
receive. Further, the fact that Wells Fargo was receiving compensation in this transaction both
as a result of its role as a placement agent hired by the EDC and as a result of its work as an
agent for 38 Studios created a potential conflict of interest that should have been disclosed to
potential investors.
38 Studios’ Default
73.

After obtaining the net proceeds from the 38 Studios Bonds, 38 Studios attempted

to obtain the additional financing it would need to complete Project Copernicus. It was unable to
do so.
74.

In the spring of 2012, 38 Studios defaulted on its loan payments to the EDC.

75.

38 Studios filed a petition for liquidation in the United States Bankruptcy Court

for the District of Delaware in June 2012. That bankruptcy proceeding is pending.
76.

Bondholders were paid the interest due on the 38 Studios Bonds through

November 2012 from the Capitalized Interest Fund. To date, bondholders have been paid
principal and interest on the 38 Studios Bonds when those payments were due from both the

20

Case 1:16-cv-00107 Document 1 Filed 03/07/16 Page 21 of 29 PageID #: 21

Capital Reserve Fund and as a result of decisions made by the Rhode Island General Assembly
to appropriate funds to make those payments.
77.

At the time of 38 Studios’ default, the outstanding principal and interest on the 38

Studios Bonds, excluding amounts previously reserved, was approximately $90 million.
