INITIAL DECISION ON DEFAULT

APPEARANCE:

David S. Frye for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Brenda P. Murray, Chief Administrative Law Judge

On March 3, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. Respondents were served with the OIP by March 10, 2016, and their answers were due
by March 23, 2016. Joseph Denard Reid, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3735, 2016 SEC
LEXIS 1114 (ALJ Mar. 24, 2016).
Respondents did not appear at a prehearing conference on March 22, 2016. Tr. 5. I
issued an order to show cause on March 24, 2016, that required Respondents to respond by April
5, 2016, why this proceeding should not be determined against them and warning that they
would be found in default if they failed to respond. Joseph Denard Reid, 2016 SEC LEXIS
1114.
Respondents are in default because to date they have not filed answers, did not participate
in a prehearing conference, or otherwise defend the proceeding. See OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f). Accordingly, I find the allegations in the OIP to be true.

In addition to their repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, Respondents failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance
requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations or, through their failures to maintain
valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive
such letters.
Conclusions of Law
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require issuers of securities
registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the
Commission current and accurate information in annual and quarterly reports, even if the
registration is voluntary under Exchange Act Section 12(g). Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires
issuers to file annual reports and Rule 13a-13 requires domestic issuers to file quarterly reports.
See 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1, .13a-13. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and
may not be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange
Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), mot. for recons. denied,
Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not
required to establish violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and rules thereunder. See SEC v.
McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C.
1978). By failing to timely file required periodic reports, Respondents violated Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
Sanction
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
the registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
3

opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining the public interest or what sanctions will
adequately protect investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness
of the issuer’s violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of
culpability involved, the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure
future compliance, and the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.”
Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *1920 (May 31, 2006).
Respondents’ failures to file required periodic reports are serious because they violate a
central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is “to supply investors
with current and accurate financial information about an issuer so that they may make sound
[investment] decisions.” Id. at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that
Congress fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate
misrepresentations in the sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st
Cir. 1977). Respondents’ violations are also recurrent in that they repeatedly failed to file
periodic reports for several years. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21, 2009); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008).
Respondents are culpable because they knew, or should have known, of their obligation
to file periodic reports. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 249.308a, .310 (Commission Forms 10-Q, 10-K);
China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60
(Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that scienter is not necessary to establish grounds for revocation); Robert
L. Burns, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 3260, 2011 SEC LEXIS 2722, at *41
n.60 (Aug. 5, 2011) (stating that the Commission has “repeatedly held that ignorance of the
securities laws is not a defense to liability thereunder”). By not participating in this proceeding,
Respondents forfeited an opportunity to show they have made efforts to remedy their past
violations and to offer assurances against further violations.
On these facts, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke the
registration of each class of Respondents’ registered securities
Order
I ORDER that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
registrations of each class of registered securities of Respondents Joseph Denard Reid (a/k/a
Reid Joseph Denard), Shared 1, Inc., Vanport Acquisition I, Corp., Westview Acquisition Corp.,
Wi-Net Communications Inc., Wisdom Holdings, Inc., Yang Holding Company, and Youngheart
Production Holding Co, Inc., are REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Rule of Practice 360. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, I FURTHER ORDER
that a party may file a petition for review of this initial decision within twelve days after service
of the initial decision. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(b). A party may also file a motion to correct a
manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision, pursuant to Rule of Practice 111. See
4

17 C.F.R. § 201.111. If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a party
shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the order resolving such
motion to correct a manifest error of fact. The initial decision will not become final until the
Commission enters an order of finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a
party files a petition for review or motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission
determines on its own initiative to review the initial decision as to a party. If any of these events
occur, the initial decision shall not become final as to that party.
In addition, a respondent has the right to file a motion to set aside a default within a
reasonable time, stating the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and specifying the nature of
the proposed defense. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). The Commission can set aside a default at any time
for good cause. Id.
