Important Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in this presentation are “forward-looking statements.” These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and Elio
Motors, Inc. (the “Company”) undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking information. Risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from planned operations include, without limitation, delays in receipt of adequate financing,
delays in commencement of production, decreased consumer interest in the Company's products, downturn in general economic
conditions, increased production costs and availability of raw materials, competition, and unfavorable market and regulatory
conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the Company's control.
Readers are referred to the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, specifically the most
recent reports which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forwardlooking statements. The information contained in this presentation is a statement of the Company's present intentions, beliefs or
expectations and is based upon, among other things, the existing business environment, industry conditions, market conditions and
prices, the economy in general and the Company's assumptions.
The Company may change its intentions, beliefs or expectations at any time and without notice, based upon any changes in such
factors, in its assumptions or otherwise, and it undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements
for any reason. The cautionary statements contained or referred to in this presentation should be considered in connection with any
subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that the Company or persons acting on its behalf may issue.

ABS/ESC, A/C and power windows & lock

• 75% supplier quotes in place

High mileage with IAV-Elio engine

The Elio: Safe, Low Execution Risk & Made in America

2

Safe: Engineered to meet the highest
vehicle safety standards

3

Low Execution Risk: No new
technology – many components are
off the shelf

4

Made in America:
• Conceived, engineered and
manufactured in America

Featured in these publications & programs:

• Targeting utilization of 90%

North American components

O T CQ X : E LI O

Basic Architecture: Three Wheels & Tandem Seating
• Premise: most households have at least one
vehicle that is primarily used by only one
occupant

• Two seats, front-to-back, key to highway mileage:
½ as wide a vehicle, moves ½ as much air

• 3-wheels qualifies vehicle as a motorcycle
• Lower compliance requirements saves millions

in development & launch costs
• Development time reduced by years
• HOV/Carpool lane access
• The Elio is designed to meet the highest safety
standards

O T CQ X : E LI O

Highly Engineered
• Safety – After substantial simulation, the Company

and its safety system supplier believe that the vehicle
will achieve desired safety standards in all directions

• Aerodynamics – We believe that after numerous

computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, 80+
MPG EPA Highway is achievable

• Handling – Built to achieve 0.85 lateral g’s and

perform well in aggressive high speed maneuvers

• Fit and Finish – Using current manufacturing

techniques, we anticipate that the Elio will have
world-class fit and finish

Distribution – Retail Centers
Current System
• Uses package system (LX, SX, DX) to minimize build configuration
• Forces consumers to purchase options they do not want
Elio Motors ePlus: My Elio. My Way.
• Retail centers will offer point-of-sale installed options which allows
customers to purchase only the options they want
• Customers will choose from 14 combinations: 7 colors in either
manual or automatic transmission
• The customer specific vehicle will be built out at the customization
studios and delivered the next day
Value Proposition
• Under current system, ~25% of MSRP is for advertising and
dealership network
• In Elio Motors’ system, mass personalization will happen at the pointof-sale which decreases cost and improves customer satisfaction
O T CQ X : E LI O

12

Retail Strategy – ePlus
How it will work
• A customer visits one of Elio Motors’ stores in
any of the top 60 U.S. markets
• Selects color, transmission, and desired options
• Customer’s order goes to one of 7
customization studios
• Stores are open until 9 p.m., customization
studios build out vehicles until midnight
• With 7 customization studios, all stores are
within 9 hours
• The customer gets the vehicle exactly the way
they want within 24 hours, no matter what time
they come into the store1

Key Partners
Pep Boys is anticipated service
provider to provide factory
authorized service
ADESA will use their existing
infrastructure at their auction
sites to install options

Can Change the Industry
Impact of Abandoning the Package System

• According to JD Power and Associates, at least 20%

of new-vehicle owners have never used 16 of the 33
technology features measured1

20%
80%

New-vehicle owners
who have never used
nearly half of
technology features
measured in the report

• Consumer Affairs states that option packages lose
value at a much quicker rate than vehicles2

• Consumers are being forced to buy expensive option
packages that include unwanted, unused features

• The “ePlus: My Elio. My Way.” mass personalization

system provides option suppliers with accurate data
on the desirability of their offering

ePlus creates a revenue stream for
Elio Motors as owners continue to
add new features on their vehicles
after they have purchased their Elio
