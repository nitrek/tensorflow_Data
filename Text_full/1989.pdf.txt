Enforcement Program
Introduction
An aggressive and comprehensive program to enforce the federal securities
laws is essential to investor protection and to investor confidence in the
integrity, fairness, and efficiency of the securities markets. The enforcement
program is designed to maintain a presence in all areas within the Commission's jurisdiction, to concentrate on particular problem areas, and to anticipate emerging problems.
Key 1989 Results
As a result of developments in the securities markets, the complexity of the
enforcement activities has increased. Over the past several years the number
of brokers, dealers, and investment advisers has grown, trading volume and
the volatility of the markets have increased, and new and more complex
trading vehicles and strategies are being offered.

In fiscal year 1989, the Commission obtained court orders requiring
defendants to return illicit profits amounting to approximately $421 million,
either as disgorgement or as restitution to defrauded investors or entities.
Disgorgement orders in insider trading cases amounted to approximately $32
million. Civil penalties under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 (ITSA)
amounted to approximately $29 million.
The Commission granted access to its files to federal and state prosecutorial
authorities in 226 cases. An estimated 76 criminal indictments or informations and 72 convictions were obtained by criminal authorities during fiscal
year 1989 in Commission-related cases.
In response to the increasing globalization of the securities markets, the
Commission has thus far entered into a total of eight bilateral informationsharing agreements with various foreign authorities, including recent agreements entered into with France, Italy, and the Netherlands. In fiscal year 1989,
the staff made 101 formal requests to foreign authorities for assistance and
received 150 requests from foreign authorities.
Enforcement actions initiated by the Commission generally are preceded by
an examination pursuant to the Commission's inspection powers or an
1

investigation. The Commission is authorized to conduct investigations and
examinations of broker-dealers, municipal securities dealers, investment
advisers, investment companies, transfer agents, and self-regulatory organizations. Informal investigations are conducted on a voluntary basis, with the
Commission requesting persons with relevant information to cooperate by
providing documents and testifying before Commission staff. The federal
securities laws also empower the Commission to conduct formal investigations, providing the Commission with the authority to issue formal subpoenas
compelling the production of books and records and the appearance of
witnesses to testify. Both types of investigations are generally conducted on a
confidential, nonpublic basis.
The primary enforcement action utilized by the Commission is the injunctive action. The federal securities laws authorize the Commission to seek
temporary restraining orders and preliminary and permanent injunctions
against any person who is violating or about to violate any provision of the
federal securities laws. Conduct which violates an injunction is punishable by
civil or criminal contempt, and violators are subject to fines or imprisonment.
In addition to seeking orders prohibiting future violations, the Commission
often seeks other equitable relief in the form of an accounting and disgorgement of illegal profits, rescission or restitution. When seeking temporary
restraining orders, the Commission often requests an order freezing assets to
prevent concealment of assets or dissipation of the proceeds of illegal
conduct. The Commission is specifically authorized to seek civil penalties in
connection with insider trading violations.
Several types of administrative proceedings may be instituted by the
Commission. For example, Section 8(d) of the Securities Act of 1933
(Securities Act) enables the Commission to institute proceedings to suspend
the effectiveness of a registration statement that contains false and misleading
statements. Administrative proceedings pursuant to Section 15(cX4) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) may be instituted against any
person who fails to comply and any person who is a cause of failure to comply
with the reporting, beneficial ownership, proxy, and tender offer provisions.
Respondents may be ordered to comply or effect compliance with the relevant
provisions. The Commission may also institute administrative proceedings
against regulated entities and associated persons. Sanctions include censures, limitations on activities, and the suspension or revocation of the
registration of such entities. Additionally, the Commission may impose
similar sanctions on persons associated with such entities and persons
affiliated with investment companies. Administrative proceedings may be
instituted against persons who appear and practice before the agency, such as
accountants and attorneys. Sanctions, including suspensions and bars, may
be imposed in these proceedings.
Under appropriate circumstances, matters are referred to other federal, state
or local authorities or to self-regulatory organizations such as the New York
Stock Exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers. The staff
may render substantial assistance to criminal authorities, such as the Department of Justice, for the criminal prosecution of securities violations.

International

Affairs

The increasing internationalization of the world's securities markets has
raised new issues that affect the enforcement of the federal securities laws. The
Commission has developed mutual lnforrnatlon-sharinq agreements on a
bilateral basis with various foreign authorities. These agreements allow the
Commission to obtain evidence located abroad while avoiding the conflicts
that may result from differences in legal systems. In addition, the staff
coordinates closely with the regulators with whom the Commission has
information-sharing agreements in order to develop ways to implement and
improve the agreements.
The Commission also cooperates on an informal basis with foreign regulators with whom it does not have explicit agreements by assisting them in
obtaining publicly available information on a voluntary basis, and, where
appropriate, granting them access to certain nonpublic investigative files.
Close consultation is maintained with the Departments of State and Justice
concerning the negotiation of Commission agreements and U.S. criminal
mutual legal assistance treaties to ensure that such treaties cover securities
offenses.
The Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 (ITSFEA), which became effective November 19, 1988, amended the Exchange
Act to provide, among other things, that the Commission may use the full
range of its powers to assist foreign securities authorities. This provision
enabled the Commission to enter into recent information-sharing agreements
with France and the Netherlands. Other countries are following the U.S. lead
in this area by developing similar legislation that will allow the development
of additional agreements.
The staff has provided training and education in connection with programs
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Justice Securities and Commodities
Fraud Working Group, the North American Securities Administrators Association, the American Law Institute/American Bar Association, the International Bar Association, and other professional groups. In October 1988, the
Commission sponsored a conference on international market manipulation
that was attended by representatives from eleven countries.
The Commission
has participated
in the following international
organizations.
The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). The
Commission currently chairs the Executive Committee and has been an active
participant in several of IOSCO's substantive technical committee meetings
and working groups.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The
Commission staff has participated in discussions at the OECD regarding the
establishment of international standards governing foreign corrupt practices.
The Group of Negotiations on Services (GNS) to the General Agreements on
Tariff and Trade (GATT). The GATT involves representatives from 150 countries, including the United States. The Commission is an active participant in
3

Program Areas

During 1989, the Commission maintained an aggressive enforcement
presence in each area within its jurisdiction. The Commission established new
programs and maintained existing programs to address particular problem
areas; these include the creation of the SEC Penny Stock Task Force in
October 1988 and the formation, as announced in December 1989, of a new
enforcement unit devoted primarily to detecting, investigating, and prosecuting securities fraud in the banking and thrift industries. Principal areas in
which enforcement actions were instituted in fiscal year 1989 include insider
trading and other violations related to contests for corporate control, securities offering violations, financial fraud, and violations by regulated entities.
(See Table 19 for a listing of enforcement actions instituted in fiscal year 1989.)
Unless otherwise noted, enforcement actions discussed below were settled
upon consent of defendants or respondents without admitting or denying the
factual allegations contained in the complaint or order for proceedings.
Penny Stock Cases

The Commission recently has focused increased attention on the problem
of fraud in the offer and sale of "penny stocks" (penny stocks are low priced
securities, usually offered below $5 per share when initially placed on the
market, and generally traded in the over-the-counter market). Penny stock
cases may involve various types of violative activities, such as market
manipulation and offering violations. Penny stocks have become the subject
of numerous manipulative schemes typically involving either newly formed
"blank check" companies (companies that conduct registered offerings
disclosing that the proposed use of proceeds is to seek generally unspecified
business opportunities) or existing companies with no assets or operations,
and small trading markets. These shell companies are then merged with
private companies purported by the promoters to have great growth potential,
and promoted and marketed to the investing public through the use of
extreme high pressure tactics. The securities may be manipulated to reach
highly inflated prices, at which point the promoters may dump shares they
own into the public market and move on.
These schemes have spread nationwide, and the Commission has initiated
active programs to deal with them. In October 1988, the Commission
established an in-house Penny Stock Task Force to: (1) increase coordination
and information-sharing with other federal, state and local regulators and
prosecutors; (2) step up enforcement activities, including criminal referrals
when appropriate; (3) target regulatory solutions; and (4) educate investors to
recognize and avoid penny stock fraud.
4

In fiscal year 1989, the Commission instituted an administrative proceeding
(In the Matter of the Stuart-James Co., Inc., et al.1) against a broker-dealer
specializing in underwriting and trading speculative low priced over-thecounter securities, and against various associated persons of that brokerdealer. The allegations include excessive undisclosed markups on the first day
of trading in two new issues underwritten by the broker-dealer, use by the retail
sales force of false and misleading scripts predicting price increases in
speculative low priced securities, undisclosed policies permitting execution of
customer sell orders only if an offsetting buy from another customer could be
arranged, and tie-in sales agreements in some offices that conditioned
customer receipt of new stock issues on the customer's agreement to either
purchase more new issues in the aftermarket or to sell all or some of their new
issue on the first day of aftermarket trading. At the close of the fiscal year, the
proceeding was pending.
The Commission also filed an action, SEC v. Amold Kimmes, et al.,2 alleging
that Arnold Kimmes, Thomas Quinn, and Michael Wright, among others,
were engaged in an international scheme to defraud the public in the
registration, trading, and sale of two penny stocks, GSS Venture Capital
Corporation ("GSS") and Max, Inc. ("Max"). Both GSS and Max, it is alleged,
were sham corporations from their inception. The GSS scheme allegedly
included figurehead officers and directors, placement of stock in nominee
accounts, and stock price manipulations. The Commission's complaint
alleged that over 2,000 U.S. and foreign investors from at least 45 countries
lost in excess of $10 million through their investments in GSS securities. The
Commission also alleged that Max had its price artificially inflated through a
series of alleged manipulations-its
price rose from $.15 per unit (which
consisted of one share of common stock and eight warrants) to over $4 per
share alone, and in Europe to as much as $6.50 per share. Kimmes, Wright,
and Quinn consented to the entry of preliminary injunctions against them;
permanent injunctions were entered against three other defendants. At
year-end, the case remained pending against certain defendants. In related
criminal proceedings, Arnold Kimmes and Michael Kimmes (also a defendant
in the Commission's action) pled guilty to criminal charges based on the
manipulation of penny stocks.
Other penny stock fraud cases include SEC v. Arthur Tuchinsky, et al.,3 in
which it is alleged that the defendants disseminated information about
mergers and acquisitions involving the issuer that had not in fact occurred. At
year-end this case was pending. In a case involving the manipulation of trading
in the securities of three blind pool issuers, defendants were enjoined and
ordered to disgorge $100,000. The registration of the broker-dealer involved
was revoked and its president was barred (SEC v. Brownstone-Smith Securities
Cotp., et al.4 and In the Matter of Brownstone-Smith Securities Cotp., et al.5). In
SEC v. Habersheir Securities, Inc.,6 involving net capital violations by a penny
stock broker, the broker-dealer consented to entry of a permanent injunction
following issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order against it.

Insider Trading
Insider trading refers generally to the purchase or sale of securities in breach
of a fiduciary duty or a relationship of trust or confidence, while in possession
of material nonpublic information about an issuer or the trading market for an
issuer's securities. The federal securities laws prohibit such trading not only by
corporate officers and directors and other persons having a relationship of
trust or confidence with the issuer or its shareholders, but also by persons who
misappropriate material nonpublic information from the issuer or sources
other than the issuer. Tippees of such persons may also be subject to the
prohibition. Insider trading in the context of tender offers is also specifically
prohibited.
With respect to insider trading cases, the Commission generally seeks
permanent injunctions and other equitable relief, including disgorgement of
profits gained or losses avoided, and civil penalties under the Insider Trading
Sanctions Act of 1984 (ITSA), which authorizes the courts to impose penalties
up to three times the profits gained or losses avoided through insider trading.
The Commission generally institutes administrative proceedings and seeks
suspensions or bars from further association with the securities industry
against broker-dealers or investment advisers or persons associated with
entities engaged in insider trading violations.
The ITSFEA, effective in November 1988, supplemented the Commission's
ability to respond to insider trading violations. The ITSFEA, among other
things, (1) expands the scope of civil penalties to include liability of "controlling persons" who fail to take appropriate measures to prevent insider
trading by their employees; (2) gives the Commission discretionary authority
to award bounty payments to persons who provide information leading to the
recovery of civil penalties in insider trading cases; (3) requires brokers,
dealers, and investment advisers to establish, maintain, and enforce written
policies designed to prevent misuse of material nonpublic information; (4)
increases the maximum jail term and fine for those convicted of criminal
securities law violations; and (5) codifies a private right of action for contemporaneous traders.
Considerable staff resources are used in insider trading investigations and
subsequent litigation. This past fiscal year, the Commission brought 39
enforcement actions based primarily on insider trading violations and four
other actions that included insider trading allegations. Cases involving insider
trading are only one component of the Commission's comprehensive enforcement program. The magnitude and gravity of the cases recently brought by
the Commission and the criminal prosecutions initiated by the U.S. Attorney's
Office for the Southern District of New York, however, reflect the continuing
importance of this issue.
The Commission brought a number of cases involving insider trading in
connection with mergers, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and other extraordinary corporate developments. For example, in SEC v. GLenn GoLenberg, et
aL.,7 the Commission alleged, among other things, that the principal of an
investment banking firm that was the investment adviser to the management
6

of Revco D.S., Inc., during leveraged buyout negotiations, disclosed material
nonpublic information regarding the buyout to three of the other defendants
who traded in Revco common stock and options. After the public announcement, this individual continued to disclose material nonpublic information
regarding the status, timing, and price of the transaction to other defendants
who continued to trade Revco stock and options. The defendants were
enjoined and ordered to disgorge a total of $794,780.44 and to pay a total of
$1,125,946.62 in ITSA penalties. The investment banker was barred (In the
Matter of Glenn Golenberg 8).

The Commission also brought an action, SEC v. William S. Banowsky,9
against a member of the board of directors of a corporation involved in a
potential merger. In this action, the Commission alleged that the defendant
had tipped information concerning the merger to his secretary and two
relatives. As a result of this tipping, 18 persons traded stocks and call options
for an aggregate profit of $442,837.54. The defendant consented to the entry
of an order enjoining and ordering him to disgorge an amount equal to the
profits of those who traded and to pay a civil penalty of $311,613.71.
Other cases involving insider trading while in possession of material
nonpublic information regarding extraordinary corporate developments
include SEC v. David Hellberg, et al.,10 in which the Commission's complaint
alleges that a person traded on information obtained from his son concerning
a proposed tender offer by the son's employer. The father allegedly realized a
profit of approximately $328,844 on an investment of $15,049.81. An
injunction was entered against the son, and at year-end the action was pending
against the father. In SEC v. Kerry A. Huston, et ai.,ll the Commission's
complaint alleges that a paralegal provided information obtained during the
course of her employment with a law firm concerning a proposed merger and
leveraged buyout contemplated by a client of the law firm to others who traded
on the information. This case was pending at the end of the year.
The Commission instituted actions against an editor of BusinessWeek
magazine, a- salesman for a company that printed the magazine, and others
who allegedly traded while in possession of pre-publication information about
the content of articles that were to appear in the magazine. In SEC v. Seymour
G. Rudermen.t? the Commission's complaint alleged that the defendant, the
magazine's editor of broadcast operations, purchased the securities of over 50
companies that he knew were to be the subject of favorable articles. Ruderman
consented to entry of an injunction and agreed to disgorge $20,734.89
representing his profits, and to pay an equal amount as a civil penalty.
In SEC v. Shayne A. Waiters, 13 the Commission's complaint alleged that the
salesman obtained copies of BusinessWeek from his employer's plant before
the magazine was available to the public generally. While in possession of
material nonpubllc information, Walters allegedly purchased securities of at
least thirteen companies that were favorably discussed in the magazine, and
communicated this information to his broker. Beginning in May 1987, Walters'
broker allegedly gave Walters large cash payments in exchange for nonpublic
editions of Business Week, purchased securities of more than 40 companies,
and communicated information to others who purchased securities of over 60
7

companies. Walters admitted to the Commission's allegations and consented
to the entry of an injunction and an order requiring him to disgorge
$31,033.11, representing his profits, and to pay an equal amount as a civil
penalty. In SEC v. William J. Dillon, et ai.,14 the Commission's complaint
charges five defendants, including a former registered representative and a
lawyer, with insider trading while in possession of information to be published
in the magazine. At the end of the fiscal year, this action was pending (SEC v.
Stephen Sui-Kuen Wang, et aI.15).
On August 2, 1989, a settlement was reached with Fred Lee, who the
Commission had previously alleged to have made more than $19 million
through trading in more than 20 securities based on material nonpublic
information, using overseas accounts in more that 30 different names. Lee was
enjoined and paid $25,150,000 to the court appointed receiver in the action.
In the first insider trading case tried to a jury, the Commission was successful
in obtaining an order requiring the defendant to pay a civil penalty. Previously,
civil penalties recovered by the Commission had been paid pursuant to
settlements of Commission injunctive actions. In SEC u. John Naylor Clark
111,16 a federal jury found the defendant, Clark, liable for insider trading, and
the court thereafter ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000. At trial, the
jury found that Clark had misappropriated material nonpublic information
from his employer regarding the employer's plan to acquire another corporation and had violated Section 1O(b)of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 by
purchasing stock of the target corporation while in possession of this
information. The defendant sold the stock after the public announcement of
the acquisition. In addition to the requirement that he pay a civil penalty, Clark
was also enjoined and ordered to disgorge $57,025.82, representing profits
realized by him, his wife and his broker, and to pay prejudgment interest.

Financial Disclosure
Actions involving false and misleading disclosures concerning the financial
condition of companies and the issuance of false financial statements are
often complex and require more resources than other types of cases, but their
effective prosecution is essential to preserving the integrity of the disclosure
system. In fiscal year 1989, the Commission brought 30 cases containing
significant allegations of financial disclosure violations against issuers, regulated entities or their employees (including four actions in which financial
disclosure violations were alleged in addition to other primary violations).
Many of these cases included alleged violations of the accounting provisions
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Commission also brought 12 cases
alleging misconduct by accounting firms or their partners or employees.
The Commission filed an action against the founder and chairman of Crazy
Eddie, Inc. and six other officers, directors, and employees of Crazy Eddie.
The Commission's complaint alleges that the employees, at the chairman's
direction, falsified financial records to overstate the company's pretax income
by $2 million in 1986 and to show pretax earnings of $20.6 million instead of
a net loss in 1987. Four defendants also allegedly sold over $60 million of
Crazy Eddie stock while aware that the price of the stock did not reflect the
8

actual value of the company. Three defendants (not charged with insider
trading) consented to the entry of injunctions against them. At the close of the
year the case was pending against the remaining defendants (SEC v. Eddie
Antar, et aIY).

A number of cases involved the improper recognition of revenue or income.
In SEC v. Donald D. Sheelen, et al., 16 the Commission's complaint alleged that
the former chairman, chief executive officer and president of Regina Company, Inc., and the former chief financial officer of Regina, with the assistance
of other corporate employees, devised and implemented a scheme to inflate
the revenue and profits of Regina to meet predetermined sales and profit
targets and permit Regina to report steadily increasing sales and earnings.
Among other things, the alleged scheme involved a failure to record at least
$13 miIlion of product returns, the recording of more than $5 miIlion of
fictitious revenue from false invoices, and inflation of profits by falsely
lowering the costs of goods sold on Regina's books. The two defendants
consented to the entry of injunctions against them.
Injunctive and administrative proceedings were also instituted against
employees of Matrix Science Corporation who were allegedly engaged in
improper accounting practices, including holding quarterly financial records
open beyond the last calendar day of the quarter to record additional sales
revenue, preprinting invoices for orders that had not been shipped to permit
the improper recording of such orders as sales, and delaying the issuance of
credit memoranda for orders that had been returned. The company and seven
officers and employees consented to the entry of the Commission's order to
comply in the future with applicable provisions of the Exchange Act. In
addition, the Commission filed and settled a civil action resulting in injunctions against three former officers of the company (In the Matter of Matrix
Science Corp. et al.19 and SEC v. Ronald A. Hammond, et al.20).
In SEC v. Frederick S. Plotkin, et al.,21 the Commission alleged, among other
things, that Intex Software Systems International Ltd. failed to disclose the
unauthorized use of over $1 million in corporate funds and certain compensation paid to underwriters in connection with an initial public offering,
inflated revenue and accounts receivable in its financial statements, and failed
to disclose uncertainties surrounding the validity of contracts and orders for
Intex products. In SEC v. Information Solutions, et al.,22 the Commission
alleged that the issuer overstated its revenue for fiscal years 1985 and 1986 by
prematurely recording a total of 20 transactions as sales even though the sales
had not been completed. In SEC v. David N. Hanania, et aI., 23 the Commission
alleged that the defendants failed to disclose properly or account for a material
contingent liability. In SEC v. Wilderness Electronics, lnc., et al.,24 the Commission alleged that the issuer failed to disclose the cancellation of a major
government contract for radarscopes and demands for reimbursement that
had been made under other contracts. Injunctions were entered against all
defendants named in these actions.
The Commission alleged that certain corporate officers engaged in conduct
that materially overstated a reporting company's 1985 net income and
inventories by inflating quantity and cost figures on inventory count sheets
9

and by arranging for a supplier to send a false confirmation to the auditors.
The company, its officers, its supplier, and the supplier's president all
consented to the entry of permanent injunctions (SEC u. Rocky Mount
Undergarment Co., lnc., et ae5).
In SEC u. Timothy L. Sasak, et al.,26 the Commission filed and the
defendants consented to an injunctive action that alleged inadequate disclosure of related party transactions. Additionally, the company's auditor was
suspended from practice before the Commission pursuant to an administrative proceeding brought pursuant to Rule 2(e) in which the Commission
alleged that he failed to conduct his 1985 audit of the company in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards (In the Matter of Richard P. Franke,
CPA 27).
A number of accountants were suspended from practicing before the
Commission in Rule 2(e) proceedings based on allegations of significant audit
failures (In the Matter of Lynne K. Mercer, CPA;28 In the Matter of Jack M.
Portney, CPA; 29 and In the Matter of Edmon A. Morrison, IIpo). Accountants
enjoined for aiding and abetting violations of the registration and antifraud
provisions in connection with securities offerings by their preparation and
audit of financial statements were also the subject of suspension orders (In the
Matter of John L. VanHom;31 In the Matter of Larry A. Dixon;32 and In the Matter
of Noemi L. Rodriguez Santos33).
An accountant caught in an FBI sting operation and who pled guilty to a
criminal charge in connection with certifying that he had performed an audit
when he had not done so consented to a permanent suspension from
practicing as an accountant before the Commission (In the Matter of Marvin D.
Haney, CPA 34). Additionally, a chief financial officer was suspended from
practice before the Commission after consenting to administrative proceedings brought pursuant to Rule 2(e), subsequent to his consent to an injunction
from future violations of the federal securities laws(In the Matter of Sheldon M.
BLazar35).

Corporate Control
Sections 13 and 14 of the Exchange Act require, among other things,
disclosures in connection with the acquisition of more than five percent of a
class of equity securities registered with the Commission, proxy solicitations
and tender offers for more than five percent of a class of equity securities
registered with the Commission. These requirements are intended to ensure
that investors have material information needed to make informed investment
or voting decisions concerning potential changes in the control of a corporation. The Commission instituted a number of actions in fiscal year 1989
relating to required disclosures under these provisions.
The Commission filed an action against Paul A. Bilzerian and others
alleging, among other things, failure to disclose the acquisition of significant
beneficial interests in corporations. Settlements reached with three of the four
defendants resulted in disgorgement totalling over $3 million. At the end of
the year, the caseagainst Bilzerian remained pending (SEC v. Paul A. BiLzerian,

10

et al.36). In a related criminal action, Mr. Bilzerian was sentenced to four years
in prison and fined $1.5 million.
The Commission brought cases that involved alleged false statements
concerning the investment purposes of persons who made filings under
Section 13. The Commission's complaint against a registered broker-dealer
and three of its partners alleged that the defendants filed false, misleading
and untimely statements concerning the purpose of their investment in
Graphic Scanning Corporation, in particular with respect to their plan for a
proxy contest to take control of Graphic. In addition to injunctive relief, the
Commission's complaint seeks disgorgement of illegal discounts allegedly
received as a result of purchasing Graphic stock after the proxy contest was
planned but before the plan was disclosed to the public. At the close of the
fiscal year, this action was pending (SEC v. Amster & CO.37). In related
administrative proceedings, In the Matter of William R. Grant,38 a partner of
Amster & Co. was ordered to comply with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act.
A similar compliance order was entered against Merry Land & Investment
Company, Inc., in a proceeding based on allegations that it had failed
accurately to disclose its intent to control or influence the management of
Bankers First Corporation (In the Matter of Merry Land & Investment Co.,
Inc.39).

The Commission also brought actions against persons who made false and
misleading statements regarding proposed transactions that they were financially or otherwise incapable of completing. These include SEC v. Rana
Research, Inc., et al.,40 a pending case involvlnq a leveraged buyout of
Superior Industries International, Inc., and SEC v. Frederick J. Ball, Jr.,41
involving an acquisition offer for Fieldcrest Cannon, Inc. and Kellwood
Company. In this case the defendant consented to the entry of an injunction.
Securities

Offering Cases

Securities offering cases represent a significant portion of the Commission's
enforcement activities. These cases involve the offer and sale of securities in
violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act and may also
involve material misrepresentations concerning risks involved, return on
investment, and the uses of proceeds of the offering. A number of securities
offering cases are filed on an emergency basis. In addition to seeking
injunctive relief, the Commission may also seek asset freezes, accountings,
disgorgement of profits, and the appointment of receivers.
The Commission filed an action against Louisiana Real Estate Equity, Ltd.
and other corporate and individual defendants alleging that the defendants, in
the offer and sale of investment contracts totalling approximately $65 million
and involving condominiums in several states, misrepresented or omitted
material facts concerning, among other matters, the financial condition of the
issuer, use of monies, costs of the condominiums, their occupancy rates,
profits, and commissions. Injunctions were entered against all defendants

(SEC v. Louisiana Real Estate Equity, Ltd., et al.42).
In SEC v. Arthur Miller,43 the Commission instituted both injunctive and

administrative proceedings against a person who, as an associated person of
11

an investment adviser and a registered representative of a broker-dealer. was
alleged to have sold unregistered securities in the form of interests in a
mortgage account. This person. who raised $4.3 million through material
misrepresentations and omissions concerning the nature of the investment,
the use of investor funds. the returns investors would receive. and the risks
associated with the investment. was enjoined and barred from the securities
industry.
The Commission's complaint in SEC v. William A. Bartlett, et al.44 alleged
that the defendants. between 1981 and 1985. raised more than $8 million
from more than 200 investors residing in 23 states through the offer and sale
of unregistered securities in the form of investment contracts in a dairy cattle
leasing program. Among other things. the investors were allegedly told that
their investment was safe. with a guaranteed net return of 15.3% per year,
when in fact the program was not safe and had experienced substantial losses
and severe operational difficulties that were not disclosed to investors. The
defendants consented to injunctions.
The Commission also brought actions against securities professionals for
their involvement in offering violations. For example. an action was filed
against a registered investment adviser who made material misrepresentations and/or omissions in the offer and sale of securities in two funds sold to
approximately 50 investors (SEC v. Frank R. Breitweiser45). The defendant
allegedly failed to disclose. among other things, that he borrowed $111.000
from one of the funds to purchase property for use as a business residence.
and that the interest rate on the mortgage to be paid to the fund was below
market. The defendant was enjoined and ordered to disgorge $151.369.30.
Regulated Entities
A major segment of the Commission's enforcement program involves
broker-dealers and investment advisers. Other regulated entities. such as
investment companies. transfer agents and securities exchanges. may also be
the subject of Commission proceedings. Allegations in broker-dealer cases
typically include violations of the financial responsibility and the brokerdealer books and records provisions. or involve fraudulent sales practices.
Recent enforcement actions filed against investment advisers include allegations of commingling or appropriation of client assets. misleading performance advertising claims, and non-disclosure of material information to clients.
In April 1989. following extensive negotiations. the Commission entered
into a settlement as to defendant Drexel Burnham in SEC v. Drexel Burnham
Lambert Incorporated, et al .â€¢46 an injunctive action that alleged that Drexel
Burnham. Michael R. Milken. and other named defendants devised and carried
out a fraudulent scheme involving insider trading. stock manipulation. fraud
on Drexel's own clients. failure to make required disclosures of beneficial
ownership of securities. and violations of the books and records and margin
rules. as well as other violations. Included in the alleged scheme were
transactions based on a secret arrangement with former stock trader Ivan F.
Boesky. Drexel Burnham consented to. among other things. a permanent
injunction with respect to the alleged violations. including the antifraud
12

provisions; payment of $350 million into a fund for the benefit of persons
injured in the transactions; $300 million in civil and criminal penalties; and
compliance with sweeping remedial undertakings. Drexel Burnham also
consented to entry of a Commission order placing the firm on administrative
probation for three years (In the Matter of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Incorporated47). At the close of the fiscal year, the case against Michael R.
Milken and five other defendants remained pending. The related criminal
investigation conducted by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New
York resulted in, among other things, Drexel Burnham's agreement to plead
guilty to six felony counts.
Injunctions were entered against a registered broker-dealer and investment
adviser, along with its principals, in an action involving the alleged embezzlement of approximately $2 million from customers. The funds were allegedly used to pay operating costs and to finance unrelated personal
investments of the principals of the firm. In addition to entry of the injunctions, the firm's broker-dealer and investment adviser registrations were
revoked, and the principals were barred (SEC v. Waddell Jenmar Securities,
Inc., et ai.48 and In the Matter of Waddell Jenmar Securities, Inc., et ai.49). Bar
orders were also entered in other cases involving misappropriation and
dissipation of hundreds of thousands of dollars of investor funds (In the Matter
of Gary M. Wozniak 50 and In the Matter of William S. Hoglund51).
Bars were entered against two brokers who allegedly engaged in excessive
and unsuitable trading in the accounts of their customers, which included
several small municipalities and local government agencies. The president
and sales supervisor of one of the broker-dealers employing them were
suspended (In the Matter of William E. Parodi, Sr., et ai.52). The registration of
a broker-dealer was revoked and three principals were barred following a
conviction based on a 47-count indictment for failure to file currency
transaction reports upon receipt of cash totalling approximately $2.3 million
(In the Matter of American Investors of Pittsburgh, et aI.53).

The Commission alleged that a registered broker-dealer specializing in
municipal securities engaged in over $1.3 million in invalid closings in
municipal bond underwritings as part of an effort to avoid the effects of
scheduled changes in the tax laws. The broker-dealer and two of its principals
were enjoined; the registration of the broker-dealer was revoked and bar
orders were entered against the two principals. At the close of the fiscal year,
the proceeding was pending against two remaining defendants (SEC v.
Matthews & Wright Group, Inc., et ai.54 and In the Matter of Matthews, Inc.55).
The Commission instituted proceedings involving the trading of approximately $12.5 million in unmarked short-sale transactions during the market
break of October 19, 1987. The broker-dealer was censured and ordered to
comply with certain remedial undertakings (In the Matter of Salomon Brothers,
Inc.56).

The Commission censured a broker-dealer based on alleged violations of,
among other things, the requirements for maintaining possession and control
of securities pledged as collateral for "hold in custody" repurchase transactions. The broker-dealer was ordered to comply with undertakings to maintain
13

additional reserves for such transactions for a two-year period (In the Matter of

Prudeniiel-Beche Securities, Inc.57).

Among the enforcement actions instituted against investment advisers in
1989 was an injunction obtained against an investment adviser alleged to
have commingled and diverted approximately $3.5 miIlion in customer funds
obtained through the fraudulent sale of securities. The adviser's registration
was revoked, and its principals were enjoined and barred (SEC v. Thomas E.
Bemhoft, et al.58 and In the Matter of Forbes Portfolio Management, et aI.59). A
bar order was entered against an investment adviser for failure to maintain any
books and records (In the Matter of Roberto C. Pol06o).
Two investment advisers alleged to have made misleading performance
claims in advertisements were the subject of administrative proceedings.
Each was censured, subjected to limitations on new business, and ordered to
comply with certain remedial undertakings (In the Matter of Managed Advisory
Seroices, lnc., et aI.,61 and In the Matter of Haroest Finsncisl Group, lnc., et aI.62).
An investment adviser and its president were enjoined based on allegations
that they received "kickbacks" of brokerage commissions paid by clients in
exchange for securities transaction business directed through those brokerage
firms. The firm was enjoined and its registration with the Commission
revoked; the president was both enjoined and barred (SEC v. Dave Mason, et
al.63 and In the Matter of Dave Mason, R.I.A., lnc., et aI.64). In a related
proceeding, the independent auditor for the investment adviser was suspended from practice before the Commission based on, among other things,
his alleged lack of independence from the firm (In the Matter of Frederick D.
Woodside, CPA 65).

In proceedings instituted against an investment adviser to three affiliated
investment companies, the Commission alleged that the adviser did not fully
disclose its receipt of 50 percent of the commissions paid by the client to a
broker-dealer with whom the adviser's officers were registered representatives
(In the Matter of Heine Securities Corp.66). The Commission also instituted
proceedings against advisers to other investment companies alleging that
they had engaged in a variety of internal controls and compliance violations
(In the Matter of United Seniices Advisors, et aI.67 and In the Matter of Sea
Investment Management, lnc., et aI.68). In each of these proceedings, the
investment adviser was censured and ordered to comply with certain remedial
undertakings.
Defendants were enjoined in a Commission action against John Peter
Galanis and others. The Commission alleged that Galanis, who had been
enjoined in two previous Commission actions and was barred from association
with investment companies, had, through others, acquired control of a
registered investment adviser to three investment companies. Following the
acquisition, the adviser executed certain investments in worthless securities
that caused losses to the funds totalling $6 million (SEC v. John Peter Galanis,
et aI.69).
The Commission instituted administrative proceedings against the Chicago
Board Options Exchange (CBOE), a registered national securities exchange,
for failure to enforce compliance with its trading rules. The proceeding alleged
14

that the decision of the CBOE's Business Conduct Committee not to initiate
charges against various members and persons associated with members for
trading certain multiple-listed over-the-counter options and the S&P 250
Index primarily for the purpose of "creating an appearance of activity" and
through pre-arrangement was without reasonable justification or excuse. The
CBOE was censured and ordered to comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act provision requiring that each self-regulatory organization,
including an exchange, enforce compliance, absent reasonable justification or
excuse, with its rules. The CBOE was also ordered to comply with its
undertakings to strengthen its market surveillance activities and disciplinary
process (In the Matter of Chicago Board Options Exchange 70).
Sources for Further Inquiry
The Commission publishes in the SEC Docket litigation releases that
describe its civil injunctive actions and criminal proceedings involving
securities-related violations. Among other things, these releases report the
identity of the defendants, the nature of the alleged violative conduct, and the
disposition or status of the case. Commission orders that institute administrative proceedings or provide remedial relief also are published in the SEC
Docket.

Full Disclosure System 

Introduction
The full disclosure system is administered by the Division of Corporation
Finance (Division). The system is designed to provide investors with material
information, foster investor confidence, contribute to the maintenance of fair
and orderly markets, facilitate capital formation, and inhibit fraud in the
public offering, trading, voting, and tendering of securities.

Key 1989 Results
A number of economic and legal developments affected the full disclosure
system during fiscal year 1989. The decline inthe number of registered public
offerings filed with the Commission, beginning i n the months immediately
following the October 1987 market break, continued throughout 1989. A total
of 3,139 registration statements were filed in fiscal year 1989 (exclusive of
post-effective amendments and filings that become effective without staff
action), representing a 10 percent decrease from fiscal year 1988. The number
of initial public offerings (IPOs) also decreased 18 percent in fiscal year 1989,
including a 25 percent decline in registration statements filed o n Form S-18
(869 in 1988 versus 648 i n 1989).
Form S-18 registration statements, including home office filings, were
reassigned to the regional offices most closely associated with the business or
proposed business of the issuer. This reassignment was done to permit better
oversight of blank check and other promotional offerings in order to identify
common, potentially abusive practices and to minimize the risk that certain
persons/involved with such offerings would avoid recognition of the extent of
their activities. About 50 percent of the regional Form S-18 filings were blank
check offerings, compared t o 56 percent of the filings in the prior year. Total
regional blank check offerings between fiscal years 1988 and 1989 declined
27 percent (384 versus 280). Regional offices also continued to receive and
review substantial numbers of post-effective amendments containing new
financial statements and descriptions of properties and businesses acquired
with the proceeds of such blank check offerings.
The Division staff continued its special review of registrants' disclosures in
the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (MDGA). The first two phases of this special review were
completed during 1989. The Division also undertook a study of leveraged
buyouts, including management buyouts, and reverse leverage buyouts, in
which public companies are taken private and subsequently taken public
again.
The implications of the increasing internationalization of the securities
markets continued t o be a major focus of the program. Securities markets are
changing worldwide as a n increasing number of issuers offer both debt and
16

!

equity across national boundaries and in offerings in several markets at one
time. As a result, the lines of demarcation between domesticand international
capital markets are beginning to blur, and'domestic markets face serious
competition from a largely unregulated, intern'ational financial market. Inter.
nationalization of the markets raises numerous issues under United States
securities laws for domestic issuers raising capital offshore and for foreign
issuers selling to United States investors, at home or abroad. The Commission
took action to address the internationalization of the securities markets,
including reproposing Regulation S to govern the transnational scope o f the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Commission also pro.
posed and reproposed Rule 144A, a safe harbor from the registration
requirements for resales of securities to institutions, which may afford foreign
issuers greater access to United States capital markets. The Commission also
proposed rules and forms t o permit development of a coordinated registration
process for multijurisdictional securities offerings and tender offers with
Canada.
In other rulemaking activity, the Commission (1)proposed and reproposed
rules comprehensively revising the regulatory scheme governing ownership
reporting and trading by officers, directors, and principal security holders, (2)
proposed and reproposed rules providing a change in holding period for
restricted securities, (3) proposed changes to the manner of registering
employee benefit plan securities, and (4) adopted rules addressin changes in
fiscal year end and related reporting requirements. In the area f beneficial
ownership and change in control transactions, the Commission published two
proposals-one would modify the reporting requirements applicable to
greater than five percent beneficial owners of securities by permitting passive
investors t o file short-form Schedule 13G rather than Schedule 13D, and the
other would require Increased disclosure concerning significant equity participants in change in control transactions. Inorder t o facilitate capital formation
by small businesses, the Commission proposed and adopted amendments t o
Regulation D that revised the definition of accredited Investor and provided
that an exemption would not be lost for certain deviations from regulatory
conditions when there wasa good faith and reasonableattempt to comply with
the requirements. In addition, the Commission issued two interpretive
releases for the guidance of the public-one addresses MDGA and the other
commodity pool disclosure.
The staff is heavily involved in planning the transition from paper to
electronic filing under the operational Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis
and Retrieval (EDGAR)system. The conversion will begin during 1991 and will
continue for a period of 36 to 48 months. During the next year, significant
resources will be dedicated to EDGAR rulemaking, training, planning, and
coordination.

Review of Filings
Accounting expertise is essential to the review process, and the level of
issuer and transactional filing reviews is directly related t o the number of

accountants in the Division. During fiscal year 1989, the Division continued its
efforts to increase the percentage of accountants in the review process to at
least 50 percent. However, those efforts fell far short of the goal, as the
recruitment and retention of accountants has been extremely difficult due to
hiring limitations as well as the competition from public accounting firms,
private industry, and other government agencies.
The first two phases of a special review of registrants' MD&A disclosures
were completed during the year. The purpose of MD&A is to provide material
historical and prospective disclosure enabling investors and other users to
assess the registrant's financial condition and results of operations with
particular emphasis on the registrant's prospects for the future. A total of 359
registrants in 24 industries were reviewed and, as a result, 126 registrants filed
amendments to their reports. More than one-half of these amendments
substantially expanded the MD&A discussions. In addition, work began on a
third phase of this special review involving 180 registrants in 12 new industries
and will be completed in fiscal year 1990.
During fiscal year 1989, the staff reviewed 2,615 reporting issuers' financial
statements and related MD&A disclosures. Reporting issuers are registrants
who file reports under the Exchange Act. The reporting issuer reviews were
accomplished through the full review of 884 registration statements filed
under the Securities Act, 1,949 annual and subsequent periodic reports, and
291 merger and going-private proxies. In addition, the staff completed 388 full
financial reviews of annual reports. The staff reviewed 1,177 and 136 registration statements filed by new issuers under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, respectively, proxy material relating to 84 contested proxy
solicitations, 176 going-private schedules, and 191 Schedules 14D-1 with
respect to third-party tender offers for 175 issuers and a roll-up of three limited
partnerships. The table below sets forth the number of selected filings
reviewed during the last five fiscal years.

Reporting issuers reviewed includes those issuers filing Exchange Act
reports whose financial statements and MD&Adisclosures were reviewed in
Securities Act and Exchange Act registration statements, annual reports,
and merger and going-private proxy statements. It does not include issuers
whose financial statements were reviewed in tender offer filings.
In fiscal years 1987, 1988 and 1989, filings are included only if they contain
new financial statements.
Includes reports reviewed in connection with other filings.
Excludes limited partnership roll-up transactions. In fiscal year 1989, there
was one roll-up transaction involving three limited partnerships.
Excludes reviews of revised and additional preliminary proxy material.

Rulemaking, Interpretive, and Legislative Matters
Scope of Registration Requirements
In fiscal year 1988, the Commission published for comment proposed
Regulation S, a series of rules intended to clarify the extraterritorial application of the registration provisions of the Securities Act. In light of comments
received on the proposal, Regulation S was reproposed for comment during
fiscal year 1989.71 Proposed Regulation S consists of: (1) a general statement
that the registration provisions apply to offers and sales that occur within the
United States but do not apply to offers and sales that occur outside the United
States; and (2) safe harbor provisions designed to protect against an indirect
offering in the United States. One safe harbor (the issuer safe harbor) would
apply to offers and sales by issuers, securities professionals participating in
the distribution process, and their affiliates. The other safe harbor (the resale
safe harbor) would apply to resales by other persons. Two general conditions
would apply to the safe harbors. First, the sale must be made in an "offshore
transaction," and second, no directed selling effort could be made in the
United States.
The issuer safe harbor would establish several classes of securities based on
19

the nationality and reporting status of the issuer and the degree of United
States market interest in the issuer's securities. In addition to the general
requirements, a class would be subject to specific restrictions on sales,
depending on the degree of likelihood that the securities sold would "flow
back" to the United States. The resale safe harbor would permit non-dealers
not affiliated with either the issuer or professionals involved in the distribution
process to resell securities with no restrictions other than those imposed by
the general conditions. Specific restrictions would be applied to dealers'
resales of certain classes of securities.
Multijurisdictional Disclosure System
The Commission published for comment proposed rules. forms, and
schedules intended to facilitate cross-border offerings of securities by specified Canadian issuers.72 The rules, forms. and schedules would provide a
foundation for a multijurisdictional disclosure system that could be expanded
to encompass a wider class of issuers and be extended to additional jurisdictions. The Canadian securities regulators in Ontario and Quebec concurrently
published proposals that would facilitate offerings by United States issuers in
Canada.
The multijurisdictional disclosure system would permit Canadian issuers
that, depending on the nature of the offering, met tests of market value, public
float, and Canadian reporting history to register securities in the United States
using disclosure documents prepared according to the requirements of
Canadian regulatory authorities. Issuers meeting tests of market value and
public float also would be able to use such documents to meet United States
periodic disclosure requirements. Companies subject to United States proxy
requirements could use their Canadian documents for certain solicitations. In
addition, insiders of companies subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act
could meet the reporting requirements of that section by filing Canadian
forms. The multijurisdictional system further would permit third-party and
issuer exchange and cash tender offers for Canadian securities to be made in
compliance with the provisions of applicable Canadian tender offer regulation
where less than 20 percent of the class of securities subject to the offer were
held of record by United States residents.
Resales to Institutional Investors
The Commission published for comment a proposed new Rule 144A that
would provide a non-exclusive safe harbor from the registration provisions of
the Securities Act for resales to Instltutlons.P In light of comments received
on the proposal, Rule 144A was reproposed for public cornrnent.?" As
reproposed, Rule 144A would permit unlimited resales of any securities other
than those of the same class as securities listed on a United States stock
exchange or quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers'
automated quotations system, provided the purchaser was a specified institution with more than $ 100 million invested in securities. In the case of
securities of private issuers that did not report under the Exchange Act and
20

had not established the exemption from reporting provided by Rule 12g3-2(b)
under the Exchange Act, the seller, or a person acting on its behalf, would be
required to provide the buyer upon request with limited financial information.
Change in Holding Period for Restricted Securities
In the same releases as the proposal and reproposal for Rule 144A, the
Commission proposed amendments to the rules concerning the required
holding period for public resale of restricted securltles.P To sell securities
under current Rules 144 and 145, a person must have owned beneficially the
securities for at least two years, no matter how long a period has transpired
since the issuer or any affiliate thereof originally sold the securities. Requiring
the securities to be held for two years by each successive holder before
permitting public resales, without regard to the time elapsed from the actual
offering by the issuer or affiliate, appears unnecessarily restrictive. Accordingly, the amendments would redefine the two-year holding period to commence on the date the securities were acquired from an issuer or affiliate, and
to run continuously from the date of the acquisition. A comparable change
would be made in the calculation of the three-year period prescribed by Rule
144(k). As reproposed, the amendments to Rules 144 and 145 would not
permit such "tacking" of holding periods for securities of non-reporting
foreign private issuers.
Ownership Reports and Trading by Officers, Directors, and Principal
Security Holders
The Commission published for comment a proposal to revise the rules and
forms regarding the filing of ownership reports by corporate officers, directors,
and principal shareholders (Tnstders"), and the exemption of certain transactions by those persons from the short-swing profit recovery provisions of
Section 16 of the Exchange Act and related provisions of the Investment
Company Act and the Holding Company Act.76 The Commission proposed to
revise these rules to achieve greater clarity, enhance consistency with the
statutory purposes, rescind unnecessary requirements, streamline mandated
procedures, and enhance compliance with the reporting provisions of the
rules.
These proposals were revised and republished for cornrnent " The proposals, as revised, include: several definitions to provide greater clarity; a new
Form 5 for the annual reporting of transactions that are exempted from
short-swing profit recovery; a comprehensive approach to derivative securities
such as options and warrants changing the reporting date to the date of
acquisition, rather than the date derivative securities become exercisable, and
exempting most exercises and conversions of derivative securities from
short-swing profit recovery; and an amendment to the proxy rules to require
issuers to disclose late reporting by their insiders in the annual proxy
statement and annual report on Form 10-K.
Management's Discussion and Analysis
The Commission published an interpretive release that reports the results of
21

the first two phases of the MD&A review project. The release sets forth the
Commission's views regarding several disclosure matters that should be
considered by registrants in preparing MO&As.78 It provides guidance regarding: prospective information required in MO&A; long and short-term liquidity
and capital resources analysis; material changes in financial statement line
items; required interim period disclosure; MO&A analysis on a segment basis;
participation in high yield financing, highly leveraged transactions or noninvestment grade loans and investments; the effects of federal financial
assistance upon the operations of financial institutions; and preliminary
merger negotiations.
Form 8-8
The Commission issued a release proposing major revisions to the procedures for registering employee benefit plan securities on Form S_8.79
Primarily, the proposals are intended to reduce registrant costs by eliminating
the need to prepare and file separate documents for federal securities law
purposes that duplicate information otherwise provided to plan participants,
while assuring timely delivery of information necessary for participants to
make informed investment decisions. Under the proposed approach, the plan
information (excluding plan financial statements) and a statement of documents available upon request by plan participants would be required to be
delivered to participants but would not be included in the Form S-8 and would
not be filed with the Commission. Plan information would not have to be in the
form of a customary prospectus; rather, it could be provided in one or several
documents prepared by registrants in the ordinary course of employee
communications. The proposals also would simplify the process of registering
and reporting on plan interests that constitute separate securities.
Change in Fiscal Year/Quarterly Reporting
The Commission issued a release adopting amendments that revise the
reporting requirements
applicable when issuers change their fiscal
year-end.P? The amendments update these requirements and integrate them
with other current periodic requirements, codify staff rule interpretations, and
clarify issuers' quarterly reporting obligations when they change their fiscal
year. The Commission also adopted related amendments to Form 8-K and the
accounting and proxy rules relating to financial reporting, as well as to the
quarterly reporting rules to modify the timing requirements for a new
registrant's first quarterly report.
Beneficial Ownership Reporting
The Commission published for comment amendments to Regulation 130/G
that would allow any person who acquires more than five percent of a class of
equity securities with a passive investment purpose to file a short-form
Schedule 13G rather than a Schedule 130.81 The Schedule 13G would be
filed within ten days of acquiring beneficial ownership of more than five
percent of a class of equity securities, except that institutional investors
22

currently permitted to use Schedule 13G would continue to file 45 days after
the calendar year's end. Another significant change in the beneficial ownership reporting system would be a limitation of the percentage of ownership
that could be reported on a Schedule 13G. The Commission proposed a 20
percent cap for all Schedule 13G filers. The proposed amendments also would
revise substantially the cooling-off period currently applicable only to institutional investors; filing persons would be restricted in purchasing or voting
the stock after the conditions for filing on Schedule 13G are no longer
satisfied.

Disclosure of Significant Equity Participants
The Commission issued a release proposing to amend the instructions to
Schedules 13D, 13E-3, 148, and 14D-1-the
principal schedules filed in
connection with acquisitions of securities, going-private transactions, proxy
contests, and tender offers-to require disclosure concerning the significant
participants in those transactions.V The revised instructions would require
responses to specified items of the schedules relating to the identity, background, funding, and purposes of the filing person with respect to each person
who (1) contributes more than ten percent of the equity capital or (2) has the
right to receive, in the aggregate, more than ten percent of the profits or assets
upon liquidation or dissolution of the filing person. The revised instructions
would not apply if the filing person has a class of equity securities registered
under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.

Commodity Pool Disclosure
Simultaneously with the issuance of an interpretive statement and request
for comments by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the
Commission issued an interpretive statement and request for comments
regarding disclosure by issuers of interests in publicly offered commodity
pools.83The statement sets forth the Commission's views regarding disclosure
of the performance history of commodity pool operators and commodity
trading advisers, as well as disclosure of fees, commissions and expenses, and
also reminds issuers of their disclosure obligations under the antifraud
provisions. The companion statements reflect a continuing effort on behalf of
the CFTC and the Commission to maintain consistent coordinated requirements for publicly offered commodity pools.

Regulation D Exemptions from Registration Requirements
The Commission adopted several amendments and additions to the rules
comprising Regulation D, which had been published for comment earlier in
the fiscal year.84Regulation D provides certain exemptions for the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. The amendments revised the definition of
accredited investor to include plans established and maintained by the
governments of the states and their political subdivisions, as well as their
agencies and instrumentalities, for the benefit of their employees if the plans
have total assets in excessof $5 million. Other amendments and the new rules

23

provide that an exemption from registration requirements will be available for
an offer or sale to a particular individual or entity, despite failure to comply
with a requirement of Regulation D, if the requirement is not designed to
protect specifically the complaining person; the failure to comply is insignificant to the offering as a whole; and there has been a good faith and
reasonable attempt to comply with the requirements of the regulation.
Conferences
SEC Government-Business

Forum on Small Business Capital Formation

The eighth annual SEC Government-Business Forum on Small Business
Capital Formation was held in Washington, D.C. on September 21-22, 1989.
Approximately 200 small business executives, accountants, attorneys, government officials, and other small business representatives were in attendance. The format of the forum combined brief panel presentations by experts
followed by discussion groups comprised of the panel members and forum
attendees. The topics discussed included Seed Capital and Early Stage
Financing, Enactment of a Capital Gains Tax Differential for Investments in
Small Business, Recent Developments in the Securities Laws Affecting Small
Business, and the Use of Leveraged Buyouts by Small Business. A final report
setting forth a list of recommendations for legislative and regulatory changes
approved by the forum participants will be prepared and provided to interested
persons, including Congress and regulatory agencies.
A study by Karen V. Pincus of the University of Southern California entitled
Reporting Requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as they
Affect Small Businesses: Defining the "Small Public Company" was distributed
at the forum pursuant to the Commission's obligation under Section 502 of
the Omnibus Small Business Capital Formation Act of 1980. This section
requires the Commission to gather, analyze, and make available to the public
information with respect to the problems and costs to small businesses of
meeting their capital formation needs. The study was undertaken by Professor
Pincus in response to a request made by the Division to the SEC and Financial
Reporting Institute in December 1986. The primary goal of the study was to
explore alternative possible definitions of "small public companies" for
purposes of establishing reporting thresholds or exceptions for small
businesses.
SEC/NASAA

Conference under Section

19(c) of the Securities

Act

On April 26, 1989, approximately 40 senior staff officials of the Commission met with approximately 40 representatives of the North American
Securities Administrators Association in Washington, D.C. to discuss methods of effecting greater uniformity in federal and state securities matters. After
the conference, a final report was prepared and distributed to interested
persons describing several resolutions of the participants, summarizing the
discussions and identifying the participants.

Accounting and Auditing Matters
Introduction
The Chief Accountant is responsible for all Commission accounting and
auditing matters arising from the administration of the various securities laws.
Specific responsibilities include; (1) establishing accounting policy to enhance
the reliability of financial reporting and to improve the work performed by
public company auditors; (2) assisting in the preparation of formal Commission opinions involving accounting and auditing matters; (3) overseeing
private sector activities related to accounting and auditing matters; (4)
supervising the procedures followed by Commission staff in conducting
auditing or accounting investigations; (5) recommending that administrative
proceedings be instituted to disqualify accountants from practicing before the
Commission; and (6) assisting in such administrative proceedings.
Key 1989 Results
Fiscal year 1989 was highlighted by a number of significant public and
private sector initiatives intended to enhance the reliability of financial
reporting and to ensure that the accounting profession meets its important
public responsibilities imposed under the federal securities laws. For example,
the Commission adopted rules to accelerate disclosures concerning changes
in independent accountants. In a related private sector effort, the Commission
worked with the SEC Practice Section (SECPS) of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) to establish a reporting mechanism
under which SECPS member firms are required to notify the Commission
whenever an SEC client relationship has ended. The staff uses these notification letters to ensure that prompt and accurate reporting is made of these
changes in accountants. The Commission also issued a concept release
seeking comment on the costs and benefits of requiring auditors to review
quarterly financial data before it is filed with the Commission. In another
private sector initiative, the AICPA requested its members to vote on whether
membership in the SECPS (and its related requirement to undergo peer
review) should be mandatory for all firms with AICPA members that audit SEC
registrants. This requirement was adopted subsequent to year-end.
The Commission has identified differences in disclosure requirements,
accounting principles, auditing standards, and auditor independence standards between countries as impediments to multijurisdictional securities
offerings. Accordingly, the staff participated in a number of initiatives by
international bodies to establish appropriate international accounting and
auditing standards that might be considered for use in multinational offerings.
The staff also undertook a broad review of the Commission's independence
requirements as they relate both to U.S. and to foreign auditors. These actions
reflect a comprehensive system of public and private sector initiatives-

25

Commission rulemaking and oversight activities, private sector standardsetting, peer review programs, state licensing, and judicial and administrative
litigation-through
which the integrity of financial reporting for public
companies is constantly being reviewed, modified, and improved.
The following are the primary Commission activities designed to achieve
compliance with the accounting and financial disclosure requirements of the
federal securities laws:
â€¢ ruLemaking that supplements private sector accounting standards,
implements financial disclosure requirements, and establishes
independence criteria for accountants;
â€¢ reoieui and comment process that results in improving disclosures in
filings, identifying emerging accounting issues (which may result in
rulemaking or private sector standard-setting), and identifying
problems that may warrant enforcement actions;
â€¢ enforcement actions that impose sanctions and serve to deter improper
financial reporting by enhancing the care with which registrants and
their accountants analyze accounting issues; and
â€¢ oversight of private sector efforts, principally by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB)and the AICPA,which establish
accounting and auditing standards and improve the quality of audit
practice.
The Commission's review and comment process and enforcement actions
are discussed elsewhere in this report. The remainder of this section summarizes the Commission's accounting-related rulemaking initiatives and its
oversight of private sector activities. In addition, this section comments on
several initiatives addressing issues arising out of the continued internatlonalization of the securities markets.
Accounting-Related Rules and Interpretations
Regulation S-X sets forth requirements as to the form and content of
financial statements filed with the Commission. Also, the Commission has
adopted various rules that require disclosure of specific financial information
in addition to that provided in the financial statements. For example, certain
supplementary financial information, selected financial data, and management's discussion and analysis of a company's financial condition and results
of operations are required to be disclosed by Regulation S-K. In addition to
requiring financial disclosure by registrants, Commission rules also address
the qualifications of accountants, including their independence, and accountants' reports on financial statements.
To address significant accounting issues, the Commission may issue
interpretive releases and, when announcing rule changes, may provide
guidance for compliance with new or amended rules. In addition, the
Commission staff periodically issues Staff Accounting Bulletins (SABs) to
inform the financial community of the staffs views on accounting and
disclosure issues.
In fiscal year 1989, a number of SABs were issued to address various

26

accounting and financial disclosure issues. Particularly significant bulletins
dealt with the appropriateness of gain recognition on the sale of a business or
operating assets to a highly leveraged entity and with the appropriate financial
reporting of transfers of nonperforming assets by financial lnstitutlons.P?
Other SABs addressed topics such as: (a) financial statement requirements for
significant acquired businesses; (b) the calculation of earnings per share and
stock compensation expense in an initial public offering; (c) accounting for
sales of stock by a subsidiary; (d) various oil and gas accounting issues; and
(e) accounting issues related to quasi-reorqanlzatlons.P" Subsequent to yearend, a SAB was issued to provide guidance on the appropriate disclosures of
loss contingencies related to property and casualty insurance reserves.V The
staff also sent a letter to the United States Department of the Treasury setting
forth its views on the accounting and financial disclosure issues involved in certain
foreign loan restructurings involving debt and debt service reductton.P"
National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting
The Commission continued to pursue various initiatives that were suggested in the report of the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial
Reporting.89
Changes in Registrants' Independent Accountants. The Commission previously adopted rules to enhance auditor independence by substantially
strengthening the requirements for disclosure related to a change in a
registrant's independent eccountants. 90 During fiscal year 1989, the Commission reduced the timing for these disclosures from a possible 45 calendar day
period to a 15 business day period.?' In a related action, with strong
encouragement from the Commission, the SECPS adopted a membership
requirement that firms must notify the Commission's Office of the Chief
Accountant whenever an audit engagement with a SEC client has ended. The
staff uses these notification letters to ensure that prompt and accurate
reporting is made of changes in accountants. This system has resulted in the
identification of a number of potential violations of registrants' reporting
obligations that are being pursued by the staff.
Management Reports. The Commission received over 190 comments on a
rule proposal that, if adopted, would require a company's report on Form
10-K and its annual report to shareholders to include a report from management. The proposed report would describe management's responsibilities for
preparing the financial statement and for establishing and maintaining a
system of internal control directly related to financial reporting. In addition,
the report would provide management's assessment of the effectiveness of
that internal control system.92 The staff has analyzed the comments and is
preparing its recommendation to the Commission.
Tunely Reviews by Auditors of Interim lniormetion. The Commission published a concept release to examine the costs and benefits of requiring
auditors to review quarterly financial data before it is filed with the Commission. The release also solicited comments on other initiatives related to
interim financial data, such as expanding the number of registrants subject to

27

Item 302(a) of Regulation S_K,93 which currently requires larger, more widely
traded companies to disclose certain quarterly data in their annual audited
financial staternents.?" Under Item 302(a), auditor review of these data may be
delayed until the year-end audit. The staff is analyzing the approximately 175
comments received.
Audit Committees. In December 1988, the Commission wrote to the
securities exchanges (other than the New York Stock Exchange which already
has a requirement for an independent audit committee) and the National
Association of Securities Dealers asking them to review their requirements
regarding audit committees. These letters have resulted in (1) a petition by the
American Stock Exchange to amend its rules to require listed companies to
have audit committees with a majority of independent directors,95 and (2) the
initiation of studies by other exchanges to examine their audit committee
requirements.
Enforcement Remedies. The Commission reproposed legislation for
enhanced enforcement tools, such as the imposition of civil monetary
penalties, that may be useful in deterring fraudulent financial reporting.96
Oversight of Private Sector Standard-Setting

Through active oversight, the Commission monitors the structure, activity,
and decisions of the private sector standard-setting organizations.
FASB. Financial statements filed with the Commission are presumed to be
misleading unless they are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
that have substantial authoritative support. In this regard, the Commission's
approach has been to look to the FASB to establish and improve accounting
principles, and the FASB's performance continues to be generally satisfactory.
Oversight of the process involves reviewing the standards established by the
FASB and participating directly in the development of standards. The staff
monitors the progress of FASB projects and developments closely, maintains
frequent contact with the FASB to discuss topical issues, and participates in
meetings, public hearings, and task forces.
The staff continued working closely with the FASB and the Financial
Accounting Foundation (FAF) to explore ways to improve the standard-setting
process. In this connection, the FASB has taken a number of initiatives to
enhance its outreach programs, including task forces and field testing, and
has exhibited continued willingness to respond to legitimate requests for
fine-tuning new standards as a result of problems identified during the
implementation phase. The FAF has formed an oversight committee to
monitor operations of the FASB and to suggest improvements on an ongoing
basis. The FAF also is considering other possible changes to improve the
standard-setting process. The Commission has and will continue to monitor
carefully these activities, and continues to believe that the FASB's independence and the openness of its processes are vital to the FASB's ability to serve
the public interest and perform its tasks well.
A brief discussion of FASB activities follows.
Post-employment Benefits Other Than Pensions. The FASB held public
hearings on its exposure draft of a standard on employers' accounting for
28

post-employment benefits other than penslons.r" Presenters at the public
hearings, as welI as most of the approximately 470 commentators on the
exposure draft, have generalIy agreed that post-retirement health care benefits
represent a form of deferred compensation and that an obligation should be
recognized as services are rendered. However, key issues affecting the measurement of the obligation remain contentious. The FASB is considering these
issues and expects to issue a final standard in late 1990.
Income Taxes. The FASB issued a statement that defers the effective date for
two years of its statement on accounting for income taxes. The new effective
date applies to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1991.98 This action
was taken to provide sufficient time to consider requests to (1) change the
criteria for recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets to anticipate,
under certain circumstances, the tax consequences of future income, and (2)
reduce complexity by changing the requirement for scheduling and consideration of tax-planning strategies.
Finenciel lnstrumenis. The FASB continues to work on its major long-term
project to address financial instruments and off-balance sheet financing
issues. A final standard is expected to be issued in 1990 that would require
certain disclosures about financial instruments not recognized currently in the
financial statements. Subsequent parts of the project will include issues
related to: (1) accounting for risk-transfer instruments such as guarantees and
interest rate hedging instruments; (2) off-balance sheet financing arrangements; (3) the appropriate measurement basis for financial instruments; and
(4) accounting for securities with both debt and equity characteristics.
Other Activities. The FASB also issued statements during the fiscal year
dealing with (1) accounting for discontinuations of the application of FASB
Statement 71 affecting regulated enterprises, and (2) amendments to its cash
flow standard to exempt certain enterprises and to address the appropriate
reporting of certain securities acquired for resale.99 The FASB held task force
meetings on major projects involving consolidations and the reporting entity,
discounting, and impairment of long lived assets.
Tunely Financial Reporting Guidance. The FASB's efforts to provide more
timely guidance on emerging issues resulted in the issuance of technical
bulletins dealing with the right of setoff and accounting for leases.IOO
The FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (ElTF), in which the Commission's
Chief Accountant participates, continues to perform an important and useful
role in identifying and resolving accounting issues. Since its inception in
1984, the ElTF has considered over 200 issues covering a broad range of
topics including financial instruments, business combinations, accounting for
leveraged buyouts, and income taxes. The ElTF addressed a number of
financial reporting issues relating to employee stock ownership plans, including questions arising from the recent use of convertible preferred stocks.
Registrants are expected to folIow the positions agreed upon by the ElTF.
Those that do not follow these positions will be asked to justify departure from
any consensus reached.
AICPA. In addition to oversight of the private sector process for setting
accounting standards, the Commission also oversees various activities of the

29

accounting profession conducted primarily through the AICPA. These
include: the Auditing Standards Board (ASB), which establishes generally
accepted auditing standards; the Accounting Standards Executive Committee
(AcSEC), which provides guidance on specific industry practices through its
issuance of statements of position and practice bulletins and prepares issue
papers on accounting topics for consideration by the FASB; and the SECPS,
which seeks to improve the quality of audit practice by member accounting
firms that audit public companies through various requirements, including
peer review.
ASB. The Commission's Chief Accountant suggested that the AICPA playa
more visible role in focusing auditor attention on high risk areas. The ASB
responded by initiating a procedure of issuing Audit Risk Alerts to provide
auditors with an overview of recent economic, professional, and regulatory
developments that may affect audits they perform. The series was inaugurated
in December as an aid in performing 1989 year-end audits and includes
guidance both on audits generally and in four specific industries (savings and
loans, credit unions, property and liability insurance, and health care).
AcSEC. The AcSEC has a key role in identifying accounting practices, with
an emphasis on those in specialized industries. The Commission staff
encouraged the AcSEC to initiate a project to develop improved accounting
guidance for investments in debt securities with market values that are below
cost. In a December 1989 letter to the AcSEC, the staff specified the kind of
disclosures that the staff expects pending issuance of such gUidance.101 This
is a controversial issue where practice is mixed, and the accounting guidance
differs to some extent among industries. The AcSEC has approved the
issuance of an exposure draft of a statement of position for public comment
that would provide improved guidance in this area. 102 During fiscal year 1989,
the AcSEC issued a practice bulletin to provide guidance on accounting for
amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans. 103 Finally, at the request
of the Commission's Chief Accountant, the AcSEC is working on a project to
address accounting issues related to the recognition of interest received in
connection with various kinds of lending activities by financial institutions and
others.
SEepS. The membership requirements of the SECPS are designed to
strengthen the quality control systems of member firms, thus enhancing the
consistency and quality of practice before the Commission. According to the
1989 SECPS annual report, 88 percent of public companies are audited by
SECPS member firms, and the revenues of those companies constitute 99
percent of the total revenues of all public companles.l?" Member firms are
committed to a triennial peer review under the close scrutiny of the Public
Oversight Board (POB). The SECPS also reviews and makes inquiries regarding the quality control implications of alleged audit failures involving public
clients of SECPS member firms. In January 1990, the AICPA voted to require
membership in the SECPS for al/ firms with AICPA members that audit SEC
registrants. The Commission staff is continuing to review the impact of this
initiative on the SEC's mandatory peer review proposal. 105
The Commission exercises oversight of the SECPS through frequent
30

contact with the POB and members of the executive and peer review
committees of the SECPS. In addition, the staff reviews POB files and selected
working papers of the peer reviewers. This oversight has shown that the peer
review process contributes significantly to improving the quality control
systems of member firms and, therefore, that it should enhance the consistency and quality of practice before the Commission.
International Accounting and Auditing Standards
Significant differences in accounting and auditing standards currently exist
between countries. These differences serve as an impediment to multinational
offerings of securities. The Commission, in cooperation with other members
of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (I0SCO), has
actively participated in initiatives by international bodies of professional
accountants to establish appropriate international standards that might be
considered for use in multinational offerings. For example, Commission staff
has worked with the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), a
body of accountants with membership in 71 countries, to reduce accounting
alternatives as an initial movement toward appropriate international accounting standards.U" Over 150 comment letters were received, the majority of
which expressed support for the initiative. Issues of completeness and lack of
specificity in international accounting standards still need to be addressed,
and the IASC has undertaken to address them.
Commission staff also continued working with the International Federation
of Accountants (IFAC)to revise international auditing guidelines. Auditors in
different countries are subject to different independence standards, perform
different procedures, gather varying amounts of evidence to support their
conclusions, and report the results of their work differently. The Commission
staff, as part of an IOSCO working group, worked closely with IFACto expand
and revise international auditing guidelines to narrow these differences.
Independence
Commission staff also is studying the various national and international
requirements for auditor independence. In this connection, they have solicited
detailed information about the nature and extent of such requirements in a
number of major countries and have encouraged the IFAC to enhance
international guidelines in this area. The staff has undertaken a broad review
of the Commission's own auditor independence requirements. This review was
prompted by three factors: (1) the increasing globalization of the capital
markets; (2) the changes in the size and structure of certain accounting firms
during the past decade; and (3) a petition filed by the largest accounting firms
seeking a reconsideration of the Commission's views regarding the ability of
accounting firms to engage in prime and subcontractor relationships with
registrants that the firms concurrently audit.

31

The EDGAR Project
Introduction
The primary purpose of the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and
Retrieval (EDGAR) system is to increase the efficiency and fairness of the
securities markets for the benefit of investors, securities issuers, and the
economy. Under EDGAR, information currently submitted to the SEC on
paper will be transmitted and stored electronically using electronic communication and data management systems. Once the electronic filing is
accepted, public information will be available quickly to investors, the media,
and others on computer screens via the Commission's public reference rooms
and through electronic subscription services. When fully operational, EDGAR
will accelerate dramatically the filing, processing, dissemination, and analysis
of time-sensitive corporate information filed with the Commission.

Key 1989 Results
The EDGAR pilot system completed its fifth full year of successful operation
on September 24, 1989. It has demonstrated clearly the feasibility of
receiving, processing, storing and retrieving electronic filings. Since the pilot's
beginning, over 63,000 filings have been transmitted electronically to the
Commission.
The Commission also proceeded with its plan to develop an operational
EDGAR system. On January 3, 1989, the Commission awarded the operational system contract to 8DM International (8DM), with Mead Data Central,
Inc., Sorg Incorporated, and 8echtellnformation Services as subcontractors.
The Commission has formed numerous work groups to assist in the detailed
design of the operational system. The first draft of the EDGAR Requirements
Description Report was completed by 8DM in May 1989. The Commission
staff and 8DM are continuing work on developing both the receipt and
acceptance (R&A) subsystem, and the analysis and review (A&R) subsystem.

Pilot System
The EDGAR pilot serves a group of volunteer companies whose filings are
processed by staff in the Office of Applications and Reports Services and
Divisions of Corporation Finance and Investment Management. At the end of
fiscal year 1989, there were 580 registrants fully participating in the pilot. In
addition, numerous other registrants participated partially in the pilot by
submitting electronically filings of certain forms. This group of partial
participants includes:
â€¢ 978 investment companies submitting annual and semi-annual reports
on Form N-SAR;
â€¢ 72 registered public utility holding company systems or subsidiaries

32

submitting forms required under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act; and
â€¢
 15 institutional investment managers submitting Form 13F-E to
report securities held in their managed accounts.
No enhancements were added to the EDGAR pilot due to the award of the
operational system contract and the transfer of the pilot operations to BDM
International.
Operational System
The eight-year contract to design and operate the EDGAR system was
awarded January 3, 1989, for approximately $52 million, to BDM International, with Mead Data Central, Inc., Sorg Incorporated, and Bechtel Inforrnation Services as subcontractors. BDM, a subsidiary of Ford Aerospace
Corporation, will develop and operate the EDGAR system. Mead Data Central,
provider of the world's largest full-text electronic library of legal, news,
business, and general information, will provide the Commission with a
LEXIS-Iike full-text search and retrieval capability for the EDGAR database.
Sorg, a leading financial and corporate printer and an active participant in the
EDGAR pilot, will provide advice on the design and operation of the receipt
and acceptance subsystem. Bechtel, a long-established engineering and
construction firm and the Commission's paper and microfiche contractor
since 1985, will continue to provide paper and microfiche dissemination of
electronic and paper filings as a subcontractor to BDM.
The Commission will share funding of the EDGAR system costs with BDM.
The Commission will pay for both the receipt and acceptance, and analysis
and review subsystems. The contractor will pay the full cost of the dissemination subsystem in exchange for Commission-regulated sale of electronically
filed data and associated services.
In early May 1989, BDM completed the first draft of the EDGAR Requirements Description Report and the corresponding set of system blueprints.
After Commission staff reviewed these documents, it was agreed that BDM
would accelerate developing all major functions of the receipt and acceptance
subsystem as part of the EDGAR Release 1 software. This approach will
facilitate a smooth transition from the pilot to the operational system since it
enhances filer interface and associated support functions. This software
release is now scheduled for the second quarter of fiscal year 1991.
As a result of these changes, a new EDGAR implementation timetable was
prepared in consultation with BDM. This timetable calls for the conversion of
pilot filers to the operational system in July 1991 but will allow test filings to
be submitted beginning in January 1991. Once the pilot filers enter the
operational system, the pilot system will be terminated. The first group of
non-pilot filers will enter the operational system during November 1991,
January 1992, and April 1992. This group will consist of approximately 2,500
filers. It is anticipated that all remaining filers will enter the operational system
beginning in late 1992. Provided no major system problems are encountered
and the Commission is staffed adequately to phase-in approximately 1,500
33

filers per quarter, 15,000 filers should be converted to the operational system
by mid.1994.

Rulemaking
In order to refine requirements and assist in the detailed design of the
operational system, the Commission has formed numerous work groups
consisting of representatives from the contractor, subcontractors. and several
Commission divisions and offices that will be impacted by EDGAR. The
Rulemaking Coordination Work Group has identified issues that require
Commission rulemaking. Issues addressed by this work group include: (1)
phase-in (including voluntary filings); (2) hardship exemptions; (3) filing date
adjustments; (4) receipt and acceptance; (5) data tagging; (6) Williams Act
filings; (7) filer identification and password access; (8) preliminary proxy and
going-private material; (9) redlining; (10) correspondence filed electronically;
(11) exhibit files; (12) modular documents (formerly called reference filings);
(13) testing; (14) user manuals; (15) segmented filings; (16) paper printouts;
(17) amendments; (18) confidential treatment requests; (19) fee verification;
and (20) use of personal identification numbers. These issues will be largely
resolved as the EDGAR Release 1 software is finalized during fiscal year 1990.
The initial rules and phase-in schedule are expected to be released for
comment during the third quarter of fiscal year 1990.

Conclusion
Although the detailed design of the operational EDGAR system has taken
approximately eight months longer than anticipated, the Commission
remains committed to this project and is convinced of the soundness of its
design. Work on the operational system in fiscal year 1990 will include
completion of the system design and construction, rulemaking initiatives, and
initial training of the filer support staff.

Regulation of the Securities Markets
Introduction
The Division of Market Regulation, together with regional office examination staff, is charged with the responsibility of overseeing the operations of the
nation's securities markets and market professionals. In fiscal year 1989, over
11,000 broker-dealers, nine active securities exchanges, as well as the
over-the-counter (OTC) markets, and 15 clearing agencies were subject to the
Commission's oversight.

In fiscal year 1989, the Commission continued with market reforms
addressing the concerns resulting from the 1987 market break; adopted rules
and enhanced inspections of broker-dealers to curtail "penny stock" fraud and
other broker-dealer sales practice abuses; furthered the goals of internationalization of the securities markets through clearing linkages as well as easing
the access of foreign broker-dealers to domestic markets; adopted disclosure
rules for new issue municipal securities; approved fundamental reforms
concerning arbitration of disputes between broker-dealers and customers; and

35

proceeded with a phased removal of barriers to the multiple trading of options
on all exchanges with the ultimate aim of establishing appropriate market
linkage facilities. The Commission also furthered the development of both the
national market system and the national systems for transaction clearance
and settlement through various technical advancements which, for example,
will lead to next-day comparison of exchange and OTC trades.

Securities Markets, Facilities and Trading
Market Reform Initiatives
During fiscal year 1989, the nation's securities markets continued to
experience periods of large price and volume volatility. These events demonstrated that the episodes of intense volatility encountered during and shortly
after the October 1987 market break were not isolated occurrences. As a
result, the Commission continued to pursue many of the market reform
initiatives that were first undertaken in 1988 in order to enhance the stability
and integrity of the nation's securities markets.
Studies of the October 1987 market break recommended, among other
things, the adoption of temporary trading halts, commonly known as "circuit
breakers," in order to disseminate information concerning significant price
movements and to provide market participants with time to re-establish an
equilibrium between buying and selling interest. In order to implement these
recommendations, the Commission in 1989 approved rule changes by the
American Stock Exchange (Amex), Chicago Board Options Exchange
(CBOE), Midwest Stock Exchange (MSE), National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. (NASD), New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and Philadelphia
Stock Exchange (Phlx) that provide for temporary trading halts of one and two
hours if the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) falls more than 250 points
or more than 400 points, respectively, on a single day.107 The Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved analogous rule changes submitted by futures exchanges with respect to halts in the trading of stock index
futures and options on those futures. In addition, as discussed in greater detail
below, 108 the Commission approved a NYSE proposal to segregate program
trading orders on its automated order execution system into a separate file
during periods of significant market declines and to give priority on the
system to orders of individual investors on days when the DJIA declines more
than 25 points.
After the October 1987 market break, the Report of the Presidential Task
Force on Market Mechanisms 109 advocated the establishment of crossmargining rules to allow market participants with an investment in index
futures to receive credit (for purposes of calculating the necessary margin) for
a stock or options position that is hedged by the futures position, The
Commission implemented this recommendation by approving proposed rule
changes by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) that would allow crossmargining with certain futures positions cleared by the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME),IIO

36

The Commission also participated in discussions with the Group of Thirty
both prior and subsequent to the release of its report on global clearance and
settlement systems. III The Group of Thirty is a private sector group of
international businessmen, brokers, and others concerned with the international financial system. Among other things, the Group of Thirty recommended that, by 1992, settlement of equity securities transactions occur on
the third day after the trade date. The Commission supported this recommendation and has worked with the Group of Thirty and the securities industry to
identify the steps that must be taken, such as the further elimination of
physical certificates, to implement this recommendation.
In light of the markets' performance during the extreme volatility and
volume of October 1987, the Commission staff focused attention during fiscal
year 1989 on outlining certain steps it believes the self.regulatory organizations (SROs) should take to ensure that their automated systems have the
capacity to accommodate current and reasonably anticipated future trading
volume levels and to respond to emergency conditions. In November 1989,
the Commission published the Automation Review Policy Statement, which
states that the SROs should, on a voluntary basis, establish comprehensive
planning and assessment programs to determine systems capacity and
vulnerability. Primary objectives of their programs would be to establish
capacity estimates, to conduct stress tests, and to contract with independent
reviewers to assess their automated systems annually. 112
In addition, the Commission proposed amendments to its uniform net
capital rule, Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1. 113Among other things, the proposal
would require specialists, who are now exempt from the net capital rule, to
maintain certain minimum levels of net capital in accordance with the terms
of the rule.
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission approved proposed rule changes
by seven clearing organizations to establish the Securities Clearing Group
(SCG).114SCG is a voluntary organization of clearing agencies designed to
increase coordination and cooperation between clearing agencies in overseeing the financial and operating condition of their participants.
Finally, the Commission continued to pursue the series of legislative
proposals that it first proposed in 1988 to enhance the efficiency and fairness
of the United States capital markets and to help avoid precipitous market
declines. As introduced in the House and the Senate, the proposed legislation
provided for: (1) information reporting by broker-dealer holding companies for
purposes of risk assessment; (2) large trader reporting; (3) clarification of the
Commission's authority to facilitate development of coordinated clearance
and settlement systems; and (4) emergency authority for the Commission. 1IS
In addition, the Commission devoted considerable resources to the preparation of Congressional testimony concerning these and other market reform
initiatives.
The National Market System
In fiscal year 1989, the Commission took action on several national market
system (NMS) plans under Section 11A of the Exchange Act. First, the
37

Commission published for comment a proposed Joint Industry Plan submitted by the NASD, together with the American, Philadelphia, Boston, and
Midwest Stock Exchanges, governing the collection, consolidation and dissemination of quotation and transaction information for NASDAQ/NMS OTC
securities listed on an exchange or traded on an exchange pursuant to a grant
of unlisted trading privileges.116
In addition, the Commission reviewed amendments to the Intermarket
Trading System (ITS) plan. The ITS is a communications system designed to
facilitate national market system trading among competing markets by
providing each market with order routing capabilities based on current
quotation information. The amendments to the plan (1) recognized the use of
the "Regional Computer Interface" by the Boston Stock Exchange; (2) allowed
for the price used in pre-opening procedures to be based on the closing price
on the NYSE or the Amex in certain circumstances; (3) clarified the responsibility of a specialist/market maker who has sent a pre-opening response to
seek an execution report; and (4) clarified the procedures for resolving third

approved in November 1989.
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission reviewed a number of SRO
proposed rule changes intended to enhance or introduce new automated
systems. For example. the Commission published for comment a proposed
rule change by the NASD to establish a one-year pilot program testing the
OTC Bulletin Board Display Service for securities traded OTC that are not
included in the NASDAQ System or listed on a national securities
exchanqe.U" In addition, the Commission permanently approved a Boston
Stock Exchange (BSE) proposal establishing the Boston Stock Exchange
Automated Communications Order-routing Network (BEACON), an automated order-routing and execution system, and rules governing the
system. 119BEACON routes orders in eligible stocks from member firms to
the BSE and guarantees either an automatic or manual execution, depending
on the classification of the stock, at the BEACON quotation.
On May 12, 1989, the American Stock Exchange submitted a proposed rule
change to implement a pilot program for the use of AUTO-EX (a feature of the
Exchange's PER/AMOS order routing system) for the automatic execution of
trades in 20 of the exchange's most actively traded equities. The Commission
continues to consider this proposal. The Amex also requested that transaction
charges for the selected stocks be waived, whether or not executed through
AUTO-EX. The Commission granted approval of the proposed transaction fee
waiver on October 2, 1989.120
In addition, the Commission published for comment a NASD proposal to
create the Rules of Practice and Procedures for the Automated Confirmation
Transaction Service (ACT).121 The ACT Service is intended to facilitate the
comparison and clearing of interdealer OTC equity trades by requiring input
of trade reports within specific time frames, comparing that trade data, and
submitting matched, locked-in trades to clearing. In September 1989, the
Commission granted partial accelerated approval of the ACT rules as they
apply to self-clearing firms only. 122

38

In May 1989, the Commission adopted an amendment to its rule governing
transaction fees to extend indefinitely the exemption on transactions in
OTClNMS securities from the imposition of Section 31 transaction fees.123
National System for Clearance and Settlement
During fiscal year 1989, market events continued to underline the importance of enhancements to all components of the National System for
Clearance and Settlement (National System). The Commission continued to
work with clearing agencies, banks, broker-dealers and other federal regulators to implement changes recommended in various reports on the October
1987 market break.124
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission approved a number of SRO
proposals designed to improve intramarket and intermarket clearance and
settlement. For example, the Commission approved rule changes which, when
fully implemented, will provide for next.day comparison of exchange and OTC
trades125 and will automate the resolution of uncompared trades. 126 As noted
earlier, the Commission also approved clearing agency proposals creating the
sca, a voluntary association of clearing agencies designed to improve
coordination of clearing agencies' monitoring of common members. 127
Additionally, the Commission approved proposed rule changes by the OCC
that (1) increase initial net capital requirements for clearing members from
$150,000 to $1 million and member maintenance net capital requirements
from $100,000 to $750,000128 [OCe's futures clearing subsidiary, the
Intermarket Clearing Corporation (ICC),made identical changes to its memo
ber net capital requirements]; 129 (2) increase minimum required clearing fund
contributions to OCe's equity and non-equity option clearing funds from
$10,000 and $50,000, respectively, to $75,000; 130 and (3) authorize OCC, in
the event of a market emergency, to defer liquidation of a defaulting clearing
member's positions and to execute hedge transactions to protect against a
decline in value of the open posttlons.P!
As noted above, the Commission during fiscal year 1989 also recommended to Congress legislative proposals which, among other things, would
authorize the Commission and the CFTC to facilitate development of coordinated clearance and settlement systems, and would authorize the Commission to establish uniform pledge and transfer rules if necessary to the safe and
efficient operation of the National System. 132
The Commission staff also consulted extensively with an American Bar
Association (ABA) committee examining possible federal and state legal
impediments to efficient and safe clearance and settlement. The committee
transmitted a letter, dated April 26, 1989, to Chairman Ruder outlining
potential state commercial law problems that the committee will study.
Also during fiscal year 1989, the Commission approved clearing agency
proposals that continued expansion of the services and immobilization goals
of the National System to mutual fund, mortgage-backed, and U.S. government securities. For example, the Commission approved enhancements to
National Securities Clearing Corporation's (NSCC) Automated Customer
Account Transfer Service to permit the automated transfer of book share
39

mutual fund assets in customer accounts that are subject to a customer
transfer request (for mutual funds associated with NSCC fund members and
mutual fund processors). 133 The Commission also issued an order registering
Participants Trust Company (PTC) as a clearing agency on a temporary basis
for a period of 12 rnonths.P" PTC provides depository services for mortgagebacked securities. In addition, the Commission approved a system of the
Government Securities Clearing Corporation (GSCC) for netting and settling
compared, next-day, government securities trades submitted for clearance
and settlement by GSCC members. 135
The Commission also issued an order registering Delta Government
Options Corporation (Delta) as a clearing agency on a temporary basis for a
period of 36 months.P" The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the
order,137 effective January 18, 1990, and remanded the matter to the
Commission for further consideration of whether Delta has the capacity to
comply with the Exchange Act because the Commission had not determined
whether the OTC options trading system is an exchange that must be
registered as such under the Exchange Act. 138
Internationalization
In recognition of the accelerated pace of internationalization in securities
markets, 139 on July 11, 1989 the Commission adopted Rule 15a-6 under the
Exchange Act to provide conditional exemptions from broker-dealer reqlstration for foreign broker-dealers that engage in certain activities involving
United States investors and securities markets. 140 These activities include (1)
"nondirect contacts" by foreign broker-dealers with U.S. investors and mar.
kets, through execution of unsolicited securities transactions and provision of
research to certain U.S. institutional investors; and (2) "direct contacts,"
involving the execution of certain transactions through a registered broker.
dealer intermediary with or for certain U.S. institutional investors, and
transactions with or for registered broker-dealers, banks acting in a broker or
dealer capacity, certain institutional organizations, foreign persons temporarily present in the U.S., U.S. citizens resident abroad, and foreign branches
and agencies of U.S. persons. By adopting Rule 15a-6, the Commission
sought to facilitate access to foreign markets by U.S. institutional investors
through foreign broker-dealers and the research that they provide, consistent
with maintaining the safeguards afforded by broker-dealer registration, and to
provide clear guidance to foreign broker-dealers seeking to operate in
compliance with U.S. broker-dealer registration requirements.
Concurrent with the adoption of Rule 15a-6, the Commission issued a
release discussing the concept of an exemption from broker-dealer reqlstration based on recognition of foreign requlatlon.l''! Recognizing foreign
regulation as a substitute, in certain circumstances, for U.S. registration would
allow certain foreign broker-dealers to deal with U.S. institutional investors
without incurring the expense of U.S. registration and thereby substantially
increase the access of U.S. investors to the valuable services that foreign
broker-dealers provide relative to foreign markets. In seeking comment on its
concept release, the Commission stressed that any approach to regulation of

40

foreign broker-dealers must not compromise the essential protections for
customers and the market system as a whole provided by the U.S. regulatory
regime.
Also during fiscal year 1989, the Commission took several actions with
respect to the application of Rules 10b-6, 10b-7, 10b-8, and 10b-13 under
the Exchange Act to transactions involving concurrent U.S. and foreign
distributions or tender offers. Rule 10b-6 proscribes certain conduct by
persons participating in a distribution to prevent such persons from artificially
conditioning the market for a security to facilitate the distribution. Rule 1Ob- 7
governs market stabilization activities during offerings. Rule 10b-8 governs
the market activities of participants in a rights offering. Rule 1Ob-13 prohibits
purchases otherwise than pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer from the
time such offer is publicly announced until the offer expires. The Commission's actions permitted non-U.S. persons to continue certain customary
market activities in foreign jurisdictions during multinational transactions,
subject to certain conditions designed to prevent a manipulative impact on the
U.S. market.
For example, an exemption was granted to permit the U.K. market maker
affiliates of the dealer managers of concurrent U.S. and U.K. tender offers to
continue market making activities during the tender offers.142 In addition,
U.K. market makers 143and Canadian exchange specialists 144affiliated with
distribution participants were permitted to continue their market making
activities during multinational rights offerings involving U.K. and Canadian
issuers, respectively. In connection with offerings in the U.S. by Australian, 145
British,146 Dutch.l"" French, 148Italian, 149and Spanish 150issuers, relief from
the application of Rule 10b-7 permitted the underwriter to initiate a stabilizing bid based on the price of the security on a foreign exchange.
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission continued to promote the development of international linkages between clearing agencies and to foster
foreign participation in the National Clearance and Settlement System. For
example, the Commission registered the International Securities Clearing
Corporation (lSCC) as a clearing agency on a temporary basis for a period of
18 months.P! ISCC was formed to develop linkages with clearing organizations in other countries. The Commission also approved Depository Trust
Company's (DTC) International Institutional Delivery System, which automates the confirmation and affirmation process for institutional trades that
include non-U.S. entities and institutional trades in foreign securities.P''
In fiscal year 1988, the NASD submitted a rule proposal to establish the
PORTAL system, which is a screen. based system designed to facilitate the
placement, distribution, and secondary market trading of securities, including
certain foreign securities, that would be exempt from registration pursuant to
proposed Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. During fiscal year
1989, the Commission published for comment a NASD amendment to the
proposed rule change which was in the nature of a substitute proposal.P''
In addition to these regulatory actions, the staff participated in several
international securities working groups. The Technical Committee of the
International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) is comprised
41

of representatives of securities regulators of 12 countrles.P" It held its first
meeting in July 1987. At that meeting, six working groups were established
to study various aspects of the international securities markets. One group,
Working Group Number 3, includes representatives from France, Japan, the
United Kingdom, and the United States (represented by Commission staft),
and was established to study the issues related to capital adequacy for
securities firms from a worldwide perspective.
The capital adequacy working group produced a report concluding that: (1)
there is a need for a common worldwide conceptual framework regarding the
capital requirements for non-bank securities firms; (2) requirements should
include risk-based elements covering all the risks to which a firm is exposed;
and (3) minimum capital requirements should be based on type of business
and that firms wishing to enter the securities business should demonstrate an
appropriate level of commitment, but standards should not be so high as to
adversely affect competition. The report was approved by the IOSCO Technical Committee on June 20-21, 1989 and was endorsed by lOSCO at its annual
meeting in Venice, Italy on September 18-21, 1989. At its Venice meeting,
IOSCO asked the working group to continue and expand its efforts.

Options and Other Derivative Products
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission reviewed a large number of rule
changes that were intended to address market volatility concerns that have
arisen in connection with the markets for options and futures instruments.
First, in response to recommendations resulting from the October 1987
market break studies, the Commission and the CFTC approved SRO proposals establishing coordinated circuit breaker procedures to be used in periods
of severe market stress. These procedures are outlined in the subsection above
entitled "Market Reform Initiatives." Second, the Commission approved an
NYSE proposal imposing certain trading restrictions on orders entered into
the NYSE's automated order-routing system, the Designated Order Turnaround (DOT) System, during periods of significant market declines (the
"sidecar" rule).155 The rule applies when the price of the S&P 500 futures
contract traded on the CME falls 12 points below the previous trading day's
closing value (approximately equivalent to a 96.point fall in the DJIA). Once
activated, program trading-related market orders entered into DOT are routed
into a separate file. The purpose of channelling program trades into a separate
file, or "sidecar," during times of market volatility is to isolate one potential
cause of market volatility, program trading, from other market activity. The
"sidecar" rule replaced the 50-point "collar" rule that had prohibited index
arbitrage-related stock transactions through DOT on days when the DJIA had
moved 50 or more points from the previous day's close.
Third, the Commission approved an NYSE proposal that grants individual
investors' market orders of up to 2,099 shares entered into the DOT system
priority in delivery to the specialist's post for execution. 156The feature, known
as the Individual Investor Express Delivery Service (llEDS), is activated when
the DJIA rises or falls 25 points from the previous trading day's close and
42

remains in effect for the remainder of the trading day that it is activated. lIEDS
is designed to facilitate implementation of the "sidecar" rule.
Fourth, the Commission approved identical proposals filed by the Amex,
CBOE, Phlx and Pacific Stock Exchange (PSE) to extend current margin
requirements for equity and stock index optlons.l'" The margin requirement
for broad-based index options is 100 percent of the option premium plus 15
percent of the underlying aggregate index value, less any out-of-the-money
amount, with a minimum of premium plus 10 percent of the underlying
aggregate index value. For equity options, the margin requirement is premium plus 20 percent of the underlying stock value, less any out-ofthe-money amount, with a minimum requirement of premium plus 10 percent
of the underlying stock value.
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission also adopted Rule 19c-5 under
the Exchange Act. 158In adopting Rule 19c-5, the Commission found that the
reasonably anticipated benefits from options multiple trading (i.e., increased
price competition, enhanced market making requirements, and improvements in exchange services) outweighed the possible adverse consequences of
an expansion of multiple trading-namely,
market fragmentation, domination by one market, and harm to the financial integrity of particular
exchanges. The rule provides that, as of January 22, 1990, no rule, stated
policy, practice or interpretation of an options exchange shall restrict the
listing of any new stock options class to a single exchange. In addition,
effective January 21, 1991, but not before, Rule 19c-5 amends exchange
rules to prohibit any exchange from limiting by any means its ability to list any
stock options class because that options class is listed on another exchange.
The rule also contains a phased-in implementation schedule. Moreover, in
order to increase the anticipated benefits from options multiple trading, the
Chairman requested that the options exchanges work together to develop a
joint plan for a market linkage facility. 159
In conjunction with the adoption of Rule 19c-5, the Commission separately
released for comment a white paper, prepared by the staff of the Commission's
Division of Market Regulation, that discusses the market structure issues
associated with multiple trading of options on exchange-listed stocks and
outlines several possible market structure enhancements. 160In particular, the
white paper describes three possible measures to integrate the options
markets: an intermarket order routing linkage, a mechanism for orderby-order routing to the market with the best price, and a central limit order file.
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission reviewed several new derivative
product proposals. First, the Commission approved proposals submitted by
the Amex, CBOE, and Phlx to list for trading market basket products
designated as index participations (IPS).161An IP is a present interest in the
current value of a portfolio of stocks, is of indefinite duration, and entitles
holders to receive cash payments equivalent to a proportionate share of any
regular cash dividends paid on the component stocks in the underlying stock
portfolio. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,
responding to a challenge by the CME and the Investment Company Institute,
set aside the Commission's orders. The Court, in Chicago Mercantile

43

Exchange v. SEC, found that the SEC had no jurisdictional basis to approve the
trading of IPs contracts on a national securities exchange. 162
Second, the Commission approved a CBOE proposal to list options on two
interest rate measures: a short-term interest rate measure based on the most
recently auctioned 13-week Treasury bill and a long-term interest rate measure based on the most recently auctioned seven. and ten-year Treasury notes
and 30-year Treasury bonds.163 The options are designed to provide investors
with hedging and risk-shifting vehicles that reflect the overall movement of
short. and long-term interest rates.
Third, CBOE and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBT) entered into a joint
venture (JV) agreement which provided for the concurrent trading on the
CBOE floor of index option and futures contracts.P" Pursuant to the JV
agreement, CBT commenced trading CBOE 250 Stock Index futures contracts in November 1988. To accommodate the trading of the new futures
products on CBOE, the Commission approved rule changes submitted by
CBOE that defined the individuals and organizations that are permitted to
execute transactions in JV contracts, specified certain CBOE rules applicable
to non-CBOE member JV participants, and established trading rules for JV
and .Jv-related products.
Fourth, pursuant to Section 2(aXIXB) of the Commodity Exchange Act, the
Commission sent to the CFTC two comment letters concerning proposed new
stock index futures contracts. The Commission sent a comment letter not
objecting to the CME's proposed futures on the European, Australia, and Far
East Index (EAFE). 165 The EAFE is a capitalization-weighted index designed
to be a barometer of the securities markets of Europe, Australia, and the Far
East. In addition, the Commission sent a comment letter not objecting to
designation of the CME as a contract market to trade options on its Nikkei
futures contract.166 The Nikkei is a price-weighted stock index based on the
prices of 225 stocks traded in the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Fifth, the Commission submitted a letter to the CFTC commenting on the
CFTC's proposed rule and statutory interpretation regarding the regulation of
hybrid instruments, such as debt securities with principal or interest payments
pegged to stock market rnovements.J'" The letter suggests that, rather than
adopt the proposed rule and interpretation, the CFTC continue discussions
with representatives of the Commission and other interested regulatory
bodies to address perceived concerns relating to hybrid instruments.
The Commission also approved several other important rule changes
relating to derivative instruments. First, the Commission approved a NYSEI
CME policy and circular prohibiting a member or person associated with a
member or member organization from engaging in frontrunning involving
securities and stock index futures or options on stock index futures.168
Frontrunning generally is defined as trading on the basis of nonpublic market
information regarding imminent, material market transactions.
Second, the Commission approved proposals submitted by Amex, CBOE,
MSE, NYSE, NASD, Phlx, and the PSE requiring members to develop,
implement, and maintain specific written standards for approving customer
accounts seeking to establish uncovered short options positions, and to
44

establish a minimum net equity requirement for approving and maintaining
such customer accounts.Y?
Finally, the Commission approved a CBOE proposal to require each CBOE
market maker clearing firm to file with the CBOE's Department of Financial
Compliance written procedures for assessing and monitoring the risk to the
clearing firm's capital from positions in its own market maker accounts and
from positions of independent market makers for whom it clears trades. 170
These procedures will enable clearing firms, as well as the CBOE, to better
assess and monitor the potential risk of loss from options market maker
accounts over a specified range of possible market movements.

Regulation of Brokers, Dealers, Municipal Securities
Transfer Agents

Dealers, and

Penny Stock Task Force
In response to the Commission's growing concerns with the widespread
incidence of broker-dealer fraud and other misconduct in connection with
certain low-priced, or "penny," stocks traded in the OTC market, the Penny
Stock Task Force was created to coordinate the Commission's enforcement,
regulatory, and educational efforts. 171 To this end, in fiscal year 1989,
rulemaking and inspection programs focused on specific aspects of these
concerns.
On August 22, 1989, the Commission adopted Rule 15c2-6 under the
Exchange Act, which imposes sales practice requirements on broker-dealers
who recommend purchases of these securities to persons who are not
established custorners.V'' As a means reasonably designed to prevent fraud,
the rule makes it unlawful for a broker-dealer to sell to, or to effect the
purchase by, any person of a security subject to the rule (in general, a
non-NASDAQ, OTC equity security of an issuer with lessthan $2 million in net
tangible assets) unless (a) the transaction is exempt under the rule or (b) prior
to the transaction, the broker-dealer has (1) approved the purchaser's account
for transactions in those securities and (2) received written agreement to the
transaction from the purchaser. Exemptions are provided for (a) transactions
in which the price of the security is five dollars or more; (b) transactions in
which the purchaser is, as defined in the rule, an accredited investor or an
established customer of the broker-dealer; (c) transactions that are not
recommended by the broker-dealer; and (d) transactions by a broker-dealer
who is not a market maker in the particular security and whose sales-related
revenue from transactions in securities subject to the rule does not exceed five
percent of its total sales-related revenue from transactions in securities.
Also, as part of its effort to curb penny stock market abuses, the Commission published for comment amendments to Rule 15c2-11 under the
Exchange Act.173 Rule 15c2-11 governs the submission and publication of
quotations by brokers or dealers for certain non-NASDAQ, OTC securities.
Among other things, the proposals would revise that rule by specifically
requiring a broker-dealer to review the information the rule requires the firm

45

to have before initiating or resuming a quotation in a quotation medium, and
to have a reasonable basis to believe that the information is true and accurate
and obtained from reliable sources. The proposed amendments also would
require a broker-dealer initiating or resuming quotations for a security to have
in its records a copy of any trading suspension order, or Exchange Act release
announcing a trading suspension, issued by the Commission with respect to
any of the issuer's securities during the preceding year, and to review the other
required information in its records in light of the information contained in that
order or release. The Commission also solicited comment on whether to
modify or eliminate the rule's "piggyback" provisions that allow brokerdealers to enter quotations without having the information specified by the
rule where there has been a specified amount of recent market activity in the
security.
Furthermore, the Commission's regional offices completed 165 examinations of penny stock broker-dealers. A large number of these examinations
uncovered evidence of serious violations involving excessive retail markups,
market manipulation, high-pressure "boiler-room" sales practices, and misrepresentations to investors concerning the business activity and financial
condition of corporate issuers. Enforcement referrals have been made in 82
(50 percent) of the completed examinations, and an additional 14 examinations (9 percent) have been referred to the NASD for its enforcement
consideration. The penny stock program will continue in fiscal year 1990, with
particular focus on compliance by firms with new Rule 15c2-6, which became
effective on January I, 1990.

Broker-Dealer Examination

Program

The broker-dealer examination program seeks to evaluate the examination
programs of the SROs through the conduct of oversight examinations of SRO
members. In addition, the Commission conducts cause examinations when it
is aware of circumstances that may warrant direct Commission rather than
SRO action. In fiscal year 1989, the regional offices completed 328 oversight
examinations and 148 cause examinations. These completed examinations
resulted in a record high number of matters referred for Commission enforcement consideration (106, or 22.3 percent) and of referrals to SROs (46, or 10
percent).
As discussed above, during fiscal year 1989, the examination program
placed heavy emphasis on examining firms engaged in a penny stock
business. In addition, the examination staff continued to review for brokerdealer compliance with the currency transaction reporting obligations of the
Bank Secrecy Act. As a result, the Commission referred a number of matters
to the Department of the Treasury. The Commission also provided "talking
points" for the U.S. delegation to the International Financial Transactions Task
Force, which is addressing money laundering problems. Further, Commission
staff developed examination procedures to review firm compliance with
the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988.174
Finally, procedures were developed to monitor and assessrisks taken by firms

46

that concentrate
strategies.

Municipal Securities Disclosure

On June 28, 1989, the Commission adopted Rule 15c2-12 under the
Exchange Act, which requires underwriters participating in primary offerings
of municipal securities of $1 million or more to obtain, review, and distribute
to investors copies of the issuer's disclosure documents. 175 The rule grew out
of the Commission's previous issuance of a release soliciting public comment
on several initiatives designed to improve the quality, timing, and dissemination of disclosure in the municipal securities markets.
The release addressed the concerns identified by the Commission in its
investigation of the Washington Public Power Supply System default by
detailing the disclosure and due diligence obligations of municipal securities
underwriters.Vf Rule 15c2-12, which became effective on January 1, 1990,
establishes standards for the procurement and dissemination by underwriters
of disclosure documents as a means of enhancing the accuracy and timeliness
of disclosure to investors in municipal securities. The Commission also issued
an interpretation concerning the responsibilities of underwriters of municipal
securities under the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.
The interpretation stated, among other things, that, at a minimum, the
Commission expects that in all offerings of municipal securities underwriters
will review the issuer's disclosure documents in a professional manner for
possible inaccuracies and omissions.
Commission Dollar Practices

A variety of issues regularly arise in connection with the use by money
managers of commission dollars of their advised accounts to obtain investment research and brokerage services. Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act
provides a safe harbor for these so-called "soft dollar" arranqernents.l " In
connection with an ongoing staff review of these arrangements and their
market implications, the Commission sponsored a roundtable on commission
dollar practices in July 1989.178 Some of the issues addressed at this
conference included the relationship between soft dollar arrangements and
market liquidity, the use of these payments in the context of directed
brokerage accounts, the definition of the term "research" as used in Section
28(e), and disclosure issues implicated by soft dollar payments. The roundtable also focused on issues surrounding broker-dealer payment for order flow
in exchange and OTC transactions. Participants in the roundtable included
representatives from the NYSE, NASD, the United States Department of
Labor, the United Kingdom Securities and Investments Board, and the
broker-dealer, investment advisory, and banking communities.
Exemption of Certain Securities Issued by the Resolution Funding
Corporation

The Financial

Institutions

Reform, Recovery and Enforcement

Act of

1989179 authorized the newly-created Resolution Funding Corporation (RFC)
to provide financing for the resolution of matters relating to insolvent savings
and loan associations in part from the public offering of debt securities to be
issued by RFC. Unless otherwise exempted, these securities would be subject
to a variety of regulatory restrictions imposed by the Exchange Act. In order
to avoid delays in these financings or increases in the interest costs of the debt
securities issued by RFC resulting from the application of the statutory
restrictions, which was not deemed necessary for the protection of investors,
the Commission adopted on an emergency basis Rule 3a12-10 under the
Exchange Act.180 The rule, which was adopted pursuant to Section
3(aX12XAXv) of the Exchange Act,181 defines the debt securities issued by
RFC as "exempted securities" for purposes of those provisions of the Act that
by their terms do not apply to such securities. Concurrent with the adoption
of Rule 3a 12-1 0, the Commission issued an order exempting these securities
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.182
Financial Responsibility Rules
The Commission published for comment a proposal to amend Rule 15c3-1
under the Exchange Act by raising the minimum net capital required of
certain registered broker-dealers. 183Broker-dealers that hold customer funds
or securities would be required to maintain at least $250,000 in net capital.
Those firms that clear customer transactions but do not hold customer funds
or securities would need to maintain at least $100,000. Broker-dealers that
introduce customer accounts would be required to maintain $50,000 or
$100,000, depending on whether they occasionally or routinely receive
customer funds and securities.
The Commission also issued a release proposing to amend the net capital
rule to make the rule applicable to certain exchange specialists that are now
exempt from the rule. 184As proposed, the amendments would allow those
specialists a grace period during which they could either bring in additional
capital or reduce the size of their positions in specialty securities in order to
satisfy the value reductions ("haircuts") on those positions called for by the
rule. Under the proposal, options market makers would continue to be exempt
under specified conditions.
The Commission issued a release proposing to amend its customer
protection rule, Exchange Act Rule 15c3_3.185 The amendment would
expand the categories of instruments that broker-dealers may deliver as
collateral to customers from whom they borrow fully paid or excess margin
government securities. In addition to the instruments currently permitted
under the rule, the amendment would allow broker-dealers to deliver as
collateral "government securities" as defined by Sections 3(aX42XA) and
3(aX42XB) of the Exchange Act, and securities issued or guaranteed by the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage
Association, the Student Loan Marketing Association, or the Financing
Corporation. The proposed amendment excludes zero coupon bonds and
"stripped" securities not issued by the Department of the Treasury. Pending
final action on the proposed amendment, the Commission authorized issu48

ance of a no-action letter allowing broker-dealers to expand, in accordance
with the proposed amendment, the categories of instruments they may deliver
as collateral to customers in government securities borrowinqs.l'"
Lost and Stolen Securities

Rule 17f-1 sets forth participation, reporting, and inquiry requirements for
the Lost and Stolen Securities Program (Program). As of December 31, 1989,
21,858 institutions were registered in the Program. Statistics for the calendar
year 1988 (the most recent year available) reflect the Program's continuing
effectiveness. During the year, registered institutions reported as lost, stolen,
missing or counterfeit 626,829 certificates valued at $2,877,883,729. Those
institutions also reported the recovery of 122,627 certificates valued at
$636,405,051. At the end of 1988, the aggregate value of securities contained
in the Program's database was $15,079,115,776. Registered institutions made
inquiry concerning 2,577,303 certificates. Inquiries concerning 2,178 certificates valued at $10,679,142 matched reports of lost, stolen or missing
securities on file in the database.
Oversight

of Self-Regulatory

Organizations

National Securities Exchanges

As of September 30, 1989, nine active exchanges were registered with the
Commission as national securities exchanges. During the fiscal year, the
Commission granted exchange applications to delist 84 debt and equity
issues and nine options issues and granted applications by issuers requesting
withdrawal from listing and registration for 26 issues. In addition, during the
fiscal year, the Commission granted 339 applications by exchanges for
unlisted trading privileges.
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission received 194 proposed rule
changes from the stock exchanges. The Commission approved several
significant rule filings, including an NYSE proposal consisting of two policy
agreements in regard to intermarket trading restrictions between the NYSE
and the CME and between the NYSE and the New York Futures Exchange
(NYFE). While not affecting legitimate trading activities, the joint policy
prohibits a member or person associated with a member or member organization from engaging in intermarket frontrunning lnvolvlnq securities and
stock index futures or options on stock index futures. 187
A NYSE proposal to prohibit the use of portable telephones on the floor of
the exchange was approved by the Commission during fiscal year 1988.188
During fiscal year 1989, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, responding to a challenge by a NYSE member, upheld the Commission's decision to approve the rule, The Court, in Higgins v. SEC, found that the
SEC decision was supported by substantial evidence because it evaluated
"several harmful consequences" that it could foresee from the use of portable
telephones on the f100r.18g The Court found these consequences to be
"sufficiently substantial" to sustain the SEC action. The Court concluded that
49

the Commission decision was not arbitrary, capncious, or an abuse of
discretion because the Commission adequately considered and responded to
comments received on the proposal and adequately weighed the competing
interests.
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission approved NYSE proposals that
revised certain requirements for specialists. The Commission approved a
proposal to revise, restate, and consolidate the Exchange's Specialist Job
Description and Code of Acceptable Business Practlces.P" The revisions
replace the former specialist job description with one that provides more
specificity regarding the performance expected of specialists.
A NYSE proposal to establish certain minimum issuer and member
contact requirements for specialists was also approved by the Cornrnisslon.l'"
Under the rule, specialist units are required to make quarterly contacts, at
least one of which is an in-person meeting, with a senior official at each of the
specialist unit's listed companies. The specialist units are also required to
establish semi-annual contacts, off the Exchange floor, with the 15 largest
NYSE member organizations, other member organizations that are significant customers of the specialist unit, and any other member organizations
that request such contact.
NYSE and Fhlx proposals to impose allocation restrictions on a specialist
unit that loses its registration in a specialty security were also approved by the
Commission.192 The rules prohibit a specialist unit from applying for new
listings for a six-month period immediately following the reallocation of any
of the unit's specialty stocks as a result of informal corrective action or a
disciplinary proceeding.
In addition, the Commission approved modifications to the NYSE shareholder approval policy for listed domestic companies, as set forth in the NYSE
Listed Company ManuaI.193 The modified policy continues to require shareholder approval as a prerequisite to listing securities issued in certain
significant corporate transactions. However, the circumstances triggering a
shareholder vote were revised to clarify and make more realistic the
exchange's standards and to simplify its administration of the policy. For
example, the threshold amount for requiring shareholder approval for issuances of stock in connection with acquisitions was increased from 18.112
percent to 20 percent, and the policy was amended to take into account total
voting power in addition to the shares outstanding at the time of the issuance
to determine when the threshold would be exceeded.
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
The NASD, the only national securities association registered with the
Commission, is the largest self-regulatory organization in the securities
industry in terms of membership, with over 6,300 member firms. It is the
operator of NASDAQ, the second largest stock market system in the United
States, and the third largest in the world (after the Tokyo Stock Exchange and
the NYSE). In fiscal year 1989, the NASD reported a total of 869 final
disciplinary actions.
Additionally, the Commission received 54 filings of proposed rule changes
50

from the NASD and approved 64 proposed rules changes in fiscal year 1989.
Among the significant rule changes approved by the Commission 194 were
those involving the registration of associated persons of member firms. Rule
changes were approved to specifically prohibit member firms from maintain.
ing inactive registrations 195 and to require member firms to provide associ.
ated persons who resign or are dismissed a copy of the form U-5 (the Uniform
Termination Form filed with the NASD) and to obtain, before hiring, past U-5
forms relating to each new associated person.196 Also, Schedule C of the
NASD By. Laws was amended to establish a new category of registration for
persons who function as securities order takers (Assistant Representative.
Order Processing). 197
The Commission also approved an extension through December 1, 1990 of
the quotation linkage between the NASD and the International Stock
Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Ltd.198 The
Commission published for comment NASD proposals that would prevent a
firm that has been removed as a market maker on NASDAQ from making a
market in that security outside that system during the prohibited period.199
Clearing Agencies
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission received 114 proposed rule
changes from registered clearing agencies and approved 100 rule changes.
For example, the Commission approved a DTC filing concerning the Automated Tender Offer Program (ATOP), which allows DTC participants to
transmit electronically to DTC instructions regarding securities on deposit at
DTC that are subject to a tender or exchange offer.2OO The Commission also
approved a DTC filing concerning a system permitting DTC participants with
a short position at DTC to request DTC to use its Participant Terminal System
to invite tenders, from participants who are long in the particular security, to
eliminate the short positions.2Â°1 In addition, the Commission approved an
OCC proposal to clear and settle a new CBOE market basket product through
physical delivery of shares at each clearing member's designated clearing
corporation.2Â°2 Other clearing agency oversight activities of the Commission
during the fiscal year are discussed above in the section entitled "Securities
Markets, Facilities and Trading."
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
In fiscal year 1989, the Commission received eight proposed rule changes
from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), and approved five
MSRB rule filings. Of particular note was the partial Commission approval of
amendments to the MSRB's Arbitration Code concerning the fairness and
efficiency of the MSRB's arbitration process, and the use of predispute
arbitration clauses in customer agreements. The amendments bring the code
in line with the procedures of the exchanges and the NASD as recommended
by the Securities Industry Conference on Arbitration, as discussed in the
following subsection. The remaining issue to be resolved relates to the
MSRB's proposed definition of "public arbitrator" and whether persons with
strong industry ties should be eliminated from the arbitrator pool.

SRO Sponsored Arbitration

During the fiscal year, the Commission and staff placed special emphasis on
oversight of the securities arbitration programs of the SROs. Those oversight
efforts culminated in the Commission's approval on May 10, 1989 of major
reforms to the arbitration rules of most of the SROs that administer arbitration
programs, including all of the forums with significant caseloads. The NASD,
NYSE, Amex,203 CBOE,204 and MSE 205 have adopted the new rules. As
discussed above, the MSRB has adopted the new rules with one exception
concerning the classification of arbitrators.206
The new arbitration rules improve virtually all significant aspects of the
arbitration process. Key issues such as who may serve as arbitrators, public
availability of the results of arbitrators, prehearing discovery of information,
and other issues important to investor confidence in arbitration as a means for
resolving disputes with the brokerage community have been addressed in the
new rules. In addition, the new rules prescribe specific disclosure requirements for customer account agreements that include predispute arbitration
clauses and prohibit the use of such clauses to curtail substantive rights that
would otherwise be available in a judicial forum.
Inspections of SRO Surveillance and Regulatory Compliance

During fiscal year 1989, the staff conducted an inspection of the Amex
options, equity and financial surveillance programs, and of its investigatory
and disciplinary programs. While the inspections staff found that, overall, the
Amex programs functioned adequately, the division recommended improvements in a number of specific areas, including the use of summary fines for
its members with data submission deficiencies and a review of present staffing
levels in its Compliance Department. Further, the staff recommended that
Amex strive to generate its daily specialist capital report either prior to the
start of trading or as shortly thereafter as feasible (enhanced by electronic
submission of input for the report), develop formal procedures to monitor
specialist capital on an intra-day basis following instances of extreme intra-day
price volatility (augmented by changes to its "early warning" signals), and
require reports on financial arrangements available to specialists on a
quarterly rather than annual basis.
In a special purpose inspection, the staff reviewed the programs at the NYSE
and Amex for monitoring affiliations between large, diversified broker-dealers
and specialist operations pursuant to NYSE Rule 98 and Amex Rule 193,
respectively. The inspection staff found that both exchange programs
appeared to be operating effectively. However, the staff made a number of
recommendations for improvements in each exchange's procedures. The staff
also recommended that the NYSE and Amex improve the coordination of
their very similar programs, consider the feasibility of joint examinations for
dual-member firms, and meet regularly to compare findings about dualmember firms and to discuss means of further enhancing the exchanges'
monitoring programs.
In fiscal year 1989, the inspections staff conducted a comprehensive
52

inspection of the NYSE surveillance, investigatory, and disciplinary programs
for "upstairs" member firms' trading violations. The inspections staff found
that while the surveillance and investigatory programs were functioning
adequately, timeliness of investigation completion needed improvement.
Accordingly, the staff recommended that the exchange focus on having all
member firms prepared to transmit requested trade data electronically,
commit to greater use of its disciplinary authority to encourage prompt
transmissions, develop an automated case tracking system, and continue to
improve the efficiency of its automated surveillance systems. As to the
exchange's disciplinary program, the inspection revealed continuing deficiencies concerning timeliness and case management and documentation. As a
result, the staff recommended that the exchange implement procedures to
achieve case resolution within 12 months from the time of referral from its
surveillance division, and implement a case tracking system and the use of
internal control procedures, such as the maintenance of docket sheets.
In fiscal year 1989, the staff conducted an inspection of the Phlx regulatory
programs relating to options and equities trading violations. The purpose of
the inspection wasto ascertain the status of the exchange's implementation of
the staffs recommendations made following a comprehensive 1987 inspection. The 1989 inspection found that the Phlx had responded satisfactorily to
the staffs prior findings and recommendations. The staff did recommend,
however, that the exchange devote additional resources to identifying those
surveillance procedures that could be performed more efficiently with additional automation. In addition, the inspection revealed deficiencies in the
timeliness of the exchange's disciplinary process. Accordingly, the staff
recommended that the exchange improve file documentation, establish a
60-day time limit between the authorization of formal charges and the
subsequent issuance of charges to its members, and consider increasing the
staff of its enforcement division.
In April 1989, the staff began a special purpose inspection of broker-dealer
policies and procedures designed to prevent, pursuant to the Insider Trading
and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988, the misuse of material
nonpublic information. In this regard, the inspections staff reviewed the
surveillance and documentation procedures and interviewed key compliance,
legal, and investment banking personnel at 23 firms nationwide.
The staff conducted an inspection of the NASD's programs for review of
members' communications with the public. Specifically, the inspection
focused on the pre-use review and spot-checks of advertising and sales
literature conducted by the Advertising Department and the on-site review of
such material conducted during routine broker-dealer examinations.
Although a few technical deficiencies were noted, the inspection disclosed
that, overall, the NASD was conducting an effective review of members'
communications with the public.
As a result of findings from a series of inspections of SRO reviews of
members' communications with the public, including the NASD inspection,
the staff sent a letter to the Options Self-Regulatory Council, which is
composed of representatives of those SROs that engage in options trading,

53

recommending improved guidelines and better coordination among SROs in
the review of options advertising, educational material, and sales literature.
The Council, through its Advertising Subcommittee, has proposed a number
of initiatives to respond to the concerns expressed in the staffs letter.
In a related action, the staff conducted a survey of the Amex, CBOE, NASD,
and NYSE to determine whether those SROs, in their reviews of members'
communications with the public, found any communications that they
believed were in violation of any "good taste" standard adopted by the SROs.
Overall, the SROs reported finding few violations, with one SRO, the NASD,
having no specific requirement of that kind in its rule. Although the
Commission had, in the past, approved amendments to SRO advertising rules
that established "good taste" requirements, the SROs were advised that these
requirements are now disfavored by the Commission and that the staff would
consider future amendments by SROs to remove them.
The staff conducted an inspection of the NYSE's programs for monitoring
transfers of customer accounts between member firms, together with a
separate inquiry into specific prolonged failures to transfer customer accounts
by and between certain NYSE members. The inspections disclosed significant
deficiencies in the NYSE's ability to effectively monitor transfers, as well as a
failure to impose meaningful sanctions against members unable to consistently complete transfers within time periods prescribed by NYSE rules.
The staff conducted an inspection of the NASD's broker-dealer examination
program focusing specifically on the NASD's effectiveness in computing retail
markups on equity securities traded in OTC markets. The inspection disclosed systemic weaknesses in the NASD's ability to compute markups in a
manner consistent with NASD guidelines and Commission decisions. Since
the inspection, the NASD has implemented a number of initiatives designed
to ensure proper markup computations, including improved examiner training and supervision.
The staff conducted an inspection of the NYSE Division of Enforcement,
focusing on the NYSE's recommendations to close a number of outstanding
enforcement cases as part of an initiative aimed at effectively managing the
growing caseload within the NYSE's enforcement program. Although the staff
did not object to the NYSE's disposition of any of the cases reviewed, the
inspection raised concerns with some of the rationales used by the NYSE to
support its decisions to close specific cases. The staff recommended that, in
future cases, the NYSE should consistently consider and resolve all attendant
issues (such as the adequacy of the firm's supervision of respondents) and
should take additional steps to ensure that enforcement cases are begun in the
most timely manner possible.
The Commission's nine regional offices conducted routine oversight inspections of regulatory programs administered by ten of the NASD's 14 district
offices. These inspections included evaluations of the districts' broker-dealer
examinations and their financial surveillance and formal disciplinary programs, as well as investigations of customer complaints, terminations of
registered representatives for cause, and members' notices of disciplinary
action. Although these inspections disclosed several deficiencies involving a

54

variety of issues, most were characterized as less serious in degree and
magnitude. Overall, these inspections revealed that the NASD was effectively
meeting its regulatory responsibilities.
On occasion, the inspections staffs oversight of SRO programs indicates a
need for formal remedial action with respect to an SRO's performance. During
the past fiscal year, and for the third time in the past ten years, the Commission
instituted an administrative proceeding against an exchange based on circumstances revealed in the course of the staffs oversight. On May 11, 1989,
the Commission issued an order censuring the CBOE for failing to enforce
compliance with its trading rules?07 Simultaneously with the institution of
these proceedings, the Commission accepted CBOE's offer of settlement.
CBOE, without admitting or denying any of the matters set forth in the
Commission's order, consented to the issuance of the order, the findings
contained therein, and the sanction imposed by the Commission. The
Commission also directed CBOE to comply with undertakings designed to
improve its disciplinary procedures and to strengthen its market surveillance
program.
In the order, the Commission concluded that CBOE failed to enforce
compliance with certain of its rules when CBOE's Business Conduct Committee (BeC) determined not to initiate charges against 12 market makers
(including a former vice chairman of the CBOE) and seven affiliated firms.
The Commission found that, in 1986, the CBOE staff presented compelling
circumstantial evidence to the BCC that certain trades, entered into during the
introduction of new multiply-traded options, were effected primarily for the
purpose of creating an artificial appearance of activity, a practice known as
"chumming," Nevertheless, the BCC determined that no probable cause
existed for finding violations and did not cause a formal disciplinary hearing
to be held. Under these circumstances, the Commission found that the CBOE
violated Section 19(9X1) of the Exchange Act by failing, without reasonable
justification or excuse, to enforce its own rules. Subsequent inspections of the
CBOE surveillance, investigatory and disciplinary programs for trading violations, including one conducted in 1989, found that the CBOE programs
functioned effectively. In the 1989 inspection, however, the staff recommended that the CBOE complete its automated Market Surveillance System,
improve its audit trail accuracy rates, and enhance its file documentation. The
staff also recommended the development of guidelines for the timely and
thorough resolution of all investigations.
During the fiscal year, the inspections staff also conducted a review of
program trading strategies utilized in early 1989 and submitted a report,
dated June 30, 1989, to Congressional oversight committees on these
strategies and their effects on market volatility.
Routine oversight inspections of the BSE and the Spokane Stock Exchange,
and special purpose inspections of the audit trail procedures at the NYSE,
Amex, and the NASD, also were commenced in fiscal year 1989.
Applications for Re-entry
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission received 75 SRO applications to
55

permit persons subject to statutory disqualification, as defined in Section
3(aX39) of the Exchange Act, to become or remain associated with brokerdealers. The distribution of filings among SROs was the following: NASD (50);
NYSE (24); and MSE (1). Of the total filings processed in 1989, including those
received but not completed in 1988, six were subsequently withdrawn, 76 were
completed and four were pending at year-end. One re-entry application was
denied.208
SRO Final Disciplinary Actions
Section 19(dXl) of the Exchange Act and Rule 19d-l thereunder require
self-regulatory organizations to file reports with the Commission of all final
disciplinary actions.
A Rule 19d-l filing reports the facts about a completed action that may
have been initiated at any time during the current or previous years. The
duration of an SRO disciplinary action frequently reflects the severity of the
violations charged, the number of respondents involved, and the complexity
of the underlying 'facts. SROs generally conclude cases involving minor or
technical violations and a single respondent in less than a year. Cases
involving serious trading violations (e.g., price manipulation, insider trading,
frontrunning, etc.) often require more time to complete because of the
necessity for demonstrating specific intent to the disciplinary panel that acts
as trier of fact. Consequently, the absolute volume of Rule 19d-l notices
submitted by an SRO in a given year is not a precise measure of its proficiency
in market surveillance and compliance. Nevertheless, the number of actions
reported can be useful in assessing the regulatory effectiveness of different
SROs over similar time periods, and this information has proved useful in
focusing inspections of SRO regulatory programs.
In fiscal year 1989, the Amex filed 49 Rule 19d-l reports; the CBOE filed
188; the NYSE filed 127; the Phlx filed 166; the PSE filed 107; the MSE filed
two; the registered clearing agencies, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange and the
BSE filed none; and the NASD filed 869.209

Investment Companies and Advisers
Introduction
The Division of Investment Management oversees the regulation of investment companies and investment advisers under two companion statutes, the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act) and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Investment Advisers Act), and administers the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (Holding Company Act). The
tables below show the number and size in terms of assets of registered
investment companies and investment advisers and the number of examinations of those registrants performed over the last five years.

The number of registered investment companies increased by only 1.5
percent during fiscal year 1989. An important factor in the recent slowing of
growth in the number of registered investment companies is the number of
investment companies that now combine several separate portfolios or
investment series in one investment company registration. The Division of
Investment Management estimates that counting the separate portfolios or
series of these companies would equate to a registrant population of 16,000
investment companies at the end of fiscal year 1989. Registered investment
companies added 590 new portfolios or series during fiscal year 1989. The
58

number of registered investment advisers grew by 10 percent and the assets
they manage increased by 19.5 percent.
Investment company and investment adviser examinations completed
decreased by 11 percent during the fiscal year. This decrease was due to a
decision to devote greater staff resources to the examination of high risk
investment companies and advisers.

Key 1989 Results
Significant Legislative Developments
In June 1989, the Commission proposed legislation to amend the Investment Advisers Act to authorize the creation of one or more self-regulatory
organizations (SROs) for investment advisers. The SROs would generally be
patterned after SROs for broker-dealers created under the Securities
Exchange Act, providing for Commission oversight of the activities of any
investment adviser SRo. All registered investment advisers would be required
to join an adviser SRO, which would regulate all advisory activities except
those involving investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act. The Commission would retain oversight responsibilities for investment companies.

Disclosure Requirements
The Commission revised registration Forms N-3 and N-4 used by insurance companies that issue variable annuity contracts under the Investment
Company Act and the Securities Act?ll The revisions consolidate expenserelated data in a table near the front of the prospectus in order to improve the
quality of expense disclosure in variable annuity prospectuses.
Rule 30b 1-3 under the Investment Company Act was adopted by the
Commission in March 1989. The rule requires companies changing their fiscal
year to file a report on Form N-SAR within 60 days after the close of the
transition period or the date of the determination to change the fiscal year,
whichever is later; the transition period can be no longer than six months.212
Amendments to the registration form for closed-end investment companies
(Form N-2) were proposed that would extend the two-part disclosure format
to closed-end funds, update current disclosure requirements, and shorten and
simplify the per share table. The Commission also proposed an amendment
to Rule 8b-16 under the Investment Company Act to exempt closed-end funds
from the requirement that their Investment Company Act registration statements be updated annually, provided certain disclosures are made to fund

shereholders.P:'
The Commission adopted three new forms (N-17f-l,
N-17f-2,
and
ADV-E) to be filed by accountants with their certificates for examinations in
those cases in which investment companies (or members of a national
securities exchange) or investment advisers have custody of securities. The
forms are to be filed in accordance with Rules 17f-l and 17f-2 under the
Investment Company Act and Rule 206(4)-2 under the Investment Advisers

59

Act. The new forms are intended to facilitate proper filing of examination
certiflcates.F'"
The Commission published for comment a release proposing revisions to
Form N-1A, the registration statement used by open-end investment companies. The Commission proposed two alternative amendments designed to
provide investors with new, easily understood information about mutual fund
performance. The first alternative would require management to discuss and
analyze the mutual fund's performance during its previous fiscal year and the
techniques used to achieve that performance in light of the fund's objective.
The second alternative would require a comparison of fund performance over
certain time periods to the performance of an appropriate securities index
over the same periods. In addition, the Commission proposed amendments
that would (1) revise the per share table contained in the prospectus to shorten
and simplify it, while providing investors with the fund's total return and (2)
require disclosure about persons who significantly contribute to the investment advice relied on by funds. The revised disclosure requirements are
intended to provide investors with more information about the performance of
the fund and the individuals who may be primarily responsible for that
perforrnance.v'"
EDGAR Filings
In July 1985, the Office of Public Utility Regulation began accepting
electronic filings from registered public utility holding company systems and
their member companies. An EDGAR Pilot Branch was formed in October
1985, which began processing electronic filings for a volunteer group of
investment company registrants. The volunteers include a representative
group of 214 management investment companies and 78 unit investment
trusts with over 3,659 separate series. Electronic filings of semi-annual reports
on Form N-SAR have also been made by 999 registered management
investment companies that are not full-scale participants in the EDGAR Pilot.
As of September 30, 1989, the Commission had received 42,980 investment
company filings through the EDGAR pilot system.
Over one-third of all active registered management investment companies
are now making electronic filings on Form N-SAR. The Division of Investment Management is working with the Commission's Office of Information
Systems Management to develop an efficient means to transfer the information contained in these filings to a N-SAR database and to permit the
automated manipulation of that information. The number of investment
companies filing N-SARs electronically has reached a point where a N-SAR
database, using data extracted from reports filed through EDGAR, could be a
useful resource in the investment company inspection program and other
Commission activities.

Regulatory Policy
Significant Investment Company Act Developments. During fiscal year 1989,

the Commission proposed

60

216

and adopted

217

Rule 32a-3 under the Invest-

ment Company Act to provide an exemption, under certain conditions, from
the requirement that an independent public accountant be selected at a board
of directors meeting held within 30 days before or after the beginning of the
company's fiscal year or before the annual meeting of stockholders. Companies eligible to rely on the rule are given an expanded time period during
which to select an accountant.
Rule 12dl-l under the Investment Company Act was proposed during fiscal
year 1989 to ease restrictions on registered investment companies' acquisitions of the securities of foreign banks and foreign insurance companies.218
Rule 12d-l is intended to provide registered investment companies a broader
range of investment policies and more flexibility in acquiring the securities of
foreign banks and foreign insurance companies. The rule has now been
adoptedr"?
Rule lla-3 under the Investment Company Act was adopted to permit a
registered open-end investment company (other than a registered separate
account) or its principal underwriter (collectively, the offering company) to
make certain exchange offers to the company's shareholders or to shareholders of another open-end investment company in the same group of investment
cornpanles.F" Since exchange offers permit shareholders to move easily from
one fund to another, such offers are popular with investors. Absent the rule,
such exchange offers would be prohibited without prior Commission approval.
The Commission proposed amendments to Rule 12d3-1 under the Investment Company Act which would allow registered investment companies to
acquire the equity securities of foreign securities firms, provided such
securities conform to certain criteria.221
Significant Public Utility Holding Company Developments. There were 13
registered public utility holding company systems with aggregate assets of
$92.2 billion as of June 30, 1989, an increase of $2.9 billion or 3.2 percent
over June 30, 1988. Total operating revenues for the 12 months ended June
30, 1989 were $34.2 billion, a $1.5 billion increase from the 12 months ended
June 30, 1988. There are 69 electric or gas utility subsidiaries, 76 nonutility
subsidiaries, and 29 inactive companies in the 13 registered systems, a total
of 187 companies operating in 24 states (excluding seven power supply
subsidiary companies).
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission authorized the issuance of nearly
$4.9 billion of senior securities and common stock financing for the 13
registered systems: $4.0 billion in long-term debt financing and $871 million
in common and preferred stock. Long-term debt financing decreased by 13.0
percent from fiscal year 1988 primarily due to the volume of refinancing
undertaken in prior years. In addition, $169 million in pollution control
financing and $7.8 billion in short-term debt financing were approved.
Pollution control financing decreased 72.9 percent from amounts authorized
in fiscal year 1988. Short-term debt increased 59.2 percent from the previous
fiscal year. The Commission authorized $2.6 billion of financing for the sale
and leaseback of nuclear and coal-fired generating plants owned by the
registered holding company systems and $340 million of investments in
qualified cogeneration and small power production facilities and energy
61

management and audit systems. Total financing authorizations increased
34.8 percent over 1988, from $11.5 billion to $15.5 billion. Finally, the
Commission authorized $584 million for nuclear fuel and $80 million for oil
and gas development and exploration.
The Commission reviews holding company fuel procurement activities,
accounting policies, audits of service companies, as well as annual reports of
holding company subsidiary service companies and fuel procurement subsidiaries and quarterly reports by holding company non utility subsidiaries.
Electric utility subsidiaries of registered public utility holding companies were
required to reduce the cost of fuel billed to customers by the amount of
revenues gained from (1) the sale of excess oil and gas to nonassociated
companies and (2) subleasing and transloading of coal and oil barges.
Approximately $16.7 million in savings to consumers was realized as a result
of this requirement.
The Commission proposed two rules during fiscal year 1989. Rule 17
specifies circumstances in which nonutility diversification by an intrastate
public utility holding company would not be deemed detrimental to the public
interest or the interest of investors or consumers.222 Rule 52 would allow
routine issuance and sale of securities by public utility subsidiary companies
of registered holding companies to proceed without filing an application,
provided certain conditions are met.223 The Commission adopted Rule 52
essentially as proposed so as to permit the immediate realization of the rule's
benefits.224 However, the Commission is seeking comment on the need to
revise Rule 52 to eliminate or modify certain of the conditions that are now
part of the rule.225
Significant Institutional Disclosure Program Developments. Securities
Exchange Act Section 13(f)(1) and Rule 13f-1 require specified "institutional
investment managers" to file quarterly reports on Form l3F. Under Rule
13f-2(D, these managers may file the report on Form 13F-E through
magnetic tape by using the Commission's pilot electronic disclosure system,
EDGAR. Managers filing these reports disclose specified equity holdings of
the accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. for the year
ended September 30, 1989, Form 13f reports had been filed by 940
managers for total holdings of $1.5 trillion. Sixty managers electronically filed
form 13F-E reports for the quarter ended September 30, 1989 and reported
nearly 11,000 securities holdings totaling over $83 billion.
Form 13F reports are available to the public at the Commission's Public
Reference Room promptly after filing. Two tabulations of the information
contained in these reports are available for inspection: (a) an alphabetical list
of the individual securities showing the number of shares held by the
managers reporting the holding and (b) a list with the total number of shares
of a security reported by all reporting managers. Both tabulations normally
are available two weeks after the date on which the reports must be filed.

Significant Applications and Interpretations
Investment Company Matters. A Canadian closed-end fund holding com.

62

pany was exempted from Section 12(dX1XA)of the Investment Company Act
and permitted to invest more than ten percent of its assets in the securities of
United States closed-end investment companies.226 The Canadian fund must
still comply with all provisions of Section 12(dX1XF)except registering under
the Investment Company Act, and the fund may not offer, sell, or permit the
transfer of its securities in the United States or to its citizens.
An administrative hearing involving the application of The College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF), a non-profit corporation providing retirement
benefits to employees of colleges and universities, was concluded in August
1989. Exemptive relief had been requested under the Investment Company
Act to restrict redemptions and limit the voting rights of its participants. The
Commission approved the terms of the settlement under which CREF agreed
to permit transfers and lump sum distributions if an employer consents. The
settlement also provides for the election of CREF's Board of Trustees by fund
partlclpants.F"
The Commission exempted the open-end management investment companies for which Fidelity Management and Research Company or an affiliate
acts as investment adviser from Sections 12(dX1), 17(aX1), 17(aX3), 17(d),
18(f), and 21(b) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder,
and approved certain joint transactions under Rule 17d-l. 228 The relief
permits the funds to borrow from and lend to each other through a proposed
credit facility at interest rates that, because of the elimination of intermediaries, would be both higher for the lender and lower for the borrower than
would otherwise be available. The relief is subject to several conditions.
The Commission allowed the T. Rowe Price Spectrum Fund, a "fund of
funds," to invest 100 percent of its assets in Price funds so long as no more
than 15 percent of its assets are invested in anyone underlying Price fund.229
The Spectrum Fund is designed to offer small and retirement-oriented
investors the benefits of a diversified portfolio of mutual fund investments at
less cost than separately purchasing shares of each underlying fund.
The staff declined to grant no-action relief to an entity that wanted to
distribute non-English language sales materials and advertisements within
the United States to persons who use English as a second language because
only an English language prospectus was available for the funds.23o The staff
stated that if the entity distributed sales literature or advertisements in a
language other than English, a prospectus in the same language should be
readily available.
The staff stated that it would not recommend enforcement action to the
Commission for a fund that did not include performance results achieved prior
to the date that a new investment adviser managed the fund.231 However. as
a condition to this no-action position, the fund must clearly state in any
advertisement or sales literature that it previously operated under different
management, and no person affiliated with the new adviser had any affiliation
with the previous adviser; per share income and capital changes for the last ten
fiscal years must be disclosed in the fund's prospectus.
In June 1989, the staff stated that if the information required to be disclosed
in the fee table of a fund's prospectus does not, because of unique circum63

stances, reflect anticipated future expenses, a fund may describe the nature of
those circumstances in the narrative following the table or elsewhere in the
prospectus.232 Because funds have the ability to explain fully any unique
circumstances and because the staff would have difficulty making the kind of
factual determinations necessary to grant a no-action request, the staff stated
that, as a matter of policy, it would not grant no-action relief in this area.
On October 20, 1989, the staff concluded that Resolution Funding Corporation (Refcorp) is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the United States or
an agency or instrumentality of the United States for purposes of the
Investment Company Act; therefore, that Act does not apply to Refcorp.233 In
reaching its conclusion, the staff noted that Refcorp is authorized to issue only
one class of equity securities (non-voting capital stock) to be held by Federal
Home Loan Banks. The Directorate, its governing body, will be comprised of
the director of the Office of Finance, Federal Home Loan Banks, and two
members selected by the Oversight Board from among the presidents of the
Federal Home Loan Banks. Members of the Oversight Board, having general
oversight over Refcorp, will consist of officials of the United States government
and two persons appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of
the Senate.
Insurance Products Matters. The staff issued a letter stating that Rule 6e-3(T)
under the Investment Company Act applies only to contracts for which there
is a reasonable expectation that unscheduled payments will be made by
contract holders.234 No-action relief was denied because the contracts under
consideration would not have allowed a purchaser to increase the death
benefit beyond its initial level and the initial premium was already the
maximum permitted by the Internal Revenue Code.
Investment Advisers Act Matters. The Commission issued an order that
exempted Smith Breeden Associates, Inc. from Section 205(aX1) of the
Investment Advisers Act. Smith Breeden Associates was permitted to receive
an incentive fee for the disposition of assets of a failed thrift which were held
in the securities portfolio of a federally-insured thrift institution.235
HoLding Company Act Matters. The Commission authorized a plan submitted by Northeast Utilities, a registered holding company, under Section 11(e)
of the Holding Company Act to organize a new gas holding company system,
Yankee Energy System Inc. Northeast Utilities proposed to transfer and sell its
gas utility business to Yankee Energy and to divest its gas utility business by
means of a pro rata distribution of Yankee Energy common stock to its
common shareholders.P''
The Commission released jurisdiction over the issuances, sales, and acquisitions of certain securities after May 14, 1989, which was reserved in the
Commission's Memorandum Opinion and Order dated May 12, 1988 (HCAR
No. 24641), and authorized a proposal by EUA Power Corporation (EUA
Power), an electric public utility subsidiary company of Eastern Utilities
Associates (EUA), a registered holding company. By this action, the Commission authorized EUA Power to issue 17-112 percent Series C Secured Notes
(Series C Notes) on May 15, 1989 in the amount of $26,107,102 and on
November 15, 1989 in the amount of $29,145,316. These two issues were in

64

lieu of the semi-annual cash interest payments due on those dates on EUA
Power's outstanding 17-112 percent Series B Secured Notes and Series C
Notes.237 EUA Power was further authorized to issue and sell, and EUA was
authorized to acquire, through May 14, 1990, up to an additional $15.6
million of Class A 25 percent Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock
(Preferred Stock). This issue will fund EUA Power's share of costs associated
with its joint ownership interest in the Seabrook Nuclear Power Project and to
maintain EUA Power's debt/equity ratio. In connection therewith, EUA was
authorized to finance its acquisition of EUA Power's Preferred Stock through
the issuance, through December 31, 1989, of up to an additional $15.6
million of short-term notes to banks under its existing lines of credit.
The Commission authorized Indiana and Michigan Power Company and
AEP Generating Company, subsidiaries of American Electric Power Company,
a registered holding company, to sell and leaseback their respective 50
percent ownership interests in the Rockport 2 coal-fired generating station for
an amount not to exceed $1.7 billion.238 The Commission authorized Louisiana Power and Light Company, a subsidiary of Energy Corporation (formerly,
Middle South Utilities), a registered holding company, to sell and leaseback a
9.3 percent undivided interest in the Waterford 3 nuclear plant for approximately $354 million.239
After an administrative hearing, an administrative law judge rendered an
Initial Decision on February 23, 1989 approving an application by CSW Credit,
Inc., a captive finance subsidiary company of Central and South West
Corporation.P'? The application sought the removal of a limitation the
Commission had previously imposed, by order, on the ability of CSW to factor
receivables of nonassociated utility companies. The division sought review of
the Initial Decision by the Commission. The petition for review was granted on
March 15, 1989. Oral argument will be scheduled.
A notice of the filing of two applications by Noverco of Montreal, Canada
was issued.241 No requests for a hearing were filed, but written comments were
received. The Commission, on December 1, 1988, issued a notice of and order
for hearing on Noverco's two applications.242 The parties waived an evidentiary hearing and an initial decision by the administrative law judge. Briefs
have been filed. The two applications request (a) approval under Sections
9(aX2) and 10 of the Act to acquire all of the common stock of Northern New
England Gas Corporation, a Vermont corporation and an exempt holding
company which owns all of the common stock of Vermont Gas System, Inc.,
a Vermont corporation that provides retail gas service in Vermont, and (b) an
exemption under Section 3(aX5) of the Act. There are two issues presented,
namely, whether the proposed acquisition by a foreign public utility holding
company of the common stock of a United States public utility company
should be authorized and, if so, whether the foreign holding company should
thereupon be exempted from the Act given the size of the United States public
utility company.
On November 28, 1988, ALLTELand CP National Corporation (CPN) jointly
filed an application under Section 3(aX3) of the Holding Company Act
requesting an exemption for ALLTEL from all of the provisions of the Act
65

except Section 9(aX2) thereof. The application for exemption was filed in
anticipation of ALLTEL.:sacquisition of all of the common stock of CPN, which
is, among other things, a gas utility company. The acquisition of CPN was
effected on December 30, 1988, and ALLTEL thereupon became a public
utility holding company. The application was amended on February 6, 1989
to reflect the completed acquisition and to remove CPN as a co-applicant.
Under Section 3(c) of the Act, ALLTEL is exempt "until the Commission has
acted upon such application." On October 5, 1989 the Commission issued a
Notice of and Order for Hearing to determine whether ALLTEL, which is
engaged primarily in the telecommunications business, may be deemed to be
"only incidentally a holding company" under Section 3(aX3) of the Act and to
determine whether an exemption is appropriate given the size and location of
its gas utility operations.243

Other Litigation and Legal Activities
Introduction
The General Counsel represents the Commission in all litigation in the United
States Supreme Court and the courts of appeals. This litigation includes appeals
of district court decisions in Commission injunctive actions and petitions for
review of Commission orders. The General Counsel defends the Commission and its employees when sued, prosecutes administrative disciplinary
proceedings against securities professionals, and appears amicus curiae on
behalf of the Commission in significant private litigation involving the
federal securities laws. In addition, under the supervision and direction of
the General Counsel, the regional offices represent the Commission in
corporate reorganization cases under the Bankruptcy Code that have a
substantial public investor interest. The General Counsel also analyzes
legislation that would amend the federal securities laws or otherwise affect
the Commission's work and prepares legislative comments and conqressional testimony. The General Counsel's Office reviews proposed Cornmission action to ensure that enforcement and regulatory programs are
consistent with the Commission's statutory authority. In addition, the
General Counsel assists the Commission in the preparation of its decisions
in administrative proceedings under various statutes.
Key 1989 Results
The General Counsel represented the Commission in 350 litigation matters
in fiscal year 1989, compared to 314 such matters in fiscal year 1988. During
the year, 43 court of appeals and Supreme Court cases were concluded, all but
eight favorably to the Commission. There were 27 appeals in Commission
injunctive actions, four of which were concluded, with no outcomes unfavorable to the Commission.
In fiscal year 1989, there were 27 appellate and district court actions seeking
to overturn Commission orders in administrative proceedings or affirming
self.regulatory organization (SRO) disciplinary proceedings against securities
professionals. Of these appeals, 13 were concluded, with only two adverse results.
In fiscal year 1988, six such actions were concluded, with one adverse result.

The federal securities laws provide for private remedies as well as government enforcement actions. Because decisions in private cases may have
precedential effect on SEC regulatory activities and private remedies provide
added deterrence to violations, the Commission's participation in such cases
is an important supplement to its enforcement program. The Commission
participated as amicus curiae (friend of the court) in 45 cases during the year,
compared to 50 cases in fiscal year 1988. It participated in 13 private cases
that were decided, only three of which resulted in decisions adverse to the
Commission.
The General Counsel also handled more than 251 other proceedings before
the Commission or in the federal district courts. These included 58 suits
brought against the Commission or its staff and 102 suits seeking access to
Commission documents-including
actions under various public information
statutes. Of the latter, 96 suits involved discovery subpoenas in private actions
where the Commission is not a party. In fiscal year 1988, there were 61 suits
brought against the Commission or its staff and 95 suits (including 89
third-party subpoenas) under the various public information statutes.
In addition to litigation, the General Counsel is involved in significant
legislative, regulatory, and adjudicative work. For example, the office assisted
the Chairman and the Commissioners in preparing testimony on issues such
as the globalization of the securities markets, the impact of leveraged
buyouts, and the need for additional enforcement remedies. The office also
assisted the Commission in preparing legislative proposals concerning,
among other things, the sanctions and remedies available to the Commission,
market reform, and statutory changes to improve the Commission's ability to
enforce the securities laws in increasingly global markets. In addition, the
office assisted the Commission in preparing its decisions in administrative
proceedings on appeals from adjudicative actions taken by self-regulatory
organizations and administrative lawjudges and on motions presented to it in
connection with such matters.
During fiscal year 1989, 125 debtors with publicly-held securities registered
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) commenced
Chapter 11 reorganizations. The Commission appeared in 53 of these cases,
which, together with one non-registered company, involved assets of about
$8.7 billion and about 200,000 public investors. A list of pending Chapter 11
cases in which the Commission has filed a notice of appearance is set forth in
Table 23 of the Appendix to this report.
Litigation
Illegal Trading and Disgorgement. In SEC v. First City Financial COrp.,244 the
Commission successfully urged the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit to affirm a district court order enjoining the
defendants from violating the disclosure provisions of Exchange Act Section
13(d) and requiring them to disgorge approximately $2.7 million of illegal
trading profits. The district court found that the defendants had entered into
an informal understanding with a broker that enabled them to conceal the fact

68

that they had purchased stock in excess of the Section 13(d) five percent
reporting threshold. The District of Columbia Circuit agreed with the Commission that injunctive relief was proper because of the seriousness of the
reporting violation, which had the effect of depriving the market of valuable
information and allowing the defendants to buy stock at bargain prices. The
Court also agreed with the Commission that disgorgement was an appropriate
remedy for such reporting violations because buying stock while failing to
make the disclosures required by statute is, in effect, trading by an insider who
fails to disclose material information that he is under a duty to disclose.
The Commission assisted the United States Attorney for the Southern
District of New York in United States v. Chestman,245 an appeal of insider
trading convictions. Chestman argued that there was insufficient evidence to
support his convictions. The government contended that Chestman violated
Exchange Act Section 1O(b) and Rule 10b-5 when he traded on material
nonpublic information about an upcoming tender offer that had been tipped
to him by the husband of a member of the family that owned a majority of the
target company's stock. In addition, Chestman challenged the validity of
Exchange Act Rule 14e-3, which prohibits trading while in possession of
material nonpublic information about a tender offer. The government argued
that promulgation of the rule, which furthers the goal of encouraging full
disclosure in connection with tender offers, was well within the Commission's
rulemaking authority.
In the insider trading cases of SEC v. Levine and SEC v. Wilkis,246 the
Commission urged the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
to affirm a district court order awarding the defendants' illegal insider trading
profits to the victims of their fraud, as beneficiaries of a constructive trust,
rather than to satisfy the claims of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)and other
tax authorities. The Court of Appeals, however, reversed this portion of the
district court's decision, holding that a requisite element of a constructive
trust-a wrongful act-had been neither proven nor conceded. In addition, the
Court held that, even if wrongdoing had been established, the district court
erred in concluding that the defendants did not have property rights in the
illegal profits to which an IRS lien could attach. The Court reasoned that
transactions that violate the federal securities laws are merely voidable, not
void, and that under applicable New York law, voidable title is sufficient to
enable a wrongdoer to pass good title. As a result of the Second Circuit's
decision, a substantial portion of the illegal trading profits disgorged from
defendant Levine will be paid to the IRS to satisfy a tax lien. Litigation
continues with respect to the remainder of the disgorgement fund.
Self.Regulatory Organizations. During fiscal year 1989, the Commission
responded to several important petitions for review of Commission actions
involving SROs. In The Business Roundtable v. SEC,247 the petitioners
challenged the Commission's authority to promulgate Rule 19c-4, which
requires SROs to adopt rules denying listing (or requiring delisting) of the
equity securities of any company that nullifies, restricts, or reduces the per
share voting rights of any outstanding class of common stock. The rule was
adopted in response to a New York Stock Exchange proposal to change its
69

listing requirements to permit disproportionate voting rights. In its brief to the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the
Commission disputed the contention that it lacks the authority to amend SRO
listing standards that relate to internal corporate governance. Such authority,
the Commission argued, exists under the 1975 Amendments to the Exchange
Act, which expanded the Commission's authority to include all SRO rules,
regardless of the subject matter. The Commission also urged that Rule 19c-4
furthers the purposes of a number of Exchange Act sections, in particular
Section 14's proxy provisions, by promoting fair corporate suffrage. Finally,
the Commission argued that Rule 19c-4 is not an impermissible infringement
upon the states' traditional authority to charter and regulate corporations.
In Chicago Mercantile Exchange v. SEC,248 the United States Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit set aside Commission orders that allowed
three securities exchanges and the Options Clearing Corporation to issue,
trade, and clear index participations (IPs). The Commission had determined
that IPs fall within the Exchange Act's definition of security and are not futures
contracts. The Court did not disagree with the Commission's determination
that IPs are securities. The Court, however, deferred to the view of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), expressed in an amicus
curiae brief, that IPs also are futures contracts, and thus held that IPs are
subject to regulation only by the CFTC under the Commodity Exchange Act.
Definition of a Security. The Supreme Court, as urged by the Commission,
granted certiorari in Arthur Young & Co. v. Reves 249 to address the question
whether certain interest-bearing promissory notes that were widely offered
and sold to the public by an Arkansas farmers' cooperative are securities. The
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the notes were
not securities because they were payable on demand and because the interest
paid on the notes did not constitute "profit" under the test established by the
Supreme Court in SEC v. \.v.J. Howey Co,250 for an "investment contract."
The Commission argued in an amicus curiae brief to the Supreme Court that
the instruments are "notes" within the statutory definition of "security" in
both the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Exchange Act. The
Commission argued that the Eighth Circuit failed to take into account the
substance of the transactions-that
the notes were sold to the public in small
denominations as part of a broad offering and were marketed as investments.
In addition, the Commission's brief discussed the three tests used by the
courts of appeals to determine when an instrument is a "note" within the
definition of "security" and urged the Supreme Court to adopt the Second
Circuit's "family resemblance" test. The Commission further argued that the
fact that the notes were payable on demand does not disqualify them from
being securities, since it is a note's character, not its maturity date, that
determines whether the note is covered by the federal securities laws. Finally,
the brief took the position that an investor's expectation of receiving interest
on a debt instrument qualifies as "profit" under Howey.
In Holloway v. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & CO./51 the United States Court of
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, agreeing with the position urged by the
Commission as amicus curiae, held that certificates issued by two Oklahoma
70

financial institutions were securities. The certificates at issue generally had
maturity dates of six months or less and some were payable on demand.
Applying the Tenth Circuit's "cornrnercial/Investrnent' test for determining
when an instrument is a "note" within the definition of "security," the Court
held that the certificates were covered by the securities laws because they had
been offered to the general public, purchased by more than 10,000 investors,
and advertised to the public as investments. The Court rejected the argument
that, under the Supreme Court's decision in Marine Bank v. Weaver,252 the
federal securities laws should not apply, since the financial institutions
involved were subsidiaries of a bank holding company that had been subject
to regulation under the federal Bank Holding Company Act at the time the
certificates were issued. The Court held that the Marine Bank exclusion was not
applicable in this case because the protections of the two statutes were not
comparable-the
Bank Holding Company Act's purpose is to protect depositors in banks owned by holding companies, not investors in the nonbank
subsidiaries of holding companies. The Court also held that state regulation
of financial institutions is not sufficient to invoke the Marine Bank exclusion.
Finally, in Foremost Guaranty Corp. v. Meritor Seoinqs Bank,253 the Com.
mission filed an amicus curiae brief that addressed the question of whether
certain mortgage backed pass-through certificates are securities. The Commission urged the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to
overturn a district court decision holding that the certificates are not securities. The Commission took the position that the certificates satlsfy the
investment contract test set forth in SEC v. WJ. Howey Co. The Commission
also took the position that the certificates fall within the category "certificate
of interest . . . in any profit-sharing agreement" included in the definition
of a security in both the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. In addition, the
Commission pointed out that such mortgage backed certificates have been
universally viewed as securities by Congress, by the Commission, by com.
mentators, and by the legal and financial communities. Thus, the Commission
argued that the certificates fall within the category "instrument commonly
known as a 'security'" included in the Securities Act and Exchange Act
definitions of security.
Btoker-Deelers and Market Professionals. The Commission filed an amicus
curiae brief at the request of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit in Hollinger v. Titan Capital COrp.,254 expressing the Commission's
views on important issues concerning the liability of brokerage firms and
urging the Court to hear the case en banco First, the Commission urged the
Court of Appeals to overrule its earlier decisions holding that respondeat
superior (the doctrine that a principal is responsible, under certain circumstances, for the conduct of the principal's agent) is unavailable in actions under
Section 10(b). The Commission took the position that respondeat superior is
applicable to the federal securities laws just as it is in actions for common law
fraud. In addition, the Commission urged the Ninth Circuit to hold that
recklessness as defined at common law-a conscious indifference to the truth,
falsity, or misleading nature of a representation-satisfies
the scienter requirement of Section 10(b) and Rule lOb-5.
71

Liability in Private Actions. In Wilson v. Ruffa & Hanover, p.c.,255 the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that a law firm that
participates in a securities offering can only be found liable under Securities
Act Section 12(2) if its participation was "the legal equivalent of solicitation of
a sale." The Second Circuit's decision reflected the position of the Commission, which had filed an amicus curiae brief at the Court's invitation. The Court
of Appeals, applying the principles governing liability articulated by the
Supreme Court in Pinter v. Dahl256 for actions under Securities Act Section
12(1) to actions under Section 12(2), held that a law firm could not be found
liable when its participation in an offering consisted only of preparing offering
materials and sending them to investors at the issuer's request. In addition, the
Court of Appeals agreed with the Commission that aiding and abetting
liability is inappropriate under Section 12(2).
The Commission participated in two recent cases raising the issue of the
appropriate statute of limitations for private actions under Exchange Act
Section 1O(b)in the absence of an express statutory limitations period for such
actions. In response to the Supreme Court's request for the government's
views, the Solicitor General filed an amicus curiae brief, in accord with the
Commission's position, in Lebman v. Aktiebolaget Electrolux.257 The United
States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit had affirmed the district court's
dismissal of the petitioners' action under Exchange Act Section 10(b) as
time-barred, finding that the applicable statute of limitations was the two-year
limitations period governing actions under the Texas general fraud statute.
The government's brief in the Supreme Court expressed the view that
applying state law has yielded inconsistent results and recommended that this
approach should be abandoned in favor of a uniform limitations period drawn
from federal law.The brief urged that the Court adopt the five-year limitations
period of Exchange Act Section 20A, which establishes an express private
cause of action against persons who trade while in possession of material
inside information. Congress, in adopting Section 20A as part of the Insider
Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988, for the first time
provided a statutory federal limitations period applicable to certain private
actions brought under Section 1O(b)(I. e., actions for insider trading). The brief
noted that, in selecting the five-year period, Congress established a limitations
period attuned to what it perceived to be the appropriate balance between
affording a remedy for investors injured by fraud and providing repose for
potential defendants in private antifraud actions. Despite advancing a view
contrary to the Fifth Circuit's decision, the brief recommended that the
Supreme Court deny review because the Fifth Circuit's decision predated the
adoption of Section 20A and since other courts had not had the opportunity
to consider whether Section 20A provides a suitable analogy to other actions
under Section 10(b) and Rule lOb-5. The Supreme Court denied review.
In Ceres Partners v. GEL Associates,258 the Commission asserted the same
position as to the applicability of the five-year limitations period in an amicus
curiae brief filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Finally, in Deutschman v. Beneficial COrp.,259another case involving private
rights of action under Section 1O(b), the Supreme Court declined to review a

72

decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, holding
that purchasers of call options have standing to assert a cause of action for
affirmative misrepresentations against the non-trading issuer of the underlying securities. In response to the Supreme Court's request for the government's views, the Solicitor General filed an amicus curiae brief, in accord with
the Commission's position, urging that the Court deny review. The government's brief took the position that it is appropriate that options traders have
standing in the circumstances presented. The brief observed that options
traders are purchasers and sellers of securities, and that the complaint in this
case alleged a fraud "in connection with" purchases and sales. The brief also
argued that, in a case alleging affirmative misrepresentations, no fiduciary
relationship need exist between the options traders and the corporation
making the misstatement. Finally, the brief argued that there are no policy
reasons that would support denying standing to options traders. In particular,
the brief noted that not allowing options traders to sue would leave unrernedied economic harm flowing from fraud, and that assertions that allowing
options traders to sue would impose enormous potential liability on issuers
are unsubstantiated.
Intemational Application of the Securities Laws. In Consolidated Gold Fields,
PLC v. Minorco, S.A.,260 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second

Circuit held that a tender offer involving two foreign corporations had a
"substantial effect" within the United States. Thus, even though most of the
shareholders resided outside of the United States and the tender offeror
sought to exclude United States shareholders from the offer, the presence of
"substantial effect" was sufficient to allow subject matter jurisdiction under
the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The district court had
dismissed securities fraud claims brought against the acquiring company on
the ground of "insignificant" United States effects. The Second Circuit,
agreeing with the position urged by the Commission in an amicus curiae brief,
held that the district court should have asserted jurisdiction, since the
acquiring company had sent the tender offer documents to British nominees
of the target company's American shareholders and those nominees were
required by law to forward the offering materials to the American shareholders. Nevertheless, the Appellate Court, consistent with the position urged by
the Commission, remanded the proceeding to the district court to determine
whether the extraterritorial effect of the particular remedy sought (an injunction against the tender offer worldwide) was disproportionate to the harm in
the United States for which redress was sought.
Actions Under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of J 935 (Holding
Company Act}. In Wisconsins Environmental Decade v. SEC,261 the petitioners
challenged a Commission order approving a corporate restructuring that
separated the utility and nonutility business of an existing intrastate public
utility holding company under a new holding company in order to facilitate
diversification into nonutility businesses. The United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the petitioners' argument that the
proposed diversification was detrimental to the public interest and that the
Commission was precluded from granting the new company an intrastate

73

exemption from the Holding Company Act. The Court of Appeals determined
that the Commission, in granting the exemption, had properly relied on state
limitations imposed on the holding company's diversification activities, as
well as the Commission's continuing jurisdiction to monitor such activities
and, if necessary,to revoke the exemption. In addition, the Court found that
the Commission properly concluded that the transaction would not "unduly or
unnecessarily complicate the structure" of the holding company system, as
required by Holding Company Act Section 10(cX1). The Court of Appeals,
however, agreed with the petitioners that the Commission had failed to
demonstrate, as required by Holding Company Act Section 1O(cX2),how the
restructuring would "tend toward the economical and efficient development of
an integrated public-utility system." The Court therefore vacated the order
approving the restructuring and remanded the case to the Commission for
further proceedings.
Motions to Vacate Injunctions. During fiscal year 1989, the Commission
opposed several motions to vacate injunctions entered in Commission
enforcement actions. In SEC v. ZaLe,262the United States Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit affirmed a district court's denial of a motion to vacate a
consent injunction obtained in a Commission enforcement action. The Court
agreed with the Commission that the defendants' contention that they were
"stigmatized" because of the injunction did not constitute grievous wronq
resulting from unforeseen circumstances that would justify vacation of the
injunction under United States v. SWift & CO.263
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit refused to
overturn a district court order freezing a company's assets, pending disgorgernent, in SEC v. GoLdcor, Inc.264 The Commission had filed an enforcement
action against Goldcor and its affiliates, alleging that they were engaging in
antifraud violations by selling stock in a sham gold mining operation in Costa
Rica. In its brief to the Court of Appeals, the Commission argued that the
district court had not abused its discretion in denying Goldcor's request to
have the freeze order dissolved because without such an order there was a
serious risk that Goldcor's managers would conceal or dissipate the company's assets.
Actions InvoLVing Other Agencies. The Comrnlsslon filed an amicus curiae
brief in FederaLDeposit Insurance Corporation v. Jenkins.265 In this case, the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, consistent with the
Commission's brief, reversed a district court decision enjoining shareholders
from litigating their Section 10(b) and Rule lOb-5 claims against officers and
directors of a failed bank and its holding company until the claims of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) against the officers and directors were satisfied. In its brief the Commission argued that the FDIC
improperly invoked the absolute priority rule, which provides that, in certain
contexts in bankruptcy and receivership proceedings, creditors' claims against
a corporation receive priority over the claims of shareholders. The Commission pointed out that neither the rule, by its terms, nor its rationale applies
when claims are asserted against parties other than the bankrupt or insolvent
corporation. In addition, the Commission's brief noted that Bankruptcy Code

74

Section 510(b), which expressly subordinates certain shareholder security
fraud claims against an issuer in a bankruptcy proceeding, suggests that the
FDIC's position on priority with respect to claims against third parties is
unwarranted. The Commission argued that neither the legislative history nor
the case law and legal commentary leading to the enactment of Section 51 O(b)
contemplates the application of a similar priority rule to shareholder fraud
claims against third parties.
Discovery Actions in Commission Enforcement Actions. In SEC v. CarL N.
Karcher, et ai.,266 the Commission defeated an attempt to depose two

Commissioners in connection with a pending injunctive action.267 The
Commission argued that depositions of such high ranking government
officials are permissible only on a preliminary showing of extraordinary
circumstances, and that the defendants should not be allowed to depose
Commissioners about the Commission's deliberations. After briefing, the
Court issued a protective order prohibiting the depositions.
Litigation lnuotoiru; Requests for Access to Commission Records. Although
the Commission received more than 5,143 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
and confidential treatment requests in fiscal year 1989, only one of these
resulted in the filing of court action against the Commission. The court action
was dismissed by stipulation. The Commission received 2,147 requests under
the FOIA for access to Commission records and 2,974 requests for confidential treatment from persons who submitted information. In fiscal year 1989,
there were 73 appeals of denials of FOIA requests to the Commission's
General Counsel and 22 appeals of denials of confidential treatment requests.
In Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. SEC,268 the Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit affirmed the district court's decision to remand a
reverse-FOIA case to the Commission for further proceedings to develop a
more complete administrative record.269 The Court of Appeals held that the
record and the Commission's decision were insufficient to permit effective
judicial review, and that the procedural requirements that the district court
imposed on the Commission were within the district court's authority and
were necessary to produce a reviewable record. For example, the district court
remand order required a document-by-document explanation of the Commission's denial of confidential treatment and concluded that, where a denial of
confidential treatment was based on public availability of information, the
agency record was not reviewable unless it included the public sources on
which the Commission relied. The Court of Appeals also held that the
imposition of such requirements in the remand order did not exceed the
district court's authority because it stopped short of requiring the Commission
to adopt specific procedures, where other procedures might achieve the
standard of reviewability mandated by the Administrative Procedure Act. The
Court indicated that any procedure producing a record capable of judicial
review must be accepted by the Court after remand.
In Sa[ecard v. SEC,270 plaintiff sought review of the Commission's decision
to withhold certain documents under FOIA Exemption 7(A) in response to
Safecard's FOIA request for access to 32 Commission investigative files. The
Commission successfully protected the interests of witnesses who provided
75

information during these investigations and prevented the disclosure of the
majority of Commission internal memoranda and handwritten staff notes.
After review of the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, the district
court granted, with limited exceptions, the Commission's motion for partial
summary judgment. The plaintiffs appeal to the District of Columbia Circuit
is pending.
Actions Against the Commission. In Suter v. Ruder,271 the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois granted the Commission's
motion to dismiss in a case alleging that present and former Commissioners
and staff participated in a conspiracy to violate the First Amendment rights of
an investment newsletter publisher. The Court also imposed monetary sanctions against the plaintiff pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure and enjoined him from filing any civil action without first obtaining
leave of the court in which he seeks to file his action. The Commission's
motion to dismiss Suter's appeal from this order is pending before the Seventh
Circuit.272
In Lin v. SEC,273 the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California dismissed a complaint against the Commission, a former Chairman
of the Commission, and present and former attorneys in its Division of
Enforcement, alleging misconduct in connection with a Commission law
enforcement investigation. In the first decision of its kind, the Court recognized that Commission enforcement attorneys were absolutely immune from
suit as long as they were exercising a discretionary prosecutorial function
within the limits of their authority. The suit also sought damages against the
Commission arising out of a temporary cancellation of the plaintiffs registration as an investment adviser. The Court ruled that the doctrine of
sovereign immunity barred damage claims against the Commission arising
out of cancellation of a registration as an investment adviser; the exclusive
remedy was appellate review under the provisions of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940 (Investment Advisers Act).
Actions Against Professionals Under Commission Rule 2(e). The staff is
litigating against a number of professionals under Commission Rule 2(e).
During fiscal year 1989, a number of such actions were concluded. In In re
Checkosky andAldrich,274 Administrative Law Judge Brenda P. Murray found,
followinq a five-week hearing, that two audit partners of the firm of Coopers
& Lybrand had engaged in improper professional conduct by violating
generally accepted auditing standards during five consecutive audits of Savin
Corporation. Judge Murray found that Checkosky and Aldrich had failed to
exercise due care and obtain sufficient evidence to support their positions.
Instead, according to the Court's findings, they had given paramount consideration to pleasing the client, while showing little concern for the truthfulness
of the client's financial statements. Judge Murray found that because of the
respondents' misconduct, the public had received five sets of financial
statements that were materially incorrect and that overstated the company's
financial position. Based on her findings, Judge Murray suspended Checkosky and Aldrich from appearing and practicing before the Commission for five
years.275

76

In In re Clark,276 after two weeks of trial, a partner in the national accounting
firm of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. consented to a Commission order that
censured him and ordered him not to practice before the Commission for nine
months. The staff had alleged that the partner engaged in improper professional conduct by signing an "unqualified" audit report when he had information indicating that the bulk of the revenues of the company were
improperly recorded and should not have been recognized.
Actions Under the Right to Financial Privacy Act. District courts dismissed
four actions filed pursuant to the Right to Financial Privacy Act seeking to
quash Commission subpoenas for customer financial information from financial institutions.277 In each of these cases, the courts held that the Commission was seeking the bank records for a legitimate law enforcement purpose,
and that the records sought were relevant to the investigation. The courts
therefore ordered compliance with the Commission's subpoena.278

Significant Administrative Decisions
Broker-Dealers and Market Professionals. In Hamilton Bohner, lnc., John R.
McKowen and John E. Sherman,279 the Commission affirmed the disciplinary
action taken by the NASD against the NASD member firm of Hamilton
Bohner, Mr. McKowen, its former president, and Mr. Sherman, its former vice
president. The Commission found, as had the NASD, that respondents
charged excessivecompensation for selling securities for a customer, and that
the firm and McKowen sent the customer confirmations that misrepresented
the capacity in which the firm was acting and did not disclose the actual
compensation it was charging. In ten transactions, Hamilton Bohner, which
was not a market maker, purchased shares sold by its customer and simultaneously resold the shares to market makers. Based on the prices Hamilton
Bohner received from those market makers, the prices paid the customer for
its securities represented markdowns of 5.3 percent to 10.2 percent below the
prevailing market price. Pointing to the "well established industry practice
pursuant to which markdowns by broker-dealers on purchases from customers are substantially lower than markups on sales to customers," the Commission found the markdowns of 5.3 percent to 10.2 percent charged by
respondents to be "far in excess of permissible levels."
In Robert J. Check,28o the Commission sanctioned Mr. Check, who was
manager of a brokerage firm's mutual funds department, for failing to exercise
reasonable supervision over the firm's salesmen with a view to preventing their
failure to apprise mutual fund customers of the sales commission discounts to
which the customers were entitled. The Commission was not persuaded by Mr.
Check's arguments that he did not have supervisory responsibility over the
salesmen, that branch managers were responsible for ensuring their sales.
men's compliance with applicable requirements, and that neither salesmen
nor branch managers reported directly to him. The Commission found that
Mr. Check "failed to carry out his responsibilities and to exercise his authority
to take effective action," and that he was not relieved of his supervisory
obligations because other officials of the firm shared responsibility for

77

supervising its salesmen. The Commission pointed out that Mr. Check was
"uniquely positioned to exercise effective supervisory control in the specialized area of mutual fund sales."

Significant Legislative Developments
Enforcement Remedies. In January 1989, the Commission submitted to
Congress the proposed Securities Law Enforcement Remedies Act of 1989.
The proposal, which was similar to a proposal made by the Commission the
previous year, was introduced in the Senate as S. 647 and in the House of
Representatives as H.R. 975.
The proposal would amend the securities lawsto authorize the Commission
to impose civil money penalties in administrative proceedings and would
expand the power of the courts to impose such penalties in civil actions
brought by the Commission. The Act also would enable the Commission to
bar or suspend persons from service as officers and directors of companies
that are required by the Exchange Act to file periodic reports with the
Commission. The authority of the courts to impose such sanctions would be
clarified. In addition, the scope of Section 15(cX4)of the Exchange Act would
be broadened to permit the Commission to bring administrative proceedings
against persons for violating the securities ownership reporting provisions of
Section 16(a) of that Act.
Former Chairman Ruder testified in support of the proposals before the
Securities Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs on April 18, 1989 and before the Telecommunications and
Finance Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on
July 19. No further action was taken by the lOlst Congress during its first
session.281
InternationaL Enforcement. The accelerating internationalization of the
world's securities markets has made it necessary for the Commission to
develop additional means of conducting investigations and bringing enforcement actions with respect to violative conduct that occurs in part or entirely
outside the territorial borders of the United States. In particular, the Commission has sought to negotiate bilateral assistance agreements with foreign
governments, known as Memoranda of Understanding. These agreements
enable the Commission to obtain evidence located abroad through the
cooperation of foreign officials. In order to enhance its ability to enter into
such cooperative arrangements, the Commission asked Congress for the
authority to conduct investigations requested by foreign authorities even
when there is no indication that a violation of the United States securities laws
has occurred. The Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act,
which was passed by Congress and enacted into law on November 19, 1988,
amended the Exchange Act to permit the Commission to conduct such
investigations.
In January 1989, the Commission submitted legislation to Congress that
would further strengthen its international enforcement capabilities. The
International Securities Enforcement Cooperation Act of 1989, introduced in

78

the Senate as S. 646 and in the House of Representatives as H.R. 1396, would
authorize the Commission to accept reimbursement for expenses incurred in
providing assistance to a foreign securities authority. It also would permit the
Commission and the SROs to impose sanctions on a securities professional
who is found by a foreign court or securities authority to have engaged in
improper or illegal conduct. SROs would also be given the authority, subject
to Commission oversight, to prohibit any person who has been convicted of a
felony from becoming a member of that organization, or associated with a
member, or to place conditions on such membership or association.
The Act also would amend the Exchange Act to enable the Commission to
preserve the confidentiality of certain evidence obtained from foreign authorities that otherwise might have to be disclosed pursuant to the FOIA. The
disclosure provisions of that Act would not be applicable to such evidence if
the foreign authority represented in good faith that disclosure would violate
the laws of that country. By carving out a narrow exception to the FOIA, the
proposed legislation would facilitate the sharing of information relevant to
Commission investigations. In addition, the bill would clarify the Commission's rulemaking authority to provide domestic and foreign enforcement
officials with certain nonpublic information.
Hearings were held in both Houses of Congress. H.R. 1396 was passed by the
House on September 25, 1989. In the Senate, the Commission's proposal
became part of a comprehensive bill entitled the Securities Acts Amendments
of 1989, passed by the Senate at the close of the first session as H.R. 1396. The
House did not act on the comprehensive proposal before the end of the
session.
Internationalization. On June 15, 1989, former Chairman Ruder testified
before the Securities Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking,
Housing, and Urban Affairs concerning the globalization of the securities
markets. Former Chairman Ruder described for Congress the degree of
internationalization that has taken place in recent years and outlined the
numerous initiatives undertaken by the Commission to deal with this phenomenon. Among the measures discussed was the Commission's Policy
Statement on the Regulation of the International Securities Markets, which
was issued in November 1988. That statement urges cooperation among the
world's securities regulators while recognizing the need to take account of
cultural differences and national sovereignty concerns. The Commission's
statement suggests that an effective regulatory structure for an international
securities market system would include efficient mechanisms for quotation,
price and volume information cissemlnation, order routing, order execution,
clearance, settlement and payment, and strong capital adequacy standards;
sound disclosure systems that protect investors while balancing costs and
benefits for market participants; and fair and honest markets achieved
through regulation of abusive sales practices, prohibitions on fraud, and high
levels of enforcement cooperation.
Market Reform Legislation. The Commission's legislative package to address
certain issues raised by the October 1987 market break was re-introduced in
the 101st Congress as S. 648 and H.R. 1609, the Stock Market Reform Act of
79

1989. As amended by the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee and by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,
the bill would permit the Commission to close the markets in the event of an
emergency so long as the President does not object, require that information
concerning the identity and transactions of large securities traders be made
available to the Commission, enable the Commission to gain access to
information concerning the financial and operational condition of entities
associated with broker-dealers, and facilitate improved clearance and settlement. The House Finance Subcommittee also added a provision dealing with
program trading.
Although the Commission's original proposal would have given the agency
unilateral authority to impose a halt in securities trading on an exchange or
otherwise for up to 24 hours (and for additional periods with the approval of
the President), Chairman Breeden explained in testimony before the House
Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee on October 25, 1989 that
nondiscretionary circuit breakers implemented since the market break have
lessened the need for such authority. The subcommittee voted on November
14, 1989 to report a version of the bill, which was subsequently introduced as
H.R. 3657, that provides that a Commission decision to close the markets will
not take effect unless the Commission notifies the President and the President
does not object. The Senate Committee on Banking, HOUSing,and Urban
Affairs voted to report substantially similar language.
With respect to a proposal to require reports to the Commission by any
person effecting large securities transactions for that person's own account,
concerns were raised by the SROs and members of the securities industry that
the original bill, which required that such information be provided to the
Commission on an ongoing basis, would be expensive and cumbersome. The
revised bill would require large traders to provide information to the Commission concerning their identity and the accounts through which they trade
and would require broker-dealers to retain records relating to large securities
transactions by large traders.
Similarly, changes were made to the proposals relating to holding company
risk assessment to reflect discussions among Commission staff, members of
the securities industry, and the Department of the Treasury. Rather than
requiring such companies to report risk assessments to the Commission on an
ongoing and comprehensive basis, the revised proposal would require recordkeeping and quarterly reports to the Commission. In this instance, the
Commission would have the ability to obtain an immediate and detailed risk
assessment when conditions warranted. In addition, certain status exemptions
for regulated entities (e.g., banks and insurance companies) would be replaced
with augmented exemptive authority for the Commission.
The revised proposal also directs the Commission to establish an advisory
committee, under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, to assess the current
adequacy of state commercial laws with respect to the clearance and settlement of securities. The proposal also would require the Commission to
consult with the Federal Reserve Board and the Department of the Treasury in
80

connection with rulemaking concerning the transfer and pledge of
securities.282
Although the Commission's original proposal did not deal with program
trading, the House subcommittee reported language that would authorize the
Commission to adopt rules prohibiting certain manipulative or abusive
practices that contribute to market volatility and to enforce these rules
through cease and desist authority and civil fines. The Senate committee did
not agree to the proposal but did approve a provision directing the Commission to conduct a study of program trading.
Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs). During fiscal year 1989, the Commission
submitted extensive testimony to a number of Senate and House Committees
on issues concerning leveraged buyouts. Although LBOs take many forms, all
involve using the assets of a company as collateral for a loan that is obtained
to pay for all or part of the purchase or restructuring of the company. The
Commission's testimony focused on the disclosure obligations and antifraud
concerns surrounding such transactions. In particular, the Commission discussed the problems inherent in management-led buyouts and the workings
of Rule 13e-3, which generally applies to going-private transactions. In
promulgating that rule, the Commission determined that substantive fairness
requirements should be left to state law. Rule 13e-3 seeks to provide
shareholders with the information they need to assess the fairness of a
"going-private" transaction and to pursue the remedies provided under state
law. Former Chairman Ruder's testimony on behalf of the Commission was
given to the Senate Committee on Finance on January 25, 1989 and to the
House Ways and Means Committee on January 31, 1989. He had previously
given similar testimony-in a private capacity-to the House Subcommittee
on Telecommunications and Finance.
Investment Adviser Sed-Requleiion, The Commission submitted proposed
legislation to amend the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to permit the
registration of one or more national investment adviser organizations as
self-regulatory organizations subject to Commission oversight. These SROs
would establish qualification and business practice standards, perform inspections, and enforce compliance with the securities laws. Membership would be
mandatory for all investment advisers required to register with the Commission except those whose only clients are registered investment companies.
The Commission's proposal was introduced in the Senate as S. 1410 and in the
House as H.R. 3054.
Shareholder Communications. A Commission proposal to extend the benefits of its shareholder communication rules to mutual fund and other
investment company shareholders was introduced in the Senate as S. 649 and
the House as H.R. 2780 during the first session of the 101st Congress. The
shareholder communication rules generally require entities that hold securities in nominee name to deliver proxy materials and annual reports to
beneficial owners and to supply issuers with information concerning beneficial owners. The proposal also would require that the information statements
provided by registrants in the event of a shareholder vote-for which the
registrant does not solicit proxies-must be transmitted to beneficial owners.
Rl

Mutual funds and other investment companies would be required to provide
information statements when a shareholder vote is held but proxies are not
solicited. This proposal was passed by the Senate at the end of the first session
as part of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1989, H.R. 1396. That Act was
not passed before the end of the session.
Debt Financing. Hearings were held on the Commission's comprehensive
proposal to modernize the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (Trust Indenture Act)
before both the Senate and House oversight subcommittees. The proposal is
designed to accommodate the legal requirements relating to modern financing and institutional trust practices without undermining the protection of
investors in debt securities provided by the Act. Among the changes proposed
are provisions to incorporate certain sections of the Act into trust indentures
qualified under the Act by operation of law. The Commission's exemptive
power would be broadened and certain technical conflicts of interest for
indenture trustees would not affect a trustee's eligibility to serve prior to
default. To promote the internationalization of public securities markets, the
Act would be amended to allow foreign trustees under specified circumstances. The Senate bill was incorporated into the comprehensive Securities
Acts Amendments of 1989, which was not enacted during the first session.
RICO Reform. The Commission supported certain portions of H.R. 1046, the
Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations (RICO)Reform Act of 1989, which
was designed to limit the use of the civil liability provisions of RICO in cases
involving the securities laws.283 In testimony before the Subcommittee on
Crime of the House Judiciary Committee, General Counsel Daniel L. Goelzer
stated that, while the Commission has long supported both judicial and
legislative steps to ensure that persons injured by violations of the securities
laws have meaningful relief, the Commission also is concerned that securities
law claims can, in many cases, be converted into civil RICOcases. Successful
plaintiffs in such cases are entitled to treble damages, despite the recovery
limitation of actual damages under the securities laws. Moreover, plaintiffs
may be able to use RICOto bypass the carefully crafted liability provisions of
the securities laws, thus placing increased and unwarranted financial burdens
on defendants, including members of the securities industry. Accordingly, the
Commission supported those provisions of the Act designed to eliminate the
overlap between private remedies under RICO and those under the federal
securities laws.
Corporate Reorganizations
The Commission acts in a statutory advisor's role in reorganization cases
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to see that the interests of public
investors are adequately protected. In these cases, a debtor generally is
allowed to continue business operations under court protection while it
negotiates a plan to rehabilitate the business and to pay the company's debts.
Reorganization plans often provide for the issuance of new securities to
creditors and shareholders in exchange for part or all of their claims or
interests in the debtor, under an exemption in the Bankruptcy Code from
registration under the Securities Act.
82

In fiscal year 1989, the Commission authorized a review of its Section
1109(a) general statutory advisory role in Chapter 11 cases and of the
adequacy of public investor protections under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code. The goal of this review is to provide an informed basis upon which to
determine whether that role should be modified and whether legislation is
needed. In connection with the review, the Commission issued a release 284
inviting comments from the bench, bar, and others and will hold a roundtable
where participants can discuss their comments. The project also includes the
assessment of active participation by the Commission staff in six reorganizetion cases that have been paired with six other cases in which the Commission
is not actively participating. In addition, the Commission's Office of Economic
Analysis is studying the impact of Commission participation in Chapter 11
cases between 1979 and 1989 and other investor protections under Chapter
11.
In its capacity as a special advisor, the Commission may raise or present its
views on any issue in a Chapter 11 case. Although the Commission may not
initiate an appeal, it frequently participates in appeals taken by others. While
Chapter 11 relief is available to businesses of all sizes, the Commission
generally limits its participation to cases involving debtors that have publicly
traded securities registered under the Exchange Act. In fiscal year 1989, the
Commission participated in Chapter 11 cases on a variety of issues.
Committees. Official committees are empowered to negotiate with a debtor
in possession on the administration of a case and to participate in all aspects
of the case, including formulation of a reorganization plan. With court
approval, an official committee is permitted to employ, as a cost of adrnlnistration, one or more attorneys, accountants, or other professionals to assist
the committee in performing its duties. In addition to a committee represent.
ing creditors holding unsecured claims, the code allows the court or a United
States Trustee to appoint additional committees for stockholders and others
where necessary to assure adequate representation of their interests. During
fiscal year 1989, the Commission moved or supported motions for the
appointment of committees to represent investors in two Chapter 11 cases.285
In In n? Continental Information Systems Corp., et aL.,286the Commission
supported the motion by certain individual shareholders to appoint an official
committee to represent the interests of Continental's shareholders. The
creditors' committee, the United States Trustee, and a secured creditor
opposed the motion, arguing that the debtor was hopelessly insolvent. The
Commission argued that the record provided no evidence of "hopeless
insolvency" but rather tended to show that the debtor was in fact solvent.
Further, the Commission argued that it was premature, at this early stage in
the case, to address the issue of insolvency.
The bankruptcy court agreed with the Commission's position that "hopeless
insolvency" could not be demonstrated. The court directed the United States
Trustee to appoint expeditiously an equity security holders' committee.
Estate Administration. The Commission acts to protect the interests of public
investors in reorganization cases by participating on selected issues involving
83

administration of the debtor's estate that have a significant impact upon the
rights of public investors.
In In re Angicor Ltd. ,287the Commission filed a brief addressing the scope
of the bankruptcy court's authority to supplant state law corporate governance
with respect to altering the composition of the debtor's board of directors. In
this case, a group of investors filed a motion, without notice to shareholders,
requesting that the bankruptcy court remove the debtor's board of directors
and appoint a board of directors favorable to the rnovants' interests. The
movants argued that the debtor's management had been ineffective in
proceeding toward a plan of reorganization and that a bankruptcy court has
equitable powers to alter shareholder corporate governance rights in bankruptcy. The Commission argued, consistent with the position urged by the
Commission and adopted by the Second Circuit in In re Johns-ManviLLe
Corp.,288 that shareholders of debtor corporations do not ordinarily lose their
corporate governance rights under state law.The Commission pointed out that
the Bankruptcy Code provides specific alternative means for remedying any
problems with current management, including the appointment of a trustee.
Prior to a hearing on the motion, a settlement was reached whereby the
members-of the existing board of directors agreed to appoint additional
directors to the board, designated by the movants, in accordance with the
debtor's bylaws and to notify shareholders of the appointment of the new
directors.
In In re Sahlen & Associates, Inc.,289 the Commission, relying on In re
Baldwin-United, 43 B.R. 443 (S.D. Ohio 1984), filed a brief urging that
indemnification of the legal defense costs may be authorized as an administrative expense of the estate under Section 503(bXlXA)of the Code if the court
finds that the continued service of the officers and directors is beneficial to the
estate and that the benefits to be derived from their continued service justify
the amount advanced for legal fees. In this case, because no adequate showing
was made, the Commission urged on appeal that the matter should be
remanded to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings. The appeal is
pending.
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission reiterated in several cases its
position (54th Annual Report at 96 and 53rd Annual Report at 73) that class
claims are permissible in bankruptcy. The Commission believes that, under
principles of statutory construction, the well-recognized right to file class
claims outside of bankruptcy is equally available in bankruptcy cases.
The Commission won a major victory in In re The Charter CO.,290when the
Eleventh Circuit ruled that class proofs of claim are permissible in bankruptcy
and that a class representative's request for application of class action
procedures is timely when made within a reasonable time after the debtor's
objection to the class proof of claim. The Eleventh Circuit thus joins the
Seventh Circuit, which had agreed with the Commission's argument in In re
American Reserve291 in permitting class claims. The only other circuit to
consider the issue, the Tenth Circuit, held, in a case of uncertain precedential
value,292 that class claims are not allowable in bankruptcy.
The Commission has participated in several other cases urging the permis-

84

sibility of class claims. In In re LTV Corp.,293 the district court, relying on the
American Reserve and The Charter Co. decisions, concluded that permitting
class proofs of claim is consistent with the broad goals of the Bankruptcy
Code. The court reversed the bankruptcy judge, rejecting the rationale of a
much-cited 1985 decision to the contrary in In re Johns.Manville.294 The
district court decision is currently on appeal in the Second Circuit. Appeals
are also pending before the district courts in In re Texas International Co.295
(class claim allowed) and In re Allegheny International, Inc. et al.296 (class claim
denied).
In In re Kaiser Steel Resourees,297 a case of major significance to the
brokerage industry, a Commission appeal to the district court addressed the
question of whether brokerage firms and other entities may be liable for
payments made to customers in connection with a leveraged buyout under
state fraudulent conveyance law through use of the Bankruptcy Code avoidance powers. Using a discount brokerage firm defendant as a test case, the
bankruptcy court found, among other things, that the brokerage firm acted as
an agent for undisclosed or partially disclosed principals (i.e., its customers)
in the transaction because the defendant effected the Kaiser stock transfers in
"nominee name" for the customers. Under this finding, the brokerage firm
could be liable to Kaiser for the LBO payments as an "initial transferee" under
Section 550(aX1) of the Bankruptcy Code.
The Commission argued on appeal that the bankruptcy court's decision was
contrary to settled case law holding that financial intermediaries such as
brokerage firms that function as mere conduits in a transaction should not be
subject to liability as "initial transferees" under the Bankruptcy Code.
Moreover, the Commission contended that by imposing potential liability on
securities brokers for transactions executed in "nominee" or "street" name,
the bankruptcy court's decision could adversely affect the depository bookentry system-a critical element of the national clearance and settlement
system mandated by Congress in Section 17A of the Exchange Act. The
district court agreed with the Commission's position and reversed the decision
of the bankruptcy court.298
Disclosure Statements/Plans of Reorganization. A disclosure statement is a
combination proxy and offering statement used in soliciting acceptances of a
plan of reorganization. Such plans often provide for the exchange of new
securities for claims and interests of creditors and shareholders of the debtor.
The Bankruptcy Code provides that adequate disclosure is to be made without
regard to whether or not the information provided would otherwise comply
with the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws. However, in
recognition of the Commission's special expertise on disclosure questions,
the Bankruptcy Code recognizes the Commission's right to be heard, distinct
from its special advisory role, on the adequacy of disclosure. For this reason,
the Bankruptcy Rules require service on the Commission of all disclosure
statements.
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission received approximately 6,000
disclosure statements filed in Chapter 11 cases involving both privately-held
and publicly-held corporations. The staff limits its review to those disclosure

85

statements filed in cases involving a publicly-held company or a company
likely to be publicly traded as a consequence of the reorganization. During
fiscal year 1989, the staff reviewed 179 disclosure statements.
In its review of disclosure statements, the staff seeks to determine whether
the issuance of securities under a plan is consistent with the exemption from
registration in the Bankruptcy Code and otherwise in compliance with the
federal securities laws. The Commission also reviews statements to determine
whether there is adequate disclosure concerning the proposed plan. Generally,
the Commission seeks to resolve questions concerning bankruptcy disclosure
through staff comments to the plan proponent. If questions cannot be
resolved through this process, the Commission may object to the disclosure
statement in the bankruptcy court.
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission commented on disclosure statements in 95 cases, the vast majority of which were adopted by debtors. The
Commission was compelled to object to disclosure statements in one case. In
In re Texas International CO.,299 the Commission filed an objection to the
proposed plan, arguing, as it has on several other occaslons.P?" that the
provisions of the plan that purported to discharge and release non-debtor
liability should be stricken or revised because such provisions are beyond the
confines of the Bankruptcy Code discharge of liability. The plan was subsequently withdrawn by the debtor and an alternative plan, which did not include
a provision releasing or discharging non-debtor liability, was filed.
Compliance with the Registration Requirements of the Securities Act. Section
1145 of the Bankruptcy Code contains a limited exemption from registration
under the Securities Act for the distribution of securities by a debtor, or an
affiliate or successor to the debtor, pursuant to a plan of reorganization and in
exchange for claims against or securities of the debtor or such affiliate. The
issuance of securities pursuant to a plan is deemed to be a "public offering,"
which means that there is no restriction on resale of such securities unless the
seller is an "underwriter" as specifically defined in Section 1145(b). During
fiscal year 1989, the staff had no occasion to file formal objections to a
reorganization plan on the basis of violations of Section 1145 of the
Bankruptcy Code.

Economic Research and Analysis
Introduction
The Office of Economic Analysis provides technical support and analysis
designed to aid in the evaluation of the economic aspectsof the Commission's
regulatory program and the impact of that program on the rapidly changing
global capital market. The economics staff provides the Commission with
research and advice on rule proposals, policy initiatives, and the capital
markets. The staff assists the Commission in making decisions affecting the
fairness, efficiency, and structure of our nation's securities industry. In
addition, the program monitors developments in capital markets around the
world and major program initiatives impacting the United States financial
services industry, markets, and investors.

Key 1989 Results
Application of new technology within the securities industry, increased
complexity of new financial products, and development of new trading
strategies have resulted in a more dynamic domestic securities market
environment. The United States securities industry has been a leader in
financial innovation for many years. The securities markets continue to
benefit from a regulatory structure that fosters both competition and the
protection of investors and, thereby, promotes both public confidence and
operational efficiency in the markets. The need to keep abreast of economic,
regulatory, and institutional changes in foreign securities markets that could
have an effect on the operation and competitiveness of the United States
securities markets will become increasingly important in the 1990s.
Internationalization presents challenges to both the United States and
foreign regulators. The world's securities markets havealready become highly
interdependent. Further growth and inteqratlon of international securities
markets is anticipated in the years ahead, presenting numerous regulatory
and economic issues. This integration and growth of global markets will
require the development of a global regulatory perspective that preservesthe
efficiencies associated with international capital mobility, while maintaining
the integrity and fairness of the United States market. The challenge in the
1990s will be to assure that this balance is achieved in the evolving global
capital market. An efficient global market facilitates the free flow of capital
across national borders, encourages competition in financial services, and
provides for a regulatory framework that builds investor confidence. The
economics staff expects to develop capital market b.ieflnq reports and policy
papers that will assessthe economic, institutional, and regulatory developments impacting the competitiveness of the domestic securities market and
the Commission's regulatory program.
During fiscal year 1989, the economics staff reviewed rule proposals
encompassing the full range of the Commission's regulatory program. The

87

staff provided advice, technical assistance, and empirical analyses of issues of
concern to the Commission and its operating divisions. Monitoring programs
were developed and maintained to study the impact of major rules, new
trading facilities, and market developments. Key accomplishments of the
economics program include:
â€¢ periodic reports on the outlook for domestic and international
financial markets;
â€¢ a follow-up study to the staff report to Congress on the
internationalization of the securities markets;
â€¢ an analysis of the liquidity provided by exchange specialists and the
depletion of their buying power during the 1987 market break;
â€¢ a report on the financial condition and performance of exchange
specialists during 1975-1987 as background for Commission
consideration of a proposal to bring all exchange specialists under the
net capital rule;
â€¢ forecasts of the effects on broker-dealers of a proposal to raise the
minimum net capital requirements of firms that deal directly with the
investing public;
â€¢ a study of the connection between index options and the volatility of
stocks in the S&P 500 index;
â€¢ an analysis of trading volume during the twentieth century on the New
York Stock Exchange on an hourly and daily basis;
â€¢ an analysis of the aftermarket price performance of initial public
offerings of closed-end funds;
â€¢ an assessment of the impact of Rule 12b-1 fees on mutual fund
expenses and growth in net asset value and total assets;
â€¢ a study of the relationship between the quality of a firm's acquisitions
and the likelihood that the acquiring firm will itself become a future
takeover target; and
â€¢ a study of the relationship between pension fund terminations and
corporate takeovers.
In addition to preparing economic studies, the staff provided technical
advice and assistance to the Commission's operating divisions on a wide
variety of issues. In the accounting area, for example, the staff helped
determine the fair value of non-traded warrants, evaluated mergers where
assets were pooled, and assisted in the development of appropriate accounting principles for reporting earnings per share in unbundled stock units. The
staff also assisted in the establishment of rules for publishing "yield" in unit
investment trusts and provided input on proposed proxy disclosure requirements for closed-end funds. Technical support was provided to the Commission's enforcement program in such areas as penny stocks and the suitability
of trading strategies recommended to customers of broker-dealers. The staff
provided economic assistance to the Division of Investment Management in
developing disclosure guidelines for quoted rates of return in unit investment
trusts and to the Division of Market Regulation in the areas of broker-dealer
capital adequacy and specialists activities.

Management and Program Support
Introduction
The goals of program direction are to formulate and communicate policy
and to manage agency resources, enabling the Commission to fulfill its
statutory responsibilities. These goals are accomplished through policy
management and administrative support. Policy management encompasses
policy formulation, information dissemination, and management of the
agency's resources. Administrative support entails services such as account.
ing, data processing, staffing, and space management to support the Commission's objectives.

Key 1989 Results
Policy Management
A major component of program direction is management, coordination,
and support of Commission regulatory policies. In carrying out its regulatory
mission, the Commission has actively sought to consider the diverse viewpoints of investors, the securities industry in general, and other interested
parties. During fiscal year 1989, the Commission considered a wide range of
issues, including penny stock fraud; a wide variety of enforcement actions,
including those involving insider trading by Wall Street professionals; and
market reform, financial services reform, and other legislation affecting the
Commission. The Commission became a leading participant in the global.
ization of securities markets, analyzing such issuesas international clearance,
settlement, and payment mechanisms; international enforcement of securities laws; the exchange of information with foreign regulators; and access to
foreign markets. The Commission was also an active participant in the
International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and hosted
numerous visits by foreign officials to the Commission's headquarters in
Washington, D.C.
The Commission held 78 meetings in fiscal year 1989, during which it
considered 419 matters including rule proposals, enforcement actions, and
other matters that significantly affect the stability of the markets and the
nation's economy. Significant rules proposed or adopted by the Commission
included:
â€¢ proposal of Rule 144A to establish a non-exclusive safe harbor from
registration requirements for resales of restricted securities under the
Securities Act of 1933 to a specified class of institutional investors;
â€¢ proposal of Regulation S to clarify the extraterritorial application of
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933;
â€¢ amendments to Form S-8 to reduce burdens in registering securities
issued pursuant to employee benefit plans;

89

â€¢ revisions of Regulations 130 and 13G to permit filing of Schedules
130 and 13G based upon the purpose of the share acquisitions;
â€¢ amendments to Schedules 130, 13E-3, 14B, and 140-1 to require
disclosure concerning significant equity participants in control
transactions; and
â€¢ proposed rules to allow acquisition of foreign broker-dealer equity
securities by investment companies, to permit investment companies
to acquire securities of foreign banks and insurance companies, and to
allow investment companies to organize as limited partnerships.
The Commission's management staff maintained a comprehensive program of financial oversight of the agency's resources, initiated special
projects, justified the agency budget request to the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) and Congress, and completed the agency's budget authorization request for fiscal years 1990 to 1992. In January 1989, the staffs
Self-Funding Study was submitted to the Securities Subcommittee of the
Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. The study
described the personnel and funding difficulties facing the SEC and presented
alternative solutions. Other major projects conducted during fiscal year 1989
included modifications to the Commission's Public Reference Room rules,
initiation of automation projects aimed at developing both a local area
network (LAN) and a wide area network (WAN), and installation of a pilot
automation system in the Boston Regional Office. In addition, the Commission's management staff has begun coordination of the agency's internal
control and audit follow-up responsibilities pursuant to the Inspector General
Act Amendments of 1988.
'
Consumer Affairs and Information Services
The Office of Consumer Affairs and Information Services supports the
Commission's efforts to prevent fraud in the nation's financial markets. The
office researches and responds to investor complaints and inquiries, collects
and analyzes complaint information and trends to help target regulatory and
enforcement activities, and prepares educational materials to assist investors
in protecting their interests. In addition to its complaint processing and
tracking role, the office serves as the agency's receipt and processing point for
requests for information under various statutes such as the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act.
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission's consumer affairs staff responded
to a total of 44,987 complaints and inquiries from investors. Of this total,
29,368 were complaints and 15,619 were inquiries. Of the complaints, over
17,100 (59 percent of all complaints) were directed at broker-dealers. Complaints against penny stock broker-dealers numbered 3,776-representing
approximately 22 percent of all broker-dealer complaints in fiscal year 1989.
In other complaint areas, issuers of securities accounted for 17 percent of total
complaints, while the remainder of complaints were divided among mutual
funds, transfer agents, banks, and investment advisers.
The complaints and inquiries received during fiscal year 1989 were marked

90

by their increased complexity. Thus, the time necessary to process and
research them has increased. To meet the demands of the large influx of
complex complaints and inquiries, the office initiated a rnulti-year project to
redesign the Commission's computerized complaint tracking system. The new
system will permit thorough analysis of complaint information and trends and
increase the timeliness of Commission responses to investors and other
members of the public. The new system is targeted for implementation during
the second quarter of fiscal year 1991.
The office also supported special Commission initiatives in a number of
ways. In addition to designating "penny stock fraud" as the focus of its
National Consumer's Week observance in fiscal year 1989, Consumer Affairs
staff supported the activities of the Commission's Penny Stock Task Force.
Specifically, support in the form of supplemental tracking and retrieval of
complaints against individual penny stock brokers was provided. The office
also participated in the compilation and distribution of several penny stock
educational brochures.
The Office of Consumer Affairs and Information Services also responds to
a variety of information requests. During fiscal year 1989, the office processed
1,989 FOIA requests, 52 Privacy Act requests, 97 Government in the Sunshine
Act requests, 23 government referrals, and 3,127 requests for confidential
treatment. In addition, the staff coordinated 1,199 requests for Commission
records from members of Congress.
Public Reference
The Commission maintains public reference rooms in the Washington,
D.C., New York, and Chicago offices. As part of a reorganization during fiscal
year 1989, the headquarters' Public Reference Room implemented procedures
designed to expedite the identification, location, and retrieval of documents
and microfiche for public users. Throughout the year, the staff answered
questions and completed requests for documents from over 69,000 visitors to
the headquarters' Public Reference Room. Over the same period, approximately 309,000 paper documents and 371,000 microfiche were added to the
existing library of publicly available information. In addition, the staff processed over 500 formal requests for certifications of Commission filings,
49,700 requests for microfiche records, 13,000 requests for paper filings, and
over 90,000 telephone inquiries regarding filings.
Equal Employment Opportunity
During fiscal year 1989, an independent study of the Commission's Equal
Employment Opportunity (EEO) program was conducted. The study provided
a series of recommendations designed to improve the effectiveness and
administration of EEO operations, as well as to improve employee awareness
of the EEO Office and its programs. By the close of fiscal year 1989, the
Commission had implemented approximately one-third of the study's recommendations. The recommendations acted upon included:
91

â€¢ improving and expanding the EEO counseling and Federal Women's
Programs (FWP);
â€¢ providing additional Office of Personnel Management (OPM) training
for EEO counselors and FWP personnel;
â€¢ recruiting more attorneys and accountants as EEO counselors;
â€¢ revising the agency's affirmative employment plan;
â€¢ using new forms to streamline the EEO process;
â€¢ developing EEO reference books for use by collateral duty personnel;
â€¢ acquiring EEO investigators through the General Services
Administration's (GSA) blanket contract with a national professional
investigative firm;
â€¢ revising the agency's EEO fact sheet by highlighting EEO procedures
and policies; and
â€¢ publishing an EEO bulletin as a vehicle to communicate information
about EEO matters to all employees.
The Commission actively recruited and employed minority groups and
women during fiscal year 1989. At the close of the year, women accounted for
almost one-half of the total SEC workforce. Blacks made up 28 percent of the
workforce. Hispanics accounted for approximately three percent of all SEC
employees. Asian Americans made up 2.36 percent of the agency's employees and American Indians/Alaskan natives made up 1.0 percent of the
Commission's workforce.
Public Affairs
The Office of Public Affairs communicates information on Commission
activities to those interested in or affected by Commission actions, including
the press, the general public, regulated entities, and employees of the
Commission. Special projects, such as support for activities related to penny
stock fraud and efforts regarding the internationalization of securities markets, were undertaken by the office in support of the Commission's mission.
In addition to special projects, workload increased substantially in the office's
ongoing activities as well in fiscal year 1989. These increases will continue in
future fiscal years.
The Office of Public Affairs' primary function is the collection and dissemination of information to the public, Commission staff, and the regulated
population. The SEC News Digest-a daily publication that provides information on rule changes, enforcement actions against individuals or corporate
entities, acquisition reports, releases, decisions on requests for exemptions,
upcoming Commission meetings, and other events of interest-was prepared
by office staff in fiscal year 1989. The SEC News Digest is available in the
Commission's Public Reference Room. Information on Commission activity is
also disseminated through notices of administrative actions, litigation
releases, and other materials.
Another important function is the coordination of the Commission's
interaction with the press. Press releases issued prior to Commission meetings
and press briefings conducted after these meetings provide insight into
proposed and adopted changes in policies and regulations and can have a
92

significant impact on financial markets. Public Affairs staff also issues press
releases on upcoming events, Commission programs, and special projects. In
all, 102 news releases were issued during fiscal year 1989. Many Commission
actions are of nationwide and, increasingly, international interest. When
appropriate, these actions are drawn to the attention of regional, national, and
international press. Special projects such as studies and reports on emerging
issues in the financial markets are also publicized.
In addition to the above functions, the office responded to approximately
82,000 requests for specific information on the Commission or its activities.
Staff is also responsible for coordinating the visits of national and foreign
officials to the Commission. In total, programs for 355 foreign visitors were
coordinated in fiscal year 1989.
Administrative Support
In addition to policy management, program direction encompasses administrative support. The administrative support function provides Commission
programs with the necessary financial, facilities, data processing, and personnel support necessary to carry out their missions. Under the direction of the
Office of the Executive Director, these support services are provided by the
Commission's Offices of the Comptroller, Administrative Services, Information Systems Management, and Personnel.
Financial Management
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission completed its first year of
operation on its new accounting system, the Federal Financial System (FFS).
Under FFS, time, error correction, and processing delays are avoided through
the electronic input of voucher and payment data into the accounting
system-a significant improvement over the old system. A further benefit of
FFS is the ready availability of management data, which allows for tighter
control over the agency's accounting system. FFS data input, limited to
selected organizations within the Commission's headquarters in fiscal year
1989, will be implemented in the remaining headquarters organizations and
the regional offices over the next two years.
Throughout fiscal year 1989, the Commission continued to improve its fee
collection processes. During the year, the Commission adopted a proposal to
accept credit card charges for the payment of filing fees in 1991. In addition,
the Commission has begun design of a new automated fee tracking, reporting,
and accounts receivable system. Once operational, this new system will
generate daily deposit tickets, electronically record and match filings and fees
within "corporate accounts," maintain accounts receivable records, produce
required billing notices, and perform periodic reconciliations.
Facilities Management
Fiscal year 1989 continued to present numerous space and logistical
challenges for the Office of Administrative Services. Office space was acquired
for the forced relocation of the New Yorkand Philadelphia Regional Offices. In
93

addition, the office acquired needed space for the Commission's Washington,
D.C. headquarters.
During 1989, Delegated Lease Management Authority (DLMA) was
obtained from GSA for application at the Commission's offices in Philadelphia
and New York. As a result, the Commission's DLMA program now applies to
six field offices, in addition to the headquarters office.
In support of the Commission's efforts to automate its information systems,
the Office of Administrative Services obtained a Delegated Procurement
Authority (DPA) from GSA. This authority allowed the Commission to install
horizontal cabling in preparation for the implementation of a local area
network in the headquarters building.
The Office of Administrative Services exercised increased responsibility in
contracting activities in fiscal year 1989. The office awarded contracts in
excess of $18 million during the year-an
increase of approximately $5
million over fiscal year 1988. A significant portion of this increase in contract
award value is attributable to the extensive procurement of ADP equipment in
fiscal year 1989.
Information Systems Management
During fiscal year 1989, the Office of Information Systems Management
(ISM) continued its efforts to modernize the Commission's computer systems
and to support the Commission's mission through advanced automation.
These efforts included:
â€¢ development of an electronic "blue sheet" tracking system-a
PC-based document tracking system for major enforcement cases;
â€¢ design of a pilot Central Registrations Depository (CRD) system in
cooperation with the National Association of Securities Dealers that
will allow for the automated receipt, processing, and assimilation of
broker-dealer filings; and
â€¢ technical support for the development of the Commission's Electronic
Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system.
Beyond program-related support, ISM continued to assist in the improvement of Commission administrative and management systems in fiscal year
1989. In response to Public Law 100-235, an ADP security plan was
developed that outlined sensitive computer applications and the means
necessary to protect them. Also, in order to assist the agency in complying
with OMB Circular A-127, ISM worked with the Offices of the Comptroller and
Administrative Services in the effective implementation of the Federal Financial System. Finally, efforts were undertaken throughout fiscal year 1989 to
develop local and wide area network capabilities within the agency.
Personnel Management
During fiscal year 1989, the Office of Personnel (OPM) revised regulations
on training, performance appraisals, and employee grievances in accordance
with government-wide changes. In addition, the office implemented a leave
transfer program to benefit employees affected by medical emergencies.

94

In response to continued Commission emphasis on information systems
automation, approximately 800 employees were trained on computer systems
and applications. In addition to computer training, the office provided
requested training to 700 staff members in order to improve their on-the-job
performance.
Recognizing that a significant portion of the Commission's staff will be
eligible to retire in the next few years, retirement counseling was provided to
approximately five percent of the agency's staff in fiscal year 1989. As a
supplement to counseling, the office developed and issued an individual
retirement benefits brochure to each permanent Commission employee.
While staff retention and turnover improved in fiscal year 1989, the
Commission continued to face severe challenges in recruiting and retaining
qualified staff. Continued emphasis was placed on the recruitment of professionals, such as attorneys, accountants, and securities compliance examiners.
Through attendance at numerous aPM job fairs, fiscal year 1989 proved to be
the Commission's most successful year for recruiting computer specialists and
secretaries. In addition, labor market conditions and special pay rates allowed
the Commission to exceed its expected level of securities compliance examiner recruitment in New York and Los Angeles.
The Commission completed its first self-evaluation as required under
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 during fiscal year 1989. The Act
requires each agency to make its programs and activities accessible to
handicapped persons. Upon conclusion of the review, the Commission was
praised by the Department of Justice for its implementation of this statute.
During fiscal year 1989, the Commission administered a balanced personnel management program through appropriate recognition of employee
performance. In fiscal year 1989. the SEC awarded more than $900,000 in
incentive and performance awards.
Commission Operations
In fiscal year 1989, for the seventh consecutive year, the SEC collected
revenue for the U.S. Treasury in excess of its appropriation. The SEC collected
fee revenue of $214 million compared to a congressional appropriation of
$143 million-a net gain to the U.S. Treasury of $71 million. Fee revenue is
collected from four basic sources: registrations under the Securities Act of
1933 (comprising 51 percent of total fiscal year 1989 fee revenue); transactions on securities exchanges (27 percent); tender offer and merger filings (19
percent); and miscellaneous filings (3 percent).

281The Commission subsequently concluded that the provisions of the
original proposal should be enhanced. In testimony before the Securities
Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
on February 1, 1990, Chairman Breeden described the recommended changes.
First, the revised proposal would expressly authorize the Commission to issue
cease-and-desist orders for violations of the federal securities laws. Second, the
Commission would be empowered to order disgorgement in its administrative
and cease-and-desist proceedings. Third, the Federal Criminal Code would be
amended to permit a court to authorize disclosure to the Commission of grand
jury information concerning potential securities law violations. Fourth, the
express authority of courts to impose officer and director bars would be limited
to violations of certain scienter-based antifraud provisions. Because of the
cease-and-desist authority contained in the revised proposal, the Commission
would not seek authority to impose such sanctions administratively, nor does
the revision contain the proposed amendments to Section 15(cX4) that are in S.
647.
282After the House Subcommittee voted to report out the revised proposal on
clearance and settlement, the revision was introduced as a separate bill, H.R.
3566.
283A companion bill was introduced in the Senate as S. 438.

Appendix 

The Securities Industry
Revenues, Expenses, and Selected
Balance Sheet Items

i

Broker-dealers that are registered
with the Commission produced revenues of $66.7 billion in calendar year
1988, one percent above the 1987
level. The traditional securities activities, the brokerage business in particular, suffered from weak investor interest
in 1988.
As a result of low volume, revenues
from the brokerage business declined
by $6.4 billion (26 percent) in 1988.
Virtually all of this decline resulted
from a decrease in revenues from retail.
ing securities products(securities commissions and revenues from the sale of
mutual funds). Margin interest declined
by a modest $300 million.
Business in traditional dealer activi.
ties also was stagnant. Revenues from
trading and investments rose by $2.4
billion (17 percent) in 1988, but this
reflects the abnormally low 1987 fig.
ures. These revenues were substantially
below the 1986 levels. Underwriting
profits declined by $100 million (two
percent).
"All other revenues," which are dom-

inated by interest income from securities purchased under agreements to
resell and fees from handling private
placements, mergers, and acquisitions.
rose $4.6 billion (21 percent) in 1988.
These revenues accounted for 40 percent of total revenues in 1988, compared to 33 percent in 1987.
Like revenues, expenses showed little
g m s change in 1988, increasing by $300
million (under one percent). Declines in
transaction-related expenses, such as
registered representatives' cornpensation (a $2 billion decline) and commissions and clearance paid other broken
(a $700 million decline), were compensated for by a $3.3 billion increase in
interest expenses.
Pre-tax income rose $300 million to
$3.5 billion in 1988. The predax return
on equity in 1988 was 9.6 percent,
comparable to the return in 1987 but
substantially below those of earlier
years.
Assets rose by 18 percent to $560.9
billion at year-end 1988, with liabilities
also rising 18 percent to $523.8 billion.
Ownership equity increased $2.8 billion during 1988 to $37.0 billion.

Securities Industry Dollar In
1988 For Carrying and
Clearing Firms
Data for carrying and clearing
firms which do a public business is
presented here to allow for more
detail as reporting requirements for
firms which neither carry nor clear
differ and data aggregation of these
two types of firms necessarily results
in loss of detail. Carrying and clear.
ing firms are those firms which clear
securities transactions or maintain
possession or control of customers'
cash or securities. This group produced 86 percent of the securities
industry's total revenues in calendar
year 1988.
Brokerage activity accounted for
about 24 cents of each revenue dollar in 1988, a substantial decrease
from 35 cents in 1987. Securities
commissions were the most important component, producing 16 cents
of each dollar of revenue, while margin interest and revenues from
mutual fund sales generated six
cents and three cents, respectively.
The dealer side produced 70 cents
of each dollar of revenue. Twenty-five
of these cents came from trading and
investments. nine cents from underwriting, and 36 cents from other
securities. related revenues. The latter is comprised primarily of interest
income from securities purchased
under agreements to resell and fees
from handling private placements,
mergers, and acquisitions.

124

Total expenses consumed 96 cent!
of each revenue dollar, compared tc
98 cents in 1987. The result was a
pre-tax profit margin of four cents
per revenue dollar, compared to two
cents in 1987.
In 1988. interest became the most
important expense category, consuming 33 cents of each revenue dollar,
compared to 29 cents in 1987. As a
percent of revenues, employee.rel~te~
expenses (registered representatIves
compensation and clerical and administrative employees' expenses) fell to
33 cents from 38 cents in 1987.
Total assets of broker-dealers carry.
ing and clearing customer accounts
rose by $83.4 billion to $539.5 billion
at year-end 1988. Resale agreements
accounted for the majority of this
growth, increasing by $50.9 billion to
$264.8 billion. Resale agreements
now account for almost half of all
assets. Long positions rose $16.6 blllion to $132.3 billion but in dollar
terms still remain below the levels
maintained in 1985 and 1986. Most of
the remaining assets represented
receivables, either from customers or
other broker-dealers.
Total liabilities increased $80.5 bil.
lion, or 19 percent, to $508.3 billion in
1988. Short positions and repurchase
agreements accounted for abou~
three. fourths of this increase. Owners
equity rose 10 percent. from $28.2
billion in 1987 to $31.2 billion in
1988.

Self-Regulatory Organizations:
Expenses, Pre-Tax Income and
Balance Sheet Structure
Aggregate clearing agency service
revenue decreased over 12%, or $44
million, in calendar year 1988 due to
decreases in securities trading volume and use of depository services.
Total depository service revenue
decreased $33 million including revenue decreases of $21 million at the
Depository Trust Company (DTC), $2
million at the Midwest Securities
Trust Company (MSTC) and $3 million at the MBS Clearing Corporation (MBSCC). MBSCC, which was
organized to service the mortgagebacked securities industry, left the
depository business. Service revenue
of clearing corporations decreased
almost $11 million, or 8 %, largely as
a result of decreases of almost $7
million at the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) and $1.5 million at
the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC).
Total depository pre-tax income was
up $9.6 million. The main factor was
MBSCC's reorganization and its cessation of business. MBSCC lost $7.5
million in 1987. In addition, DTC
earned $1.5 million more than the
previous year by retaining fees in order
to increase shareholders' equity. DTC,
as with all clearing agencies, adjusts
refunds of fees and its fee structure to
provide the amount of earnings which
it wishes to retain.
The depositories continued to
expand their base for service revenues
by increasing the number of shares on
deposit and the face value of debt
securities in custody. At the end of
1988, the total value of securities in
the depository system reached $3.5
trillion, of which DTC alone held over
128

$2 trillion, not including over $1 trillion in certificates held by transfer
agents as DTC's agent. This movement of certificates into depositories
was due to further expansion of
depository-eligible issues and the
desire of participants to avail themselves of depository services. The
MSTC had 715,000 eligible issues at
year end, up 11 %, and DTC had
609,000, up 24%. Eligibility for all
types of securities increased; however,
the number of municipal bond issues
increased 24%, and now more than
three-fourths of the principal amount
of all municipal bonds currently outstanding in the United States is in the
depository system.
As a group, the clearing corporations recorded a net decrease in pretax income of almost $9 million.
NSCC posted a pre-tax earnings
decrease of $1.6 million; OCC
recorded an increase of three-fourths
of a million; and the MBSCC reported
a loss of $4 million as compared to
earnings in 1987 of about $4 million.
In April 1987, the PSE announced
the closure of the clearance and
depository functions not essential to
PSE's trading operations. As a result,
$47 billion of securities were moved to
DTC's custody during midyear 1987.
NSCC now processes almost all of
PSE's clearing volume. The Pacific
Clearing Corporation (PCC) incurred a
pre-tax loss of $1.2 million after a loss
of $2.6 million in 1987. Of the 1988
loss, $1 million was attributable to
costs of discontinued operations. The
Pacific Securities Depository Trust
Company (PSDTC) reported only
interest income of $1.6 million versus
$517,000 of pre-tax income in 1987.
In 1988, all expenses relating to
PSDTC were absorbed by PSE and
charged to an accrual for costs of dis-

position established in 1987. Additional expenses of $275,000 were
absorbed by PSE in 1988 compared to
almost $2.4 million in 1987. The combined stockholders' equity of PCC and
PSDTC was $1 million at the end of
1988. PSE members' equity totaled
$15.7 million at the end of 1988.
The aggregate net worth of all

clearing corporations and depositories rose almost $4.4 million to a new
high of almost $50 million. Participant clearing fund contributions
decreased by $16 million, less than
2%, to $900 million. These funds
provide protection to the clearing
agencies in the event of a participant
default.

Exemptions
Section

12(h) Exemptions

Section 12(h) of the Exchange Act
authorizes the Commission to grant a
complete or partial exemption from
the registration provisions of Section
12(g) or from other disclosure or
insider trading provisions of the Act
where such exemption is consistent
with the public interest and the protection of investors. Twenty four applications were pending at the beginning of
fiscal year 1989 and 56 applications
were filed during the year. Of the total
80 applications, 25 were granted and
55 were pending at the end of the
fiscal year.
Exemptions
Issuers

for Foreign Private

Rule 12g3-2 provides various
exemptions from the registration
provisions of Section 12(g) of the
Exchange Act for the securities of
foreign private issuers. The most significant of these exemptions is that
contained in subparagraph (b), which
provides an exemption for certain

132

foreign issuers that submit on a cur.
rent basis the material specified in
the rule. Such material includes that
information about which investors
ought reasonably to be informed and
which the issuer: (1) has made public
pursuant to the law of the country in
which it is incorporated or organized;
(2) has filed with a foreign stock
exchange on which its securities are
traded and which was made public by
such exchange; and (3) has distributed
to its security holders. Periodically, the
Commission publishes a list of those
foreign issuers that appear to be current under the exemptive provision.
The most current list, as of September
29, 1989, contains a total of 1,056
foreign issuers.

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
There were 3,544 companies registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 as of September 30, 1989.
New registrations totaled 304 with
157 registrations being terminated
during the fiscal year. This compares
with fiscal year 1988 figures of 3,497
total registrations, 338 new registrations, and 124 terminations.

Book-entry deliveries continued to
outdistance physical deliveries in the
settlement of securities transactions
among depository participants. This
tendency is illustrated in Table 16.
CERTIFICATE
IMMOBILIZATION
TRENDS. The Table captures the relative significance of the mediums
employed. in a ratio of book-entry
deliveries to certificates withdrawn
from DTC. The figures include

Direct Mail by Agents but exclude
municipal bearer bonds. In 1988,
while the number of shares traded in
U.S. markets decreased
almost
15%. the total certificates withdrawn
decreased over 29%. and the ratio of
book-entry deliveries to certificates
withdrawn continued to grow. In
1988, the ratio was almost 2.5 times
the 1983 figure of 3.7 book-entry
deliveries rendered for every certificate withdrawn.

Foreign Restricted List
The Securities and Exchange Commission maintains and publishes a Foreign Restricted List which is designed to
put broker-dealers, financial institutions,
investors and others on notice of possible
unlawful distributions of foreign securities in the United States. The list consists
of names of foreign companies whose
securities the Commission has reason to
believe have been, or are being offered
for public sale in the United States in
possible violation of the registration
requirement of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. The offer and sale of
unregistered securities deprives investors of all the protections afforded by the
Securities Act of 1933, including the
right to receive a prospectus containing
the information required by the Act for
the purpose of enabling the investor to
determine whether the investment is
suitable. While most broker-dealers
refuse to effect transactions in securities
issued by companies on the Foreign
Restricted List, this does not necessarily
prevent promotors from illegally offering
such securities directly to investors in the
United States by mail, by telephone, and
sometimes by personal solicitation. The
following foreign corporations and other
foreign entities comprise the Foreign
Restricted List.
1. Aguacate Consolidated Mines,

Right to Financial Privacy
Section 21(h) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.c.
78u(hX6Â»)requires that the Commission "compile an annual tabulation
of the occasions on which the Commission used each separate subparagraph or clause of [Section 21(hX2Â»)
or the provisions of the Right to
Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (12
U.S.c. 3401-22 (the RFPA)] to
obtain access to financial records of
a customer and include it in its
annual report to the Congress." During the fiscal year, the Commission

156

made four applications to courts for
orders pursuant to the subparagraphs and clauses of Section
21(hX2) to obtain access to financial
records of a customer. The Commission obtained access to the financial
records of a customer using the procedures provided by the following
sections of the RFPA:
Section 1104 (applicable to
.5
customer consents)
Section 1105 (applicable to
administrative subpoenas) ........ 92
Section 1107 (applicable to
judicial subpoenas)
