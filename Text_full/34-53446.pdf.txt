Order Directing Appointment
of Tax Administrator

By order dated April 28, 2005, the Commission ordered respondent John D. Carifa
(“Carifa”) to pay disgorgement and penalties. Pursuant to that order, on April 28, 2005,
Respondent Carifa paid a total of $375,001 of disgorgement and penalty to the Commission (the
“Distribution Fund”). The Commission has solicited proposals from several tax firms, and has
determined that Damasco & Associates, located in San Francisco, California, is best suited to act
as tax administrator in this proceeding.
Accordingly,
IT IS ORDERED that:
A.

Pursuant to Rule 1105(a) of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans, Damasco & Associates be appointed as tax administrator
(the “Tax Administrator”) for the Distribution Fund with limited authority and
power to: (1) act as the administrator for tax purposes for the qualified settlement
fund (“QSF”); (2) prepare, sign, and file the necessary tax returns and tax-related
documents for the Distribution Fund; (3) obtain the necessary tax-related
documents and identifiers, such as an employee identification number, on behalf
of the Distribution Fund; (4) perform other tax-related and reporting duties on
behalf of the Funds as required by Department of the Treasury regulations
relating to QSF administrators; and (5) communicate on behalf of the
Distribution Fund on matters set forth in this paragraph.

B.

The bond requirement of Rule 1105(c) of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund
and Disgorgement Plans is waived for good cause shown, specifically, as further
described below, because the Tax Administrator shall never have custody or
control of the Distribution Fund;

C.

The Tax Administrator shall submit, at least 30 days prior to any date on which a
tax payment is required on behalf of the QSF, or as soon as is practicable,
documents showing the amount necessary to satisfy the tax liability of the QSF as
well as all other documents supporting such amount. The Tax Administrator shall
submit the documents to the Office of Financial Management (“OFM”),
Securities and Exchange Commission, Operations Center, 6432 General Green
Way, Stop 0-3, Alexandria, VA 22312, with a copy to the assigned staff member.
OFM shall pay the amount of the documented taxes to the Tax Administrator by
check or wire transfer from the fund. Such tax payments will come first from any
earnings or interest in the QSF, and second, if necessary, from the principal of the
QSF. The Tax Administrator, in turn, shall be responsible for paying the taxes to
the IRS and the relevant state taxing authority, if any, on behalf of the
Distribution Fund.

D.

The Tax Administrator shall comply with all reporting requirements applicable to
a qualified settlement fund as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.468B1(a), as amended, and shall file on a timely basis all required federal, state, and
local tax returns, and shall contemporaneously provide copies of such filings to
the assigned Commission staff member.

E.

The Tax Administrator shall keep records and bill each QSF for the services
provided to it. Each bill shall be reviewed by the assigned Commission staff
member. After the staff has approved the bill for payment, OFM shall pay the bill
of the Tax Administrator by check or wire transfer from the fund. Payment shall
come first from any earnings or interest in the QSF, and second, if necessary,
from the principal of the QSF. The fees billed shall be as agreed upon in the Tax
Administrator’s engagement letter accepted by the Commission on March 8,
2005.

By the Commission.

Secretary
