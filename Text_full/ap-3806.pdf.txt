In the Matter of
MARK A. LOPEZ

ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AND
DIRECTING DIVISION TO FILE
MOTION

On February 24, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. On March 21, 2016, I held a telephonic prehearing conference, at which
the parties appeared and indicated that they had discussed settlement. In an order following the
conference, I noted that the parties could file a joint motion to stay the proceeding if they reached
an agreement in principle to a settlement on all major terms, but that if no such motion was filed
by April 20, 2016, I would set a procedural schedule to resolve this matter. Mark A. Lopez,
Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3726, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1060 (ALJ Mar. 22, 2016). I further
noted that Respondent’s answer was due April 4. Id.
To date, the parties have not filed a joint motion to stay the proceeding, and Respondent
has not filed an answer.
I therefore ORDER Respondent to SHOW CAUSE by May 5, 2016, why this proceeding
should not be determined against him due to his failure to file an answer or otherwise defend this
proceeding. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
I further ORDER the Division of Enforcement to file an appropriate dispositive motion
by May 9, 2016. The Division’s motion shall address what sanctions are in the public interest
and shall include a discussion of the public interest factors under Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d
1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981), with citations to
supporting evidence. Supporting evidence should include a declaration identifying each exhibit
with a short description. In addition to the required filing with the Office of the Secretary, an
electronic courtesy copy should be emailed to alj@sec.gov in PDF text-searchable format.
