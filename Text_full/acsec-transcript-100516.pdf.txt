Sebastian, I assume we have a quorum.
MR. GOMEZ: As soon as the rest of the members
come to their chairs, we will.
(Laughter.)
MR. GOMEZ: So in the room we have a quorum.
Maybe not at the table yet.
MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Our agenda today
encompasses a variety of matters.
First there will be a discussion of Regulation

14

S-K, the integrated disclosure requirements used both

15

for registered offerings and ongoing reportings.

16

Congress passed legislation last December that requires

17

the Commission to consult with both this advisory

18

committee and the investor advisory committee in

19

connection with the disclosure requirements in

20

Regulation S-K. This committee has spent time in the

21

past discussing the benefits of scaling certain of

22

those disclosures for smaller companies. And I am

23

fairly certain we will have thoughts to share.

24

Secondly we will turn to a topic that Xavier

25

Gutierrez suggested, and we are pleased to take up, and

2 (Pages 2 to 5)

Page 6

Page 8

1

that is diversity in corporate boards. Our focus, as a

1

2

committee, is capital formation and preservation with

2

3

regard to small and emerging companies, and we believe

3

4

that there is a correlation between board diversity and

4

5

the level of a corporation's success.

5

6

Indulge me a minute or two as I digress

6

7

briefly for an analogy. As some of you may know,

7

8

Jackie Robinson tried out for the Boston Red Sox before

8

9

winding up with the Dodgers. He was rejected by the

9

10

Red Sox, and that organization made it clear they had

10

11

no intention of allowing black players on the team,

11

12

ever. As it turns out, the Red Sox were the last team

12

13

to integrate. Is there any correlation between that

13

14

and going 86 years without a championship?

14

15

(Laughter.)

15

16

MR. GRAHAM: We will hear this morning from an

16

17

outside expert in this area as to the bottom-line

17

18

benefits that research has shown. I hope that we can

18

19

have a fulsome discussion about the importance of

19

20

diversity from an economic standpoint and a shareholder

21

information standpoint, and whether there might be ways

22

the SEC's disclosure requirements in this area could be

23

improved so as to actually encourage diversity. Now,

24

this is not a mandate. This is not social policy. But

25

I admit there is some overlap.

This afternoon we will get an update from

1
2

Stephen Luparello, director of the division of trading

3

and markets, on several topics this committee has been

4

interested in for a long time: equity

5

for smaller companies, tick-size, and finders.
And we will end the meeting with a discussion

6
7

of public outreach about ways smaller companies can

8

more effectively use the securities markets to raise

9

capital.
But before moving to our agenda today we are

10
11

honored to start with opening remarks from both

12

Commissioners Stein and Piwowar. But I don't see

13

Commissioner Stein yet. So shall we -MR. GOMEZ: We will start with Commissioner

14
15

Piwowar, please.

16

(Laughter.)
COMMISSIONER PIWOWAR: That's great, I never

17
18

get to go first. I guess I'm the designated survivor,

19

I guess, of the Commission.
(Laughter.)

20

COMMISSIONER PIWOWAR: So that's great. As

21
22

the junior-most member, I usually get the last word.

23

I've never done this before, get to lead off. This is

24

great.

25

Thank you, Stephen, and thank you, Sara, for

your great leadership on this committee. Nice to see
everyone this morning. Again, thank all of you for
your service to the committee. It's a significant
commitment of time and effort on your part, and I just
want to mention that I personally find the advice and
ideas generated by this committee to be very helpful in
my role as commissioner.
As Stephen mentioned, today's agenda consists
of several important topics, including discussion about
our disclosure effectiveness initiative and corporate
board diversity, as well as issues related to equity
market structure that are overseen by our division of
trading and markets.
I am pleased that Steve Luparello, the
director of the division of trading and markets, will
provide you with an update on the tick-size pilot,
which just started this week, and the treatment of
finders. For small and medium-sized enterprises,
finding sources of capital is particularly important,
and we need to ensure that persons who play a limited
role in connecting issuers and investors for a fee are
regulated appropriately.
And as some long-time members of this
committee have correctly pointed out in the past,
subjecting finders to the full panoply of broker-dealer

regulation is not the appropriate way to do it. I look
forward to individual committee members' insights on
this topic following the discussion, including those of
our newer members.
The last topic for discussion today, as
Stephen mentioned, is outreach to smaller companies
about capital raising. This reminds me of the French
economist Frederic Bastiat's famous essay on what is
seen and not seen. Bastiat wrote over a century ago
that an act, a habit, an institution, or a law -- or,
in this case, regulations -- do not produce only one
effect, but a series of effects. The first effect is
immediate and usually appears simultaneous with its
cause. As a result, it is visible or, in Bastiat's
words, it is seen. But other effects only emerge
subsequently, and those effects are not seen.
In regulating the capital markets, the
Commission adopts rules such as crowdfunding,
Regulation A-plus, Rule 506(c). We can observe the
number of filings filed with us in response to those
rule changes. These companies can be seen. But we
lack visibility into those companies and start-ups that
do not raise or are not able to raise capital. Why is
that? How much do our regulations play a part in this
decision? These are the companies that are not seen.

Thus, as we move forward with thinking about
how to facilitate capital formation for small
businesses, we need to do our best to consider both the
seen and the unseen consequences of our regulatory
actions. Your outreach efforts in this area could be
particularly helpful in this regard.
I hope that you have productive discussions
today. Unfortunately, I won't be able to enjoy you for
the entire meeting, but I hope to be able to join you
again at various parts throughout the day. And if
there are any particular issues you would like to
follow up with me on, please feel free to reach out to
my office any time. Thank you.
MR. GOMEZ: And Steve, the -- and for the
committee members, the chair wanted to join this
morning, but she has a meeting at the IMF. And she
will be joining the committee this afternoon.
And I guess we probably should proceed to the
first item on the agenda, and when Commissioner Stein
comes in we can take a break and then she can provide
her remarks.
MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Before we get to that,
let's talk about who you are. So, Keith?
MR. HIGGINS: Well, I'm Keith Higgins, and I'm
director of the division. And with me are Betsy

MS. MURPHY: Okay. I think you covered the

SEC staff member speaking today. So that's to say that

any remarks made by any of the SEC staff members

9

10

reflect their own views, and not necessarily those of

10

11

the Commission or any other member of the Commission

11

12

staff.

12

Back to you.

13

14

MR. GRAHAM: Well, before back to me I want to

14

15

just extend my thanks again to Sebastian and Julie for

15

16

all the help they gave to this committee. None of this

16

17

would happen without them.

17

18
19
20

So, Commissioner Stein, we will turn it over
to you.
COMMISSIONER STEIN: Wonderful. I'm sorry I

18
19
20

21

got held up by traffic. I have a long commute in the

21

22

morning, and it's a little hit or miss.

22

23

I want to welcome everyone here. Thank you

realizes people do this for free to advise the
Commission.
I am really excited about today's agenda
covering Reg S-K disclosure requirements -- we've been
delving deep into those at the Commission -- corporate
board diversity disclosure, and the recently-launched
tick-size pilot project.
And these agenda items call on the committee
to consider, I think, what investors want to know in
order to make investment decisions; how smaller
companies can best give them that information in order
to attract and maintain investment in the company; and
how quality information may be linked to enhance
liquidity in small to mid-cap companies. So sort of
understanding do the companies that have better
disclosure get more people willing to invest in them,
or is there any connection there? And I think that's
something really important for us to keep considering.
I'm going to -- section 72003 of the Fixing
America's Surface Transportation Act might be
surprising to you -- requires the Commission, in
consultation with the committee, this committee, and
the Investor Advisory Committee, to study the
disclosure requirements that are set forth in
Regulation S-K. And that's, to some degree, one of the

23

24

very much for your pro bono contributions. I want to

24

25

keep saying that, because I don't know if everybody

25

reasons we started this project, although I think the
Commission was focused on this pre-Congress.
The non-financial disclosure requirements -so the non-financial requirements of Reg S-K tell us
the story of each business. What level of disclosure
and information is needed to tell the story of a small
company in a way that will produce interest,
investment, market confidence and growth?
To date, much of the discussion about the
appropriate level of disclosure for smaller reporting
companies has focused on scaling or eliminating
disclosure. The cost of disclosure to smaller
companies is sometimes characterized as burdensome.
Yet the cost to smaller companies providing
insufficient or inadequate disclosure has been shown to
negatively impact the level investment in the company.
The liquidity of its shares and its growth.
So it's sort of understanding the benefits
that come from disclosure, because people are more
willing to invest because they understand what they're
investing in. And then, on the flip side, how can we
help the companies not have a burdensome, you know,
process? And I think we're in a new age here with
computers, and we need to be thinking differently about
what gets disclosed, when it gets disclosed, and in

4 (Pages 10 to 13)

Page 14
1

what form.
So today I want to encourage all of you to

Page 16
1

size, are widened. So, in a certain groups of stocks,

2

we are going up to a nickel difference, instead of a

3

address whether or not scaling benefits for smaller

3

penny. And what difference is that going to have? And

4

companies should be done at all points along their

4

we have sort of a -- and Mike might explain this, but

5

growth curve. The complete story behind a company

5

we have sort of three different categories that people

6

requires fulsome and accurate disclosure. And such

6

are going to be in for this pilot.

7

disclosure may be of critical importance to small

7

8

companies who are seeking a new following or competing

8

collection to examine whether or not, across our three

9

against similar companies.

9

test groups, the widening of the tick-size from a penny

10

to five cents for selected small-cap stocks will have

11

in a way that attracts investors? So rather than

11

an impact on trading, liquidity, and market quality.

12

focusing on scaling, which usually means making less,

12

This committee and others have theorized that this move

13

or eliminating disclosure, how could it be reformatted

13

may facilitate market-maker interests in trading in the

14

and structured so that it actually benefits small

14

smaller-cap stocks. They can make more money and lead

15

companies, it makes it easier for them to submit the

15

to greater research and analyst coverage of these

16

information, it's information people want?

16

small-cap stocks, and possibly enhance liquidity. They

17

will trade more often.

10

17

How can small companies get their stories out

The two-year pilot will focus on data

How can digital disclosure and modernization

18

versus elimination of disclosure uniquely assist

18

19

smaller companies in a cost-effective way? So again,

19

analytical assessment. Also, recognizing the myriad of

So I look forward to this data-driven

20

looking at both parts of this equation, we want people

20

issues that contribute to small company viability and

21

to invest. How do we best, you know, get that done?

21

growth, I hope that this committee collaborates with

22

Finally, the concept release on Reg S-K asked

22

our equity market structure and our investor advisory

23

commenters to consider whether our rules should provide

23

committees to continue contemplating the full range of

24

scaled disclosure to only a subset of smaller companies

24

issues that are impacting investment and smaller

25

that obey our securities laws, or that have achieved a

25

companies. Investor protection and confidence in

Page 15

Page 17

1

track record of disseminating quality information into

1

company growth -- I think each advisory committee is

2

the market over some period of time. What are your

2

looking at it from a different angle, and you would

3

thoughts on this?

3

benefit immensely from having some interaction with the

4

folks on the other committees.

4

So it might be, if you're a company that's

5

been sort of a good citizen, good at reporting, doing

5

6

everything you can, maybe that's when you get to kick

6

today, and I will pass it back to our chair, our co-

7

into the gifted program, you know, or something like

7

chairs. Are you guys vice chairs or co-chairs?

8

that, right?

9

The committee will also address the issue of

So, thank you. I look forward to the meeting

MR. GRAHAM: Whatever you want.
COMMISSIONER STEIN: Okay. I like the vice.

10

board diversity disclosure. Diverse boards and

10

The super-important people.

11

leadership are quintessential components of successful,

11

12

innovative, and adaptive companies. The link between

12

13

diverse boards and improved company performance has

13

14

been recognized repeatedly. Companies of all sizes

14

15

benefit from inclusionary and diverse viewpoints and

15

going to be discussing Regulation S-K. And I just

16

perspectives.

MR. GRAHAM: All right. That includes
everybody. Thank you, Commissioner.
And Sara, I will turn it over to you.
MS. HANKS: Okay. So, as was mentioned, we're

16

wanted to give a little bit of context about Regulation

17

Disclosure regarding the diversity of a board

17

S-K. Everybody on this table knows this, but maybe the

18

is also now material information that investors find

18

folks back out in webcast land don't.

19

important to their investment decisions. How can our

19

20

current disclosure rules be revised to better address

20

bedrock of disclosure. It is the repository of

21

and elicit information about board diversity?

21

disclosure requirements for registration statements,

22

ongoing disclosure by reporting companies. All of the

22

Finally, this afternoon you will discuss the

Reg S-K is not just a regulation. It is the

23

pilot program launched this past Monday, three days

23

various forms that are used by U.S. companies to

24

ago, which will examine the impact on smaller companies

24

register offerings or to comply with ongoing disclosure

25

if the minimum quoting and trading increments, or tick-

25

requirements point the companies to various bits of

5 (Pages 14 to 17)

Page 18

Page 20

1

Regulation S-K. So S-K is like the building blocks for

1

incredibly entertaining. It was about tyranny and

2

all of the disclosure that is made by reporting and

2

stuff.

3

registering companies.

3

So, I encourage you to go take a look at that.

4

But more importantly, there is an effort out there by

4

So, we are talking here not just about a

5

regulation, we are talking about the disclosure

5

the Commission to try and make this stuff make sense

6

regulation, everything that's not financial and

6

for the companies and for the investors, and we do have

7

everything that relates to U.S. companies.

7

an obligation to help them with this.

8
9

As Commissioner Stein mentioned, in December
2015 Congress passed a transportation bill, the FAST

8
9

In September 2015 the prior iteration of this
committee provided the Commission with recommendations

10

Act. And of course, being about transportation, it's

10

about expanding simplified disclosure for smaller

11

got to include some bits and pieces about securities.

11

issuers. And Julie, did we hand that out? So we've

12

One of those requires the Commission to carry out a

12

got that. We think that much of what's in there is

13

study of the requirements of Regulation S-K to

13

still very relevant. But I think we can have a broader

14

determine how best to modernize and simplify

14

conversation about how to improve disclosure in

15

disclosure.

15

general. And that's what we would like to do.

16

The statute says the Commission should

16

So, who would like to start with what's at the

17

emphasize a company-by-company approach without

17

top of the Eliminate This Requirement list? I know

18

boilerplate or static requirements, things that just --

18

you've all got one.

19

you put there and then you never change them, and

19

20

evaluate methods of information delivery and

20

looking at this from the standpoint, as Commissioner

21

presentation that discourage repetition and disclosure

21

Stein mentioned, you know, thinking in terms of the

22

of immaterial information.

22

scale of disclosure as what we can eliminate. I'm not

23

sure how good we've been at looking at it from the

23

The law requires the Commission to consult

MR. GRAHAM: You know, we've been used to

24

with this committee, as well as with our sister

24

standpoint of what disclosure is really necessary to

25

committee, the Investor Advisory Committee, and issue a

25

help enable a smaller company to succeed, and -- or

report of findings and recommendations to Congress.
As Commissioner Stein and I think others have
mentioned, this isn't the first time that the
Commission has focused on disclosure effectiveness,
however. There were provisions in the Jobs Act that
required a staff study on disclosure effectiveness
which was produced in 2015. There has been a concept
release, and there is a current set of proposals for
eliminating unnecessary disclosure.
People should go to the disclosure
effectiveness initiative page on the SEC's home page,
and you will find all of these various approaches being
there -- set out there. It seems like there haven't
been very many comments about the proposals for
eliminating unnecessary disclosure, and I would have
thought that this community especially would love to
add things to the proposals for elimination of
disclosure on its red meat to this committee.
And then also there is the more generalist
concept release, which has received a number of
comments, about 80 percent of which I think are off
topic and relate to the forthcoming disclosure,
potentially, on political contributions. I waded
through a lot of them, there is a lot of form stuff
there. But there was a poem which I thought was

Page 21

16

18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

looking at it more from the standpoint of how the
disclosure is made in order to reduce the burden.
Transparency is important. And so, I think,
you know, anything that works to eliminate transparency
in the context of material information is not helpful
in the long term. So I think it's important to think
in those terms.
I mean, obviously, you know, I think all of us
are used to, for example, reading in risk factors where
you take three pages to say one thing. You know,
that's -- I mean those old habits are kind of hard to
break. And I think there is a lack of courage on the
part of practitioners to kind of break with the mold,
if you will.
But understanding notwithstanding that we
have, you know, Regulation S-K and all the dictates, I
think the underlying principle continues to be what's
material, and ensuring that whatever is material is, in
fact, disclosed.
MR. YADLEY: There is obviously a lot there,
so I'll just mention a couple of things now, in
addition to endorsing our prior recommendations.
Materiality definitely is the starting point.
Principles-based disclosure can be more helpful for
smaller reporting companies, I think, than other

6 (Pages 18 to 21)

25

companies. And the idea of a company profile may go
hand in hand with that.
A lot of the disclosure, if you look at
numbers of pages contained in particularly proxy
statements, but throughout filings, has to do with the
infrastructure of the company. How does it work,
internally? And smaller reporting companies definitely
have a corporate governance structure, they have
committees, they're supposed to have committees. The
committees have charters, they have ways that they
nominate. And most of the time those are reflective of
what larger companies do, because that's the model.
But in many cases, smaller company boards have
half of the directors on each committee. The
committees are really not as important. So I think a
lot of things that are important to investors in a
general way don't need to be as specific for a smaller
company. So I believe guidance in a principles-based
fashion will help that.
I also think that we talked at a prior meeting
about whether we should have quarterly reports or -- as
opposed to less-frequent reports. I think quarterly
reports are a great idea, the market is accustomed to
them. Things change so quickly that I don't think we
should retreat from that.

But one of two things happens with smaller

Page 25
1

2

companies outside of the financial area: they either

2

3

spend too much time on matters that are really not that

3

4

material, or they don't spend any time at all. They

4

5

just update what they did before and they often don't

5

6

use outside counsel for quarterly reviews. So I think

6

7

some focus on what is material would be important. I

7

8

think that's enough for now.

8

9

In other words, more principles-based, less

9

10

structured, and taking the disclosure package as a

10

11

whole, rather than report by report.

11

12

MR. GRAHAM: Thanks, Greg.

12

13

MR. NELSON: I started to wade through the

13

14

350-page proposal for the expansion of the

14

15

simplification of reporting requirements.

15

16

(Laughter.)

16

17

MR. NELSON: And it occurred to me that -- I

17

18

think I'm a fairly smart guy, but it was taking me a

18

19

long time to wade through, page by page. Is there a

19

20

way -- and I was looking for -- I think the Obama

20

21

Administration in 2010 actually asked for a requirement

21

22

that these things be in plain English, or that

22

23

documents that we're actually requiring people to comply

23

24

with were in plain English.

24

25

And I think -- and I immediately thought about

what Ryan said last session was that they fairly have
-- have fairly limited reporting on their company, but
it still costs them about $3 million a year, roughly.
And he said, like, our documentation doesn't really
change from year to year or from quarter to quarter.
I am wondering if there is a way -- and my
guess is that a lot of those costs are in accounting,
but also in legal fees. So I would argue that, if
these requirements could be in plain English, perhaps
CEOs or officers or directors of the companies could
actually do some of this reporting without having to
hire -- nothing against lawyers; I love them. But
sometimes costs, when you get -- pay them an hourly
basis, it's not necessarily in a law firm's best interest
to work on simplifying and making things easy and
simple to understand. It actually kind of benefits, a
more prolonged and more thorough evaluation and
discussion and reporting.
MR. GRAHAM: Forgive me if I take your love
for lawyers as insincere.
(Laughter.)
MR. NELSON: I really do. I have a number of
friends who are lawyers.
MR. GRAHAM: Patrick?
MR. REARDON: Thank you. I have a few

25

thoughts. I filed a comment letter, so that's on file,
and I will vary from what I've done in the past and I
will repeat some of what is there, just for the sake of
the group.
I think the first question you have to ask
yourself is, who is the consumer of the information? I
think, for a long time, we have assumed that there is
fundamental analysis going on, and that we have to have
levels of disclosure, that are what we've done in the
past. And while we've supplemented and increased the
burden, I don't think we've taken a look at that.
I think Commissioner Stein has hinted that
maybe that's something we need to think about, is that
the trader on Wall Street who needs all of this
information? Or if your company trades -- and most of
the investors are small investors that are noninstitutional -- maybe they do need that information.
But I think an assumption that one size fits all is
perhaps wrong. Maybe I'm over-complicating things.
But I would like to know.
And I had a conversation with the CEO and the
chief legal counsel last week of a public company, and
it's bigger than one of the companies -- than any of
the companies we deal with, but it hasn't been there
that long. And there is this difference between what

they get asked about by the analysts and what we have
in the disclosures. I mean I will just tell you that
one of the things that they complain about is the
restrictions on disclosure of non-GAAP measures, that
-- they say that the analysts are the ones pushing for
that, that they are not pushing it out there to the
analysts, it's the analysts who are asking for it.
So, I mean, I think somebody -- and certainly,
you know, I have no answer to the question, and it's
easy to ask a question if you don't purport to have the
answer -- but who is the consumer, and who are we
writing to? And is all of this stuff needed?
On principles-based disclosure, I embrace the
concept of principles-based disclosure. I think it's
one of the reasons that private placements are
attractive, is that you don't have to -- you don't have
a checklist kind of disclosure. You can sit down with
a client and say at the end of the day, "Okay, what did
I miss?" And you can ask questions that lead to this.
But if it's not material, then you can
conclude that you don't need to put it in there. Or
you can abbreviate it. Compensation, for example, and
the pages and pages of compensation disclosure, is an
example of where -- that I think, you know, you could
you use principles-based disclosure.

Page 28

you up at night?" and "What are you proud of?" or,

2

"What are you least proud of?" but those kinds of

3

things. But not last year's mark-up.

4

I think the use of the summary -- I asked

5

another executive about all this, and it was the point

6

at which we were talking about summaries and 10-Ks. And

7

his comment was, "That's all I'm going to read." And

8

if you take that in this context -- well, I think,

9

first of all, there ought to be some sort of mechanism

10

where you put things in the summary and expand the

11

summary, and things that are said in the summary don't

12

have to be said again in the full exposition on the

13

various topics covered in the summary. It's easy, as

14

lawyers, to just simply repeat everything you said in

15

the summary. And that's a common client criticism is

16

you say it two and three times.

17

have it in the summary, knowing that some readers are

19

only going to read the summary, then not to make the

20

summary 40 pages long, but to make the summary a

21

summary, and then to the extent you can -- and

22

sometimes you need to lay the predicate back in the

23

back with a lengthier disclosure -- you repeat some of

24

it. But if you could do that so that things are only

25

said once, such as in the back, saying, "Hey, go read

Page 27
1

Now, I will tell you that, having represented

Page 29
1

2

little companies, that principles-based disclosure will

2

3

lead you to unscrupulous executives who will argue that

3

4

the fact that the company has two weeks of cash in the

4

5

bank and they're going to go broke after that, that

5

6

disclosure is not material. Okay? So you have that

6

7

problem. I'm not sure that it's -- they wouldn't argue

7

8

the same if you had a checklist. But, you know, you

8

9

will run into that, and I think it's inevitable that

9

you do. But I favor principles-based disclosure.

10

10
11

Also, I think that the -- and what Keith was

11

12

saying about, you know, that we don't really think

12

13

about what we are doing, one of the things I have seen

13

14

on reports is, well, let's mark up last year's 10-K and

14

15

we'll get that over to you. And nobody takes a fresh

15

16

look at it. And I've actually taken over for another

16

17

company that just marked it up for years and years, and

17

18

more or less threw it away and started with a blank

18

19

sheet of paper. And that gets some resistance. But

19

20

there is a point at which it's more than just the mark-

20

21

up, and you have to ask what is material.

21

22

And I think the MD&A and the guidance on MD&A

I think the summary, if there is a way to just

18

22

23

is good in that regard. It's just pushing people to

23

24

look at that and say, okay, what's important now? And

24

25

you can start by asking the CEO and CFO, "What keeps

25

the summary under so-and-so first, before you read
this," it would help. It would cut down on the length.
I think compensation is -- beat that horse too
much, and that needs to be condensed. I mean people
are entitled to know what the CEO is getting, but I
think we've taken that too far.
Political contributions, I think the people in
the front office of the investment firms are interested
in that. I'm not so sure that the analysts are
interested in that. I don't know if you care, one way
or the other, as long as somebody at the investor is
asking for it. Then maybe you have to put it in. But
you know, if we want to regulate political
contributions, there are other methods of doing that.
But to me, that's the purpose of political
contributions, is regulating that.
And finally, in the -- in my comment letter, I
think that the Commission, for its own purposes, should
require each reporting company to include in its 10-K
its annual routine '34 Act compliance costs. It
doesn't have to be with great precision, because
they're allocations, but plus or minus five percent.
And have it certified. And the reason for that is
that's going to give you an instant benchmark on what
it costs to be a public company. And you may not like

the number. Keep scowling over there, like I said the
most horrible thing in the world.
But, you know, how much does it cost? And the
way I'd present it, because you're going to get some
pushback for one more thing, is this is so we can see
what we're doing to you, and what your costs are,
because we need to be able to compare. But I think
that would be useful information, and it might be
surprising. And then you wouldn't just have anecdotal
comments of, "It cost my company this to do it." And I
don't think there is any disclosure like that at
present.
Those are my comments.
MR. GRAHAM: Okay -MS. HANKS: Steve?
MR. GRAHAM: Yeah, please.
MS. HANKS: Could I just mention? One thing I
just wanted to bring up, because I'm not sure that the
watching audience understands this in general.
A few people have talked about principlesbased disclosure. And I sometimes come across young
lawyers or foreign lawyers who say, "Well, in the
United States there is this requirement that you
disclose all material things about your company." And
that's not actually the way that the securities laws

Page 32
1

members who is the former dean of the engineering

2

school at a major university chided me for not knowing

3

the definition, and pointed me to it. And when I read

4

it, all I knew is that I had gotten it wrong, that I

5

didn't know what it meant.

6

So, I think principles-based, Sara is

7

absolutely right. But I think, when we've been talking

8

about it colloquially, it's been more issues-based with

9

the materiality standard attached.

10
11

MR. GRAHAM: Laura?
MS. YAMANAKA: I'm just going to make a couple

12

of comments on my observations on the types and the

13

size of clients that I deal with, and actually how

14

people in my world look at these kinds of reports.

15

So, I agree with the comments of reducing all

16

the boilerplate or redundancy, because I think if

17

you're a sophisticated investor -- and I hate to say

18

what people do when they really review it. Nowadays

19

it's great, it's out there so you can eliminate

20

everything that's the same as last year and just pull

21

up what's different for this year, which then makes it

22

quite manageable if you are knowledgeable about the

23

company and you're routinely looking at that.

24
25

But then I question how much does it cost to
actually keep all the boilerplate that people aren't

Page 31
1
2

work.
It might be a distinction without a

Page 33
1

looking at routinely. And I say that, routine, as a

2

qualifier. Because if you're -- if this is the first

3

difference, but what we have is a required disclosure

3

time you're looking at it, then you need all that

4

that you, A, you don't -- you must make these

4

information.

5

disclosures, all the stuff in the Reg S-K that I

5

6

mentioned; you must not make any misleading statement;

6

there about having a repository of information that

7

and you must not omit anything necessary to make what

7

doesn't change for -- my words, not technical terms,

8

you've already said not misleading. That is not the

8

right? That you can go to so that you can understand

9

same as requiring all material information to be

9

the basic structure for organization reporting

10
11

disclosed.
And that makes us different than some other

So I think there's been some comments out

10

committees that smaller companies may or may not really

11

comply with as completely as, you know, sophisticated,

12

jurisdictions. And I think that we have to keep that

12

publicly-traded companies. But at least it's there,

13

in mind when we're talking about principles-based

13

and you can focus on the things that are changing.

14

disclosure, because principles-based disclosure would,

14

15

in fact, be, "Tell us everything material, and leave

15

companies and the investors that they track typically,

16

out the stuff that's not material."

16

it's not somebody off the street, right, "Give me your

17

prospectus and let me take a look at it." It's

18

probably somebody that they know about, they've known

19

about the company, they know other information that's
not commonly known by the public.

17
18
19

Just checking to make sure that nobody is
disagreeing with me at that end of the table.
MR. YADLEY: Yeah, I don't disagree with you,

And then I talk about the -- for small

20

but -- and I do agree with you on what the standard is

20

21

for disclosure. But I think when many people are using

21

And so, that reporting formalizes the

22

it, it's in contrast to very prescriptive, structured

22

information that they actually really know of the

23

disclosure. So we should always be precise.

23

company: the people who are running it, maybe the

24

product, maybe they've been tracking the trend of the

25

development. I see Brian shaking his head, but I think

24
25

I did some audit committee minutes and used
the word "exponential," and one of the committee

that, in reality, is how it works.
So, if -- to the comments of knowing the
consumer of the information, I -- although it is making
it more complicated, I think, to segment this out, in
reality that's what I think people are looking at.
Materiality, I'm going to make a very
controversial statement here, and I'm going to lump it
in with non-GAAP disclosures. That's where I think you
get the meat. All -- you know, when you really look at
reports, and you compare them, if they all look the
same the material things are going to be okay,
whatever. You really -- the gotchas that I think that
everybody has ever, in my experience, been generated in
my world, is the non-material.
I am going to give you an example. There is a
company that -- they were looking at, you know, who
ever looks at deposits, right, unless you're into that
business. Deposits -- always small, it's always like,
you know, rent deposits or something. It always kind
of stays the same. And I remember looking at some
financials. It's been very consistent. And all the
sudden it spiked up. Wasn't material, you know, but it
was just kind of wow, maybe they got a new building,
maybe they're -- you know, whatever.
Well, it turns out that they had changed --

Page 36
1
2

because they know the financials are rearview driving.
So it's a very sticky wicket, it's different

3

from -- for each company. It is very unauditable many

4

times. But that's the kind of underground information

5

that I think that the people who are really good at

6

investing are looking at.

7

MR. GRAHAM: And, you know, I think it's clear

8

that one size doesn't fit all. And I think one way to

9

address this is to kind of head into the principles-

10

based system, if you will. But I -- and I think that

11

your example kind of underscores that, because maybe

12

what you are looking at, what you have identified, is

13

something "small." But maybe in the context of that

14

particular business, it was material.

15
16

Oh, Annemarie?
MS. TIERNEY: So before I express my views, I

17

will give my own disclaimer, which was my first job out

18

of law school was with corpfin, so I love disclosure.

19

I'm a big fan of disclosure, and I think disclosure is

20

necessary.

21

But I've had two other jobs, I think, that

22

give me a slightly different perspective on disclosure.

23

One was the general counsel of a small, publicly-traded

24

company. It was a broker-dealer, and it was NASDAQ

25

listed, and we made, I don't know, maybe 125 million to

Page 35

17

21

25

they were thinking about changing the course of their
business. They were going out and committing to buy
all these properties. They really hadn't committed to
change the approach or to expand the approach of the
business. Maybe it should have been disclosed
elsewhere. But since it was in pilot stage, and they
really weren't sure if they were going to do it yet,
they didn't feel it was -- that they had to disclose
it.
On the other hand, if you looked at the
agreements, it's like, wow, they're on the hook for all
of this stuff, and that next quarter it could
significantly change if they pull the trigger.
So, sometimes it's the small things that pick
-- that I think reveal things. Also non-GAAP, I
totally understand why the investors or the analysts
want that information, because we found that when we
deal with CEOs, presidents, business owners, if they
are really good at what they're doing, they don't wait
until the financials to get the information and know
where they're at. They've got early warning
indicators. They have certain metrics that identify
are we okay, are we on track, how are we doing, and
that's what they use to run their business and monitor
their business, and the analysts want to know that,

Page 37
1

150 million a year, and we spent 2 to 3 million a year

2

on disclosure. That was very disproportionate for our

3

company.

4

But there are a few things to keep in mind.

5

The disclosure requirements, you don't want to be

6

outside the box because that leads to litigation risk

7

and your board is terrified of doing something

8

different because they don't want to get sued. So we

9

had a lot of, you know, staying in a typical disclosure

10

structure with typical disclosure, good disclosure. We

11

had excellent outside counsel, we had excellent

12

accountants. But my team spent half of our year on

13

disclosure, and that's four or five people plus our CFO

14

and our controllers. So there is a lot of focus in a

15

very small company on mandated disclosure and meeting

16

the disclosure requirements.

17

I agree with Patrick. I was at the New York

18

Stock Exchange when the CD&A requirements were adopted.

19

That's just as we were going public. And that is a

20

increasing creeping disclosure requirement that I think

21

is outsized to the actual benefits that it gives to

22

investors. And I think, Commissioner Stein, you asked

23

the question, like, "Who is reading the disclosure?"

24
25

So, when I was -- NYFIX was the name of the
public company I was the general counsel of. We did a

big revamp of our proxy statement. We tried to make it
really user-friendly. We upgraded everything. I was
really proud of the result. We were really proud of
the result. We sent it out into the, you know, ethos,
and I feel like nobody read it.
And so, you do the effort, right, and we
didn't have big institutional investors watching us, we
had a lot of little investors through human beings.
Maybe they read the proxy, maybe they didn't. But you
felt like you put your heart and soul into something,
and then there wasn't the interest in reading it.
And another thing that you said that I think
is very important is how are people reading
information? If you look at the demise of, you know,
hard newspapers and hard -- you know, any publications
and hard copy, people today -- investors today, they
want sound bytes, they want short and sweet. They want
to be able to look at a summary; they're not going to
read a 200-page 10-K. They're not going to read a 150page proxy statement. They're not going to read more
than summary.
So, you are mandating a disclosure -- and I
understand so much of it is congressionally required,
so the SEC does not have as much bandwidth to actually
change or decrease disclosure potentially than maybe

Page 40
1

for small companies, a lot of the disclosure is too

2

much for even mid-sized companies. But at least it's a

3

place to start. Thank you.

4
5

MR. GRAHAM: Thank you. Xavier?
MR. GUTIERREZ: So, I wanted to make a couple

6

of comments. First, I did also want to reiterate

7

support for the previous recommendation. In

8

particular, the increasing of the size of the companies

9

that we're talking about. I thought that was very

10
11

important.
I also wanted to make another comment that I

12

left last meeting really shocked at Brian's comment of

13

how much they were spending, and it really got to me in

14

terms of, you know, the burden on these smaller

15

companies. And, you know, echoing a little bit of what

16

Annemarie said, I run a privately-held investment firm.

17

And we look at investments all day long. And we get to

18

the materials that are important to us very quickly,

19

without the reams of information that are compared to

20

when we look at a publicly-traded company.

21

So, the information can be distributed in a

22

way that's accessible without being burdened. And the

23

private to public sort of analysis shows that. So to

24

me, when I thought about, okay, if I was going to

25

invest in Brian's company that was privately held, the

Page 39

Page 41

1

you probably want to, but I just think that we've gone

1

amount of information I would get is much more concise,

2

to a point where disclosure requirements are outsized

2

and much more accessible than, quite frankly, if -- it

3

for most companies. Not even just small reporting

3

being a publicly-traded company. And so, that is

4

companies, but I think most companies.

4

something that I think we need to take into

5

consideration when we're looking at what is important.

5

The next job that I had was the general

6

counsel of a private company, and it was, like, Nirvana

6

7

and fantasy La-La Land, and I'm, like, wait, what? I

7

executive -- of a compensation committee of a public

As the -- skipping topics, as the chair of an

8

don't have to do any of these things? Now, we were

8

company, I wanted to reiterate something that Patrick

9

very focused on disclosure to our investors, who spent

9

said, which is I think I was really, really shocked at

10

a lot of time on presentations, investment

10

the amount of information that we were having to

11

presentations and things like that. Disclosure was

11

provide on the compensation plan. And I felt that it

12

sensible, it was suitable for our company, it was risk,

12

could have been easily distributed in a much more

13

you know, thoughtful.

13

concise manner and getting to the point of exactly what

14

we were paying people and why we were paying them. And

14

But it really was, I think, an extremely good

15

example of why you see so many companies staying

15

I didn't need 20 or 30 pages from a very highly-paid

16

private these days. You can be a very successful

16

executive compensation consultant to compare to a peer

17

company, large -- we see, you know, hundred-something-

17

group that, quite frankly, was ever changing. And to

18

plus unicorns, a growing number of decacorns. You

18

me, for a small company that was a $250 million market

19

could be a really successful company without stepping

19

cap company, that executive compensation plan could

20

into this disclosure structure, which is, again,

20

have been explained in a much faster, more discernable

21

constrictive, not necessarily helpful to your

21

fashion.

22

investors, and extraordinarily costly. So, I'm really

22

So, those are my comments.

23

glad that the SEC and our committee is able to give

23

MR. GRAHAM: Okay, thank you. Brian?

24

thoughtful feedback.

24

25

I think a lot of the disclosure is outsized

25

MR. HAHN: I would like to just follow up on a
few of these points.

11 (Pages 38 to 41)

Page 42

Page 44

1

So, just two areas, you know, talking about

1

2

marking up a 10-K versus starting new each year. You

2

3

have way too many cooks in the kitchen to start new

3

4

every year. You've got to get through management,

4

5

audit committee, board input, lawyers, accountants.

5

6

So, you know, when preparing for the IPO with the S-1,

6

7

it took weeks of drafting sessions just to get through

7

8

all the input. So even with a markup each year, it

8

9

still takes weeks to get through that.

10

9

The other point I wanted to bring up, too, was

10

11

on risk factors. So when we were going public, there

11

12

was kind of a running joke between company counsel and

12

13

underwriter's counsel on who could have longer risk

13

14

factors. So I just pulled up our last 10-K. We had

14

15

close to 30 pages of risk factors. And being in an

15

16

industry -- you know, drug development is risky enough,

16

17

you know, I don't think it takes an investor 30 pages

17

18

worth of materials to understand that there's a lot of

18

19

risk involved.

19

20
21

So, I think that, you know, areas like that we

20
21

could definitely shrink down.

22

22

MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Patrick?

23

MR. REARDON: Obviously, I was not clear. I

24

don't mean you start with a clean sheet every year.

25

But I do think that if you put the document aside from

23
24
25

there, because you're so involved in Reg A-plus.
But, you know, what we're hearing is our
investors are very happy and comfortable with that
level of disclosure, and they're happy and comfortable
with the format. So I think we could probably learn
some good lessons over time about potential alternative
purchase disclosure from that structure.
MS. HANKS: Yeah, I can throw in a story from
the coalface, as it were, and then I think we've got
Jonathan also with a comment there.
With respect to Reg A-plus, I mean, one of the
things that we've been trying to do is just focus on
the things that investors really, really need to know,
not that a meteor might strike the earth, and you do
not need three risk factors explaining the impact of
the meteor striking the earth, and -- you know.
And we've actually had a couple of debates in
the last couple of weeks where we have had traditional
counsel, company counsel that we're interacting with,
where the traditional company counsel have taken the
drafting that we've done in our standard Reg A way and
said, "Hmm, I think we need another five or six risk
factors on this. And, by the way, if we were doing
this under an S-1, we would also have this disclosure."
And we go, "This isn't an S-1, it's different.

the prior year and you sit down with the CEO and the
CFO and say, "All right, what's important from the
period we're reporting on, and what's important right
now," that that's a good start, and then go back to the
document that you filed before.
I hear often as an excuse -- which I don't
spend much time listening to -- is, "We've never done
it before." And, you know, so we're going to break the
mold. But anyway, I understand, and you're right. I
mean you can't afford the cost of drafting de novo
every year something like that, it's prohibitive. I
just -- I don't want to get down -- I don't want to
look at the trees before I've looked at the forest.
MR. GRAHAM: Okay. We have not heard from
everyone. Does anyone else want to comment?
Annemarie?
MS. TIERNEY: I have one more thought. I
think, you know, what's going to be really interesting
is the Reg A-plus disclosure scheme and get a sense of,
you know, how investors are reacting to that. Are they
comfortable with that type of disclosure? Are they
comfortable with that level of disclosure? I think
that that was pretty thoughtful and forward-thinking in
the way it was structured, so I'd love to know, you
know, sort of as -- maybe Sara has some experience

Page 45
1

It's focused on a completely different thing."

2

And so I think there is a mindset here in the

3

established law firm market, where they go, "We're not

4

going to -- it's ridiculous to have something that's

5

only 20 pages long. You need something longer there,

6

you need more words. More words are going to help

7

you." And that's not true. What is going to help you

8

is disclosure that is read and understood.
And we keep going back to the informed

9
10

investment decision. Are you giving the material

11

information necessary in order to make an informed

12

investment decision? And that really should be the

13

starting point, as a couple of people have pointed out.

14

Look at who is reading this, and make sure that they do

15

actually read it. Because I can guarantee you young

16

investors do not read 20 pages of risk factors.
Jonathan?

17

MR. GRAHAM: Greg, are we going to stand for

18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

that?
(Laughter.)
MS. HANKS: And I speak as a former
established law firm partner.
(Laughter.)
MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Someone else had a comment
over here? Jonathan?

MR. NELSON: Anyone but me.
MR. GRAHAM: Okay.
MR. NELSON: One of the things that I had -we just had a liquidity conference in Silicon Valley a
couple of weeks ago, and we had one of the general
partners of Saints Capital, which is one of the primary
providers of secondary liquidity in Silicon Valley, and
he was talking about a -- how many fewer public
companies there are now, as opposed to 30 years ago.
It's about 50 percent. And it's not just in the United
States, it's also across other markets, like Japan and
Brazil, Mexico.
And he also talked about the number of very
large $1 billion, $10 billion companies, you know,
unicorns, decacorns, that are actually public. And he
said, "It's, frankly, a very competitive advantage to
these companies not to actually have to file and not to
disclose." And he said, "Frankly, I'm making a ton of
money on this because, you know, I know all of these
people and I can get into these deals. But private
investors, the smaller investor, doesn't have access to
these kinds of deals. And so they're actually not able
to make the money that investors on the private side
have been able to make."
And, you know, I am also doing research. The

Page 48
1

MR. GRAHAM: Thank you.

2

Laura?

3

MS. YAMANAKA: I just wanted to comment on

4

what Sara just said, and the significance of what she

5

just said. Right?

6

So here is Sara. She's got some chops, right?

7

She's got some credibility. And it takes you to go up

8

against counsel and attorneys to add that in. So my

9

clients, the people that I know, they're just doing

10

whatever they're told. If somebody wants an additional

11

disclosure in there, it's not fighting not to get the

12

disclosure, it is, "Does anybody object to the

13

wording," you know?

14

And so, that's how it just layers on and

15

layers on. It's like one time I ask them, "What is all

16

this stuff," right?

17

And they go, "Oh, the attorneys said that we

18

needed to do it." I go, "Do you understand it?

19

Because I will just tell you I don't." Right?

20

And they go, "No, but the attorneys said we

21

needed it. And if we go back around, it's going to

22

cost us, you know, $750 for somebody to explain it to

23

us, and they do it all the time, so let's just leave it

24

in. We'll deal with it later."

25

So, next time comes around, and I'm like,

Yale Endowment, you know, they're -- 30 to 40 percent
of their capital goes into private placements,
alternatives, private equities. And they usually
estimate that they're going to do about 20 percent,
year over year, which is another 10 percent on top of
what an index would do on the public markets.
And so, I think that there is a lot more money
to be made for investors on the private side, where
disclosures are much smaller. The standard for one of
our portfolio companies you go for a Series A is a 10page deck and then due diligence, like, you know, a
page of web analytics and a page -- you know, access to
the QuickBooks account.
And a lot of million-dollar investments are
actually made on those terms. And a lot of it is
relationship-based. And I understand that public
markets are much different. But it just seems like -one of the things that Ken mentioned was could we
actually start asking, and he said, "People are going
to hate me for saying this: Could we actually start
asking non-public companies, if they reach a market cap
of over $10 million, maybe they should start filing
too, just to kind of level the playing field?"
I am not going to agree or disagree with that.
I thought it was very interesting, though.

Page 49
1

"It's still in here. Does anybody know what this

2

means?"

3

And they go, "No. But if -- they just put it

4

in. If we ask to change any of the pre-existing

5

wordage, verbiage, it's going to cost us $950," you

6

know, price went up.

7
8
9

(Laughter.)
MS. YAMANAKA: And so they just do that. So I
just want to make the comment that, again, if Sara is

10

having to do that, then, you know, all these small

11

little companies have no chance.

12
13
14
15
16
17

Brian is laughing. Did that happen to you?
MR. GRAHAM: That -- those kinds of examples
are out there.
MS. KASSAN: I just have a question for
Annemarie.
You mentioned the multi-million-dollar

18

disclosure costs, and it is a -- it was a broker-

19

dealer. So I was just wondering how much of those

20

costs were related to being a broker-dealer versus

21

being a public company.

22

MS. TIERNEY: None of them.

23

MS. KASSAN: Okay.

24
25

MS. TIERNEY: Those were just public company
costs. Yeah. Broker-dealer costs were a separate

13 (Pages 46 to 49)

Page 50
1

bucket of delightful money.

Page 52
1

But it is hard, and it will take time to sit

2

MR. GRAHAM: Sara?

2

down and go through what the disclosure has been, why

3

MS. HANKS: You know, I was just going to sort

3

is it there, what should we be talking about, and that
will involve the CEO and the CFO and a lot of
management people.

4

of build on what Laura said here. I mean, to a certain

4

5

extent, what we're dealing with is not a problem with

5

6

the regulations themselves, it is the interpretation of

6

7

those regulations. My people, who are incentivized,

7

they just punt and say, you know, "We don't really have

8

who spend a lot of time interpreting them. And

8

time for that." And if they trust their lawyers, and

9

so, fixing the regulations is not necessarily going to

9

their lawyers are being practical -- I don't think the

10

lawyers are trying to make it more burdensome. But

11

MR. GRAHAM: Fair comment.

11

there will, as a result, be a lot of things that are in

12

Greg?

12

the disclosure package that haven't changed because

13

MR. YADLEY: Yeah, I almost don't want to

13

nobody has pointed them out as obsolete, they haven't

10

completely fix the cost of regulation.

And I think Laura is right. A lot of times

14

enter the debate, but -- because I agree with what

14

been a problem, the client doesn't really want the

15

everybody said. But it is a little more complicated

15

lawyer to be taking up their time, talking about

16

than that.

16

immaterial things.

17

The comment was made that the public markets

17

18

are different. They sure are. Anybody who is invested

18

And some of the thoughts that have been expressed today

It doesn't mean we shouldn't address these.

19

in a private equity deal doesn't get anywhere near the

19

I think would at least lead companies and their

20

type of information that a public company presents.

20

advisors to sit down and take a fresh look, and we

21

Compensation, that's been mentioned.

21

should encourage that.

22

Investors in private equity deals, they don't

22

MR. GRAHAM: Thank you, Greg. Anyone else?

23

know what people make. They rely on the sponsor, and

23

Patrick?

24

the sponsor has a reputation, and that's what they care

24

25

about, because they want to make the kind of returns

25

MR. REARDON: I'm old enough to remember when
Form S-3 was adopted. Keith, you may not remember

that Jonathan mentioned for their investors because
they get paid a lot, and they're going to have the next
fund. And it doesn't always work, because some of
those people aren't as smart as they think they are,
and some of them are not as honest as we hope they
would be. But that's a different system.
So one of the things that people take for
granted today that didn't occur 20 years ago was
independent boards. So we do now have mostly
independent boards, and that is a protection and a new
regime. But I don't think that, in real life, an
independent board is quite the same as a private equity
sponsor that's watching things.
There is that tension with all companies, and
particularly smaller companies, when it comes time to
make disclosure about how much time are we going to
spend, how -- can we sit down and give things a fresh
look. And I think, sure, there are lawyers who like
hourly rates. Otherwise, we wouldn't still have them
as much as we do. But, by and large, I think
securities lawyers, as a group, have other work they
could be doing, and it would be much more interesting
work and lucrative work, like raising money, helping
companies raise capital. So that's a great mandate of
this committee.

Page 53
1

that. Do you remember it?

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. REARDON: No? Okay. Well, I may be the

4

only one here. But I remember then that there was a

5

cry that the sky is falling, and it took a while for

6

everybody to get on board.

7

But if you shorten this stuff and one company

8

in the sector gets the size right, then next year --

9

well, XYZ had a third of what we've got here, why do we

10

have to do that? And the competitive forces of what

11

other people are doing will drive, ultimately, the

12

issuers to shorten their disclosures, because they do

13

not want to increase their compliance costs.

14

I mean SEC filing costs don't make you any

15

money directly. I mean they do, in that people have

16

confidence in your financials and things like that.

17

But they're indirect, and -- rather than direct. So

18

they'd rather put the money into making widgets, or

19

doing whatever they do.

20

MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Good thoughts. I

21

appreciate everyone's comments. We will give it some

22

thought and -- as to what a recommendation might look

23

like, and get back to the committee on that.

24
25

Okay. Next topic, board diversity. We would
like to discuss, one, the premise that there is a

14 (Pages 50 to 53)

correlation between a corporation's level of success
and board diversity; and, two, assuming that to be the
case, how might the SEC encourage rate of diversity
through its disclosure requirements.
We are pleased to have joining us today an
expert who has done a lot of research in this area.
But before we turn to her, Betsy Murphy of the division
of corporation finance is going to give us a brief
background.
As on many corporate governance issues, the
SEC's role here is focused on disclosure. In 2009 the
Commission adopted a rule requiring companies to
disclose whether and, if so, how the director and
nominating committees consider diversity. And, if they
have a policy on diversity, how its effectiveness is
assessed.
The disclosure requirement, as I think you all
know is soft. Diversity is not defined, which means
that the regulation hasn't been as helpful in
generating useful information. So what does diversity
mean? It means diversity of thought, experience, et
cetera. It also means gender and ethnic diversity.
We can argue about the inability to define
diversity with precision, but that may be just
something of a head fake, and a means to shift focus

Page 56
1

formal diversity policy. And, as a result, there is

3

very little disclosure on how companies are assessing

4

the effectiveness of their policies. A recent GAO

5

study indicated that only 8 of the S&P 100 companies

6

disclosed the existence of a diversity policy during

7

the period from 2010 to 2013.

19

21
22
23
24
25

away from the absence of gender and ethnic diversity.
It's -- that then makes it convenient for some to
suggest that this whole area is something that
represents an incursion in a social policy and beyond
the SEC's mission.
The definition doesn't have to be exclusive.
And moreover, it's disclosure, and it's not a mandate.
So, with that, we will turn it over to Betsy
to explain more.
MS. MURPHY: Thanks, Steve. In 2009 the
Commission adopted a rule requiring companies to
disclosure in their proxy statements whether diversity
is considered in identifying nominees. And, if so,
how. And if the company has a policy on diversity, how
the policy is implemented and assessed.
The rule does not define diversity, as Steve
mentioned, and left it to companies to say what they
mean by diversity in their policies and disclosures.
Therefore, companies' definitions of diversity differ
greatly, and they cover such attributes as business,
financial, accounting experience, risk management,
legal, government, and other relevant expertise. And
sometimes we'll see disclosure about the age of the
directors, nominees, the length of board tenure, and
also race, gender, and ethnicity.

So, while some companies voluntarily provide
more useful disclosure, most companies' disclosures on

10

board diversity under the current requirements haven't

11

changed too much since the 2009 adoption.

12

I will talk a little bit about some of the

13

statistics we've seen. We've reviewed some information

14

indicating that minority directors on the boards of the

15

top 200 companies in the S&P 500 have remained at about

16

a 15 percent level for the last several years. And the

17

percentage of these companies with at least 1 minority

18

director actually declined from 90 percent in 2005 to

19

86 percent in 2015.

20

In addition, the GAO has estimated that it

21

could take more than 40 years for women's

22

representation on boards to be on par with men's. And

23

we also have reviewed a 2016 article that indicates the

24

lack of gender diversity as especially severe in

25

smaller firms. The article indicated that 37 percent

Page 55
1

Unfortunately, few companies have disclosed a

of the firms in the S&P 600 small cap index have no
women directors, and that compared with 21 percent for
the S&P 400 mid cap index, and 7 percent for the S&P
500.
Not surprisingly, some investors have been
pushing for more robust disclosure. To respond to
these issues, Chair White directed the staff to review
the current diversity disclosure rule and the extent
and quality of disclosure that have followed, with an
eye toward revising the rule if we thought that was
warranted.
So, Corpfin staff informally sampled diversity
disclosure in companies' 2015 and 2016 proxy
statements, and so they were looking at 120 companies
of varying size and industry focus. In general, we
observed that disclosures are clear about whether a
company considers diversity in the selection of board
nominees, but less clear about how they go about doing
that.
For most companies in the sample, their
disclosures didn't change much from 2015 to 2016. But
if you expanded the 2016 disclosure to explain what
they meant by diversity -- and they also -- many
included depictions in the form of pie charts,
spirographs, and matrices to show their situation.

15 (Pages 54 to 57)

Page 58

In September, Chair White directed the --

2

announced that the staff is preparing a recommendation

2

3

to the Commission to amend the rule to require more

3

4

specificity, including information on the race, gender,

4

5

and ethnicity of board members and nominees. Like you,

5

6

we are very interested to hear more on this topic.

7
8

So, I will turn it back to the co-chairs to

8

introduce our guest speaker.
MR. GRAHAM: Thank you, Betsy. And now we're

9

10

pleased to have the Honorable Cari M. Dominguez from

10

11

the National Association of Corporate Directors join

11

12

us. You may have seen in the original agenda that

12

13

experts from McKenzie and Company were also going to

13

14

present on their research, but now they're unable to be

14

15

here. Fortunately, Cari is quite experienced and

15

16

knowledgeable on the topic.

16

17

17

Cari joins us in her capacity as the director of

18

the National Association of Corporate Directors, a non-

19

profit dedicated to advancing boardroom leadership.

20

She was the twelfth chair of the U.S. Equal Employment

21

Opportunity Commission, serving in that role from 2001

22

to 2006. She currently serves as a corporate director

23

of Manpower Group and SSS Management Corp, both NYSE-

24

listed public companies, and as a trustee of the

25

Calvert SAGE Fund.

18
19

21
22
23

25

do we get -- forget about capital markets if we don't
have the right human capital, and that human capital is
coming from very diverse sources.
So it's important that, in terms of
disclosure, as individuals make voting decisions and
informed decisions, that there is a growing interest in
the quality of the talent, not just in terms of the
skill sets, but also in terms of the consumers, the
shareholders that are reflected at that level of
leadership.
So this morning I'd like to share with you the
findings and recommendations that are contained in our
blue ribbon commission report that's entitled, "The
Diverse Board: Moving From Interest to Action." And
the thing is we've talked a lot about diversity over
the last several decades, but not that long ago I read
an article that came out in -- I believe it was USA
Today, it was a survey that asked employees, "Do your
companies practice diversity as much as they say they
do?"
Well, a whopping 22 percent said yes. And an
even more whopping 78 percent said no. So I think we
still have a ways to go, and I really think it's a
critical component, not only of board leadership, but
of governance. And those trends haven't really

14

pleasure for me, on behalf of NACD, to talk about a

14

15

subject that's very dear and near to our heart, and

15

about diversity, not just at a specific session, but

16

that's board diversity and corporate diversity. And

16

throughout all of our programs. And I will share some

17

so, this is a wonderful opportunity to share those

17

of that with you.

18

thoughts, to talk about some of the programs. And I,

18

19

again, thank you for making this an important item on

MS. DOMINGUEZ: Thank you. Thank you very

So, we'd like to talk about the findings.

I also would like to express our appreciation

America?

Page 64

So we do that -- we have 17,000 members. And

2

3

if you look at the composition, we have full board

3

4

membership and we also have individual membership. The

4

5

full board membership: 73 percent are publicly-traded

5

6

companies, they come from publicly-traded companies, 16

6

7

percent from privately-owned companies, and about 10

7

8

percent for non-profits. And, as you can see, the top

8

9

represented industries really come from a highly-

9

10

regulated environment: banking, financial services,

10

11

insurance, energy, utilities.

11

12

We -- in addition to the 17,000 members, we

12

13

have 22 chapters all over the United States. So we

13

14

hold all kinds of director professionalism classes for

14

15

these individuals.

15

16

Some of the publications that have been very

16

17

well received -- cyber risk, as we know, is a hot, hot

17

18

topic in corporate America. Director compensation, I

18

19

heard a lot of comments about that this morning. We

19

20

have an annual survey on public company governance,

21

what are the issues that they are concerned about, as

22

well as, obviously, Dodd-Frank is a big issue for our

23

members.

20
21

24

These are some of the examples of the blue

ribbon commission report. Every year we put together a

commission, and we talk about what -- some of the
timely issues that are affecting board governance:
talent development, compensation is always the hot
topic, long-term value creation. How do you manage
short-term results with long-term value creation?
Strategy, and, of course, what I will talk about is the
diverse board. I had the privilege of co-chairing that
board, that commission.
These are four councils that NACD has. They
convene 400 to 500 committee chairs. And, of course,
it follows the structure of governance: audit,
nominations, compensation, and risk oversight.
And, of course, just like SEC, we are multivested with all the stakeholders that really weigh in
on the issues of corporate governance, including
institutional investors, media outlets, and government
officials. And we're very proud of our relationship
with the SEC and the work that we have done together.
Okay. Boardroom diversity. This is a
statement that -- the result of a one-year-long study
that came out of our blue ribbon commission. Board's
performance really relies on its understanding of the
company and its operating environment. In today's
business landscape, the board cannot properly fulfill
this responsibility without having directors who

reflect the composition of its stakeholders,
particularly the employees and the customer. So what
we're trying to do is make sure that board governance
reflects the diversity that exists in the marketplace.
Betsy mentioned some statistics. These are
some of the statistics that just came out of the 2015
Spencer Stuart board index. We have an 8.6 percent
directors that are -- come from the African-American
descent, which is down slightly from 9.6 percent in
2010. These are S&P 500 companies. So, AfricanAmerican directors make up 8.6 percent. HispanicLatino directors, 4.8 percent, a slight increase from
4.2 percent. And Asian descent, 1.8 percent, a slight
increase again from 1.3 percent.
So, as you can tell, the ethnic and the racial
diversity of board members has really kind of stayed
static, kind of stagnant, it really hasn't progressed
to the extent that we had hoped.
If you look at women, women make up about 20
percent of all directors. About 75 percent of all S&P
boards have 2 -- at least 2 women directors. And,
interestingly, from all independent directors that come
internationally, that has come down. I think it
probably has to do with the logistics of travel these
days. It's very difficult. But it's gone from 12

percent back in 2014 to 9 percent in 2015.
The median age of board members has gone up
from 61 to 63. I think that has to do with the fact
that a lot of companies now have extended the age, term
limits, to 72, to 75. Some don't have age limits,
which really has -- and we'll talk about this in a
little bit, but has an impact on the ability of new
board members to come in to the board.
If we look at the state of board diversity in
the U.S. compared to other countries around the world,
I think we're at -- in terms of European countries,
we're number 11. Norway, Sweden, France, Italy have
approached the gender inclusion issue through targets
and quotas. So they are pretty firm about, you know,
the representation of women, and looking for ways to
accelerate that representation.
Australia and the UK, in particular, have used
other kinds of things that have nothing to do with
quotas, and we'll get into that in a second. But it's
been equally as effective, and continues to be quite
effective. And, of course, in the United States, we -as has been indicated, the disclosure statement doesn't
really give us much of a window to make some
comparisons, in terms of the growth that we have and
companies have diversity and which ones don't, in terms

of ethnic and racial diversity.
So, the findings from the blue ribbon
commission: directors and stakeholders agree on the
importance of increasing boardroom diversity, but the
progress has been quite, quite slow. And it's been a
very sluggish transition. It really hasn't kept up
with the technology, it hasn't kept up with the pace of
business, as well as the human progress, in general.
This is the most recent survey that we have,
2016-2017 new findings. Boards are largely relying on
expanding their search criteria for new candidates and
diversifying the composition. So boards have
traditionally looked at certain search firms. Now
they're saying, okay, let's expand the criteria.
There's a bias towards CEOs, or presidents of operating
divisions. They say, "What about somebody with an IT
background? What about somebody with international
experience?" So the criteria has been broadening in an
effort to increase the representation of prospective
board members.
And, please, if you have any questions at any
point, feel free to ask. Any questions so far? No?
MR. GRAHAM: Yes.
MR. AGUILAR: I have a question.
MS. DOMINGUEZ: Yes.

quota to promote diversity. They don't really talk
about quotas for those companies within the United
States, they talk about the 30 percent coalition. They
try to set targets to try to encourage chairs and
nominating committee and CEOs to reach those targets
through peer pressure, through public CEO sort of -- a
little bit of cajoling, if you will. But we don't
really have -- as we know, we don't really have -impose quotas. We do have that peer pressure that
we'll talk about in a second in more detail.
Let's see, expanded director search criteria,
diversify composition of the nominating and governance
committee. This has been a pretty helpful tool to try
to get more consideration of diversity, to try to get
the nominating committees to reflect some diversity.
Historically, we haven't had that much diversity, but
this has been a helpful tool. One of the boards that I
sit on, which has changed the chair of one of the
committees, and, you know, it's -- really has expanded
the conversation as it relates to diversity.
One other option is to increase the size of
the board. When the board is actually shrinking or
down to an average of 9, 11, increasing the size of the
board to allow for new board members has been a
positive way of increasing diversity at the board

MR. AGUILAR: You mentioned that Norway,

level.

2

France, and Sweden have quotas that they fill to

2

3

include women on boards. Where do those quotas come

3

mechanism. Again, with board members getting older and

4

from? Do they come from regulation? Do they come from

4

not -- there is a little bit of reluctance to leave a

5

legislation? Internal policies? Can you talk a little

5

board, because there is a perception that if you're

6

bit more about that?

6

asked to leave a board, that there is -- you know, it's

7

kind of a stigma attached to it. And so we're trying

7

MS. DOMINGUEZ: Sure. Most of them are

Let's see, institute or change tenure limiting

8

legislative, mandated. And some are regulatory

8

to think about what -- if you have term limits, or

9

executive mandates. For example, Germany, they just

9

something like that, where board members can be -- can

10

imposed a quota that -- through -- directly through

10

move around and participate in other boards, I think

11

Angela Merkel.

11

that would be a positive way.

12

So, it comes in different iterations, but it's

12

13

either through rulemaking or its legislatively imposed.

13

African-Americans and Hispanics, but essentially a lot

14

Norway was legislatively imposed, and they actually are

14

of those individuals are being recycled. They are

15

at the top of ranking at 40 percent representation. So

15

going from one board to the other, so we're not really

16

it varies, and I will talk about the UK and Australia

16

growing the base, we're just having that -- and if you

17

in a second, but they are actually using other non-

17

18

quota tools to really achieve more of a gender equity.

18

discourse.

19

Unfortunately, the ethnic and racial

You know, we talk about the representation of

19

So, how do we change that, you know? What
types of criteria do we look at? And I think some of

20

components don't apply outside of the United States, so

20

21

our comparisons are mostly on the gender side and on

21

the things we've talked about, looking at -- you know,

22

the ethnic or racial side outside of the United

22

23

States.

23

major division exclusively, although there is a bias

24

toward those types of credentials. But we have the

25

talent pool, we have the pipeline, and I think it's

24
25

I mentioned this before. A few boards are
adjusting tenure limiting mechanisms or adopting formal

more of building the awareness and some of the
accountability that goes with it.
And some have adopted the racial or gender
diversity targets, but that's few and far between. I'm
not -- this is summary data, so I'm not really aware of
which companies have adopted that.
In terms of public -- the boards of larger
companies are far more likely than those of smaller
companies to discuss diversity of their members. Some
of the informal surveys that we have conducted, we have
found that it's very little discussion at the board
level about diversity. A lot of the discussion takes
place at the committee levels, but not really at the
board level, the full board.
And half of the small cap respondents said
that their boards did not discuss gender diversity, and
most didn't discuss racial or ethnic diversity. As you
can see in the chart, it really depends on -- we talk a
lot about professional industries, skill sets. We talk
a lot about gender diversity, a little less about
ethnic and racial and age diversity and other kinds -international experience is another one.
Now, if we look at Australia, for example, I
think it's a good example, as this Commission, SEC,
considers expanding or amending their S-K regulation.

They have actually brought change in a non-quota market

1

2

by calling on boards to establish measure and report

2

3

their diversity outcome. What proportion of their

3

4

boards are women? What proportion of their senior

4

5

managers are women? And if they don't wish to report

5

6

it, why not? You know, what's the reason why they

6

7

don't want to report it?

7

8

So, I think they've made some significant

9

progress by calling on these requirements in order to

8
9

10

be listed as part of their Australia stock exchange.

10

11

And they do have champions of change. They have a

11

12

coalition of very high-profile businessmen, primarily,

12

13

that are -- have coalesced to talk about diversity, and

13

14

to talk about gender inclusion as a competitive

14

15

business asset, not as a nice-to-do or, you know, we're

15

16

falling behind, but as a competitive business asset.

16

17

If you look at the United Kingdom with Lord

17

18

Davis, it was a government-backed commission that

18

19

examined the under-representation of women, and they

19

20

have had tremendous success. They had set a goal of 25

20

21

percent by 2015 and, in fact, have exceeded that goal

21

22

last year. So now they're trying to increase it.

22

23

They have an approach called name and shame,

companies that have increased their representation
versus those that have not increased their
representation. So, last I heard, there was one or two
that hadn't quite gotten there. And, you know, a
couple of phone calls, a little nudging, and -- just
really helped. So let's not under-estimate peer
pressure as it relates to opening up inclusion and
diversity.
It's a voluntary framework led by business.
The Coalition of British Enterprises is a very, very
powerful -- led by business leaders, and they have been
pushing for change.
Institutional investors pressure big business.
There is also this assumption that if you served on a
board longer than nine years, you're not really
considered independent. They're considered more -less independent than those who have served for less
time.
This is the -- what the trends has been for
non-quota markets. And I think it's relevant because
we're not thinking -- you know, United States doesn't
recognize quotas as an acceptable tool in the
marketplace. So I think the fact that we have some
examples of opportunities to reach gender inclusion,
gender diversity, and racial and ethnic diversity

23

24

which is if -- they use the press, they use whatever

24

25

public bully pulpit is available to talk about the

25

without that component, you can look at the trend line.
This is only to 2014. The numbers have gone up
significantly last year.
These are the basic findings that our
commission found. First of all, we said we had some
serious structural factors that are keeping -- that are
slowing down the pace of inclusion at the board level.
The absence of tenure limiting, as well as limited
mechanisms such as term limits, that has been a
structural issue.
The recommended solution has been to preserve,
enhance, or consider adding mechanisms to increase
director turnover. One of those tools is board
evaluations, you know. We don't really evaluate
boards, the full level, on a general basis. So that's
an opportunity to do it.
We also have, structurally speaking, small
board sizes. Again, a lot of the boards are going down
to 9 or 11 as sort of the average range. So if you're
thinking of diversifying, one option would be to
include -- to expand the board seat until there is some
turnover, and allow that person to serve as sort of an
understudy for that period of time.
As I mentioned, we have inadequate use of
evaluations, inadequate use of executive talent

management to develop directors from within.
Succession planning and the tools that exist have not
been as effective. The pipelines haven't reached the
point that would allow a critical mass of women and
ethnic and racial diverse perspective board members to
reach and be considered and be visible for those
levels. So talent management, it's a key factor, I
think, not just for board participation, but certainly
for overall enhancement of representation at all levels
and areas of employment. That's -- that was one of our
recommendations from a structural perspective.
From a social factors perspective, little
knowledge of where to find candidates -- it's hard to
believe, but we find -- our experience has shown that,
a lot of times just go to the same network. And if the
network is so -- you're not going to get a whole lot of
diversity.
Also, overboarding of certain stars. Rock
star board members. And I talked about that before.
We have the same representatives going from one board
to another. It's not unusual to find an ethnic or
racially diverse individual to serve on three or four
boards, sometimes to the detriment of others that are
coming up, because typically it's only one or there is
maybe two. So the number of seats are quite limited.

Page 75

There is also great reluctance of sitting

Page 77
1

2

directors to leave a board. And so maybe adhering to

2

3

term limits to build turnover acceptance might be

3

4

another option, another solution. Not one that is

4

5

highly popular, but a possibility.

5

6

And the other thing that we have found is

6

7

often times the term "minority" captures all of the

7

8

ethnic groups, or consolidating -- you know, we have 10

8

9

percent representation of women and minorities, as

9

10

opposed to dividing it and saying, okay, let's -- you

10

11

know, what exactly is the representation of women and

11

12

ethnic and racial minorities?

12

13

And like I said, sometimes you have a woman of

13

14

color that meets -- you know, so they check both boxes,

14

15

but it really is one person serving on the board. You

15

16

can relate to that, using that?

16

17

(Laughter.)

17

18

MS. YAMANAKA: Totally. I'd like that not to

18

19
20

be the case.
MS. DOMINGUEZ: Yeah, me too. Then we have

to full board discussion. But elevating the topic as a
competitive business strategy, I think, is one of the
recommendations that we have been advocating for a
number of years.
Again, tendency to seek only CEOs, public
company directors for board seats, and the lack of
diversity in the nominating governance committee.
These were the structural, the social, the habitual
factors that we believe are keeping the gender balance,
ethnic, and racial representation, not moving at the
pace with which we would have expected by now.
So, the goals are a comprehensive definition
that should include -- must include gender, race,
ethnicity, and skills, and we not only talk about that
in the diverse board commission report, we talk about
that in all the commission reports we've had since.
This is a diverse board. We talked about strategy
development. So it's very important that we integrate
diversity, not just for -- talk about diversity, but to
integrate it into all aspects of the company practices.
Again, finally, discussing in depth board
discussions about critical topics like diversity.
Select and implement solutions. Expand our horizons
for recruiting candidates and improve director
evaluation.

19
20

21

the habitual factors: failure to put diversity on the

21

22

board's agenda as a discussion topic. So we strongly

22

23

-- NACD strongly recommends that we do that, that we

23

24

put it on the agenda. Often times it stays with the

24

25

compensation and human resources committee, as opposed

25

And disclosure. We think disclosure is a
critical component, and we really support the
liberations that are taking place right now here, with
respect to how to enhance, how to enrich the disclosure
requirements to allow shareholders to make informed
decisions, investment decisions, and voting decisions.
But we think the disclosure could really help the
process significantly.
Other things that have -- and you're very
familiar with that, that's mentioned, the GAO report
that said that they will take another 40 years to reach
gender parity. I believe Catalyst, which is a research
organization in New York, came out with a study not
that long ago that said that if we're looking at
pipeline in terms of entry level all the way to board,
it could take 100 years to have a critical mass of
women moving up the pipeline in significant numbers to
reach parity at the board level. So, that's -- 100
years, 40 years, that's quite a challenge. I don't
know. I know I'm not going to be here to see that.
But obviously, public pension funds have
petitioned you to require disclosure. It's very
simple, just put a little chart, a matrix. I had
gender identity and ethnic and racial, and it's not
going to be very burdensome, in general, but it would

help the disclosure, knowing how the appointment
process is proceeding.
And we've got a number of state initiatives
that have passed resolutions urging for more women on
boards. And, by extension, ethnic and racial diverse
board members.
This is a coalition I talked about, the Thirty
Percent Coalition, organization of executives that
really press, use peer pressure, use publicity. I know
they've pushed for increased SEC diversity disclosure.
I attended their meeting last November, and it really
has taken a lot of momentum in the private sector.
And, of course, we have impact investment
funds that are being created to generate social change,
as well as financial returns: State Street Global
Advisors, we've received $250 million investment from
CalPERS to take a look at gender diversity.
In conclusion, you know, I think we have all
of these pieces converging. But all together, I think
at the end of the day it's really about how do we
influence change. I -- it's going to take a village.
It's going to take everyone from different angles, but
it's also going to take strong leadership, and a change
in the corporate culture. If we don't change the
corporate culture, you're going to have a CEO who is

to generate information for shareholders and to assist
with governance, an adequate definition is needed. And
certainly diversity of thought and experience and the
right skill sets, all those things are important and
are part of the conversation.
It sometimes becomes a more difficult
conversation when we talk in terms of gender and ratio
and ethnic diversity and sexual orientation and, you
know, those kinds of things. You know, but those -but that should be part of a definition, as well.
The SEC, as we know, cannot mandate diversity.
And I know that some quotas have imposed quotas and
that sort of thing. And even if we were in a position
to impose quotas, I wouldn't be in favor of that. But
I think the SEC clearly does have a role, in terms of
disclosure, of course, and related to education
regarding things that are important to investors in the
context of company performance.
The -- you know, I'm convinced that there are
those corporations out there whose boards are lacking
in diversity because their thinking is similar to that
of the mid-20th century Red Sox. You know, even if
it's only through the magic of implicit bias. Maybe
they don't even know it.
I'm equally convinced that there are those

corporations out there lacking in board diversity

2

And once that CEO leaves, the change -- you know, there

And we think, by having all the stakeholders

And I think that there are those corporations

out there that are not really aware of their own

along those lines.

MR. GRAHAM: Well, thank you very much, Cari.

MR. HAUPTMAN: That was a great presentation.

I think your organization, as a private-sector

I think we can agree that diversity is what you make

backed commission was doing naming and shaming. I

25

it. If something that doesn't work -- if we're trying

25

would think if you went out to most of America and said

there is the free enterprise system, people working,
and then there is the public servants in D.C. whom they
hire, that if there is any naming and shaming to be
going on, I'm not sure they would think it should be
going from D.C. out to them. Right?
That Jackie Robinson example, which I use all
the time -- I am actually a fellow UCLA alum -- they
didn't just do it, hire Jackie Robinson, because it was
fair to him, which it was. The Dodgers did it because
it benefited the Dodgers. Now, imagine the teams that
did not go after the right talent. Imagine they ceased
to exist. Well, that's what the business world is.
So, the free enterprise system -- that's why I
think our main goal is to make sure we have robust
markets and easy -- lower barriers to entry in every
industry, because the good practices, by definition,
win out. So we won't have practices that are harmful
because they lose, right?
And let me just throw this anecdote out. I
went from high school to college from -- my high school
had virtually no -- it was out in the country, up in
Maine -- almost no diversity the way college
administrators think of it. Those brochures they send
you that says, "Look, we have upper middle class people
of all races, or at least people who can afford our $60

Page 84
1

dad this weekend and my brother," they were never

2

talking about going to a penitentiary to do so, despite

3

the massive amount of incarceration in this county.

4

How on earth do you not know anyone like that?

5

When I said that starting at 13, when I worked

6

at a restaurant, you know, for $3.65 an hour, washing

7

dishes, it was amazing how many people you met in

8

college who had only worked, like, in internships and

9

at law firms, you know, that never wore a uniform, you

10

know.

11

And my point here is not that all these folks

12

ought to endeavor to know felons and know people who

13

get pregnant as teenagers or work crappy jobs like I

14

did. My point is they ought to stop saying that they

15

know about diversity that well.

16

And it is an irony to me that the discussion

17

of diversity often falls victim to the same group-think

18

with which we are talking about. If there was a

19

company started by some folks in a part of this country

20

that either geographically or because of recent

21

immigrant groups culturally has a lot of stay-at-home

22

moms, for example, that area might have a harder time

23

finding qualified professional women to serve on their

24

board. But in Volvoland, if we went to Palo Alto or

25

Westchester County or to McLean, Virginia, where people

sweatshirt."
And then I went to college, and my graduating
class at college was 27 percent white students, right?
So, obviously, 73 non-white. And I noticed that the
people who used the word "diversity" the most,
including people on payroll at the university, they
were the most blown away when I talked about my high
school, that we had day care at my high school for the
girls that were pregnant -- it was a room off the
cafeteria -- that getting your diploma, you know, a
woman who is visibly pregnant with the gown, was not a
strange thing.
And these people, fellow students, were
astonished by this, despite -- especially back then -a massive teenage pregnancy epidemic in this country.
I was like, "How do you not know anyone like this,"
right?
The fact that -- I remember I bought a ticket
for $250 to go on spring break. It's the first time in
my life I'd ever been on a plane for leisure travel,
and people were astounded by that. How on earth did
these folks who talk about diversity not know anyone
like that?
As they used to say somewhat disparagingly
back then, when they talk about, "I'm going to see my

Page 85
1

use the word "summer" as a verb, and there is -- they

2

can afford nannies, and there is no shortage of

3

professional women, are we really trying to handicap

4

the recent immigrants in favor of the haves, and call

5

that a win that we're doing for our country?

6

If I was outside the United States, competing

7

with an American company, I would be envious of the

8

diversity that we can provide in this country. These

9

statistics, I believe in them wholeheartedly, about the

10

benefits of them, both the psychological studies and

11

the financial benefits. But if I was competing, and we

12

decided to use that, which is easily measured, which

13

race and gender are, and put it into a quota, or naming

14

and shaming from government, I would then be pleased as

15

an outsider, and say, "Look at Americans, they're

16

handicapping themselves, they're doing my work for me."

17

How weird for the American Government to hard American

18

investors and workers.

19

And I say that -- again, back to my original

20

point. A private-sector organization like yours

21

spreading information and best practices is a

22

phenomenal way to do it, and the market does it even

23

better. Right? Again, the teams that didn't embrace

24

the talent disappear. That's what the business world

25

is like.

useful, that there are certain things that definitely

2

provide guidance, and then we say, oh, you know, this

2

should be a part of that definition. At the same time,

3

is soft and it's not mandated, I -- guidance from

3

we have to understand and respect that we cannot come

4

government and suggestions is sometimes like Bamm-Bamm

up with a definition that's going to include everything

from the Flintstones, like have no idea how strong they

that should be included. I think it's a mindset that

are.

6

we encourage doing what you need to do to get away from

7

group-think and that sort of thing.

But I just caution. I think sometimes when we

7

And I'm reminded when the 401(k) plans came

And, you know, the examples that you

8

in, small business got a little pamphlet to explain

8

9

what a 401(k) was and how it worked. And it said on

9

10

it, you know, as an example, so if the worker got three

10

diversity, something, I think, that most of us can

11

percent out of paycheck pre-tax, and then the employer

11

appreciate in terms of background. It doesn't just --

12

kicked in three, it all goes in. To this day, three

12

it doesn't have to be race, ethnicity, gender. But I

13

percent is the most common employer match because of

13

think that race, ethnicity, and gender have to be part

14

that pamphlet, because people were like, oh, the

14

of the conversation.

15

government said to me I bet if I do this, I'm going to

15

MS. KASSAN: I think Kyle made some

16

be all right.

16

interesting points that brought up for me the question

mentioned, that's -- those are examples of real

So, when we do easily-measurable things -- and

17

of class diversity, because that is not really part of

18

remember what I was talking about when I went from high

18

the conversation. People who serve on corporate boards

19

school to college, from the supposedly less-diverse

19

are generally a, you know, very privileged class. So,

20

place to the very diverse place, and how stunned they

20

I'm not sure what the answer to that is, but I'd love

21

were at very common life experiences, all I'm trying to

21

to keep that in mind, as well.

22

say here is that we just need to be very careful, the

22

23

power of government that often can be counterproductive

23

24

and fall victim to the same group thing that we're

24

MR. GRAHAM: Xavier?

25

trying to avoid with this discussion of diversity.

25

MR. GUTIERREZ: So I have a number of

17

Page 87
1

MR. GRAHAM: Thank you, Kyle. You know, I

Page 89
1

2

think you're exactly right. I mean you don't want to

2

3

fall victim to the easy. You know, unfortunately, I

3

4

think that those are -- that there are those out there

4

5

who say we should do nothing because it's hard. So I

5

6

-- pardon me?

6

7
8
9

MR. HAUPTMAN: Who is we? Or those that say
we should do nothing? Who is we?
MR. GRAHAM: Commentators. There are people

7
8
9

10

of the opinion that this whole -- this -- that there is

10

11

this inability to define what is diverse. And, as a

11

12

result, this is something that we should be very, very

12

13

careful about getting into.

13

14

I don't -- so, in other words, coming up with

14

15

a definition is hard. And, you know, personally I'm of

15

16

the view that that shouldn't -- the fact that it's hard

16

17

shouldn't be a determining factor.

17

18

And we should also understand the limits. I

18

19

think that you've very well pointed out some of the

19

20

limits. The idea -- and in terms of mandate, we're not

20

21

going to tell anybody to do anything, other than

21

22

disclosure what you are doing. And if -- and from

22

23

there, the choice is yours.

23

24
25

And I think we can all probably agree, in
terms of coming up with a definition that might be more

MR. HAUPTMAN: Yeah, it's the Golden Rule: He
who makes the rules usually gets the gold.

25

comments. But first I want to start by thanking you,
Stephen, and you, Sara. When I gave you a call and
asked you to put this on the agenda, you were very
enthusiastic about it, and we had a wonderful
conversation prior to that. And you also informed me
that this was an issue that had been previously
discussed by this committee. And so I was very, very
happy to hear that it had been a topic and that we
would continue to engage in this.
I also wanted to applaud the commissioners for
engaging in this conversation, and particularly the
chair, who have seen the importance of this discussion
and have really taken a leadership of that. And in
absentia I really want to thank a former SEC
commissioner, Luis Aguilar, who is a dear friend of
mine, who -- this topic was a very, very important part
of his tenure on the Commission, and who clearly still
sees the importance of it in private life.
A couple of comments. I think that we don't
need to belabor the point, but clearly diversity is a
business imperative. And if you look at the consumer
base, if you look at the shareholder base, if you look
at who is creating businesses in this country, it looks
very different than it has in the past. And I believe
that corporate America and others -- and the data

supports this -- needs to adapt. It needs to adjust.
Now, how to do it? And I echo the comments -Kyle, that we have to be very careful of what it is to
be diverse. You brought up socio-economic diversity,
which I think is really, really non-existent in the
conversation of diversity discussions. And so I would
agree with you.
But to Stephen's point, just because something
is hard to define, doesn't mean that we shouldn't
undertake exploring it. The role of the SEC, I
believe, is to be more clear in its disclosure
requirements. I believe that several of the
recommendations brought forth by The NACD and other
organizations should be things that the SEC should
undertake because, again, you can't improve what you
can't measure. Those in Silicon Valley love data, in
particular, and clearly we are having a data problem to
start.
And so, I would very strongly urge the
Commission to think of ways to improve its disclosure
in order to address this matter.
I was particularly, I guess, disturbed by the
fact that small companies, in particular, don't
entertain or engage in this conversation. One, because
there is more of them. Two, because they tend to, in

Page 92
1

have a board. It's 12 guys. And we've seen that

2

recently in one of the very, very big companies who

3

suddenly emerged and started to file, and everyone

4

goes, "Ha, you've just got guys on your board. Do you

5

not know any women? Are there no women in California?"

6

And it was -- to build on something that Kyle said,

7

there was the -- nobody needed to name and shame them

8

from the government point of view, because Twitter did

9

it for them. And they said, "It's so sad you don't

10

know any women." And, goodness, they went and found

11

one or two and appointed them. And how easy that was.
And so, it is -- this is an area that is very

12
13

much within the remit of this committee, because if you

14

don't do it when you are small and emerging, you're not

15

going to have fixed it by the time you go and do your

16

IPO.

17

MR. GRAHAM: Thank you. Greg?

18

MR. YADLEY: I also would like to thank you,

19

Cari. And I think the dissemination of information on

20

why this is good shouldn't be necessary. But

21

particularly the studies that show that companies

22

perform better, including their financial results, that

23

is very powerful, and it gets the discussion going.

24
25

I have some reason to be optimistic that we
will get there. To come back to my earlier comment

Page 91

Page 93

1

essence, be the bench for the directors for larger

1

about exponential, I'm not that old, but when I was in

2

companies. So, when we're talking about some of the

2

law school I went to a national law school, and I think

3

structural issues, directors on smaller company boards,

3

there were 11 women in my section, and there were 3

4

whether public or private, tend to be the candidates

4

sections, not very much. Our law firm, new hires are

5

for larger-company boards.

5

at least 50 percent women, which reflects the

6

And so, if we are having a particular lack of

6

diversity, gender diversity, in the law schools. Not

7

engagement at that level and size of company, then

7

doing nearly as well, racially.

8

clearly we're going to have an issue at the larger

8

9

companies. And so, given our purview in terms of

9

My daughter-in-law is a physician. She's
finished her residency. Majority of women. And I was

10

smaller companies, public and privately held, I think

10

proud to send an article from my alma mater, Dartmouth,

11

it's especially important that the SEC Commission and

11

where the engineering school this year graduated more

12

staff look at the small companies and the micro-cap

12

women engineers than any -- than men. And that was the

13

companies, and what they're doing in terms of

13

first time for a major engineering school. So,

14

disclosure, not only of the results, but also of their

14

hopefully, exponentially, women are taking place. And

15

policies. So thank you.

15

it's not a situation where Sara just mentioned, where

16

MR. GRAHAM: Thank you. Sara?

16

we don't know any women, because they're sitting right

17

MS. HANKS: Yeah. I just want to respond to

17

there. But it may take 40 years.

18

something that Xavier said there, which is -- I mean

18

19

coming to this as the small and emerging companies

19

-- some of the earlier comments that were made about

20

committee, people might think, well, you know, this is

20

we're in business, you know. Who is investing? Who is

21

a thing for big companies. But as we have seen, there

21

buying our products? What are the social forces? So I

22

is a tendency for smaller companies to stay private

22

think it can happen, and I think the disclosure ability

23

longer, and then they suddenly emerge on the public

23

of the SEC is extremely powerful, as Kyle said, with

24

company space, where they become regulated by the SEC.

24

the three percent example. You know, I think if you do

25

that, maybe it will encourage us all to build more

25

And at that point they're like, oh, yeah, we

I think that once the discussion gets started

24 (Pages 90 to 93)

bridges.

Page 96

but I know there are people who would say that.

2

MR. GRAHAM: Thanks, Greg.

3

than the -- the quiet persuasion than I am either the

But -- so I'm more of the persuasion, rather

4

MR. REARDON: I said I wasn't going to

4

shaming or formal requirements. I mean I think if you

5

comment, but -- I said that to myself -- but lest I be

5

can fashion an argument, like I said, that this is good

6

considered the redneck from Texas. But let me start --

6

business, that you'll get more cooperation, rather than

7

I don't expect any kudos for this; I did it because it

7

SEC disclosures or anything like that. So -- or

8

was the right thing to do -- but the only lawyers or

8

policies.

9

law students I have employed during my legal career

9

So I hope I don't offend you by that
perspective, it's not my intent. Anyway --

10

when I've been on my own have either been women or

10

11

African-American. And the African-American was a -- I

11

12

hired him when he was a freshman at University of Texas

12

are pretty much on the same page. I too am not a Texas

13

at Arlington. He is now a graduate of Washington and

13

redneck.

14

Lee Law School. I'm glad that I could help with that.

14

MR. GRAHAM: You know, I think that you and I

(Laughter.)

15

So I don't think I'm really a redneck or

15

16

anything like that, but I do have a slightly different

16

and it's a point that I've tried to make, and perhaps

17

approach. And I think the first thing is to say that

17

not very clear, and that is that things like naming and

18

your presentation needs to answer -- and maybe I didn't

18

shaming, or however you want to put it, don't have any

19

watch as carefully as I should -- but if you go into a

19

relevance in this context. This operates at two

20

president or CEO and you talk to him, I guess the

20

levels: disclosure and what's right, if you will. I

21

question he or her -- and my daughter is in management

21

think we are concerned with disclosure, even if they

22

at a company that's run by a woman, a public company,

22

end up doing something that's right as a result.

23

Silicon Valley -- is, "How is this going to make more

23

But I think the important thing here is -- and

24

money for me?" Okay?

24

why this should be of interest to shareholders is the

25

economic argument, that, you know, we're talking about

25

And I think there are some very good answers.

MR. GRAHAM: But I do agree with you, that --

Page 95

Page 97

1

I mean one of the subjects I've given a great deal of

1

things that are important in the eyes of, certainly,

2

study in my life is women. And including reading some

2

many shareholders, if not most, something important

3

of people like Deborah Tannen, and the different ways

3

that goes to the heart of the performance of the

4

that women see the world. I'm sure African-Americans,

4

enterprise.

5

male or female, there is research on that, too.

5

6

So, I mean, you -- if you can package this and

6

Yes, Cari?
MS. DOMINGUEZ: Yeah. Well, thank you. Thank

7

go to somebody with, "This is good for business," not

7

you for that comment. And I just want to clarify the

8

that you're going to get embarrassed or you're going to

8

naming and shaming is a tool that's used in the UK.

9

get shamed into this -- and that makes somebody just

9

NACD is not advocating naming and shaming. We are just

10

push back -- but if you can do that and put it in a

10

saying this is an approach that has been effective in

11

context of, "You're going to make more money doing

11

that particular forum.

12

this," I think -- I would think first in retail or

12

13

manufacturing, that different tastes and different

13

and I think people pay attention to what is reported

perspectives -- that's an easy one to sell.

14

and what's disclosed, as a tool. So what we're saying

15

is there is unconscious bias, and we spend a lot of

15

The industries that have traditionally fewer

I do believe that we treasure what we measure,

16

African-Americans or Hispanics or women in them -- and

16

time looking at unconscious bias, even when you have

17

there are a number of them -- that's a harder sell.

17

things like the Rooney Rule, for example, that says you

18

But I think you're going to have to -- that would be

18

must have an African-American to be considered for a

19

how I would sell this. And I'm not as rabid as Justice

19

coaching job. Well, sometimes you just -- it's

20

Clarence Thomas, but I do think there is an element

20

prescriptive, you go through that process, but it

21

that if you force people to do this, either by shaming

21

doesn't really yield the results intended.

22

or quotas, then you become -- you run the risk that,

22

23

oh, that's our quota director, you know? And I don't

I mean I don't think -- you know, I wouldn't say it,

So I think -- and I believe -- I reflect the

compliance programs when I launched a glass ceiling

wonder if you can speak on, because I think it talks a

points. But in Norway they mandate, you know, board

4

we're supposed to do," but there were no results,

gender diversity of 40 percent female. So I think it's

5

because it wasn't given to their creativity, to their

5

important to mention that for a couple of points,

6

culture.

6

because I think the quota isn't effective. I think you

7

So you have to be flexible, but I do think

7

have to have a critical mass of diversity before

8

that disclosure is an important tool for people to make

8

diversity is actually -- you know, makes an impact on a

group or board.

10

MR. GRAHAM: Kyle? Robert?

10

11

MR. AGUILAR: So I think that talking about

11

that looked into the Norwegian companies actually found

And then, two, I mean, they -- the studies

race is or can be uncomfortable, right? And it seems

12

that the board, from a corporate governance

13

to be a little uncomfortable in the room right now

13

perspective, was more effective, and I think that's

14

because we are talking about it. So I applaud the SEC

14

where the potential for, you know, better -- you know,

15

for, you know, putting the disclosure requirement out

15

for doing better as a company. It's not necessarily

16

there, so that, you know, Stephen, to your point, you

16

bringing perspectives on a certain idea or brand, but

17

said that it's hard to have a dialogue. Well, if it's

17

the way in which the corporation itself is governed is

18

out there, it's going to be easier to put that on the

18

actually improved.

19

table and have that dialogue, and to speak about it.

19

So I don't know if you know anything about

20

So, I think that, you know, somebody else made

20

21

a point of having a quota and, you know, just grabbing

21

22

any person that fits that quota to fill those

22

lot of information about -- it's not just the

23

positions. And I don't think -- I think that would

23

creativity and the innovation that diverse perspectives

24

harm that, you know, the diversity cause, more than

24

and experiences bring, but it's also, you know, women

25

help it. You know, the first thing that you want to do

25

and ethnic and racial minorities are often times more

Page 99
is you want to identify board members that are

1

2

qualified and can do the position.

2

3

So if the discussion is out there in the board

3

4

-- I mean, one of the things that you commonly hear is,

4

5

"Well, we can't identify, you know, African-Americans

5

6

and Hispanics that can fulfill these roles," and it's

6

7

because they're not in the mix. But if there is a

7

8

dialogue about it, and you're making a conscious effort

8

9

to identify those individuals, then it makes that, you

9

10

know, fulfilling the -- I don't want to say the quotas,

10

11

but being a more diverse company and, therefore, you

11

12

know, as the studies show, a more profitable company,

12

13

it makes it, I think, a little easier.

13

14

MR. GRAHAM: Thanks.

14

15

Michael?

15

16

MR. PIECIAK: Thanks, Stephen. And thank you,

16

17

Cari. That was an excellent presentation. And thank

17

18

you for the SEC, again, as -- echoing some of the other

18

19

comments from folks on the committee -- for taking up

19

20

this issue. Very important.

20

NASAA dedicated its entire spring -- or fall

21

22

conference, sorry, to the issue of diversity in

22

23

financial markets, looking through a number of

23

24

spectrums, including corporate board diversity.

24

25

And one of the things that was interesting I

MS. DOMINGUEZ: Well, yes, there has been a

21

that, those particular studies, and can expand on that.

25

independent. They act more as an independent board
member than the board members who have been in place
for quite a while.
So, as a result of that, the corporate
governance process has improved. I don't have quotes
on the studies, but it has proven that corporate
governance has improved when you have more gender
diversity. And, by extension, I would say race and
ethnic. Because of the lack of -- you know, the
greater independence of the individuals. So that's a
positive.
Now, there has been some negative comments in
terms of a quota, and I know we've had that discourse
here in the United States for years. If, you know, if
you promote somebody just because that person is -- and
I think you referenced that, the Clarence Thomas
approach -- I don't want to have the stigma of thinking
that I'm here because I'm a woman or because I'm a
person of racially or ethnically diverse.
So, I think there is always that level. But
the point being is you don't take to that level the
unqualified, the unneeded, the people who aren't going
to step up and going to do their homework and be
prepared. I think that's the first and foremost thing
that one has to consider when that comes across.

I'm just sick and tired of trying to help these people

raise money from -- I'm sorry, but there is just a lot

4

5

of old white guys on Sandhill Road in Silicon Valley.

5

6

And I'm tired of hearing stories from these

7

women CEOs saying things like, "He asked if my husband

was the one doing the work and I was just at home

starting a company," or, "He said, you know, it was a

10

11

amazingly powerful businesswomen, and they got turned

11

12

down for venture financing from a fairly well-known

12

13

firm, because one of the old GPs said, 'Well, why would

13

14

15

15

We've been working on the back side in Silicon

16

MR. HAUPTMAN: I just wanted to ask Cari for a

16

17

Valley on gender diversity a lot. And a lot of the

17

18

feedback that we get from -- and that I've heard from

18

19

the White House staff who are doing that work on

19

20

diversity in Silicon Valley was that there is just a

20

21

lot of pushback from The VCs saying, "It's not a

21

22

problem. It's a pipeline problem. It's a talent

22

23

problem. It's" -- you know, it's anything else, aside

23

24

from people having biases. And I'm just kind of tired

24

25

of it.

25

Scandinavian countries. I think you had France in
there, right? Was it just a lack of data that it's
well-off white countries, the only ones we're talking
about? That very well may be the case.
But my point is, obviously, our global
competition that we're facing every day is frequently
from places other than that. You know, Brazil, India,
China, Korea, that's what I think about when I think
about folks competing with the United States. And
obviously, the United States measuring itself against
Norway, Sweden, this is -- you know, it's like Palm
Beach measuring itself against Beverly Hills, you know.
MS. DOMINGUEZ: Right. No, there is data in
terms of global data. In fact, I just got back from
Mexico. I was there -- we rang -- a number of women
rang the stock exchange bell for the first time in the
history of Mexico, but they only have five percent
women representation in Mexico. So we still have a
long ways to go.
The United States is comparing itself against
the countries that have actually shown significant
progress in this. But when you talk about Asia, the
Pacific, we're just not quite at that critical mass
yet, as some of the European countries. Colombia,
actually, is doing quite well in Latin America.

Surprising.
MR. GRAHAM: Annemarie?
MS. TIERNEY: So one of my questions, when I
looked at the statistics on the racial diversity is the
percentages on boards, how they translate to a
percentage of what you would deem qualified applicants
in the marketplace. Because I think part of the
problem, at least for women in my experience, is there
is -- I think there is still not a clear path to
becoming a board director for a lot of women in
different categories of professional experience and/or
potentially for people of different ethnicity or race.
So, do you have to kind of self-select that
you want to become a board member? I think that's the
first step for everybody, make a decision on their own.
And how do we encourage more people to self-select, to
want to be board members, to increase the pool of
diversified candidates, to be considered? And so I
think that's a challenge, and I don't know how you
solve for that.
How do you get people of different race and
ethnicity wanting to be on boards, like a Laura or a
Sara or a -- you know, or a me. Like, how do you
create a pipeline for education and opportunity,
networking? So many board memberships are based on

Page 108
1

not want to self-select. Am I white? Am I Asian? I

2

have other nieces and nephews, cousins' children, who

3

are biracial, you know, Caucasian/African-American.

4

They may not want to self-select a race. But if you

5

put a picture of somebody in a proxy statement, then

6

their ethnicity is more clear.
But that's -- you know, I wouldn't like to see

7
8

a chart that sort of says, you know, "I consider myself

9

white and Asian," or, you know, confusion, right? So I

10

don't know the best way to disclose diversity, but

11

photographs might be a easy way to kind of get that

12

conversation started.
MR. GRAHAM: You know, I don't know the best

13
14

way, either. But -- and this -- I mean there are a lot

15

of things to think about. The more you think about it,

16

the more complex it gets.

17

But, you know, I don't think people should be

18

required to self-select. I think that if someone wants

19

to identify themselves as this or that, they should be

20

allowed or encouraged to do so. But I don't think it

21

should be a requirement. That's just my view.
Laura?

22

MS. YAMANAKA: So I totally agree with that,

23
24

because I prefer to think of myself as a strong,

25

intelligent businesswoman first, who happens to have an

Page 107

Page 109

1

personal relationships with CEOs and other people at

1

ethnic identity, and who happens to be a woman, right?

2

the management level. That's a time-worn problem for

2

So I totally agree with that.

3

anybody trying to become an executive in a public

3

4

company in the United States of America. We need to

4

5

have a different pathway to self-select. You want to

5

6

become a board member? Different educational processes

6

applaud everybody who had a part -- Xavier, the SEC,

7

and a better, more diverse pool.

7

Stephen, you know, Sara -- of bringing this

8

conversation to the forefront. Thank you, Cari, so

9

much for providing some context and background. And to

8
9

You made the comment that, you know, there was
some diversity candidates who are recycled from one

I have so much to say here, right? So much to

So, first off, I want to say I really do

10

echo Robert's point, it's a difficult conversation,

11

other options for the companies who were doing the

11

right?

12

board recruiting at the time? Were they looking for

12

13

diversity and the candidates just weren't presented to

13

time, so it's just, hey, you know, you just -- heads

14

them? That would be some information I would love to

14

down, and you're working, for the most part. And when

15

understand. Like, how do we create a more diverse pool

15

you have the opportunity to sit and listen to this

16

of appropriately-educated and experienced candidates to

16

conversation and think and dwell, it is -- I think it's

17

meet expanded search criteria? That would be one thing

17

really important to understand how critical everybody

18

I think should be a goal of anybody looking to

is in this room to actually changing something. Right?

19

diversity their board.

19

So the fact that we can have a conversation

I mean I don't play in this world all the

The second thing was just kind of a basic

20

about this, and have difficult conversations, and have

thing on disclosure. A really easy way to disclose the

21

varied positions on this, is a good thing. And we need

diversity of your board is to add pictures in your

25

select. I have biracial nieces and nephews who might

25

20
21

That said, I do think this committee and our

28 (Pages 106 to 109)

Page 110

Page 112

1

purview is in a very select area. We do not have the

1

was money. Where are we going to put investment in?

2

authority, nor are we mandated, nor I think people are

2

And maybe it was to equal opportunity and all that

3

interested in talking about quotas, et cetera. It's

3

stuff, but to me, the factual impact of that was to see

4

talking about disclosure. So, within that context,

4

how seeding money into a broad section of just out

5

however, I think it's really important to understand

5

there education would allow women to achieve so much

6

that people make changes in behavior, one, because they

6

more in other areas. So again, money and information.

7

-- morally, and they feel it's right. But more often

7

So, when I look back at our role in what we

8

because of money or information. Right?

8

do, since we can't hand out money, either, we have

9

information as our tool. And how can information -- if

So we've talked about the money. It's better

10

that you are going to be more profitable, you're going

10

we put it out there, how are other people going to use

11

to do better in your industry if you have diversity in

it to make the best economic decisions for the -- for

12

place.

12

our economy?

13

Information. I would prefer not to go with

13

14

the shame and whatever that phrase is -- it's out of my

14

is a mature economy, right? We can't afford to leave

15

head -- because, as Sara said, nowadays, with social

15

half of our bench or -- how much, you know, 70 percent,

16

media and the Internet, you know, pop that out there.

16

90 percent of our bench, 50 percent of our bench -- on

17

And the comment about Silicon Valley, have you guys all

17

the table. When you constantly read how well we do, it

18

been reading about the Silicon Valley?

18

is because of our diversity. And we've only been

19

playing part of the team.

19

Yeah, thank you, Jonathan. It's interesting

When we look back at global, the United States

20

to note, because that's been the last -- in the last 30

20

As companies such as China, Russia, everybody

21

years they're talking about, that is the big producer.

21

else, whatever you say, the globe catches up with us in

22

That's the big economic gain, as far as industry goes,

22

the easy things, we're going to have to play more of

23

in the United States. And they're back in the

23

our bench. And economically, it's going to be our

24

eighties, as far as things go. So I don't think that

24

decision on how we do it, which leads me to, like, my

25

strictly economic drive parity.

25

last point: It's a matter of time.

Let's talk about pipeline. Pipeline, I
totally get that, because I too -- you know, when I
first started out, I was 3 in my accounting class,
right, which -- and now, you know, it's over 50 percent
that are women. The interesting thing is, if you look
at the people who run companies, partners in law firms,
in accounting firms, whatever, that pipeline appears
not to be linear.
Like there is something that happens, and we
still have the representation and leadership of people
not getting to those top positions for I don't know
what reason. And there could be many, okay,
structurally, within how law firms and CPA firms are
structured, social constraints, all those things. I
don't know why, I don't think that has a place in
discussion here. I just want to say, factually, the
pipeline alone doesn't appear to be working.
I want to bring up another observation, title
nine. You guys all know title nine, right? It's what
allowed women's sports to blow out, you know, in -- as
far as, you know, entertainment goes, as far as
opportunities for women. And actually, as far as
assisting in the leadership of women in business roles,
government roles.
So, that was an allocation of funds issue, it

Do I think, eventually, we're going to get
there, no matter what we do, in spite of what we do?
Absolutely, because economics are going to eventually
-- to your point, you know, if you're the only one not
doing this, it makes sense you're going to be out of
business.
But do we want it to take 86 years? Okay, so
that's the point. And do we have 86 years or 100 years
or 40 years, or whatever it is? Title IX, within the
space of one generation, boom, got us into the playing
field. Is it completely fair yet? No, but nothing
ever is. But it became significant, it became
material. And I think that's what we're looking for
right now.
I was very disturbed about the stats when we
talk about -- we have better compliance, publiclytraded companies, because it makes sense, they
understand the PR, they understand the pressure. That
pipeline of people coming up on the under -- under your
public -- it's dismal. And when you look at Silicon
Valley, which is heavily weighted to non-public, and is
the high-growth entity, again we see the same things
being replicated.
So, as far as if we could use anything that we
could do from an informational basis to level the

playing field -- I'm not talking about giving anybody a
free ticket, because, frankly, I think, if you asked
anybody who's been on the outside, looking in, they
don't want to get a free ticket, they just want to get
an opportunity to play and strike out. Right? Not
everybody is going to make it. Not everybody should.
The best, we want the best. We just want to take off
the blinders, as far as what defines the best.
And again, if we could just figure out a place
so that the free market evaluates what the best is, and
we can quantify it, based on the financial results,
then I think it just makes good economic sense. Thank
you.
MR. GRAHAM: Thank you.
Yes, Brian?
MR. HAHN: Just a kind of a story from the
trenches here, and I'd like to -- I think Annemarie hit
on a great point.
So our CEO is a female. She's a co-founder.
She's also been a board member for the last 13 years.
For the last two years, at the board-level discussions,
there has been discussion about trying to identify and
find another female board member as an independent. In
the past year-and-a-half the board has identified and
approached three women for a board position, but

Page 116
1

of interest and availability onto the board, isn't

2

happening. And I find that baffling. I mean what's

3

going on there? I just don't know.
MS. DOMINGUEZ: I was actually a partner with

4
5

two international search firms, and I can tell you some

6

stories about that. I did a search for a biotech

7

company in the Los Angeles area that had no women. And

8

they had been trying for three years. The board

9

members had been trying for three years to find a

10

woman, until finally they called a search firm and I

11

was the person. I found them 16, and then they had a

12

problem trying to select.
I think part of the challenge -- and that also

13
14

speaks to Annemarie's point -- part of the challenge is

15

if it's the first board that a woman gets on, or a

16

person of diverse background, there is a certain

17

reluctance. And so the reason why these diverse board

18

members are over-boarded is because they call each

19

other. The CEO calls the CEO of the other company and

20

say, "Does he fit? Is this a cultural fit? Is she

21

okay? Does she" -- it's a -- you know, the dynamics of

22

corporate governance, no one wants to have those

23

disrupted.
And so, I think, from that perspective, it's a

24
25

challenge. Even if you find them, you know, 10

they've already had their plates full, or they're in
very high demand.
Now, there was a 2014 survey done on small and
medium businesses in my industry, and it showed that 46
percent of the women have an interest in becoming board
members. So it's not a lack of ambition. I think it's
just how to identify that pull. And I think, you know,
industry-specific, I think there is something, you
know, industries need to do to be able to come up with
identifying who -- you know, these potential board
members.
MS. HANKS: Stephen?
MR. GRAHAM: Sara?
MS. HANKS: Yeah. In response to that, I
mean, one of the things I've remarked over the last few
years, there are some search firms who are specifically
targeted with the, okay, we need a fill-in-the-blank.
You are the guys who know fill-in-the-blank, go fetch
us one of those for the board. And there seem to be
quite a few of them, and I end up, you know, talking to
some of them.
And I'm not sure what's happening there,
because there seem to be a qualified pool of people, a
qualified pipeline of intermediaries who have taps into
those people. And then the final piece, the conversion

Page 117
1

candidates, if some of these candidates haven't been

2

tested in terms of being -- serving on other boards --

3

so that's -- to your point, that's the big leap to

4

have.

5

The other point I wanted to make to

6

Annemarie's, we just had the big National Association

7

of Corporate Directors annual summit. We had one whole

8

session on how to get on a corporate board. It was

9

standing room only. And these individuals were all

10

extremely qualified and highly frustrated, because of

11

what I just talked about, the fact that, you know, to

12

get to a board requires more than just skills. You

13

have to have a sponsor, you have to be approved. There

14

is a lot of sort of the intrinsic issues or values that

15

people convey that aren't written down.

16

And when I was doing searches, if I wanted to

17

replace a CFO, which I did many times, there was -- the

18

perception was somebody who looks like me. You know?

19

That was the first reaction. And so, six feet one, and

20

I bring a five-three candidate, and there is this bit

21

of -- you can tell the reaction.

22

So, I think, from a cultural perspective, and

23

from the dynamics of unconscious bias, which you

24

referred to, I think those are some of the barriers

25

that really are affecting the parity. And I hope it

30 (Pages 114 to 117)

Page 118

Page 120

1

doesn't take 40 years, but that -- you know, we have a

1

2

number of CEOs with daughters and professional wives,

2

greater social decision.
But it's out there, whether we acknowledge it

3

and they're actually leading the charge to make sure

3

or not. And I think, again, that's why we have to do

4

that --

4

things that are uncomfortable, and perhaps push things

5

MR. HAHN: Just to follow up on that, just to

5

along a little bit more because, again, it's going to

6

be honest, you know, being an emerging growth company

6

happen because economics, I think, are in play. It's

7

and watching all of our costs, you know, we will go to

7

just can we afford the time that it's going to take.

8

the recruiter model next. But it was if we can save

8

How can we accelerate that, if we know this is a good

9

money and try to find it through our networks first,

9

thing?

10

that's what we'll try. And obviously, it's just not

10

11

happening yet. So we will move to the paid recruiter.

11

note, to note that, you know, implicit bias is out

12

there, it's in every aspect, I think, of our society.

13

going to tell a story that I told Annemarie earlier.

13

And I challenge anyone to say that they are not biased

14

At my career point I feel I've had the opportunity and

14

in some way about some thing. The issue is getting

15

the luxury of being surrounded -- environments like

15

people to admit it, to acknowledge it, and to begin to

16

this, where your credentials are taken at face value.

16

think of ways to counter it.

17

You know, yes, you have to prove you're not an idiot,

17

18

but it's like being a female, being an Asian, okay,

18

appropriate disclosure, I think an unintended but good

19

whatever, it's nice, you know? But it's not a

19

consequence might be that we encourage people to think

20

significant factor.

20

about it and perhaps acknowledge, you know, maybe the

12

MS. YAMANAKA: You know, Brian, that's -- I am

MR. GRAHAM: Yeah. It's important, as you

And I think that, as we work on what might be

21

So I have the opportunity to be honored by my

21

pool is a little bit deeper than we thought, and maybe

22

college, who shall remain nameless -- actually, this is

22

there is some bias that has entered into the equation.

23

not nameless, right, it's public -- hopefully they

23

I think that's important.

24

don't see this. So I was at a special reception for

24

Anyone else? Xavier?

25

The honorees, and I took my husband. And it was very

25

MR. GUTIERREZ: I just -- I guess I'll close

interesting, because I didn't know this group of people
because I did not keep in touch with my college alumni.
So there's all these muckety-mucks, people, their
sponsors, et cetera, and they kept coming up to my
husband and congratulating him on being honored.
I was shocked. That hasn't happened to me in
years, because -- which is my point, because the
networks that I go in, I'm proven, they know who I am,
I'm pre-vetted, I'm validated. This was -- I rarely go
into a completely brand-new network where I have to go
based on visuals, and the visuals was the guy in the
suit who is taller than me has got to be the honoree,
right? And then he kept going, "Well, no, no, no."
And so, it is -- these are good people. These
are good people. They -- highly successful, clearly,
doing really good things. I really do think that
implicit bias, whether we acknowledge it -- all of us,
all of us, they said, right, we all have our implicit
biases. Not necessarily for gender, not necessarily
for race. It could be geography, it could be class, it
could be food-based, it could be style, and how you
dress. Whatever, we all come from a frame. And I
think once we understand that we all do come from a
frame and get comfortable with making decisions that
are in conflict with that frame, that's probably the

it in asking the question that I ask myself all the
time, which is what is the role of an SEC in this?
What is the role of a public pension fund in this?
What is the role of quasi-public enterprises in terms
of this matter?
You know, and I don't think there is an easy
answer. I think you heard this discomfort with quotas.
As a person who gets approached to sit on boards, it
would bother me if it was to meet a quota, because I
see it as a business imperative. I see this as I'm
adding value, and this is important for the business
enterprise. So, I wouldn't want to see that.
On the other hand, there needs to be something
that does have an impact. I think your example is
excellent, right? No one ever thought the impact of
that could possibly overlap into the business world.
They thought -- they wanted to equalize, you know,
athletic programs around the country.
So clearly, something needs to be a catalyst.
And I love to hear these initiatives on state-by-state
bases where they're saying this is important. When you
look at public pension funds, who are The pensioners,
right? And so that's an important connection to make,
as an investment pool, and how it should impact their
investment philosophy, which thus impacts this issue.

So, I think we -- you heard it in this

1

2

discussion. There is no one size fits all. But we

2

is a smaller reporting company for purposes of the

3

can't let that be the impediment to finding solutions

3

rationalized disclosures -- and I think we can give

4

that have results. So thanks.

4

some examples of areas where we think things can be

5

enhanced, but should avoid a laundry list of particular

6

provisions that apply or don't apply. The staff has

MR. GRAHAM: Thank you. Does anyone else want

5
6

to add a comment before we break for lunch?

MR. YADLEY: I agree. And starting with who

7

(No response.)

7

more expertise in that area, and there may not be

8

MR. GRAHAM: All right. Good discussion.

8

unanimity of opinion, anyway.

9
10

Thank you. Let's break for lunch and reconvene at
2:00. All right, thank you.
(Whereupon, at 12:15 p.m., a luncheon recess

11
12

was taken.)
AFTERNOON SESSION

13

MR. GRAHAM: Okay, might as well get started.

14

And then, in terms of the delivery of the

9
10

information, again, there is such a wide range of how

11

people use the information -- and certainly it's

12

generational -- as well as who is interested, analyst

13

versus regular investors. But while we want to make

14

the electronic information more accessible to the
extent it would impose burdens on issuers, you know,

15

Do we have a quorum? We still have the quorum, so

15

16

we're just reconvening, so I guess we still have a

16

XBRL times three expanded to non-financial disclosure

17

quorum.

17

and things like that, we should probably discourage

18

that.

Well, the first thing that I want to do is to

18
19

spend a couple minutes kind of recapping this morning,

19

MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Anything else?

20

as we begin to formulate recommendations -- we've got

20

Patrick?

21

the right framework. And starting with S-K, I think

21

22

the first thing we want to do is reaffirm our prior

22

understand what you said. Could you repeat what you're

23

recommendations. I think there is one in February of

23

planning on writing as a recommendation?

24

2015. I think we had a recommendation regarding the

24

25

definition of smaller reporting companies, as well.

25

Page 123
The sense that I got is that, though kind of

1

1

as we've gone down this path for a couple of years,

2

3

there has been kind of an emphasis on less disclosure

3

4

when we talk about this. And what is appropriate in

4

5

terms of less, as we try to define what scaling means?

5

6

But there seems to be kind of a more refined approach

6

7

from the standpoint of thinking in terms of better

7

8

disclosure, not more and not less, but better, and kind

8

9

of away from the notion of compliance, and more towards

9

10

what's of interest to shareholders' investment

10

11

decision.

11

This includes being more principles-based, it

12

13

includes, of course, being -- at all times being

13

14

transparent with respect to, you know, what's material.

14

15

It is finding ways to be less redundant, less

15

16

repetitive. And, you know, and in that regard I think

16

17

we feel that the ability to do more than cross-

17

18

referencing might end up being -- end up being useful.

18

So, I think, instead of trying to come up with

19

MR. GRAHAM: We aren't that far yet. We're
talking about framework.

Page 125

2

12

MR. REARDON: I'm sorry, I didn't quite

19

20

a laundry list of what we think it might be a good idea

20

21

to do, I think we should stick with kind of concepts

21

22

and kind of our own approach to principles, if you

22

23

will.

23

24

Does anyone have anything to add to that?

24

25

Greg?

25

MR. REARDON: Framework, okay, thank you.
MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Okay, the next thing we
talked about was board diversity. And if I can kind of
summarize where I think we came out was that board
diversity is certainly within the purview of the SEC,
and it kind of goes to the economics of enterprises,
that disclosure is important to shareholders, to
employees, to customers. And if it's important to that
group, then it comes right back around to it's
important to shareholders.
The issue that we have is the absence of an
adequate definition, and so that information that is
useful to investors will be generated. I think that's
kind of the gist of where we came out. I think we had
a good discussion this morning. There is -- but in
terms of formulating a recommendation, I think that's
the direction that we're heading in.
Anyone want to add to that?
(No response.)
MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Well, so let's go to this
afternoon's agenda.
First of all, as we mentioned this morning,
Chair White was offsite at a meeting. She was meeting
with the IMF. And so we missed her this morning. But
we're pleased to have her join us now. And Chair White

would like to make a few remarks.
CHAIR WHITE: Thank you, Steve, very much.
And good afternoon, everybody. I won't hold up your
agenda, but I did want to stop by to express my
appreciation for your being here again, you know,
sharing your experience, hearing your perspectives with
this. I mean I -- frankly, you can't say it enough. I
mean your efforts really do help us, and really do, you
know, inform what we need to be thinking about doing
for, you know, small companies.
So I will say also that I find your agenda
always of interest to me. Today I think you're four
for four on four of my priority areas. And I
appreciate the recap. I did get a little bit of a
mini-briefing when I came back into the building and
before I leave the building again, and I'll get caught
up on the full discussion. But I really do -- you
know, I'm really glad to see you discussing these
particular subjects.
I mean, obviously, you know, the disclosure
requirements in Regulation S-K, the Commission, the
staff, as you know, are very closely focused, you know,
on those, both in terms of small reporting company
issues, but also more broadly than that, as well. And
the objective is better disclosure, but we also

understand, you know, the issues that issuers have,
particularly smaller companies have with disclosure
requirements.
The diversity topic that Steve just alluded to
-- and I understand you had a very good discussion on
that. As I think you know, this issue is very
important to me, in terms of -- in particular, not
limited to, but diversity in the board room. I think
it's -- well, I was a member of a public company board
and audit committee when I was the only woman on the
board.
And, you know, I think, you know, look, I've
said it before, but I -- you know, I'll say it again.
I really saw firsthand what I think the research is
telling us, which is that it's just a much richer,
dynamic, better decision-making when you have diverse
boards and you also have, you know, the studies
indicating, you know, certainly correlation with better
performance by the companies, as well.
I've spoken before about what the staff -- you
may have spoken about this morning, in terms of -- you
did? Okay, so you know where that stands, in terms of
our looking at our own rule and recommendation for
amending that to make it really more meaningful to
investors. And then investors are interested in this

information. They should be interested in it. And so
that's why we're, you know, prioritizing that, as well.
Steve, our distinguished director of trading
markets, is about to update you on some of our equity
market structure work, and specifically we'll be
discussing the staff's perspective on the issue of
finders and other intermediaries in small business
capital formation transactions, which, obviously, we
know is of great interest to you.
I think, Steve, you're also going to give a
brief update on the tick-size pilot, which started just
this week to help us assess the impact of tick-sizes on
market quality for smaller companies. I really do look
forward to what that data will -- you know, will show
us. And, you know, lots of hard and painstaking work
certainly, you know, went into that. And, frankly,
whatever the data ultimately yields, you know, the
pilot really is reflective of, you know, our
appreciation that, you know, market structure should
promote capital formation for smaller companies, and
one size, you know, doesn't, you know, necessarily or
even often sometimes fit all. So, I really do look
forward to that data.
And then, finally, the last item on the agenda
this afternoon is I really want to thank you for what I

believe to be sort of The proactivity of this
committee, in terms of continuing ideas and suggestions
on ways to help more small companies become familiar
with the different avenues available for raising
capital in the securities markets.
You know, all of us, including staff -really, across the agency, but in corporation finance
-- the commissioners are very focused on this area kind
of across the boards, including, you know, how
Regulation A-plus is working, how crowdfunding is
working and being used by small businesses. And, you
know, it really is the case that, you know, we all
know, I mean, small businesses play such a vital role
in our economy.
So it's really very important that, you know,
not only that the various avenues be understood, in
terms of, you know, what's out there, but also how they
might work, how others have used them to good
advantage. You know, it could be really invaluable
information for other, you know, smaller companies. So
very much appreciate your work in that area.
So I promised I wouldn't interfere with your
agenda, so, you know, again, I just end by thanking you
for your service.
MR. GRAHAM: Well, thank you, and you're not

interfering. And if you would like to give more
remarks, you're welcome to do so.
(Laughter.)
MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Sara?
MS. HANKS: Okay, thanks. Well, I was very
pleased to hear the chair say four for four on
priorities, because there is a few of the items that
we're going to discuss with Steve Luparello today which
are very much things that we care about, too.
Much of our committee's focus is on matters
that are handled by the division of corporation
finance. This is, of course, disclosure rules,
exemptions from registration, but we've also got a lot
of interest in topics within the wheelhouse of the
division of trading and markets.
Like Corpfin, trading and markets has a very
broad mission. It regulates the major securities
market participants, including broker-dealers, stock
exchanges, clearing agencies, and FINRA.
We've previously talked about the finders
issue several times, and urging the Commission to take
steps to clarify the current ambiguity in broker-dealer
regulation for people who act as intermediaries in
private placements to identify or find potential
investors.

Page 132

companies. We look forward to hearing the results of

2

that.

director of the division of trading and markets,

5

Stephen Luparello. Steve returned to the SEC as

6

division director in February 2014 from the law firm of

7

Wilmer Hale, where he had been a partner specializing

8

in broker-dealer compliance and regulation, securities

9

litigation, and enforcement. He joined Wilmer Hale

10

after 16 years at FINRA and its predecessor, the NASD,

11

where he most recently served as vice chairman of

12

FINRA. Prior to his time at the NASD, he served as

13

chief of staff as the CFTC, and a branch chief at the

14

SEC.

We made a recommendation to the Commission
along these lines in September 2015. We have further
pointed out several times the need for some certainty
in this area, both for established business models and
the new online investment platforms popularized by the
Jobs Act.
I also want to note the continuing work by the
private broker task force of the ABA, which has been
nagging T&M for some 16 years now, also looking for
some certainty.
Going back to 2013, several times this
committee has taken up issues surrounding the fact that
the current U.S. equity markets don't always offer a
satisfactory trading venue for the securities and small
and emerging companies, because they don't provide
sufficient liquidity for those securities, and because
the listing requirements are too onerous for many of
them.
In 2013 we recommended the Commission adopt
rules that would allow smaller exchange-listed
companies to voluntarily choose trading increments or
tick-sizes greater than the current increment of one
penny. The SEC, happy to note now, has now put in
place a pilot to help assess The tick-size, The
effective tick-sizes, on market quality for smaller

Steve, thank you for being here.
MR. LUPARELLO: I think always in the interest

17

of time you should waive the reading of my resume,

18

which only makes me feel old. And the chair is

19

leaving, which is unfortunate, because I was going to

20

yield my time back to her, but --

21

(Laughter.)
CHAIR WHITE: But I figured he would just step
on your line, right?

MR. LUPARELLO: So I'm -- thank you, Sara, for

the introduction. And I'm happy to sort of talk on a
variety of topics, but I know there are certain topics
that are of specific interest to you, and I'll do my
best to hit them along the way.
I think Mary Jo started with a discussion of
the tick pilot, which did, after a very, very long
wind-up, go effective on Monday. It's a -- as we
usually do things in the secondary markets, it's an
extended roll-out, where it won't be fully in place
until the end of the month. It's a two-year pilot.
But unlike, I think, other pilots we've done in the
past, I think we've gotten a little smarter on this,
where we are actually evaluating data as we go.
So, historically, what we've done is we've put
pilots in place that come to an end, and then we've
started to study what the implications were. And that
tends to drag things on. And you're generally faced
with reaching a conclusion of either shutting it down
and incurring the cost of starting it back up, or just
keeping it going, irrespective of whether you've
decided it's a good idea because you need the time to
study.
So we've built in milestones during the twoyear period, which will allow us to evaluate The
efficacy of The pilot.

One other thing about that. I think when a
number of folks were advocating the idea of different
tick-sizes, they made those points for a couple of
different reasons. Ones that always appealed to sort
of the traditional market reg types were that it would
enhance the quality of the markets, right? You'd have
deeper quotes, you'd have less price dislocation, you'd
have a greater ability to transact in size.
Others want to step farther than that, and
said encouraging market makers back in the space by
allowing them to quote in wider ticks allows them
perhaps to make more money in the provision of that
liquidity, and they could redirect that money to
reviving their long-abandoned efforts to provide
research for issues in that space. That may happen,
that may not happen. I don't think that's -- my
personal view is that's not the litmus test for whether
The tick-size pilot would succeed.
I think if we just see improvements in the
quality of the secondary markets and none of those
profits get redistributed to other places in the firm,
or the market makers that do that never had research
arms, are never going to get research arms, that we
would still probably consider the tick pilot to be a
success.

confusion problems. And if there are rules we have in

2

place that seem to interfere with the ability to launch

3

a venture exchange, let's talk about that, let's see

4

what we can do to remove them.

5

even in my testimony on the Hill is that, while I'm

7

fairly ambivalent on the notion of venture exchanges, I

8

was the biggest fan of venture exchanges that was

9

testifying in front of Congress.

Obviously, I think we would hope for a variety
of good things to happen that would enhance the quality
of the market, but also the coverage of the market and
-- by research and by, you know, by broader
participation. But again, I think our goal of what is
success that would allow us to keep this as a permanent
change to the market is probably a little bit more
modest than some of the advocates for it in the first
instance.
You know, we've tried to do other things in
the small cap space, and to pick up on the chair's
words about an appreciation that market structure is
not a situation where one size fits all. That said, I
think we have found very little traction from the
participants in the markets. And I remember testifying
a couple of years ago on venture exchanges, because
that was an idea that was getting a fair amount of
conversation at The time. And I think our position at
the time was that we always have to balance the need
for efficiency in the market with the possibility of
investor confusion. Our assumption is that investor
confusion can probably be solved.
And so, we went out -- you know, basically our
outward-facing position was come into us with ideas,
and talk to us about how we can solve the investor

(Laughter.)
MR. LUPARELLO: I don't think the industry has

12

figured out how to make money in that space. And so,

13

to a certain extent, all we can do is continue to

14

demonstrate that we are open to ideas and innovations.

15

We can't sort of create the innovations for them.

16

So, we will continue to find ways to make sure

17

we're being as open and flexible to these types of

18

conversations. But at the end of the day, if people

19

can't figure out how to make money in the space, then

20

the space is going to stay the way the space is.

21

You know, Mary Jo alluded to the fact that

22

we've got a broad market structure agenda. It's moving

23

across a variety of fronts. Honestly, most of them

24

have to do with the more liquid end of the market, this

25

larger cap end of the market. But I can hit on that in

Page 135

What I found in both those conversations and

a very, very short period of time.
We've got a number of proposals that are out
for comment, and the comments have come in, and we're
working diligently on them. One is around greater
transparency for alternative trading systems. One is
about greater transparency for institutional-sized
order flow. There is a couple that are -- involve just
-- not entirely on point for the next topic, but
somewhat similar -- on registration of broker-dealer
issues.
And then the very important one that we're
continuing to work on is -- and it's directed
specifically at some of the high-speed trading that is
so dominant in the marketplace at this point -- is an
anti-disruptive trading rule, which would define a
certain subset of trading by a certain subset of market
participants that, as a general matter, wouldn't
violate any fraud principles, and would, on most
occasions, be considered legal trading, but at certain
times of market stress would be viewed as too
destabilizing to be permitted.
So, there are a variety of other things,
including a pilot on access on maker-taker access fees
that are also in the works. And one very big thing
that we're moving along on that is more of a market

35 (Pages 134 to 137)

Page 138

infrastructure initiative, not a market structure

1

2

initiative, is the consolidated audit trail, where we

2

3

have a 180-day deadline that is in the month of

3

4

November, which is -- so I'll leave here and go back to

4

5

working on that.

5

But there is plenty in the market structure

6

6

7

space. But like I said, I think a substantial amount

7

8

of that is -- tends to be where people's focus tends to

8

9

be in the market structure, which is at the more liquid

10
11

9
10

end.
So, mostly for the purposes of taking a deep

11

12

breath and a sip of Diet Coke, I will ask if there are

12

13

any questions, and then I'll move on to your other

13

14

favorite topic.

14

15

(No response.)

15

16

MR. LUPARELLO: That's usually the look I get.

16

17

(Laughter.)

17

18

MR. LUPARELLO: So I understand there are some

18

19

-- that my staff has appeared before this committee and

20

had helpful dialogue in the past on some issues of

21

broker-dealer registration, but I'm not entirely sure

22

I'm specifically up to speed, and I want to make sure

23

I'm responding to the right questions.

24
25

19
20
21
22
23

So the extent to which these are conversations
around the -- clarifying the status of participants in

24
25

with Reg A-plus and crowdfunding and 506(c) may
indicate that there is still a need for honest people
who are willing to comply with reasonable regulation to
be able to help companies raise money.
MR. LUPARELLO: And so, in -- I'll pick on
you, Greg, just white shirts and green ties to one
another -- so the recent FINRA rules on capital
acquisition brokers, in terms of attempting to get at a
definition of reasonable regulation, where a
substantial portion of the rule book would not apply to
entities that, obviously, have -- do a very finite
business, but it sounds like the business that I think
you are talking about -- does that miss the mark? Does
that help? What's the general view on that?
MR. YADLEY: That is a regulation that I think
has merit for other parts of the capital-raising
community. But, for example, as you know, part of the
rule talks about transactions involving qualified
purchasers. If that were accredited investors, that
would really have helped. And, in fact, that point was
made and FINRA determined that that was not the right
way to go.
But we don't have a lot of qualified
investors, qualified purchasers investing in a $1
million transaction or a $2 million transaction for a

market as broker-dealers or not as broker-dealers,
based on certain types of conduct, when this committee
has had these conversations in The past, what type of
conduct is generally the focus? Or is it a number of
different areas?
MR. GRAHAM: Great?
MR. YADLEY: I'll start. I wear a white shirt
and a green tie. So Steve and I will have an identity
of interest here.
(Laughter.)
MR. YADLEY: It is a whole bunch of issues,
but I think, most succinctly, it's building on to the
ABA task force report, which I'm a former co-chair of,
and the idea that there is limited participation by a
number of intermediaries that help foster capital
formation, and yet the regulation that goes along with
being a finder in the most narrow sense, or being a
limited intermediary who engages in activities that are
activities that broker-dealers engage in, except that
these are people who don't hold customer funds or
securities and don't operate on exchanges and really
act as advisors to smaller businesses, those are the
kind of issues that we think have been impediments for
companies raising capital.
And, in fact, some of the early experience

Page 141
1
2

start-up.
MR. LUPARELLO: So it's more around the scope

3

of the business and who they can interact with than it

4

is around the rules they get relief from and don't get

5

relief from? Or is it you wouldn't entirely concede on

6

the latter?

7

MR. YADLEY: Yeah, I think it's more than

8

that. But again, in it's most simplified form, it's

9

someone who -- and the finder issue, hopefully, is one

10

that can be addressed more easily. But even someone

11

who does more than make an introduction for a fee on a

12

contingent basis still shouldn't be subject to -- I was

13

happy to be quoted by one of the commissioners this

14

morning -- the panoply of broker-dealer regulation.

15

MR. LUPARELLO: So, look, I think there is a

16

reason why the finders have been a conversation for 16

17

years, because there are two sides to the transaction,

18

and they don't seem to be moving expeditiously or,

19

frankly, at all towards each other. Right?

20

And I think one of the ways in which that

21

conversation tends to get discussed is in the context

22

of old no-action letters, including Paul Anka, right?

23

And I think, historically, the division has taken a

24

very narrow view as to what Anka permits and what Anka

25

does not, you know, give coverage on. And I think our

36 (Pages 138 to 141)

25

general understanding is that maybe the industry has
moved it a little farther than the division would have
wanted to move it, and has locked that in as basically
tacit no-action relief.
I think we are generally appreciative of that.
And, you know, I think if we take it away, we would
take it away in a more formalistic way. But I suspect
that in these conversations, which have always been
very polite and nice, but seemingly not moving in any
expeditious direction, it's because the gap continues
to be pretty wide. That especially when you're talking
about the prospect of reaching out to the full breadth
of customers, including retail customers -- and if you
have retail customers and you have transactions and you
have transaction-based compensation, that strikes at
our core and we have a very difficult time, just based
on The nature of The instrument getting comfortable on
it.
So I think there hasn't been a whole lot of
movement over The years because both sides haven't
moved very much.
MS. HANKS: But if I could just respectfully
make the point that if we don't have any movement,
especially with the way the online markets are moving
-- and these are online markets which are dealing not

Page 144
1

specific area of uncertainty, but we've got a whole

2

area which is now increasing. You know, the cone of

3

uncertainty, like a hurricane, is getting bigger every

4

day.
MR. LUPARELLO: And those other areas -- so we

5
6

have provided, obviously, some narrow guidance in the

7

private issuer space, which was considerably narrower

8

than the initial request. So I think we both signaled

9

what we -- where we were and where we weren't at that

10

point.
So, in terms of other areas where -- and

11
12

likewise, to the same in M&A, right before I arrived --

13

so in other areas where you think we haven't spoken at

14

all, what are those areas of focus?
MS. HANKS: Being in the business, you know,

15
16

what is the nature of being in the business. And I

17

would circle back again to some of the questions that

18

were raised by the task force. I mean there is a lot

19

of unanswered questions there. And if we could add

20

online platforms to that, and get answers, that would

21

help a lot.
MR. LUPARELLO: And the online platforms are

22
23

doing what that is different from both what finders

24

have to -- what finders and other have traditionally

25

done in the space, as well as what the platforms are

Page 143

Page 145

1

just with accredited, but with non-accrediteds, we are

1

doing in the context of crowdfunding? What are they

2

either going to end up somewhere that you really don't

2

doing that is in that gray area?

3

like but haven't said that you really don't like it, or

3

4

we'll have regulation by enforcement, or nobody knows

4

honest. I mean it's a complete variety. But there is

5

what they're doing.

5

-- I know that -- you know, I represent some clients

6

who look at things and say, "How can they do that? How

And a point that I've made in the past is, for

6

MS. HANKS: It depends on the platform, to be

7

the companies -- for the intermediaries who are

7

can they put out that video? How can they put out that

8

absolutely trying to do the right thing, it is so

8

social media?" You know, there is a very wide range

9

unfair to them --

9

there.

10

MR. LUPARELLO: Absolutely.

10

MR. LUPARELLO: No, I think that's --

11

MS. HANKS: -- to be complying, when everybody

11

MS. HANKS: And a lot of it technology-driven.

12

else is, hey, we can do whatever we like. We can

12

13

solicit, we can send out emails, we can advertise on

13

14

the TV. And this is not helping anybody, and it's just

14

15

going to get worse.

15

MR. LUPARELLO: So the reaction to us

16

MR. LUPARELLO: And their compensation
structures are likewise all over the map?
MS. HANKS: Yeah.
MR. REARDON: I'm Patrick Reardon. My

16

comments are -- well, this has been going on for 16, 19

17

rescinding Anka would be what? And I'm not -- I'm just

17

years. If there ever has been a bureaucratic Waiting

18

asking that as a --

18

for Godot, this is it. Okay?

MS. HANKS: Hypothetically, if you were to do

19
20
21
22

that -MR. LUPARELLO: Thank you for asking the
question better. I appreciate that.

19

I mean I don't care about -- we're asking

20

questions after 16, 19 years? You should know all the

21

answers to the questions by now. There are people out

22

here stealing in my home state of Texas who are

23

(Laughter.)

23

unlicensed broker-dealers. I have spoken to -- who was

24

MS. HANKS: It would only be a very small part

24

the lady who was -- had a corporation finance under

25

Mary Shapiro?

25

of the overall uncertainty. I mean that is one

heart, but just can't afford to comply, if we had a

MR. REARDON: Yeah, I spoke to her, I talked

simplified registration. And you can ask all the

to somebody in the office in Fort Worth. I mean

questions you want to ask. I don't care what you do.

MR. LUPARELLO: You should become a

MR. REARDON: I became a whistleblower. I'm a
badass.
(Laughter.)
COMMISSIONER STEIN: You'll become a rich
badass, too, if you're -MR. REARDON: Well, I don't care about that.

MR. LUPARELLO: Yeah, no, I agree. And I also

5
6

think that there are probably a lot of people out there

7

who would rather -- if broker-dealer regulation wasn't

8

burdensome, and that's why I think we encouraged FINRA

9

to go down the road of capital acquisition brokers.

10

And I don't think we're married that they've got the

11

four corners of that entirely right.
If there are ways in which it can be made a

12

13

I mean there are people who are stealing from our

13

little bit more flexible, both in terms of the business

14

clients. I call the SEC, I said, "I've got an

14

you're allowed to do and the rules you need relief

15

unlicensed broker, somebody in your division."

15

from, I think those are things we're willing to

16

"Well, yeah, they're unlicensed. Don't you

16

explore, because I agree. I think the much better

17

get in bed with them and do a deal with them, because

17

answer is to get the good people inside the tent and

18

you'll be aiding and abetting, a violation." But you

18

create -- eliminate the distance -- sort of them being

19

won't pass a rule that says, you know, what is a

19

outside the tent.

20

limited exemption.

20

But I also agree that the -- that always needs

21

to be married with a reverse enforcement program, where

22

because I don't think, after 16, 19 years, you're going

22

you sue people for acting as --

23

to pay any attention to me.

23

21

I'm not going to go to the trees and tell you,

24

MR. LUPARELLO: So --

24

25

MR. REARDON: What I think is Congress is

25

MR. REARDON: Oh, absolutely. I am all in
favor of enforcement, and I've made that clear.
And when will you have a rule out proposed on

Page 147

Page 149

1

going to have to step in here and do this, because you

1

this?

2

all have had plenty of time to do all this. I am

2

3

frustrated, as a lawyer, and I am even more frustrated,

3

4

as a taxpayer, because there are people out there who

4

5

are being stolen from, and you all just sit on your

5

6

hands and ask questions.

6

MR. LUPARELLO: A rule proposed on what?
MR. REARDON: On a limited financial broker
whose -MR. LUPARELLO: So -MR. REARDON: To sell in private placements.
MR. LUPARELLO: So -MR. REARDON: Okay. After 16, 19 years,
what's the schedule?
MR. LUPARELLO: I believe the schedule is that
The FINRA capital acquisition broker rules go into
place six months after they put out a notice, which is
at some point in the month of October. At that point I
think broker-dealers who -- people who are acting as
unregistered broker-dealers and who claim that, given
the marginal nature of the business and the great
burdens of being a regulator -- being regulated -don't have that argument any more. And so, one would
hope we would see even more 15(a) stand-alone
unregistered broker-dealer cases.
We don't do rules -- occasionally we do rules
-- that define broker-dealer. But I think our
definition of broker-dealer probably stays the same.
Our enforcement of unregistered broker-dealers, when
there is an easier path to be a broker-dealer, is

7

MR. LUPARELLO: So we -- I am a big supporter

7

8

of bringing stand-alone 15(a) cases, and I have worked

9

very closely with the director of enforcement to bring

9

10

stand-alone 15(a) cases. They aren't the sexiest cases

10

11

in the world, right, because a lot of times there isn't

11

12

actually customer blood on the floor in the instance

12

13

where you find it, but you are preventing blood on the

13

14

floor later on in the process.

14

8

15

So, can't actually speak for 14 to 17 of those

15

16

16 to 19 years, but I can say with Andrew at -- in --

16

17

as the head of enforcement, and in conversations and

17

18

interactions on what's important to our collective

18

19

programs, unregistered broker-dealer cases, despite the

19

20

fact that they're not terribly exciting, have become a

20

21

much greater priority. And there are a lot more cases

21

22

in the last couple of years than there have been,

22

23

historically.

23

24
25

MR. REARDON: Well, it would help separate the
crooks from the honest -- the people who are pure of

24
25

38 (Pages 146 to 149)

Page 150

2

something where you make the progress.

Page 152
1

MR. REARDON: So you would totally defer to

MR. LUPARELLO: Well, and those are policy

2

calls that are, frankly, over my pay grade. But what

3

FINRA's rule. So if I'm registered with FINRA, I'm

3

you said at the last point is the counterweight to

4

good with you.

4

that, right, which is walking away from registration of

5

broker-dealers, especially a subset of broker-dealers

6

that interact with retail customers, is something that

7

the Commission, I think, would do only with great

8

hesitation.

5

7
8
9
10
11
12

MR. LUPARELLO: Well, if you're registered
with FINRA, you're also registered with us.
MR. REARDON: Okay. So that's a limited
registration with you, is what you're saying.
MR. LUPARELLO: I don't believe there is that
notion of a limited registration with us.
MR. REARDON: I mean is it a 15(b)
registration or not?

9

MR. YADLEY: Well, but also -- and, you know,

10

we're not debating. As Patrick said, the information

11

is out there. It hasn't been demonstrated that the

12

kind of people we're talking about are committing

13

MR. LUPARELLO: I assume it is, yes.

13

fraud. It's just not where we've seen it. You know,

14

MR. REARDON: Okay. Thank you.

14

these are -- we're trying to get people regulated in a

15

MR. LUPARELLO: Sure.

15

reasonable fashion, not have them out there doing

16

MR. GRAHAM: Greg?

16

whatever they want to do.

17

MR. YADLEY: Yeah. I think what a lot of

17

18

people were hoping would be acknowledging that the SEC

18

that too -- because, as I'm sure you know, many states

19

is, you know, a political -- there is a political

19

have regulations that, in the private placement area --

20

dimension -- small P -- to it. But I think a lot of

20

and I am from one in Florida, where I don't have a

21

people were hoping for leadership. And we talked

21

private placement exemption. If somebody that fits

22

about, you know, name and shame this morning in another

22

within the definition is getting paid, and people, for

23

context, but if the Commission is going to punt to

FINRA, why not have an exemption from federal broker-

24

and say, "Greg, start the meter, tell me how to run my

dealer registration for limited concept? This

25

life." They meet people, they get introduced to

Page 151

Page 153

committee has recommended the state registration would

1

2

-- could be a condition of that.

2

3

I think the North American Securities

3

4

Administrators, there is a whole bunch of

4

5

constituencies there, all the different states, and yet

5

6

they've been effective on a number of fronts recently,

6

7

working together.

7

8
9

And somebody has got to be the leader here,
and I think Patrick's frustration and others has been

And it's a real problem -- Patrick alluded to

8
9

10

that, yeah, we have the states and we have FINRA and we

10

11

have the SEC, and many of us hope -- because we have

11

12

such high regard for the SEC, sincerely, or we wouldn't

12

13

be here today -- that -- we hope you take a couple of

13

14

lumps to the head and lead this. If you can't do it,

14

15

or you feel it's not appropriate to do it -- but there

15

16

is lots of investment advisor and other areas. This is

16

17

federal, this is state. And if we have to -- if FINRA

17

18

becomes the arena, then that's where we'll go. But --

18

19

and, of course, Capitol Hill.

19

20

But, you know, I think most of us believe

20

21

that, if the -- something within the SEC's purview, the

21

22

agency will do a better job because it has more

22

23

expertise and it's not capital-P political, and

23

24

therefore will get better regulation that protects

24

25

investors and helps capital formation.

25

people, they are happy when somebody says, "Look, I
would love to help you. If it doesn't work out you
don't have to pay me anything. But, you know, if I
introduce you to my friends, and I help you raise
$100,000, yeah, you can pay me X."
I mean we know that that is within brokerdealer land. But it shouldn't have to be regulated by
a full FINRA registration.
MR. LUPARELLO: And again, I think we will
continue to look for ways in which very narrow stripes
of the business can be relieved of those obligations,
and then we will continue to look for ways in which we
can relieve fully registered broker-dealers from a
substantial portion, including all of the regulatory
burden that doesn't particularly apply to that
business.
And I think, you know, I will come back again
after the capital acquisition broker rules are in place
and get your sense for whether you think those are a
good start or not, but I think that's the approach.
MS. KASSAN: I have a question. There is an
intrastate exemption for broker-dealer registration, is
there not?
MR. LUPARELLO: There is.
MS. KASSAN: Okay. But I guess we're -- it's

39 (Pages 150 to 153)

Page 154
1

narrow, so people aren't -MR. LUPARELLO: I don't know that there is a

2

Page 156
1

And there are a lot of issues associated with that, but

2

there is a gap, in terms of having everyone kind of

3

single broker-dealer taking advantage, because,

3

have a better appreciation for where the capital

4

obviously, any interaction with a customer outside of

4

sources are.

5

the state is going to destroy the intrastate broker-

5

6

dealer exemption.

6

this all works. For example, at our last meeting we

In addition to that, there is a gap as to how

7

MR. GRAHAM: Anyone else?

7

spent a lot of time with Reg A-plus. I think -- I know

8

MS. HANKS: What about tick-sizes and the

8

that I was enlightened in a significant way in kind of

9

forming a greater appreciation for how Reg A-plus could

9

like?

10

actually be a good vehicle for capital formation. I

11

we're looking forward to the data, and we're hoping

11

wonder how many smaller companies out there who could

12

that we see real improvement in the quality of these

12

benefit from this really appreciate what it's all

13

markets, because they are not as well served. They are

13

about. And I would guess the number is large.

14

not -- one end of the market is extraordinarily

14

I think that when we think about, you know,

15

arguably over intermediated, and this one is

15

sources of capital, there are traditional sources that

16

significantly under-intermediated. So we're hopeful it

16

might meet some of the needs of this sector that are

17

does bring immediate improvements to the quality of the

17

kind of on the angel side. I think that there are

18

markets, and then, with the ability to trade in size,

18

probably other things that -- you know, such as

19

the -- you see greater participation by a greater

19

foundations -- that are interested in, you know, for

20

segment of investing public. So we're optimistic.

20

example, certain -- the development of certain drugs to

21

treat certain diseases, where if companies kind of

22

understood those sources, they could tailor their
businesses to tap into those kinds of sources.

10

21
22

MR. LUPARELLO: So, you know, I -- again,

MR. GRAHAM: Other comments? Steve, do you
have any more?

23

MR. LUPARELLO: No, I think that's it.

23

24

MR. GRAHAM: That's enough? Okay. Then I

24

25

guess we will excuse you. And thank you for coming.

25

Page 155

Page 157

1

MS. HANKS: Thank you, Steve.

1

2

MR. GRAHAM: Okay. We're going to turn to

2

3

outreach to smaller companies regarding capital

3

4

raising.

4

5

And beginning with our initial planning

5

6

meeting in February of this year, most of us have noted

6

7

at one time or another that there are significant gaps

7

8

in awareness among small companies about the various

8

9

sources of capital, as well as the securities

9

10

regulatory framework. And even if they are aware, they

10

11

may not be sure how to figure out how all of this

11

12

applies to their business.

12

13

Education about options is important, and I

13

14

know that most of us take this on at a micro level in

14

15

our day jobs, one company and one founder at a time.

15

16

But we thought it would be helpful to focus on this in

16

17

a more targeted way, and spend some time brainstorming

17

18

ways to increase outreach in a more macro level. So,

18

19

you know, again, we have touched on this from time to

19

20

time in passing, and maybe spent a total of 60 seconds

20

21

on it, you know, waiting for the day when we would have

21

22

this conversation.

22

23

The premise, again, is that we have a

I think there are industry groups that would
get -- you know, perhaps join with in terms of, you

23

24

situation where we are trying to find ways to encourage

24

25

capital formation with respect to smaller companies.

25

know, helping to get this kind of information out to
smaller companies.
Aside from identification of resources, there
are -- we could think in terms of events that could be
geared toward providing this kind of education. And I
know that the SEC does some of this now, and maybe it
can, you know, spend a couple minutes, you know,
talking, you know, speaking to that. But then -- and
let's open it up for a conversation about, you know,
how we might tackle this one. So -MR. GOMEZ: And Steve, I hadn't prepared
anything, but I will -- happy to tell you what we are
doing. And Julie, chime in. Julie has been also very
active in the area of outreach.
So I viewed the work that we have done so far
to reach out to three major type of market
participants. We often participate in PLI seminars or
ABA panels, talking about what the Jobs Act has done,
what the new exemptions are. Those events are geared
towards those of you who are here in the room who are
lawyers, and you are interacting with the client, or
those who are attending those presentations and are the
ones that are interacting with their clients, to make
sure that those advisors understand what the different
exemptions are and how they may be helpful to their

40 (Pages 154 to 157)

Page 158

Page 160

1

respective clients when their clients comes to them.

1

different constituencies, and trying to get The

2

Because the reality is a lot of you in the

2

information to those different constituencies. Pretty

3

trenches are going to be the ones that are going to be

3

much almost -- Julie has done several events. Others

4

approached by a company who comes to you and says, "I

4

in the office, we have teamed up with the division of

5

need to raise capital." They may not know how to raise

5

trading and markets, specifically when it comes to

6

the capital. But part of what your job as a lawyer

6

crowdfunding outreach because of the fact that a lot of

7

advising that company would be is what are the pros and

7

that relates to intermediaries and the work that

8

cons of raising capital.

8

funding portals do.

9

I, as a government staffer, can't tell someone

9

But that's a type of outreach we've done. I

10

that they should use one rule over another one. I can

10

would love to hear from the committee about creative

11

tell you what the rules are, but I think it's probably

11

ideas to deploy what you know are very limited

12

your role, as a lawyer, to provide that advice, itself.

12

resources, both from the standpoint of money and people

13

What I found the most enlightening about that -- and

13

to be more effective.

14

Steve, you alluded to it -- I think sometimes the bar

14

15

is a little hesitant to embrace new things.

15

talk about those meetings or conferences or whatever

16

they are where you've got a relatively small group of

16

And when you go to an ABA panel or a PLI

MR. GRAHAM: Thank you, Sebastian. When you

17

presentation and you are talking with people who are

17

passionate people on the woman, minorities, and

18

very used to companies raising capital in the form of a

18

veterans side of the equation, and you've got people

19

registered offering and form S-1, and you are telling

19

there that are saying, you know, "Help me, tell me" --

20

them about what the new features of Reg A are, in a way

20

you know, "Just tell me what the framework is, tell me

21

you are trying to change what has been the practice,

21

what, you know, where I might find the capital," it

22

what people really know. Is it the right approach for

22

really does sound like that's, you know, exactly the

23

every client? That is going to be your role. But my

23

kind of conversation that needs to be had. How do you

24

role is to give you the tools to know what the

24

expand that?

25

exemptions are, so that you can help your client. So

16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

that's one point on outreach.
We have been doing outreach alongside the SBA
and the office of minority and women inclusion to
business owners themselves, and specifically minority,
women, and veteran-owned businesses. I find those
events to be extremely rewarding. They are very
different than an ABA panel. And don't take offense,
for all of you who go to the ABA presentations. But
they tend to be smaller events, we're talking about 25
to 50 people, who are not lawyers, for the most part.
They have broad ideas, lots of energy. They are
excited about what they're doing. They need capital,
and they want to know what their options are. It's
very refreshing to speak at those events, because you
can feel the passion from those business owners.
The third one that I also think it's important
that we've done, some of it, is also to reach out to
the investors. I went and spoke at the Angel Capital
Association event. Angel investors are very used to
506(b). Well, 506(b) is not the only way to raise
capital. There is other options out there. So I
wanted specifically to talk about Reg A and what Reg A
permits and what the difference are between a security
that you acquire pursuant to Reg A versus 506(b).
So, our approach has been trying to address

MR. GOMEZ: So also, let me tell you what the

Page 161

16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

challenges are with those, and why I liked the fact
that we partnered with the SBA. Like -MR. GRAHAM: Yeah, because I think -- excuse
me, but I think that this is important from The
standpoint of figuring out some mechanism so that we
understand their perception of what the issues are.
MR. GOMEZ: Yeah. So the challenge is always
the fact that we can tell people what the options are,
people always want to know, "Which one should I do?"
And I can't provide that assistance to them at those
events.
The SBA, on the other hand, does have regional
centers, when they can -- someone asked me at the first
event that we did in Baltimore, someone said -- they
raised their hand after the presentation, they
described their business, and they said that they
realized that the next thing they needed was to put
together a business plan, and they didn't know where to
start with the business plan. The -- our colleague
from the SBA pointed them to their regional center in
Baltimore, and invited them to stop by and try to get
help there.
Part of the challenge is what can I say and do
at those events. A different challenge to the events
is when we go to these events we are reaching out the

41 (Pages 158 to 161)

local population in that area. The U.S. is huge. And
trying to capture all of the U.S. is very difficult.
So how do we reach -- and I'm not sure I have the
answers. If I did, I think we would have put them in
place.
But how do we reach parts of the country where
people have ideas, they need the capital, but are not
the traditional areas where people expect that there is
going to have the infrastructure of a SBA regional
center, incubators, and other groups? How do we reach
those parts of the country where there is certainly a
need, but there isn't infrastructure to support them?
Is the idea to do a webinar? Part of the
question is if we just film one of these outreach
events, and we just put them on the website, would that
help? Part of the challenge is I think it would help
with some aspects of getting the outreach out there.
But at all of these events what we experience is that
people have questions, questions that may not be
answered by one canned presentation.
So, how do we create a situation in which we
actually encourage that? So we've done some outreach
in which people can actually type questions and the
questions are asked by a moderator live. We tend to
keep the presentation pretty short, 15 minutes, 20

Page 164
1

facility and a point of contact for a group of people

2

that we know are interested in this subject matter. So

3

that has worked well.

4
5

to be a topic that I'm incredibly passionate about.

7

And I've been spending the last 10 years actually

8

trying to educate entrepreneurs on how to raise money.

9

And you know, within the law. And I'm just amazed --

10
11
13

who -- she was raising about $500,000, she wanted to be

14

able to have both accredited and unaccredited

15

investors. Her lawyer said, "Oh, well, you have to

16

have much more extensive disclosure with unaccredited

17

investors," because this lawyer doesn't know about rule

18

504. You know, it just drives me nuts.

19

know, even those of us who really focus on this area, I

21

will admit I send Julie emails from time to time,

22

asking her questions, because I'm -- you know, it's not

23

always completely clear to me what the right answer is.

24

So, you know, having resources for lawyers who really

25

would like to be able to help their clients understand

Page 165
1

your questions.

2
3

4

parts of the country that we don't know the question

4

5

exists?

5
6

7

the -- I don't know how many regional centers the SBA

7

8

have, but I know the SBA has got deep, deep links into

8

9

so many incubators and accelerators, and I know this

9

10

because the last couple of years I've been one of the

10

11

judges in the SBA's accelerator contest. And I did not

11

12

know there were that many out there, seriously. There

12

13

is a huge number in places where you think -- and one

13

14

of The criteria I always use is is there a need here

14

15

that can't be served by somebody else because of, you

15

16

know, regionally, where you are?

16

17

So, there are some fantastic incubators,

17

18

accelerators out there that The SBA knows who they are.

18

19

Can we use them? Can we do ask-me-anythings, with

19

20

everybody who is there?

20

21

MR. GOMEZ: So two of our events with the SBA

So, lawyers need a lot of education. And, you

20

minutes. And then most of it is Q&A, ask away, ask

MS. HANKS: But if I could ask something about

MS. KASSAN: I'm just amazed how many lawyers
don't know -- I was just talking to someone recently

2

6

(Laughter.)

12

1

How do we provide those answers to people in

MS. KASSAN: Sorry -- thank you. This happens

6

Page 163

3

MR. GRAHAM: Laura?

21

22

actually were hosted at the facilities of incubators.

22

23

And the idea was not just those who are being helped by

23

24

the incubator, but also others in the community could

24

25

come. So I think they're a great resource to have a

25

all the options I think is so important.
I actually just got a book contract from
Berrett-Koehler. I'm going to be writing a book on
this exact topic, how to raise money if you're a small
business, you know, what are all the options. I host
two live events a year on this topic, I do webinars on
this topic. I have -- you know, I have really tried to
understand all the different options that are
available.
And it is amazing to me how many people don't
-- including lawyers, do not know. And it's very
confusing for people, for non-lawyers, especially. You
know, 504, 506(b), 506(c), what is all this? You know?
The intrastate exemption, it's so confusing. So, there
really is a need for more resources to -- for
everybody.
And a third issue I've noticed, a lot of my
clients who are using creative tools to raise money, I
tell everyone, you know, really, everyone can be an
investor. Yes, you can raise money from unaccredited
investors under rule 504, for example. But then my
clients go out and talk to potential investors, and the
investors say, "Oh, I'm not an investor." They don't
understand, either, that, yes, it's perfectly legal for
them to invest in a small business. And yes, you know,

42 (Pages 162 to 165)

17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

it's an exciting opportunity.
So there is a need to educate lawyers,
entrepreneurs, regular folks who don't even understand
what it means to be an investor in a small business.
So I just want to help in any way I can, you know. I
want to interview everyone for my book if you have
things to contribute, because I really want this -- you
know, I want this book to possibly be a tool that will
be, you know, used by many all over the country.
MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Thank you for that.
Laura, you had something?
MS. YAMANAKA: Yeah, I think that what I'm
going to say is not going to be pleasing to anybody,
because where have we ever thought there is one
solution for everything, right?
And, in reality, if -- because I get clients
all the time who run the full scope for -- they come
in, they come through my door, we haven't met or
anything. They go, "I want to go public." Right?
(Laughter.)
MS. YAMANAKA: And I'm like, cool, this is
going to be a big client, I'm going to make a lot of
money, there are structures in place. And I go, "Okay,
let's look at your financials first."
"Well, I need to get some." Right?

Page 168
1

So, I -- you know, I remember I was talking to

2

one of my staff people, and I go, "I'm going to send

3

you to this conference, we're going to sign you up for,

4

like, these classes on this," and they're going, "Why

5

don't I just look on YouTube first, before we spend all

6

this money?" And then, "Could I take the money if we

7

save, and do something else," right? And, sure enough,

8

The YouTube was there. The issue was how do we

9

validate what's good and what's quality versus not.

10

And then, if we could then have, like, 101 on

11

capital with a sanctioned source that is not, you know,

12

Joe Bloe Fly By Night YouTube, The resources that they

13

can go to get one-on-one help that are valid, and how

14

do -- how -- and maybe even a session that says, "How

15

do I evaluate who is good and who is not?" What is a

16

good accountant? What is a good, you know, attorney?

17

What are the things that I should be asking?

18

And then have them be aware that some people

19

are one-trick wonders, right? I mean it's the whole,

20

hey, I know how to use a hammer, and I'm going to keep

21

using the hammer, and this is the only kind of

22

financing I do, and I'm going to tell you this is the

23

only kind that you can get.

24

So, again, I think a lot of the infrastructure

25

is there with the SBA, with the incubator groups.

Page 167

Page 169

1

(Laughter.)

1

Well, I shouldn't say that. For large economic areas,

2

MS. YAMANAKA: And -- yes. And so -- and, of

2

The LAs, The coastal areas, certain parts of the

3

course, they're not making money. And they go, "Well,

3

Midwest. There is a vast majority, I think, if you

4

I've heard, I saw that you don't have to make money to

4

don't have access to that locally, it's going to be

5

go public." And technically, they're right, right? I

5

strictly online. But if you could have a validated,

6

mean there have been companies that do so.

6

secure, safe, sanctioned, legitimate source, and then a

7

And on the other hand, you've got people that

7

listing of resources to say, "Go here for blank, blank,

8

have finally shown up, and they said, "I've done all

8

blank," that's kind of, to me, the simple way to do it,

9

this research, but I don't know who to believe, because

9

because you're not going to get around.

10

when I go out there I've spoken to 42 different

10

11

accountants and attorneys, and they're all telling me

11

and miles to, you know, go out and talk to groups of 25

12

conflictory things."

12

people.

13

So, even if you just go in and Google "how to

13

Sebastian, you don't have enough budget, time,

(Laughter.)

14

raise capital," you know, there is all this -- there is

14

15

quacks out there, and there is legitimacy. So I think

15

are asking you about, you know, "I want to get capital,

16

-- and then you're talking about the human touch,

16

and first thing I have to do a business plan," you

17

because that's what people are craving.

17

know, they should be disallowed immediately.

18

So, I've always thought it would be so great

18

MS. YAMANAKA: And, frankly, the people that

So, I mean -- and 90 percent of the people who

19

that we could get some kind of sanction, like an SEC

19

show up to those things are. So I kind of think it

20

site that says, like, simple YouTube, "How to Raise

20

might be easier, in a way, to reach a broad, legitimate

21

Capital, Part One," you know, "What Does Capital Mean,"

21

constituency, I should say.

22

and go all the way from, like, cradle to grave.

22

23

Fifteen minutes, make it short, because, actually, more

23

24

and more people go to YouTube to get their preliminary

24

25

research, and particularly when you're younger.

25

MR. GRAHAM: That's a good idea, Laura.
Sebastian, can we do that? Have you already
done it?
MR. GOMEZ: So we get about 1,700 calls a year

43 (Pages 166 to 169)

Page 170

Page 172

1

in OSBP with questions about interpretive guidance on

1

2

mostly exemptions. I can tell you that the vast

2

related calls, and that's fine. We try to point them

3

majority of the answers to those questions, we answer

3

when we can to the right place, but, you know, I'm just

4

them by pointing the people to something on our

4

glad they called at all, because I'm sure the folks who

5

website, where the information is already there.

5

want to comply are the ones calling. There's a lot who

6

are not calling, right? But we're happy to talk to
those who do call, and point them to the right place.

6

So, the question is, how do you deploy that

7

vast amount of information? So what I was -- in my

7

8

head I was nodding as you were talking about it. I

8

9

mean we have on our website a document that talks about

9

10

what's a security. And perhaps the question is how do

10

11

you present the information.

11

So, you know, they're not all securities-

But I definitely take your point, that no
one -MS. YAMANAKA: YouTube.
MS. DAVIS: Very few people can find the

12

But it's written to go through the process of

12

13

what's a security, why do I have to deal with the SEC?

13

14

What are my options if I want to register? Because a

14

and a camera like this I think would be a very low-cost

15

lot of people want to do the IPO, initially, until they

15

pilot. How about piloting it?

16

find out more about it. What are my options if I don't

16

17

want to register and I want to do an exempt offering?

17

say this. We would have to talk to our general counsel

18

And then, what are The differences between a 504 and a

18

and see all this stuff, but I think it would be very

19

505 and a 506(b) and a 506(c)? What's crowdfunding?

19

hard to do a video that's 15 minutes that even begins

20

What's Reg A?

20

to start to scratch the surface.

21

And then, part of what that document also

21

information, even though it's there.
MS. YAMANAKA: Seriously. Seriously, YouTube

MS. DAVIS: And I think we could -- well, I

So I think it would -- I'm not saying that we

22

includes is, well, what if you just want to reach out

22

couldn't do it, it's just you have to talk about

23

to others, like the SBA. The SBA -- I would love for

23

whether you -- look where -- these are securities.

24

Mark to have been here today. I mean the SBA has its

24

That's all we can cover. We're not going to do loans

25

own programs to facilitate that.

25

-- or, well, loans of security, but we're not going to

Page 171
1

do SBA loans, we're not going to talk about other forms

2

you don't have it in the form -- in my opinion -- that

2

of capital-raising.

3

people can easily digest. They've got attention spans

3

4

of this, especially entrepreneurs, right? Like this.

MS. YAMANAKA: You have the information, but

Page 173

MS. KASSAN: Also, is it up to date? Because

MS. DAVIS: No, it's a good idea.
MR. GRAHAM: Greg?

I remember seeing something about the from S-2 up there

6

7

not too long ago for a small business --

7

9
10
11

MS. YAMANAKA: And I wouldn't even go with the
acronyms and the S-2s, whatever. They need intro, and
then -MS. KASSAN: Well, my point is that I just

it's just an idea.

5

6
8

MS. YAMANAKA: Do it in modules. So anyway,

MR. YADLEY: Yeah, and not trying to pile on

8

here since Steve has left, but you have a green blouse

9

on, so it goes with my green tie.

10

For part -- for some deals, for some issuers,

11

having private placement broker, as we've talked about,

12

remember there being some stuff up there that wasn't

12

is an access point. It doesn't answer, you know, which

13

actually up to date. So --

13

exemption do I need to rely on here, and what's better,

14

MS. DAVIS: I'm sure there is stuff that is

14

but the investor doesn't really care what the exemption

15

not up to date. I mean I -- when callers call, and

15

is and what the acronym is. They want -- how do I -- I

16

we're the ones on the front lines that get the calls, I

16

need this much money. How do I get it? And you get it

17

mean I often have to say, "Our website is like my

17

from the people who have the money.

18

grandma's attic, in that everything is in there, but

18

19

you just can't find anything."

19

your question, Sebastian, is how do we put the people

20

that need the money together with those that have the

20

And so, I mean, I walk them to the spot that

So, that was really the fundamental thrust of

21

talks about the difference between 506(b) and 506(c),

21

money? And we know that, for large amounts of money,

22

and then they're -- they get it. But that's one

22

for companies that are going to really go places, there

23

person, and we talk to 1,700 of them, and a few of

23

is plenty of people willing to advise them. And we are

24

those calls are, "How do I register my local hair

24

now -- we have the ability since May to see what will

25

25

happen with crowdfunding, where people want a

relatively small amount of money, and it wasn't the
SEC's fault, but done a good job implementing rules
that now have them go through somebody other than a
full registered broker-dealer, and we'll be able to see
how that works.
And so, I mean, these are all good starts, but
a lot of these fundamental educational things -- I mean
I think one of the things Laura was chomping at the bit
to say when you said we've got the Q&A on the website
is, yeah, but you need a video with a telegenic person
like Stephen Graham to give the message, and then
people would listen, you know, because -MR. GRAHAM: Great idea, Greg.
MR. NELSON: How do we, as a committee, get
you guys more resources to do that education? Because
I completely understand that you guys are tapped out,
and I don't know how in the world I would come to a
job, knowing that part of my job is to regulate $14
trillion worth of securities every day.
MS. DAVIS: Every year since I've been here,
you know, the chair has put up a budget request to
Congress, and it includes lots of many things that she
would like more resources for. And sometimes that gets
granted, and sometimes it doesn't. So, you know, it's
really not just above -- certainly above my pay grade

Page 176
1

underneath the SBA. But there is clearly a goal of

2

everyone in that, you know, field, which is to be there

3

as a potential resource for capital. So that's one

4

point.

5

that I think Laura was alluding to, which is there is a

7

continuity of capital for businesses, right? What's

8

needed as a start-up is not what you need for growth

9

capital, it's not what you need before a pre-IPO, or a,

10

you know, sort of established business, whether public

11

or private.

and Sebastian's and Keith's, and even Chair White's,
but it's -- I mean, ultimately, you know, Congress -MR. NELSON: It's a congressional
appropriation sort of thing?
MS. DAVIS: Congress appropriates our funds,
even though our funds come from securities
transactions, not from the taxpayers. Congress has to
appropriate the amount. And, you know, within that, we
-- the agency has some discretion on how it's spent.
But at the end of the day it's Congress that makes the
call on how much money the SEC gets.
MR. GRAHAM: Any other thoughts? Oh -MR. GUTIERREZ: Just a quick comment. You
sort of alluded to the comment I was going to make,
which is, you know, working with other aspects of the,
you know, kind of government infrastructure, right, so
The SBAs, even The state authorities, in terms of their
department of business oversights, their departments of
finance, or what have you. And so, you know, using
your limited resources to piggy-back on what's already
there.
So that would be -- and I don't know what that
looks like, I don't know what you guys are allowed to
do. But clearly, your component, as the SEC, is very
different than perhaps The SBICs, or The SBIRs

And I think that lesson is probably the

13

biggest lesson that sometimes businesses need to learn

14

and understand, that you are in this stage of your

15

formation, as a business. Here are the resources that

16

are more appropriate for you, rather than showing up

17

without, you know, financials, and saying you're going

18

to go public. Right? That's just -- that's a mismatch

19

that we see all the time, and we own a bank in Southern

20

California, and sometimes we get folks who show up and,

21

really, they don't need debt financing, they need

22

friends and family, you know, investing, to be quite

23

honest.

24
25

Page 175

The second point is to also accept something

So, that's another part of this discussion
that I would suggest you all incorporate.

MR. GRAHAM: Okay -MS. KASSAN: Can I say something about that
real quick? I agree with that, but I also think there
is -- I have noticed that in -- with the information
that is out there, there is kind of -- I would say the
Silicon Valley model of a high-growth company tends to
be the assumption when you, you know, kind of Google
around about how do you raise money, and that's such a
tiny percentage of the businesses in our country.
You know, so few -- the companies end up
having that high-growth model, so that whole idea of,
like, seed stage, series A, series B is completely
irrelevant to, like, 99.9 percent of businesses. So it
drives me crazy that that's sort of the main
information that's out there. And a lot of my clients
who maybe have, like, a restaurant or a girls camp are
saying, "Oh, I think I need to raise my series A now,"
you know, and they -- we need to really make sure that,
you know, that people understand that each situation is
different, and they need to really choose the path
that's right for them.
Maybe they only need to raise money once, and
then they will break even, or maybe they need to do it
multiple times, et cetera.
MR. GRAHAM: Any other ideas? Outreach?

MS. TIERNEY: You know, I know that there is a

3

4

lot of educational programs across the country, you

4

5

know. Is there a way that there could be, like, some

5

6

kind of information aggregation so that you could point

6

7

people to different educational opportunities available

7

8

to them?

8

Because I know, like, again, kind of Silicon

9

9

10

Valley-based, but we opened an entrepreneurial center

10

11

in San Francisco a year ago, and what we do there is

11

12

educational opportunities for, like, any level of

12

13

start-up entrepreneur, and they come in and we have a

13

14

sponsoring law firm. Wilson Sonsini is our first-year

14

15

sponsoring law firm. We have a sponsoring accounting

15

16

firm, which, I think, is PwC. We have a venture

16

17

capital firm sponsoring. And they literally do

17

18

programs every single week to help people understand

18

19

here is how -- like, one of Sara's favorite things that

19

20

Sara ever said to me that -- you know, what's really

21

important is, like, you're starting a company. You're

22

telling me, like, some LC guys wanting to issue stock,

23

right?

24
25

20
21
22
23

Like, so people don't actually know what
they're talking about. So here are opportunities to

actually understand here is how to incorporate a
company, here is how you access all these different law
firms' model forms, and lots of firms have them. But,
like, is there a way for us to help you aggregate
educational opportunities for these people, incubators
and others that will offer that kind of basic
information in a kind of YouTube -- more format than
something long that they have to read?
MR. GOMEZ: In -- the challenge that comes to
mind is we can't be viewed as endorsing any one
specific aspect.
MS. TIERNEY: I'm talking about, like -- yeah.
MR. GOMEZ: And at the same time, if it is
completely a -- there is nothing that prevents the
incubators to come together, or an angel capital
association type group from coming together and
identifying different products. The question is, who
is the one that it's -- actually sanitizing what's in
there?
And Laura was the one that mentioned, I think,
it's -- if you raise capital, I mean, you see a lot of
stuff out there, and a lot of the stuff that I am not
sure I would send my worst enemy to. So part of the
thing is how do you keep tabs over it to make sure that
the content is actually correct when we, as the

government, are -- can be viewed as giving an advantage
to one over another one by endorsing one over another.
MR. GRAHAM: You know, it's -- this really is
a big -- I mean there is a pretty wide swath of ground
we're trying to cover with this idea, if you will. And
we're not going to come up with any one or two or three
ideas. And I think it might have been a point I think
Laura made to address this issue.
One thing we do know is that there is an
information deficit in this community. I think that we
should satisfy ourselves by taking the first couple of
steps in the direction of closing that gap, and not
think in terms of how do we completely solve this
problem.
I think we've heard some good ideas which
might lead us in that direction. If we can figure out
how to leverage the SBA, how to leverage the
incubators, and even what is currently on the SEC's
website, I think that that's kind of where we start.
But I think we're going to have to -- this is going to
be a long, I think, process, you know, to get to the
point where, you know, those communities that really
are lacking in these resources, you know, get to the
point of where they're actually being served.
MR. GOMEZ: And let me take it back as one

baby step, if I may, of revisiting our small business
web page, and see is there a way that we can be more
helpful on the information that's already there, as to
how to present that. So let us take that as homework
for us to think about and look at it.
We talked this morning about scrapping the old
10-K and starting from scratch. Let us take a look at
that and see if -- not to claim that I have any
technological ability to remodel our website, but let
us take a look at that and see what we can -- how we
could reframe that.
MR. GRAHAM: Okay.
MR. NELSON: If you guys actually need help
with that, I have friends who are actually in the U.S.
Digital Service, proactively helping departments of
government actually build better websites that actually
have better -- communicate in a better way.
We have writers on our staff, and we help our
start-ups pitch things all the time. I don't -- I mean
I don't want to break any rules, but I would happily
help volunteer some of our staff to help start writing
some of these things to try to translate them into
plain English.
MS. KASSAN: Me too.
MR. NELSON: Because, like, as an

entrepreneur, it took me three years to learn that to
raise money in Silicon Valley meant selling stock. I
thought that I was going to try and sell technology.
And then, the further I got into it, I realized that
securities were the words that I actually needed to be
searching for, not necessarily selling stock. And then
securities, wow, that's a big, scary word. And loans
are also securities. And it's really been kind of like
a 9 or 10-year journey for me as kind of a quest to
realize how do you raise money as an entrepreneur.
Now I know that there is five ways, you know?
There is theft, which I do not subscribe to.
(Laughter.)
MR. NELSON: There is borrowing, there is
government grants, there is loans -- well, that's
borrowing -- and selling stock. And selling stock
generally means an angel or a VC or -- I'm sure I'm
missing things, but it's taken me a long time to get to
simpler, and that's very difficult. But I'm happy to
throw some resources at this because, if we answer
this, I think we move the economy.
And entrepreneurship is at its lowest point in
the United States. Like, small business formation is
at one of its lowest points in decades. So I think
this is actually really needed.

MR. GRAHAM: Thank you, Jonathan. I'm sure
that you have -MS. YAMANAKA: Can I just stick one more thing
in there, Stephen? I'm sorry.
There is a website -- you should look at our

So, that's the kind of stuff that, when people
go out and, you know, Google, and, hey, I'm getting to
government websites, so it must be kind of legit, and
then it's sending them down rabbit holes, right, in
essence. So if you could just -- if someone could do
the pre-link, because if I were an entrepreneur, you
know, I would be gone before this.
So it's a good effort, try. There is stuff
that's out there that works, and there is stuff that
doesn't work. If somebody could put it together in the
right order, so somebody doesn't have to go search,
search, search, drill down, go back up -- actually,
that's probably a business that somebody could actually
do and make a ton of money.
MS. KASSAN: I just want to add another thing
that might be a little bit kind of out of the ballpark
of what we're talking about, but there are -- a lot of
people are getting creative about new types of
securities. What you were saying reminded me of that.
And, you know, because people aren't always on the
trajectory for a sale of the company as a way for the
investors to get paid.
So there is this thing called a SAFE, a
Standard Agreement for Future Equity. There is
revenue-based loans. And one thing that I've noticed

Page 185
1

4
5

6

own government, .gov, websites, because there is stuff

6

7

out there already that, I mean, I go to all the time.

7

8

And it says, like -- it says at the bottom it's a

8

9

website of the United States Government. Who knows if

9

10

it really is, because it looks pretty cool, actually, a

10

11

very, very --

11

12

(Laughter.)

12

13

MS. YAMANAKA: Well, you know, very modern.

13

14

I'm not saying -- you know what I meant, and not how I

14

15

sounded.

15

16

But it's kind of interesting, because it says,

16

17

"You need financing?" It doesn't educate as much as --

17

18

answer these five questions: your geography, what kind

18

19

of business you're in, and whatever. And it gives you,

19

20

like, 37 different options for financing. Doesn't link

20

21

to anything, and it's, like, things like Department of

21

22

Treasury, CDFI Bank Enterprise Award Program,

22

23

Department of Treasury Community Development Financial

23

24

Institutions Program, you know, and DOT bonding

24

25

education programs.

25

is that these instruments tend to be very unclear.
It's very unclear how they're treated from an
accounting and tax perspective.
So, to the extent that we could get some
support from the IRS to, you know, maybe weigh in on
some of these questions, that would also be incredibly
helpful.
PARTICIPANT: Good luck.
(Laughter.)
MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Well, I think we're
getting pretty close to the end. I think it's been a
good meeting. Thank everybody for coming, and I
certainly appreciated some of the lawyer comments.
(Laughter.)
MR. GRAHAM: What we will do is, you know,
come up with some draft recommendations to try to line
things up for how we might go forward.
One thing that I wanted to do is talk about
next year. And Julie, do you -- we got some proposed
dates?
MS. DAVIS: I will send them around by email,
but we're thinking of meeting in February, May, and
September.
MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Do we -MR. NELSON: Are we having another one this

year, or are we done for --

2

MS. DAVIS: Not in 2016.

3

MR. GRAHAM: Okay. So that should be coming

4

shortly.
If we are not meeting again until February, I

5
6

think there is a good chance we might end up with a

7

telephonic meeting to talk about some of these

8

recommendations.
All right. Again, thank you for coming. See

you next time. Thank you.
