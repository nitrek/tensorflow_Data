In the Matter of

ORDER INSTITUTING
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS
AND NOTICE OF HEARING
PURSUANT TO SECTION 12(j) OF
THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934

LONGWEI PETROLEUM
INVESTMENT HOLDING
LIMITED,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate for
the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)
against Longwei Petroleum Investment Holding Limited (“Respondent” or “Longwei”).
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A.
Respondent Longwei (CIK No. 0001111817) is Colorado corporation
headquartered in Shanxi Province, China. All of its operations are in China. Its common
stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.
Longwei became a public company through a reverse merger in October 2007, and became
listed on the NYSE MKT in June 2010. On March 22, 2013, the NYSE MKT delisted
Longwei after the Company failed to respond adequately to requests for documents and
information. Longwei’s common stock currently trades on the “Grey Market” of the OTC
under the symbol “LPIH.”
B.
Longwei is delinquent in its reporting obligations under Section 13(a) of the
Exchange Act. Longwei last filed an annual report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended
June 30, 2012 on September 13, 2012, and a quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended September 30, 2012 on November 13, 2012.
C.

Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder

require issuers of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file
with the Commission current and accurate information in periodic reports. Specifically,
Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual reports, and Rule 13a-13 requires issuers to file
quarterly reports.
D.
As a result of the foregoing, Respondent Longwei has failed to comply with
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission
deems it necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative
proceedings be instituted to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II above are true and, in
connection therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such
allegations;
B.
Whether it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to
suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months, or to revoke the registration of each class
of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act of the Respondent.
IV.
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence
on the questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be
fixed, and before an Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided
by Rule 110 of the Commission's Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.110].
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by
Rule 220 of the Commission's Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.220].
If Respondent fails to file the directed Answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after
being duly notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be
determined against it upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be
deemed to be true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310].
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent personally or by certified,
registered, or Express Mail, or by other means permitted by the Commission’s Rules of
Practice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 120 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule
360(a)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. [17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2)].

In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission
engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually
related proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter,
except as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is
not “rule making” within the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it
is not deemed subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final
Commission action.
By the Commission.
