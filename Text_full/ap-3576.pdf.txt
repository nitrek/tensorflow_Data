PREHEARING ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings on November 9, 2015, pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A second prehearing conference was held today. Martin F.
Healey and Ellen Moynihan, Esqs., appeared on behalf of the Division of Enforcement, and
Respondent Sandip Shah, who is incarcerated at FCI Sheridan in Oregon, appeared pro se.
The parties advised that the Division’s attempt to make available its investigative file
pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.230 (Rule 230) was not successful. Specifically, FCI Sheridan did
not allow Shah to receive the Division’s production of two CDs, although an FCI Sheridan
official had told the Division that Shah would be allowed to receive such CDs. One of the CDs
contains a video recording that cannot be viewed by any other means. The Division will attempt
to resolve the problem and will report on its efforts by February 11, 2016. After the Rule 230
production is successful, further procedural steps will be ordered.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
