We do the right thing
That phrase has always been part of our culture, and it’s also one of our core values.
I am very proud that we make this an important part of our culture, and it’s why I
find myself speaking about the role of trust in rebuilding people’s faith in our industry.
Our commitment to ethical leadership is the foundation for our core values. We owe
our reputation—our most valuable asset—to this. It has made us one of the most
successful banks in the world.
For our customers, it’s about the experience we create when we truly know them,
help them achieve their financial goals and become a trusted partner. For our
employees, it’s about creating rewarding careers that allow us to work with great
people, to challenge us, and to help us make a difference by doing the right thing.
Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct shows us how to be the most trusted
choice for all our stakeholders. It’s our shared guide to operating with the highest
level of ethics and integrity, and it’s a vital part of our risk management strategy.
Read the Code and understand its key principles. Refer to it and seek guidance
when you’re not sure what to do. Speak up when you have concerns. Hold yourself
and everyone at U.S. Bank accountable for making our purpose, core values and
brand come alive.
I am honored to be a banker, and I am proud to be your partner.
Sincerely,

Richard K. Davis
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Speak up! How to get advice or
report concerns
The U.S. Bank Code of Ethics and Business Conduct addresses
the most common issues you might encounter, but it can’t cover
everything. If you have questions or need to report concerns about
possible violations of the Code, here’s what to do:
•	 Contact your manager (or higher levels of management).
•	 Contact your Human Resources business partner.
•	 See the “Ethics and compliance resources” chart on page 51.
•	 Call the U.S. Bank Ethics Line.
•	 Use the U.S. Bank Ethics Line Web Form. Visitors to this online tool
aren’t tracked, and you may make your submission anonymously, if
you wish. You’ll be taken through a series of questions to document
your concern, and you may attach additional documentation.
Remember, you’re responsible for speaking up when you believe our
Code has been violated. U.S. Bank does not tolerate retaliation against
anyone who reports a concern in good faith.
During investigations, we keep the identities of employees who report
concerns confidential to the fullest extent possible. We ensure that
questions and concerns are handled discreetly and thoroughly.

Section 1

We do the right thing
At U.S. Bank, we value high ethical standards above all else.
Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is our guide to
operating with integrity. Our commitment to high ethical
standards is the foundation of our purpose and core values.
Demonstrating our core values every day through our words
and actions is how we strengthen our ethical culture, deliver
a superior customer experience and elevate our brand.
The Code reflects and reinforces our core values. It’s
designed to help you understand the high ethical standards
we expect of all employees. Read it carefully and refer
to it whenever you need to. Ask questions if you need
clarification. And never hesitate to speak up when you
believe our Code has been violated.

1.1 Who must follow the Code
The U.S. Bank Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applies to
everyone who works at U.S. Bank and our affiliates. This includes our
employees and directors. Anyone who violates the Code may face
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
The Code doesn’t alter your “at will” employment relationship with
U.S. Bank, unless otherwise provided by law or you have a written
agreement for continued employment signed by you or your authorized
representative and the chief executive officer. We recognize your right to
resign at any time for any reason; similarly, U.S. Bank or its affiliates may
terminate an employment relationship at any time for any lawful reason.
Nothing in the Code is intended to limit or interfere with:
•	 Any employee discussing his or her compensation.

•	 Non-supervisory employees discussing the terms and conditions
of their employment, including wages and our employment-related
policies and practices.
•	 Any other employee rights under Section 7 of the National Labor
Relations Act.
You won’t be subject to discipline or termination if you discuss these
topics. If you believe this policy has been violated, report this to your
manager, Human Resources or the U.S. Bank Ethics Line.
The U.S. Bancorp Board of Directors must approve waivers to the
Code for executive officers and directors; waivers will be publicly
disclosed. The chief executive officer must approve waivers for
employees in writing.

1.2 Your responsibilities

1.3 Leading with integrity: a message for managers

Your role in maintaining our strong ethical culture is critical.
You’re accountable for:

We hold managers to a higher level of accountability for ethical
behavior. As a manager, you’re expected to uphold the spirit and intent
of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, demonstrate our core
values in everything you do and lead with integrity. This means:

•	 Following the letter and spirit of all laws and regulations and all
U.S. Bank policies and procedures.
•	 Treating all U.S. Bank employees, customers and business partners
with respect.
•	 Being clear, truthful, fair, transparent, responsible and accurate with
customers, regulators, suppliers, shareholders and other employees.
•	 Protecting our customers from harm. This includes protecting
their information and privacy and protecting them from unlawful
discrimination and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.
•	 Protecting our reputation as a safe and trusted financial institution,
which is an important aspect of our brand.
•	 Speaking up to report concerns and violations.
•	 Cooperating with investigations.
•	 Completing ethics training and certifying your compliance. You
must do this within 30 days of joining U.S. Bank. You must recertify
each year after that and complete ethics training as required. You’ll
receive communications about these requirements, along with
instructions and deadlines. If you don’t complete your ethics or other
required corporate training on time, you may lose systems access
or receive corrective action. It also may be recorded on your annual
performance review and, if applicable, your bonus compensation may
be decreased or withheld at the direction of the vice chair of Risk
Management and Compliance or Human Resources.
These are important responsibilities, and you should take them
seriously. Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct can’t cover every
situation or scenario you might find yourself in. It really comes down
to using good judgment. When you’re not sure what to do, just ask
yourself, “Is this the right thing to do?” If necessary, look to the the
resources on page 6 and page 51 for guidance.

•	 Being a role model for ethical behavior. What you say and what
you do must reflect our core values. As a leader, you set the tone.
You must demonstrate the behaviors we expect to see from all
employees. Help everyone around you learn how to do the right
things by showing them what the right things are.
•	 Promoting our culture of integrity. Make ethics awareness among
your employees a personal goal. Set the expectation that ethical
behavior is a day-to-day responsibility, and evoke our core values
and our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct during conversations
about goals and performance. Remind employees about the role
these core values play in our heritage, brand, current success and future.
•	 Fostering open communication. Emphasize that you value—
and expect—open and honest communication. Be available and
accessible, and create an environment where employees know they
can ask questions, raise concerns, discuss promotions and internal
transfers, and report issues without fear of reprisal. During meetings
and in casual conversations, regularly encourage your team to speak
up and come to you directly with any concerns.
•	 Recognizing behavior that exemplifies our ethical standards
and core values. By celebrating success, you reinforce our culture
of integrity and provide tangible examples to employees of how to
get things done the right way.
•	 Speaking up. Respond to misconduct and report violations. Take
appropriate action immediately by involving higher levels of management
or your Human Resources business partner when necessary or by
using the Ethics Line. Don’t attempt to investigate issues on your own.
Encourage employees to speak up about their concerns, and ensure
they can do so without fear that it will affect their job. Do not retaliate
against employees who report misconduct about any aspect of their
employment, including pay, job assignments, promotions, training,
fringe benefits and any other term or condition of their employment.

1.4 Non-retaliation policy	

1.5 Seeking clarification and reporting concerns—speak up!

U.S. Bank does not tolerate retaliation against anyone in connection
with a good faith report of an ethics violation, illegal conduct, sexual
or other forms of harassment, discrimination, inappropriate workplace
behavior or any other serious issue. Not only is retaliation a violation of
the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, it also may be illegal.

You’re responsible for understanding and complying with the U.S. Bank
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. You’re also responsible for
reporting suspected or actual violations of accounting, audit or internal
control matters, disclosure obligations, and laws and company policies.

We investigate all retaliation allegations. Anyone who engages
in retaliatory behavior will face disciplinary action, up to and
including termination.
If you believe you or someone else is experiencing retaliation, report it
using the resources on page 6 and page 51.

Q&A
I made a complaint about my manager through the Ethics Line.
I’m concerned he’ll be angry with me and that this will affect
my job. What can I do?
We do our best to keep Ethics Line submissions confidential.
During investigations, we reinforce with everyone involved that we
will not tolerate retaliation. If you ever suspect retaliation, report it.

If you need clarification about anything in this Code or guidance about
a situation you’re experiencing, or if you need to report a concern, use
the resources on page 6 and page 51.
You may start with your manager, but you don’t have to if you’re not
comfortable doing so. Feel free to contact your Human Resources
business partner, higher levels of management, the Ethics Line or any
of the resources listed in this Code. You also may raise your concerns
directly to the chair of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
If the situation involves a senior officer or director, you may report
the suspected violation to the chief ethics officer, chief risk officer,
chief executive officer or the chair of the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors.
We thoroughly investigate every concern employees report through
any channel and report to the Audit Committee of the Board
of Directors on all issues reported through the Ethics Line.

Q&A
I talked with my manager about a situation within our team that
I think violates our ethical standards. She didn’t agree and told
me not to worry about it. I’m not comfortable with her response.
What should I do?
Report the situation and your manager’s response. You may call the Ethics
Line, contact your Human Resources business partner, contact higher
levels of management or use any of the resources on page 6 and page 51.

DID YOU K NOW?
•	 Our chief ethics officer is Jennie Carlson, executive vice president
of Human Resources. She oversees all aspects of our Code of Ethics
and Business Conduct. In addition, the chair of the Audit Committee
of the Board of Directors oversees issues concerning financial
accounting, auditing practices, internal controls, securities fraud
or public disclosure obligations.
•	 There is no justification for an illegal or unethical act. Believing
U.S. Bank benefited from such an act, or committing such an
act because someone else directed you to do so, is no defense.
•	 Knowingly making false accusations of illegal or unethical acts is a
serious violation of the Code. This undermines our reporting process
and can damage people’s reputations.

Q&A
I can only control my own behavior. Why am I required to report
what others are doing?
Because that’s the right thing to do. Choosing not to report potentially
unethical behavior could harm U.S. Bank, our customers or our
employees. Our reputation as a trusted, ethical bank is one of the many
things that sets us apart and gives us a competitive advantage.

You’re not permitted to use, possess, distribute, manufacture, sell,
attempt to sell, buy, attempt to buy or be under the influence of alcohol
or illegal drugs (including medical or recreational marijuana) on
U.S. Bank property, while conducting company business or while
operating a company vehicle.
The only exceptions to this policy are:

•	 Giving a coworker your prescription medicine

provided you drink responsibly and don’t return to work after the
event.
•	 Brief and temporary possession of alcoholic beverages, unopened
and sealed in their original containers, intended for use at an
authorized corporate event or for later off-premises personal
consumption.

Can we sell unopened bottles of wine to raise money for a
company-sponsored charitable event if many of the employees
who will be attending are younger than 21?
Yes, but you must make sure anyone who buys wine is at least 21
years old. You may want to consider selling non-alcoholic items,
instead, to ensure all employees can participate fully.

We do not tolerate threatening, intimidating or physically harmful behavior

2.2.3 Vehicle safety

My manager holds quarterly meetings at which trade secrets and
confidential customer information are typically discussed. I attend
these calls via teleconference. Can I record these meetings?

If your job includes driving a personal, company-owned or rental car, you
must comply with all federal and state laws. This includes restrictions on
using mobile devices. Texting and using smart phone features or apps are
prohibited while you’re driving.
For the safety of yourself and others, avoid making or receiving telephone
calls while you’re driving. If you must make or take a call, use an approved
hands-free device where permitted by law or pull over and park safely first.
For more information see:
Driving for Business

For the safety, security and privacy of employees, customers, suppliers
and others with whom you interact for U.S. Bank, and for the protection of
trade secrets, promotion of a harassment-free workplace and a workplace
free of unnecessary distractions, you may not make unauthorized audio,
video or photographic recordings of confidential information or physical
facility controls.
Nothing in the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is intended to limit or
interfere with nonsupervisory employees discussing the terms and conditions
of their employment. This includes, for example, discussion of wages and
other terms and conditions of employment, such as our employment-related
policies and practices. Nothing in this Code should be interpreted to interfere
with any employee rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.

No. You may take written notes for your records or to share
with coworkers.
2.2.5 Staying alert

or interfere with nonsupervisory employees discussing the terms and
conditions of their employment. This includes, for example, discussion
of wages and other terms and conditions of employment, such as our
employment-related policies and practices. Nothing in this Code should
be interpreted to interfere with any employee rights under Section 7 of
the National Labor Relations Act.

DID YOU K NOW?

DID YOU K NOW?

When your employment or your service as a director ends, you’re still
obligated to protect U.S. Bank confidential information.

You may not tell anyone inside or outside U.S. Bank about current or
past suspicious activity reports (SARs). SARs may be shared only on a
need-to-know basis.

Q&A

3.2.2 Transactions with affiliated investment companies

A former employee asked me to send her a copy of a proposal
she worked on before she left. May I send it to her?

If your job includes providing services for investment companies, you
must follow your business line’s requirements, as well as our 1940 Act
Affiliated Transactions Compliance Program.

No. This proposal is U.S. Bank property, and you can’t release it
outside the company—not even to the person who created it.

Corporate Compliance
U.S. Bancorp Affiliate Transactions (Regulation W) Policy

3.2 Conducting business fairly, responsibly and ethically
3.2.1 Money laundering and financial crimes laws
Money laundering is the process of taking the proceeds of criminal
activity and making them appear legitimate. It’s a global problem with farreaching and serious consequences. As a financial services provider, it’s
our responsibility to help close the channels that money launderers use.
To prevent U.S. Bank from being used as a conduit for money
laundering, terrorist financing or other criminal activity, we comply with
the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and related anti-money laundering (AML)
laws and regulations. These laws also include economic sanctions
regulations that prohibit U.S. citizens and U.S. Bank from doing
business with certain countries, businesses and individuals. Failing
to comply with these various laws can result in severe penalties.
You’re responsible for being knowledgeable about and following
U.S. Bank policies and procedures for complying with BSA, AML
and economic sanctions obligations. You must be able to identify and
escalate potentially suspicious activity. You also must complete training
as required.
For more information see:

3.2.3 Antitrust laws
Antitrust law, also known in some countries as “competition law,” is
a complex area of the law that promotes competition and protects
consumers from unfair business practices.
At U.S. Bank, this means you may not work with competitors to set
or control prices, rates, trade practices or marketing policies or to
allocate markets or customers. You should avoid situations—including
conversations with competitors—that could give the appearance of
doing this.
You also may not require customers to engage in certain “tied” or
reciprocal transactions. This is any transaction where a customer is
required to purchase or provide one product or service in exchange for
another being made available. We strongly encourage you to contact
Corporate Compliance or the Law Division if you’re considering
transactions that involve multiple products and services.

3.2.4 Fair and responsible banking laws
We do business in a fair and responsible manner, and we expect the
same from our business partners. This commitment guides the ways
in which we offer financial products and services and conduct activities
throughout the entire customer relationship and product lifecycle. This
enables us to:
•	 Prevent unlawful discriminatory lending practices.
•	 Prevent harm to our customers.
•	 Avoid unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (collectively called
“UDAAP”).
•	 Ensure compliance with all applicable fair lending and responsible
banking laws and regulations.
For more information see:
Fair and Responsible Banking

DID YOU K NOW?
A helpful way to think about your responsibility for fair and responsible
banking is to ask yourself, “Am I treating my customers the way I would
want to be treated?”

Q&A
Two couples came in to our branch today to apply for auto loans.
My coworker told the mixed-race couple to apply using our website,
but he helped the Caucasian couple complete a loan application
at the branch. What should I do?
You should report the issue using the resources on page 6 and page 51.
Your coworker may have violated fair lending laws and our Fair and
Responsible Banking Policy.

3.2.5 Anti-bribery laws
We expect our employees and business partners to comply with the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) AntiBribery Convention and all other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.
You may not give, promise or offer anything of value to any customer,
government employee or any other person to influence a decision,
secure an advantage, avoid a disadvantage, or obtain or retain
business. We don’t tolerate bribery, corruption or improper payments of
any kind in our business dealings, anywhere in the world. This applies
to officials in both the public and private sectors. Engaging in such
behavior exposes you and U.S. Bank to civil and/or criminal liability,
and you harm our reputation and undermine the trust of our customers,
shareholders and communities.

If you have any questions, consult your manager or Human Resources.
For more information see:
Corporate Compliance
“Gifts and entertainment,” section 4.3.1 of this Code
“Corporate political activities,” section 5.1.1 of this Code

Here are several examples of scenarios, warning signals and payment
types that may be prohibited or create risk:
•	 Any request for cash payment or for payment to be diverted to a third
party or third country outside normal payment terms and processes.
•	 Doing business with a potential customer in a country that has a
history of corruption, particularly when the business sector or party
has a reputation for corrupt practices.
•	 Working with customers who also are suppliers of separate services to
U.S. Bank, when both relationships are managed by the same person.
•	 Situations where fees or commissions are outside the industry norm
and seem high for the nature of the service.
•	 Requests to pay invoices or expenses that aren’t standard and/or that
fall outside usual payment methods.
•	 Payments to influence the award of contracts.
•	 Payments to obtain confidential information about the activities of
competitors.

3.2.6 Insider trading
As part of your job, you may be exposed to information about
U.S. Bancorp and other publicly traded companies that is considered
“material and nonpublic.”
Information that a reasonable investor would consider to be important
when he or she is deciding to buy or sell (“trade”) a security is called
“material.” When material information hasn’t been publicly disclosed,
it’s called “inside” information, and anyone who’s in possession of it is
called an “insider.”
•	 When you’re in possession of inside information, you may not trade in
any securities of the company or companies to which it pertains.
•	 Insider trading is not only a violation of our policies, it’s also against
the law. Violations of federal insider trading laws can result in
significant fines and imprisonment.
•	 You may not pass along inside information (also known as “tipping”)
to anyone who might use it to trade in securities, and you may not
share the information with anyone else.
If you think you have inside information about U.S. Bancorp or other
publicly traded companies and are considering making a trade in those
securities, we strongly encourage you to consult with the Law Division,
which will help you determine whether the trade you’re considering
would violate our policy or applicable laws.
3.2.6.1 Information barriers
U.S. Bank has internal information barriers that are designed to restrict
the flow of material and nonpublic information and help us comply with
insider trading rules, laws and regulations.
A “private” or “inside” area is any unit that has access to material and
nonpublic information. A “public” area is a unit that trades or sells
securities or provides investment advice.
If you work in a private or inside area of the company and possess
material and nonpublic information, you’re prohibited from communicating
this information to anyone in a public area of the company.

Section 3: Our customers

Code of Ethics and Business Conduct

3.2.7 Personal investment activities
As a U.S. Bank employee, you must conduct your personal investment
activities with our interests in mind. When you’re trading in your
personal accounts, you may not use U.S. Bank information for your
personal benefit. 	
•	 Make responsible and lawful loan and investment decisions.
•	 Base your investment decisions on sound investment principles, not
on short-term trading goals or speculation.

|

24

DID YOU K NOW?
Insider trading rules apply to the material and nonpublic information
of any publicly traded company you learn about in the course of your
U.S. Bank employment. You might learn inside information about
U.S. Bank, customers, vendors, business partners or other publicly
traded companies. It’s illegal to buy or sell shares in these companies
while you know inside information.

•	 Never engage in insider trading.
•	 Don’t engage in short-term trading in our 401(k) plan. This practice
takes advantage of stale pricing or pricing anomalies in the net asset
values of the plan’s mutual funds. This also is called “market timing,”
and it can hurt investment results for other plan participants.
•	 Your business line may have more restrictive policies that affect your
personal investment activities. You’re responsible for knowing the
rules that apply to you.
For more information see:
U.S. Bancorp Disclosure Policy

Q&A
One of my corporate customers has had great success with a new
product, and they’re looking for additional financing to make capital
investments. I’d like to buy more stock in the company because its
future looks so good. Can I buy more stock at this time?
No. You have inside information about the customer. You can’t trade in
the company’s stock until the company has publicly disclosed all the
information about its product sales and expectations. Also, you may
not pass this information along to anyone or recommend the purchase
or sale of its stock to anyone during this period.

Q&A
I work with a large vendor, which I learned is having serious
financial difficulties that haven’t been publicly announced. My sister
owns some of the vendor’s stock. Can I warn her so she can sell her
stock before the bad news comes out?
No. This is material inside information. You may not pass this
information along to anyone or recommend the purchase or sale of this
company’s stock to anyone until this information is publicly disclosed.

3.3 Respecting our customers

3.3.3. Incentive gaming

Excellent customer service is the cornerstone of the U.S. Bank brand.
We treat our customers with respect and professionalism. We put our
customers’ best interests at the forefront of everything we do.

Incentive gaming and aggressive, deceptive, unfair or abusive sales
practices are strictly prohibited. You may not manipulate records,
open bogus accounts, slam products, falsify applications or skew
results in any way for the benefit of yourself or other employees.
Vendors and third parties also are prohibited from doing this in
support of U.S. Bank, our customers or potential customers.

3.3.1 Accommodations
We remove architectural and communication barriers in accordance
with applicable law so all customers have access to U.S. Bank products
and services.
Whether you work with customers in person or over the phone,
pay attention to any physical or communication barriers and offer
assistance when it’s needed. You may need to consult with your
manager to assess appropriate assistance measures, especially
when a customer requests a specific type of accommodation.
For more information see:
Accessibility at U.S. Bank

For more information, see your individual incentive plan or ask
your manager.

Q&A
To earn incentives, a coworker is ordering credit cards for
preapproved customers without their permission. What should I do?
You should report your coworker’s behavior using the resources on page 6
and page 51. This behavior is a serious violation of our ethical standards.

3.3.2 Responsible marketing, sales and servicing activities
At U.S. Bank, we’re proud to offer our customers the best products
and services available to meet their diverse needs. We design fair
and responsible products and services, and we market and advertise
them in a fair and responsible way. We inform customers and potential
customers about options that may be appropriate for them, and we
explain terms and features in a fair and balanced way to help customers
make informed decisions.
We also provide excellent service in a fair, responsible and consistent
manner. We listen to customer feedback and monitor our servicing
efforts, which include: handling inquiries and customer complaints;
ensuring timely and accurate transaction, payment and data processing;
and managing fee practices, collection activities, account resolution
and property disposition.
When we have an experience that doesn’t meet our standards, may not
comply with the letter or spirit of the law or may create undue risk for
our customers, we act promptly to do the right thing.
Sales always must be based on customer needs or requests—they
should never be the result of efforts to promote products or services to
meet sales goals, incentives or recognition goals.

3.3.4 Complaints
We address customer complaints promptly and professionally. We:
•	 Investigate the circumstances surrounding complaints.
•	 Work to understand and address the customer’s issues and
concerns as quickly as possible.
•	 Take appropriate action based on the investigation.
•	 Use what we learn to improve the customer experience, modify
procedures and monitor third-party service support.
You’re responsible for reporting customer complaints promptly,
completely and accurately through the corporate process or your
business line’s complaint-handling process.

4.1 Ensuring records and filings are accurate

4.1.3 Record retention and legal hold policies

4.1.1 Records and filings

As a company and financial institution, we are required to maintain
certain records to meet our legal, tax and regulatory requirements.
You’re responsible for retaining records as required by our corporate
record retention schedule, understanding and complying with our Legal
Records Hold policy and completing training on this topic as required.

As a publicly traded company and national bank, we make filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Reserve and
other primary regulators of U.S. Bank and its affiliates. Our disclosures
must be full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable. We have strict
disclosure controls and procedures and stringent internal controls over
financial reporting. If you’re involved in preparing our public disclosures,
you have a special responsibility to help us meet these standards.

For more information see:
Legal Records Hold
Corporate Retention Schedule

Each one of us is responsible for ensuring the information we record,
process and analyze is:
•	 Complete, accurate and recorded in a timely manner.
•	 Handled according to applicable accounting standards, legal
requirements and internal controls.
•	 Corrected immediately if errors occur.
This information includes accounting and audit records, loan documents,
phone records, transaction records, ATM and teller balancing, expense
reports, and all other records that are part of our day-to-day business.
You also must follow notary requirements.
For more information see:
Notary Public
4.1.2 Reporting concerns
You have the right—and the obligation—to report possible violations of
accounting, audit or internal control matters, disclosure obligations, laws

DID YOU K NOW?
•	 Time records are official company records. You must record your time
accurately with the start and end time of each shift and meal period
and with any time you work after you’re called in from being off-duty.
•	 Managers may not tell you to over- or under-report the time you work.
•	 Over- or under-reporting the time you work, and reporting time in a
week other than the week in which it’s worked, violates U.S. Bank
policy and federal and state wage and hour laws.

Q&A
I worked overtime for several days by working through my lunch
period. My manager told me to record only my regular hours and
said he’ll give me time off next week to make up for the lunch
hours. May I do this?
No. Even though your manager may mean well, this violates our
policies and the law. Record your time accurately and report the issue
using the resources on page 6 and page 51.

Q&A
A customer forgot to have his loan documents notarized. My
coworker told me that I should go ahead and notarize them since
we know the customer. May I do this?
No. The notarization process requires both you, as the notary, and
the signer to be physically present so you can verify the signer’s
identification and ensure he or she is signing the document voluntarily.
You must follow the procedures of your notary license in your state,
even if someone tells you to ignore them.

4.2 Avoiding conflicts of interest
A conflict of interest exists when you have a personal or professional
interest that is, or appears to be, at odds with the best interests of
U.S. Bank. We avoid conflicts of interest, the appearance of conflicts,
and other activities that could reflect negatively on U.S. Bank.
Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct describes some of the most
common situations that may present conflicts of interest. If you need
guidance about these or other situations you may find yourself in, talk
with your manager or use the resources on page 6 and page 51.

4.2.1 Outside activities
Your outside activities must not compromise our interests, unless
they are otherwise protected by law. Generally, activities that involve
access to or disclosure of confidential information about U.S. Bank
or its customers may be a conflict of interest. Also, affiliations with
certain organizations may be conflicts of interest if they compete with
U.S. Bank or are in substantial default to U.S. Bank on loans, contracts
or other obligations.
Here are some of the most common outside activities that can create
actual or apparent conflicts of interest:
•	 Outside employment. Your manager must approve any outside
employment. While this generally is permitted, you may not take
a second job (including self-employment) that:
•	 Competes with any of our business activities.
•	 Interferes with your job performance or work schedule.
•	 Involves use of U.S. Bank equipment or resources.
•	 Violates your confidentiality obligations to U.S. Bank
and its customers.
•	 Has a negative impact on U.S. Bank.
This applies to all activities for which you’ll be paid. It also applies to
speaking and writing engagements, consulting engagements and
teaching positions where the subject matter relates to the business of
U.S. Bank or your job responsibilities.
Keep in mind U.S. Bank engages in a broad variety of business
activities, so other businesses may be considered to be competing
even if they don’t directly compete with your particular
business activities.
•	 Fiduciary appointments and inheritances. You may not act as
a personal fiduciary or co-fiduciary of any estate, trust, agency,
guardianship or custodianship account of a U.S. Bank customer
without the approval of Human Resources and the head of your
business line. This excludes cases where the customer is a family

member or personal friend whose relationship with you was
established apart from your U.S. Bank employment.
Similarly, you and your immediate family members may not accept an
inheritance from a customer unless the customer is a family member
or personal friend whose relationship with you was established apart
from your U.S. Bank employment. If a customer names you as a
beneficiary, contact your Human Resources business partner and your
manager to discuss how to resolve the conflict.
•	 Outside for-profit board of directors positions. Several laws
prohibit certain interlocking corporate directorships and management
positions or have other restrictions regarding corporate directorships.
You may not serve as a director of a publicly-traded corporation or a
large, privately-held for-profit business (i.e., one with annual revenues
of $25 million or more) without the approval of the chief executive
officer of U.S. Bank. Senior managers are required to report annually
their service on such for-profit corporate boards of directors.
•	 Serving on behalf of U.S. Bank in for-profit activities.
U.S. Bank may ask you to serve on its behalf as an officer or board
member of a public or closely-held company to represent the
interests of one or more clients who have a significant ownership
interest in such an entity through their fiduciary accounts. As a
representative of U.S. Bank and its fiduciary capacity, your actions
must reflect the interests of the account beneficiaries. You may
serve in this capacity with the permission of the head of your
business line (or higher authority as described above), and your
actions are subject to the oversight of the fiduciary governance
committee structure of your business line.
•	 Nonprofit, family, community and charitable organizations.
You may serve as an officer or board member of a nonprofit, family,
community or charitable organization, as long as it doesn’t present
a conflict of interest. You should not participate in any discussions
or decisions regarding U.S. Bank business. Also, you must provide
reasonable notice to your manager before you’re elected or
appointed to ensure no conflicts of interest exist.

Contents | Resources

Section 4: Our shareholders

Code of Ethics and Business Conduct

•	 Advisory boards and industry associations. U.S. Bank may ask
you to serve on its behalf in industry or trade associations, customer or
supplier advisory boards, or similar organizations. As a representative
of U.S. Bank, your actions must reflect our interests. You also may
serve in a personal capacity with the permission of the head of your
business line if this doesn’t present other conflicts of interest.
If an organization for which you represent U.S. Bank sponsors its own
political action committee (PAC), you must not solicit for the PAC, sit
on the PAC board or otherwise participate in political contribution
decisions. Unless restricted by business line-specific policies, you
may contribute personally to the PAC, but seeking reimbursement
from U.S. Bank is prohibited.
•	 Political activity. You generally may serve in an elective or
government-appointed office if it doesn’t interfere with your job
performance or your service as a director, use company time or
resources, or present a conflict of interest. You must be clear you’re
not representing U.S. Bank. Also, you must provide reasonable
notice to your manager before you’re elected or appointed to ensure
no conflicts of interest exist and to discuss recusal procedures if
conflicts of interest arise during your term of office. If you’re involved
in U.S. Bank business with government entities, you may be subject to
additional restrictions on your personal political activities. See section
5.1.2 (“Personal political activities”) for more information. Certain
employees, based on their role, function, grade and/or business unit,
are considered “Identified Employees.” If you‘re an Identified Employee,
you must seek pre-approval from Governmental Interactions
Compliance for your personal political activities.

Nothing in the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is intended
to limit or interfere with nonsupervisory employees discussing the
terms and conditions of their employment. This includes, for example,
discussion of wages and other terms and conditions of employment,

Code should be interpreted to interfere with any employee rights under
Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.

DID YOU K NOW?
•	 You may make formal or informal commitments on behalf of U.S. Bank
only with authorization and by following approved procedures.
Approved commitments must be properly documented and retained.
•	 You may not offer opinions on legal or tax matters, and make sure
you don’t engage in the unauthorized practice of law.

Compliance. Certain restrictions that are designed to prevent conflicts
of interest may apply.
4.2.3 Personal relationships
Working with or hiring a family member, a family member’s company
or someone with whom you have a personal relationship may create
a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict.
•	 Don’t act for U.S. Bank in any transaction or business relationship
that involves yourself, members of your family or other people or
organizations where you or your family have significant personal
connections, financial interests or decision-making influence.

Q&A
I’m a personal banker. I also have a real estate license and was
planning to work as a real estate agent on the side. Is this a conflict
of interest?
Yes. As a real estate agent, you’re in a position to recommend banking
services to your clients that may include referrals to non-U.S. Bank financial
institutions, which creates a conflict of interest. There may be very limited
circumstances in non-retail lines of business where this activity may be
approved. Consult with your manager and Human Resources before you
perform any real estate work.

Q&A
I work full-time in the Community Banking and Branch Delivery
business line, and I have a part-time job with another financial
services company doing telemarketing on the weekends. Is
this a problem?
Yes. This is a clear conflict of interest, and you must quit your parttime job if you want to continue working at U.S. Bank. You should
have discussed this outside job with your manager before you took
it (or you should have told your manager about this job if you already
had it when you started working at U.S. Bank).

Q&A
A customer whose accounts I’ve handled for years wants to leave
my children something in her will. Is this OK?
No. You should thank her for her offer and explain that our Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct prohibits you and your family members
from inheriting gifts from customers with whom you have worked as
a representative of U.S. Bank.

Q&A
I need to find a vendor to help my team finish a project. My wife
and two of her friends own a software company that does exactly
what we need. Can I hire their company to help with the project?
Probably not, because you would be in a position of authority over
your wife’s company, and that presents a conflict of interest. If actions
can be taken to prevent potential conflicts of interest from affecting (or
appearing to affect) the hiring decision, U.S. Bank ultimately may be
able to do business with your wife’s company. You always must disclose
to U.S. Bank and Corporate Procurement any personal relationship
you have with a potential third-party vendor. Conflicts of interest aren’t
always clear-cut, so it’s best to discuss these types of situations with
your manager or Human Resources business partner.

4.3 Following gift and entertainment laws and policies

|

•	 Awards given as part of approved company-sponsored
recognition programs.
•	 Nominal gifts between coworkers on appropriate occasions.
Also:
•	 You must comply with our solicitation guidelines when you’re asking
employees to contribute to a gift for a coworker.
•	 You’re responsible for following any other requirements that apply
to your business line.
4.3.1.1 Giving gifts
You may give gifts only for legitimate business reasons and never
to secure business or influence a decision. Your gifts should be
reasonable and customary for the circumstances. You may never give
gifts of cash. The guidelines in section 4.3.1.2 (“Accepting gifts”) also
apply to gifts among U.S. Bank employees. Also, the guidelines in
section 5.1.1.3 (“Gifts and entertainment for public officials”) apply to
all gifts to public officials and public employees. This includes meals,
entertainment or anything else of value provided to federal, state, local
or foreign public officials or employees.

Gift-giving and entertainment are common business practices that can
help strengthen relationships. We are all responsible for ensuring such
practices don’t create the impression of improperly influenced business
decisions. U.S. Bank does business based solely on our customers’
needs and the quality and price of our products and services.

You’re responsible for following business line-specific gift guidelines
and standard expense reimbursement procedures.

4.3.1 Gifts and entertainment

For more information see:

We comply with laws that prohibit employees, officers, directors,
agents and attorneys of financial institutions from giving, seeking
or accepting anything of value in connection with any transaction or
business of their financial institutions. Accepting or soliciting anything
of value for the benefit of a third person or third party also is prohibited.

“Anti-bribery laws,” section 3.2.5 of this Code
“Gifts and entertainment for public officials,” section 5.1.1.3 of this Code
Prize and Award Reporting
Travel and Expense Policies

These restrictions generally don’t apply to:
•	 Gifts or entertainment based on family relationships, where it’s clear
the relationship is the motivating factor for the gift (except in certain
circumstances when the family member is an official or employee of
a government entity that does or may do business with U.S. Bank).

4.3.1.2 Accepting gifts
You may never solicit or accept a gift for yourself or a third party in
exchange for favorable business treatment.
There are certain circumstances when accepting gifts or other items of
value doesn’t violate our gift policies. This includes:
•	 Advertising or promotional material of reasonable value, such as pens,
pencils, note pads, key chains, calendars and similar items.
•	 Discounts or rebates on merchandise or services that are available to
other customers under similar circumstances or as part of a discount
program that U.S. Bank negotiates.
•	 Awards of reasonable value from civic, charitable, educational or
religious organizations for recognition of service and accomplishment.
•	 Gifts awarded as part of a random drawing, where there is no inference
that accepting the gift could influence your U.S. Bank duties.
•	 Meals, refreshments, entertainment, accommodations or travel
arrangements for meetings or other occasions where:
•	 The purpose is to hold bona fide business discussions or build
better business relationships.

•	 Gifts not to exceed $200 in value that are related to commonly
recognized events or occasions. These include promotions, new
jobs, weddings, retirements, holidays and birthdays. However, we
prohibit gifts in cash or in check form in any amount.
We may make exceptions to allow employees or directors to accept
reasonable entertainment, accommodations or gifts that exceed this
policy when:
•	 A significant customer or vendor sponsors an event.
•	 Attending an event is important to maintaining our relationship with
that customer or vendor.
•	 Refusal may damage the customer relationship.
However, you must make an attempt to explain the U.S. Bank gift
policy and to return or refuse the entertainment or gift. If continued
refusal may irreparably damage the customer relationship, you should
consult with your manager and Human Resources to determine
whether accepting the gift in goodwill (and not in return for special
treatment) may be appropriate.

DID YOU K NOW?

•	 Your host is present.
•	 Your attendance is related to your job duties.
•	 The level of expense is reasonable and customary for the
circumstances.
•	 The relationship with the host, and the frequency of such
invitations from one host, is not excessive.
•	 Food or beverages that can’t be returned easily, as long as they’re
received on an occasion when gifts are customary, not extravagant
and shared with coworkers.

A “gift” is anything of value you give or receive. Gifts can include meals
and beverages, tickets to entertainment or sporting events, goods
or services, use of a residence or vacation home, travel or lodging
expenses, discounts, or charitable or political contributions made on
someone’s behalf. If the recipient doesn’t pay the normal cost of
something, it probably will be considered a gift. If something is available
to the public on the same terms that it’s being offered to the recipient,
it generally won’t be considered a gift.

Q&A
I was invited to attend a local sporting event with a customer.
May I attend?
Yes, if the purpose is to hold bona fide business discussions or further
the customer relationship, unless your business line has a more restrictive
policy. If the tickets are for your personal use and the customer won’t be
attending the event with you, you may not accept them.

DID YOU K NOW?
We choose our business partners—including vendors, lawyers,
consultants and other professionals—based on quality, competence,
competitive pricing and services, business relationships, and their
willingness to follow our ethical standards. Nothing else influences
our selection process.

Q&A
I’m a teller, and a regular customer gave me a $25 gift card
to a local coffee shop on my birthday. May I keep it?
This gift is acceptable unless your business line has more restrictive policies.

Q&A
Another employee referred a customer to me. Can I give her a gift
to thank her?
No. You should never give gifts to people, including coworkers, if it could
appear you’re trying to influence them or reward them for business activities.
Instead, visit The Best in Us for approved ways to recognize a coworker.

Code of Ethics and Business Conduct

4.4 Being financially responsible
Because of the nature of our business, you should manage your
personal financial matters prudently. Not doing so could undermine
your professional credibility—and jeopardize your job.
4.4.1 Personal finances
You may not participate in financial transactions with other employees,
customers or suppliers. In addition, you and your family members may
not borrow money from or lend money to customers, suppliers, other
employees or independent contractors. However, you may borrow
money or purchase items on credit from a customer or supplier that
is in the financial services business, as long as you don’t receive
preferential treatment.
This policy doesn’t prevent you from borrowing money from or lending
money to family members or friends, where personal relationships exist
independently of U.S. Bank business. It also doesn’t prohibit occasional
loans of nominal value (such as for lunch or coffee) between employees,
as long as the interactions are voluntary and don’t include interest.
4.4.2 Misuse of accounts and products
If you misuse an employee checking account, other financial account or
any other U.S. Bank product or service—or if you don’t pay promptly for
services, where applicable—you may lose your account privileges.
In some cases, you may face additional disciplinary action.

|

36

Q&A
My coworker asked me to lend her $75 so she can pay her utility
bill this month. Is this OK?
No. A $75 loan is not a nominal amount under our policy. The
policy is designed to prevent you from becoming involved in
coworkers’ personal financial situations, because this can disrupt
work relationships and create distractions in the workplace.

Q&A
A customer offered to lend me money to buy a boat. I didn’t ask
him for the loan. We’ve discussed and agreed on repayment
terms. May I accept the loan?
No. You may not ask for or accept a loan from a customer or vendor,
because it could appear to be intended to influence you. Also, the loan
may create the potential for a conflict among your interests, the customer’s
interests and those of U.S. Bank. Employees in the securities industry
are legally prohibited from borrowing from or lending to clients.

The following are examples of prohibited activities and don’t cover
all potential violations of federal, state or local laws or of U.S. Bank
policies. These activities may result in immediate termination of
employment:
•	 Kiting, which means floating funds between two or more accounts
to cover withdrawals.
•	 Making false ATM deposits (intentionally depositing empty envelopes)
or making inflated ATM deposits to receive immediate cash.
•	 Viewing employee or customer account information for
non-business reasons.
U.S. Bank reserves the right to monitor all account activity, subject
to applicable law.

4.4.3 Business expenses and corporate credit cards

4.4.4 Prohibited account transactions

You must follow our guidelines for incurring business-related expenses,
and you must comply with expense-reimbursement procedures.

You must handle account transactions according to U.S. Bank policies
and procedures.

If you have a U.S. Bank corporate card, you may use it for businessrelated expenses only. The only exception is for incidental personal
expenses you may incur in the course of business, where it’s not
practical for you to pay those expenses separately.

Examples of inappropriate transactions include, but are not limited to:

You must pay personal expenses in full when they are due. You must
submit your business expenses in a timely manner and ensure your
corporate card payments are up to date.
The following activities may result in the termination of your corporate credit
card privileges and/or disciplinary action, up to and including termination:
•	 Misusing your card.
•	 Falsifying business expenses.
•	 Not submitting expenses in a timely manner.
•	 Paying late repeatedly.
•	 Using your card for personal use.
If your employment ends, you must pay any outstanding corporate
credit card balance immediately. When permissible, U.S. Bank will
apply any outstanding expense reimbursement to your outstanding
corporate credit card balance.
For more information see:
U.S. Bank Corporate Credit Cards

Q&A

•	 Misappropriating funds.
•	 Opening, closing or altering accounts without proper authorization.
•	 Transferring funds without authorization.
•	 Transferring cash from branch to branch without Corporate Security’s
approval, whether you use your personal accounts or branch funds.
•	 Performing any transaction in a manner that doesn’t comply with our
policies and procedures.
You may not approve or process any transactions (including paperless
or online transactions) for your personal accounts, the accounts of
immediate family members, or accounts in which you have a personal
financial interest or on which you’re an authorized signer.
You’re also responsible for knowing about and complying with other
business-line specific restrictions.

Q&A
I’m a banker who’s authorized to waive service fees for
customers. If a U.S. Bank employee asks me to waive a service
fee on her account, is this acceptable as long as it’s consistent
with customer procedures?
Generally, no. Talk with your manager or another member of retail
management, who can process such refunds as appropriate.

As long as I pay off my corporate credit card each month, is it OK if I
occasionally use the card for personal purchases or cash advances?
No. Use your personal credit card for personal expenses or cash advances.

4.5 Protecting U.S. Bank assets
As part of your job, you have access to and use many types of U.S. Bank
resources. These resources include a wide range of U.S. Bank property,
from equipment to intellectual property to your work time. They also
include our brand, which is one of our most valuable assets.
You must use these resources only for legitimate business purposes and
protect them from theft, loss, damage, waste or abuse. You also must
ensure your use of any U.S. Bank asset is properly authorized.
4.5.1 Company resources
U.S. Bank resources include equipment, facilities, information
technology, financial assets, intellectual property and other resources.
You should use company resources only for company business. You
may use company systems occasionally for personal, inconsequential
tasks, but you must limit this activity.
Never use company resources to:
•	 Conduct outside business or engage in personal political activities,
such as political campaigning and holding office.
•	 Engage in unethical or illegal activities such as gambling or stalking.
•	 Access, transmit or store material that is offensive or violates our
policies for maintaining a respectful, harassment-free work environment.
Your work time is considered to be a valuable company resource, as
well. Limit personal activities during work time to avoid interfering with
your productivity or that of others. (See the Glossary for the definition
of “work time.”)
Nothing in the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is intended to limit
or interfere with nonsupervisory employees discussing the terms and
conditions of their employment. This includes, for example, discussion
of wages and other terms and conditions of employment, such as our
employment-related policies and practices. Nothing in this Code should
be interpreted to interfere with any employee rights under Section 7 of
the National Labor Relations Act.

other restrictions or controls your business line may have on using
company resources, including using personal devices at work or for
U.S. Bank business.

excessive use of the internet, violates company policies.
•	 You must return company resources at the request of U.S. Bank or

4.5.2 Intellectual property
While you’re working at U.S. Bank, you may produce, develop and have
access to intellectual property.
Intellectual property is the property of U.S. Bank. You must comply with
all laws protecting intellectual property, including copyright and trade
secret laws. Further, you must protect the intellectual property of
U.S. Bank from unauthorized use and disclosure, and you may not use
it for personal gain. In addition, as a condition of your employment, you
agree to assign to U.S. Bank, exclusively, all rights, titles and interest in
any such U.S. Bank property, and you must assist U.S. Bank in obtaining
intellectual property rights (e.g., trademarks, patents and copyrights)
for intellectual property developed while you’re employed at U.S. Bank.
You also must obtain any required permission from others outside
of U.S. Bank to use their intellectual property and information. You
must comply with any confidentiality obligations you may have to third
parties, such as former employers. If you have information that belongs
to a former employer, you must return it.
For more information see:
Information Security Policies

DID YOU K NOW?
•	 It’s illegal to share or modify third-party copyrighted materials
unless you or U.S. Bank has written permission from the copyright
holder. This can subject you or U.S. Bank to civil and criminal
penalties and other serious consequences.
•	 You may not use U.S. Bank trademarks or logos in a manner that,
under applicable law, infringes upon our trademark, including
registering a domain name for business purposes, without written
authorization from Corporate Marketing, the Internet Channel
Marketing Group and the Law Division.
•	 Your business line may have additional policies for securing
intellectual property. You’re responsible for knowing the rules
that apply to you.

customers, employees or any other stakeholders.
•	 Use our encryption feature (the “Key123” function) when you must
send confidential or customer information to external parties via
email. Don’t send information the recipient already has.
•	 If a customer emails a service request that contains personal
information or account numbers, remove this information from your

4.5.4 Soliciting during work
Soliciting donations or selling goods for outside events or
organizations, including those that are charitable in nature, can
be disruptive. That’s why the following rules from the U.S. Bank
Sponsored Charitable Fundraising Policy apply to soliciting during
work time (see the Glossary for the definition of “work time”):
•	 Customers: You may not solicit customers as part of charitable
fundraising activities or other business-related events on behalf
of U.S. Bank. The only exceptions are ATM activations for disaster
relief as approved by the president of the U.S. Bank Foundation and
collection drives as outlined in the policy.
•	 Vendors: You may not solicit third-party companies and
organizations, including vendors, as part of charitable fundraising
activities or other business-related events.
•	 Employees: You may solicit U.S. Bank employees for charitable
purposes only in specific cases as described in the policy.
In addition, we don’t allow business customers or other third parties
to post, advertise or otherwise solicit for business or other activities at
any U.S. Bank site, except as part of a U.S. Bank-approved marketing
program. See the Business Partner Program Guide and Best Practices
for details.
Nothing in the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is intended
to limit or interfere with nonsupervisory employees discussing the
terms and conditions of their employment. This includes, for example,
discussion of wages and other terms and conditions of employment,
such as our employment-related policies and practices. Nothing in this
Code should be interpreted to interfere with any employee rights under
Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.

Q&A
My coworkers and I are participating in a charity run that isn’t
sponsored by U.S. Bank. May we post about it on US Book?
You may not use company resources to solicit donations or participation
in a non-sponsored event. You may, however, share your volunteer
efforts and accomplishments on US Book.

Q&A
I serve on the board of a local nonprofit organization, and I’ve been
asked to reach out to my circle of influence—which includes
businesses and customers in my market—to request support for
our annual gala. Is this allowed?
Yes, this is allowed because you’re representing the nonprofit, not U.S. Bank.

DID YOU K NOW?
•	 Our corporately managed charitable fundraising programs are the
annual United Way campaign, the Employee Assistance Fund and
disaster relief response efforts through the Red Cross. The U.S. Bank
Sponsored Charitable Fundraising Policy includes guidelines for
approved U.S. Bank-sponsored activities and collection drives.
•	 Even if you’re not on work time—defined as the time you spend
performing your job or are expected to be performing your job—you
may not solicit employees who are on work time.
•	 You may not use company resources, such as copy and fax machines,
inter-office mail and US Book, for unauthorized solicitation. You also
may not post or distribute pamphlets, leaflets, emails or other literature
in work areas or on company bulletin boards.

5.1 Complying with laws governing political activities

5.1.1.2 U.S. Bancorp political action committees

5.1.1 Corporate political activities

U.S. Bancorp has two political action committees (PACs)—
the U.S. Bancorp Political Participation Program PAC and the
U.S. Bancorp Federal PAC—that make contributions to candidates
and other political committees at the federal, state and local level.

U.S. Bank works at the federal, state and local level on issues that
affect the financial industry. We comply with all laws that govern
interactions with public officials and employees, political contributions
and lobbying activities.
5.1.1.1 Lobbying activities
Lobbying activity generally includes both traditional and procurement
lobbying efforts. Traditional lobbying focuses on the activities of legislatures,
with the goal of influencing legislative and budgetary issues. Activities
include researching and analyzing legislation, monitoring and reporting
on recent developments, and attending congressional, state legislative
or regulatory meetings. The focus of procurement lobbying is developing
business relationships with the government.
The federal government and many states have extended the term “lobbying
activity” to cover efforts to influence rulemaking by executive branch
agencies and other actions taken by government agencies. This includes
an agency’s decision to enter into a contract or other financial arrangement.
You may not engage in lobbying activities on behalf of U.S. Bank without
approval from Government Relations. The only exception is lobbying
governmental agencies regarding decisions about specific contracts or
other financial arrangements. In addition, you should not engage outside
lobbying organizations or government affairs consultants without the
prior approval and oversight of Government Relations and notification of
Governmental Interactions Compliance.

46

These PACs enable employees to become involved in the political
process. Employees who are eligible to participate are invited to join;
participation is voluntary. Participating employees may request PAC
contributions to incumbent federal officials (other than the president),
but no other requests are permitted. In general, due to regulatory
requirements, you shouldn’t convey personal preferences regarding
particular candidates or political organizations to Government
Relations staff (except regarding federal incumbents).
Outside of participation in these PACs, you may not solicit or
contribute funds for political purposes or engage in any other political
activity on behalf of U.S. Bank. This prohibition includes contributing
U.S. Bank funds to any organization that engages in political activity
without prior approval from Government Relations, Governmental
Interactions Compliance and the Law Division. Contact Governmental
Interactions Compliance if you’re uncertain about whether this applies
to particular activities or organizations.
For more information see:
U.S. Bancorp PAC Program

Even if you don’t have direct contact with a government official, the
assistance you give to an employee who does lobby a government official
can count as lobbying activity under certain circumstances.

DID YOU K NOW?
“Grassroots” political activity on behalf of U.S. Bank often counts as
lobbying activity, even though it usually is informal.

5.1.1.3 Gifts and entertainment for public officials
Before you give anything of value to a federal, state, local or foreign
government official or employee, you must get approval from the
Law Division.
Gifts to public officials or employees may be subject to legal
restrictions or prohibitions.
•	 The executive branch of the federal government, the U.S. Senate,
the U.S. House of Representatives, each state and many local
jurisdictions have separate laws restricting gifts to their officials and
employees. (A “gift” is anything of value that provides a personal
benefit, such as meals, beverages, entertainment, transportation,
lodging or gift items.)
•	 Anti-bribery laws—including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act—
severely restrict gifts of any value to officials of foreign governments.
For more information see:
“Anti-bribery laws,” section 3.2.5 of this Code
Gifts and Entertainment Pre-clearance
5.1.2 Personal political activities	
We encourage employees to be active and knowledgeable participants
in the civic and political arena. U.S. Bank respects your right to express
your political views, support candidates, run for elective office and
serve in a government-appointed office. Your activities must be legal
and done on your own time and at your own expense. You may not
use U.S. Bank email or other company resources. You also must avoid
conflicts of interest. Never give the impression that U.S. Bank supports
or endorses your personal political activity.
If you’re involved in U.S. Bank business with government entities, you
may be subject to restrictions on your personal political contributions
(both monetary and in-kind), fundraising and other political activities.
This includes running for elective office, accepting a government
appointment or accepting a position on another’s election campaign.
U.S. Bank prohibits soliciting, making or coordinating political

contributions in exchange for public contracts, otherwise known as
“pay-to-play.” In addition, many laws prohibit government agencies
from entering into contracts with companies when certain employees
make, solicit or coordinate contributions above set limits.
If you’re an Identified Employee, you must get pre-approval from
Governmental Interactions Compliance before you make political
contributions or engage in other political activities. If you’re not
sure whether this applies to you, contact Governmental
