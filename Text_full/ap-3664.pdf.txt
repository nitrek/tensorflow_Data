In the Matter of
JASON MAIHER

ORDER POSTPONING
HEARING AND SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting administrative and
cease-and-desist proceedings (OIP) in this matter on February 23, 2016. The OIP directs me to
issue an initial decision within 300 days after service of the OIP. OIP at 8. A hearing is
currently scheduled for March 22, 2016.
In view of the foregoing, I ORDER the following:
1.
The hearing scheduled to begin on March 22, 2016, is POSTPONED and a telephonic
prehearing conference will be held on March 29, 2016, at 3:00 p.m. EDT.
2.
Prior to the prehearing conference, the parties must confer and discuss the date of the
hearing in this matter, the most convenient location for the hearing, the prehearing schedule, and
the matters listed in Rule of Practice 221(c). See 17 C.F.R. § 201.221(c). In doing so, the parties
should bear the following in mind. First, 5 U.S.C. § 554(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 201.200(c) provide
guidance regarding the location of the hearing. Second, Respondent has a right to a hearing
between thirty and sixty days after service of the OIP. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-3(b); see OIP at 7-8. If
Respondent exercises that right, the hearing in this matter will commence on a date to be
determined within that time period. If Respondent waives that right, the hearing will begin
roughly four months after Respondent is served with the OIP. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2). In
either event, the hearing date will be discussed during the prehearing conference.
3.
By March 24, 2016, the parties must by joint letter, filed consistent with 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.151-52:
a)

notify this office of the results of their discussion;

b)
notify this office if Respondent wishes to exercise his right to begin the hearing
between thirty and sixty days of service of the OIP; and

c)

notify this office of the date they have agreed the hearing should begin.

4.
The Division of Enforcement should promptly notify this office when Respondent or his
counsel is served with the OIP. Service on an individual is complete upon delivery. 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.141(a)(2)(i). The parties may stipulate to a service date in their joint letter.
The parties are asked to e-mail PDF text-searchable courtesy copies of any filings in this
proceeding to alj@sec.gov.
