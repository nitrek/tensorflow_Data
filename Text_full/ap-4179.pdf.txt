In the Matter of
FAIRFIELD MINERALS, LTD. and
METAL STORM LIMITED

ORDER POSTPONING HEARING
AND SCHEDULING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP) on
August 30, 2016, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. A hearing is scheduled for September 23, 2016.
On September 16, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
establishing that Respondent Fairfield Minerals, Ltd., was served with the OIP in Canada by mail in
accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(iv) on September 9, 2016. Fairfield’s answer is
therefore due September 22, 2016. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b). However, the
declaration does not establish that Respondent Metal Storm Limited, located in Darra, Queensland,
Australia, was served with the OIP in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(iv), as the
declaration does not address whether service by mail is permitted in Darra, Queensland. See
Shoham v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 922 F. Supp. 2d 44, 50 (D.D.C. 2013) (A “partial exception [to
no objection to service via international mail] appears to be Australia, which ‘does not object to
service by postal channels, where it is permitted in the jurisdiction in which the process is to be
served.’ . . . [Plaintiff] seeks to effect service via international mail . . . in Sydney, Australia, but did
not provide any information indicating that this jurisdiction in Australia permits service by mail.”).
Accordingly, I ORDER the Division to file by September 30, 2016, an updated declaration
concerning the status of service on Respondent Metal Storm Limited. Further, I POSTPONE the
hearing scheduled for September 23, 2016, and ORDER that a telephonic prehearing conference be
held on Tuesday, October 4, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern. I note that if a Respondent fails to timely
file an answer, appear at the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend the proceeding, it will be
deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined against it, and the registration of its securities
will be revoked. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f).
