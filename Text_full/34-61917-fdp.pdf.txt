File No. 3-11935

FINAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
I.

Background
1.

On May 31, 2005, the Commission instituted and simultaneously settled

administrative proceedings against Smith Barney Fund Management LLC and Citigroup
Global Markets Inc. (collectively, “Respondents”) relating to the appointment and
operation of an affiliated transfer agent that served the Smith Barney Family of Funds
(the “Funds”). In its Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings,
Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order
against Smith Barney Fund Management LLC and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., dated
May 31, 2005 (the “Order”), the Commission found that the Respondents misrepresented
and omitted material facts when recommending to the boards of the Funds that the Funds
change from the third-party transfer agent they previously used to a transfer agent that
was a Citigroup affiliate, Citicorp Trust Bank fsb or a predecessor entity (collectively,
“CTB”). The Commission ordered the Respondents to pay disgorgement of
$109,004,551, prejudgment interest of $19,055,630, and a penalty of $80,000,000. The

US1DOCS 7363304v1

Respondents were deemed to have already paid disgorgement of $17,004,551 and
prejudgment interest of $7,351,599, which the Respondents had previously returned to
the Funds. The Commission ordered the Respondents to pay the remaining disgorgement
of $92,000,000, the remaining prejudgment interest of $11,704,031, and the penalty of
$80,000,000 within ten days of the entry of the Order, i.e., within ten days of May 31,
2005. As described in the Order, the amount of $92,000,000 in disgorgement represented
CTB’s net pre-tax revenues (net of sub-transfer-agent fees), minus its total operating
expenses, for the period from October 1, 1999 through September 30, 2004. The
Commission also ordered that a Fair Fund be established pursuant to Section 308(a) of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for the disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalty
amounts to be paid by the Respondents. 1
2.

On June 8, 2005, the Respondents satisfied their disgorgement,

prejudgment interest and penalty obligations under the Order by wiring to the
Commission $183,704,031, in accordance with wire transfer instructions provided by the
Commission staff on June 7, 2005. The wired amount is the sum of the $92,000,000 of
remaining disgorgement, the $11,704,031 of remaining prejudgment interest, and the
$80,000,000 penalty that the Respondents were required to pay under the Order. The
funds have since been transferred to the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Bureau of Public
Debt (“BPD”) and, pending distribution, have been invested in short-term Treasury
securities. Other than interest from these investments, it is not anticipated that the Fair
Fund will receive additional funds.

See Sections IV.E-IV.G of the Order.

3.

As described in detail below, the Plan, in substance, provides for the

distribution of disgorgement-related portions of the Citigroup Fair Fund, defined in
paragraph 4 below, to Funds that engaged CTB as their transfer agent and paid transfer
agent fees to CTB between October 1, 1999, and November 30, 2004 or to successors to
such Funds, in proportion to the total transfer agent fees paid to CTB by each Fund or
class of a Fund (subject to certain adjustments). The Respondents, in consultation with
the Commission staff, conclude that allocating the disgorgement-related portions of the
Citigroup Fair Fund based upon the percentage of overall transfer agent fees (including
sub-transfer agent fees) paid by each Fund is fair and reasonable. In reaching this
conclusion the Respondents considered an allocation based upon the percentage of
transfer agent fees paid by each Fund net of sub-transfer agent fees and CTB’s operating
expenses. The Respondents have informed the Commission staff that it would not be
feasible to allocate operating expenses among Funds. Additionally, according to the
Respondents, these two allocation methods would result in similar distributions because
each of the Funds paid the same percentage of its overall transfer agent fees to the subtransfer agent and CTB’s total operating expenses were small relative to the overall
transfer agent fees. As described in paragraph 14, Funds that were liquidated prior to the
initial submission of this Plan will not participate in the distribution. Further, as
described in paragraph 15, the Respondents have been advancing the estimated
distribution amounts under the Plan to Funds that were liquidated after the initial
submission of the Plan but before the distribution. Under the Plan, the Respondents will
recover the amounts advanced to those liquidated Funds, plus interest. The Plan is

3
 


subject to approval by the Commission, and, if the Commission approves the Plan, the
Commission shall retain jurisdiction over its implementation.
II.

Definitions
As used herein, the following definitions shall apply:
4.

“Citigroup Fair Fund” shall mean the $183,704,031 that the Respondents

have paid to the Commission in satisfaction of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest,
and penalty obligations, plus the interest and income generated while the funds were held
by the Commission or by BPD (“earnings”), less any fees, expenses, reserves, or taxes, if
any, incurred by the Citigroup Fair Fund.
5.

“Distributable Amount” shall mean the $92,000,000.00 in remaining

disgorgement and $8,825,606.68 in interest, plus any earnings thereon, less the pro rata
share of any fees, expenses, reserves, or taxes, if any, incurred by the Citigroup Fair
Fund.2
6.

“Period” shall mean the period from October 1, 1999, through November

30, 2004.
7.

“Entitled Class” shall mean a class of shares issued by an Entitled Fund

that had more than one class of shares outstanding during the Period or has more than one
class of shares outstanding at the time of distribution of the Citigroup Fair Fund.
8.

“Entitled Fund” shall mean each Fund, other than a previously liquidated

fund described in paragraph 14 of this Plan and other than a Fund that previously
received reimbursement of all transfer agent fees paid to CTB during the Period, (a) that

2

The amount of $8,825,606.68 in interest was determined using the Federal shortterm rate determined and applied in accordance with a methodology not unacceptable to
the staff of the Commission.
4


engaged CTB as its transfer agent and paid transfer agent fees to CTB during the Period,
or (b) that is the successor by merger to a Fund that engaged CTB as its transfer agent
and paid transfer agent fees to CTB during the Period (a “Successor Fund”).3 For
purposes of paragraph 12 of this Plan, an “Entitled Fund” means an Entitled Fund that
had only one class of shares outstanding during the Period and has only one class of
shares outstanding at the time of the distribution of the Citigroup Fair Fund. In the case
of a Successor Fund, references in this Plan to transfer agent fees paid by an Entitled
Fund shall include payments by the merged Fund.
III.

Allocation and Distribution of the Citigroup Fair Fund
9.

Qualified Settlement Fund Status. The Citigroup Fair Fund constitutes a

Qualified Settlement Fund under Section 468B(g) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26
U.S.C. § 468B(g), and related regulations, 26 C.F.R. §§ 1.468B-1 through 1.468B-5.
10.

Jurisdiction of the Commission. The assets in the Citigroup Fair Fund are

subject to the continuing jurisdiction and control of the Commission.
11.

Claims-Made Process Procedures Not Applicable. The Citigroup Fair

Fund is not being distributed according to a claims-made process. Accordingly, the
procedures for providing notice and for making and approving claims are not applicable.

3

The Entitled Funds and Entitled Classes are listed on Exhibit A. Funds that
engaged CTB as their transfer agent but did not make payments to CTB for services are
excluded from the distribution under the Plan unless they qualify as a Successor Fund for
purposes of paragraph 13. The funds that previously received reimbursement of all
transfer agent fees are listed on Exhibit A.

5


12.

Calculation of Distributable Shares and Amounts. Each Entitled Fund or

Entitled Class is assigned a percentage share of the Distributable Amount (the
“Distributable Share”). Each Entitled Fund’s or Entitled Class’s Distributable Share is
equal to the ratio of (a) each Entitled Fund’s or Entitled Class’s transfer agent fees, not
including out-of-pocket expenses, paid to CTB during the Period to (b) the total transfer
agent fees, not including out-of-pocket expenses, paid to CTB by all Entitled Funds and
Entitled Classes during the Period (“Total TA Fees”).4 Each Entitled Fund’s or Entitled
Class’s Distributable Share is multiplied by the Distributable Amount to arrive at a
distributable amount for each Entitled Fund or Entitled Class (the “Specific Distributable
Amount”).
13.

Merged Funds or Classes. For the purpose of calculating the Distributable

Shares and Specific Distributable Amounts, in the case of a Fund that paid transfer agent
fees to CTB during the Period and was merged into a Successor Fund before the
distribution of the Citigroup Fair Fund under this Plan, (1) the transfer agent fees paid by
each class of a merged Fund to CTB during the Period are added to the transfer agent
fees, if any, paid to CTB during the Period by the class of shares in the Successor Fund
into which such merged Fund shares were converted in the transaction, and (2) if the
merged Fund and the Successor Fund each had only a single class of shares at the time of
the merger, the transfer agent fees paid by the merged Fund to CTB during the Period are
4

For purposes of these calculations, the transfer agent fees paid by Entitled Funds
or Entitled Classes include the amounts paid by the Entitled Funds or Entitled Classes
with respect to accounts for which First Data Investors Services Group (and PFPC, Inc.,
as its successor) served as sub-transfer agent but do not include the amounts paid by such
Funds or Classes with respect to accounts for which another entity served as sub-transfer
agent. Out-of-pocket expenses are certain separately itemized costs, including but not
limited to printing and mailing charges, that are incurred by and reimbursed to the
transfer agent or sub-transfer agent.
6


added to those, if any, paid by the Successor Fund during the Period. If a class of shares
of a Fund paid transfer agent fees to CTB during the Period and was merged or combined
with, or otherwise converted in its entirety into, another class of shares of the same Fund,
the transfer agent fees paid by the merged, combined or otherwise converted class are
added to those, if any, paid to CTB by the successor class during the Period for purposes
of calculating the successor class’s Distributable Shares and Specific Distributable
Amounts.
14.

Previously Liquidated Funds. Funds that paid transfer agent fees to CTB

during the Period but were liquidated or matured before the original submission of this
Plan by Respondents and for which Fund assets were previously distributed to
shareholders are excluded from receiving any distribution under this Plan. The transfer
agent fees paid by these liquidated Funds during the Period are excluded from the
calculation of Total TA fees for the purpose of calculating the Entitled Funds’ and
Entitled Classes’ Distributable Shares. Such previously liquidated Funds are listed in
Exhibit B.
15.

Subsequently Liquidated Funds. In addition to the Funds described in

paragraph 14, certain other Funds have been liquidated after the initial submission of this
Plan pursuant to Section IV.H of the Order. Such subsequently liquidated funds are listed
in Exhibit A. Respondents have advanced to each of these Funds or to each class of
shares thereof an estimated distributable amount calculated using a methodology
reviewed by the Commission staff. These amounts total approximately $2,039,996.60.
Because the Respondents advanced to each such Fund or class its estimated distributable
amount, the plan will reimburse Respondents at the time of the final distribution of the

7
 


Citigroup Fair Fund for these amounts plus the estimated pro rata earnings attributable to
the Fund or class from the date of such advance through the date of distribution of the
Citigroup Fair Fund.
16.

Verification and Notice to the Funds. Respondents and the independent

public accountants of the Funds have each taken such steps as they deemed reasonable to
verify the accuracy of the data and calculations, including the Distributable Shares and
Specific Distributable Amounts, and that such calculations and amounts conform in all
material respects to this Plan and the Order. After Respondents initially submitted the
Plan to the Commission staff on August 26, 2005, the independent directors of each
Entitled Fund then in existence and the counsel to those directors received notice of the
plan and an opportunity to submit comments or objections. No objections were made
concerning the initial plan.
17.

Publication and Comment. Notice of this Plan was published in the SEC

Docket and on the Commission website [http://www.sec.gov].
18.

Fund Administrator. Due to the small number of claimants, and to insure

the maximum payout to these claimants, an Assistant Regional Director in the
Commission’s New York Regional Office be appointed as Fund Administrator of the
Citigroup Fair Fund. The Fund Administrator shall carry out the duties specified by this
Plan, including, among other things, overseeing compliance with the terms of the Plan;
cooperating with the Respondents and the Tax Administrator in providing the
information necessary to accomplish income tax compliance; review and, if appropriate,
approve payment of bills submitted by the Tax Administrator for services rendered to and

8
 


taxes paid on behalf of the Citigroup Fair Fund; and submit the Final Accounting
specified in paragraph 30 below.
19.

In carrying out his or her duties, the Fund Administrator may be assisted

by other Commission staff acting under his or her supervision.
20.

Pursuant to Rule 1105(d) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17

C.F.R. § 201.1105(d), the Fund Administrator shall receive no compensation, other than
his or her regular salary as an employee of the Commission, for his or her services in
administering the Citigroup Fair Fund.
21.

The Fund Administrator shall be entitled to rely on any orders issued in

this proceeding by the Commission, the Secretary by delegated authority, or an
Administrative Law Judge, and may not be held liable to any person for any act or
omission in the course of administering the Citigroup Fair Fund, except upon a finding in
this proceeding of willful failure to comply with the terms of the Plan or any orders
issued in this proceeding. The Fund Administrator will be deemed to be acting within the
scope of his or her employment with the Commission in administering this Plan.
22.

Tax Administrator. The Commission has appointed Damasco &

Associates as the Tax Administrator (“Tax Administrator”) of the Fund.5 The Fund
Administrator and the Respondents will cooperate with the Tax Administrator in
providing information necessary to accomplish the income tax compliance, ruling and
advice work assigned to the Tax Administrator by the Commission. Before the
distribution of the Citigroup Fair Fund to the Entitled Funds, the Respondents will

5

Exchange Act Release No. 53453 (Mar. 8, 2006).
9


coordinate with the Tax Administrator to determine whether it is necessary to solicit an
IRS Form W-9 (resident entities) or W-8 (non-resident entities) from each Entitled Fund.
23.

Fees and Expenses of Administration. Unless otherwise expressly

provided in this Plan, the Respondents will pay all reasonable fees and costs associated
with the administration of this Plan, including the fees of the Tax Administrator.
24.

Tax Payments. The Tax Administrator shall bill the Citigroup Fair Fund

for the tax payments made on its behalf. Each tax bill shall be reviewed by the Fund
Administrator. After the Fund Administrator has approved the bill for payment, the
Commission staff will pay the bill using funds from the Citigroup Fair Fund. Payment
shall come first from any earnings, and second, if necessary, from the principal. Prior to
the distribution and eventual termination of the Citigroup Fair Fund, the Respondents will
coordinate with the Tax Administrator to make adequate reserves for final payment of tax
liabilities.
25.

Disbursement of Funds Through U.S. Treasury’s Financial Management

Service. The Citigroup Fair Fund will be disbursed to Entitled Funds and Entitled
Classes through the United States Department of the Treasury’s Financial Management
Service (“FMS”), which will electronically transfer funds through the Automated
Clearing House (“ACH”). Commission staff will provide the Respondents with
appropriate proprietary software for compiling the information necessary to be submitted
to FMS. Approximately 30 days prior to the distribution date, the Respondents will
compile the information available into an electronic file in the Agency Input format and
submit it to the SEC Office of Financial Management to ensure the file passes all system
edits. Any errors or omissions of data will be communicated back to the Respondents

10
 


promptly. The Respondents will submit the final electronic file to the assigned
Commission staff. Upon receipt of the file, the Commission staff will obtain
authorization from the Commission to disburse pursuant to SEC Rule 1101(b)(6). When
the order to disburse is entered, the Commission will transmit the electronic file to FMS
for the transfer of funds. Within 24 to 48 hours of receipt by FMS, funds will be
transferred by the ACH. FMS will notify the Commission, which, in turn, will notify the
Fund Administrator and the Respondents of any returned items due to non-delivery
and/or other deficiencies. The Respondents are responsible for researching and
reconciling all errors that result in non-delivery and shall submit a supplemental
electronic file for payment of the returned items. The Respondents are also responsible
for accounting for all payments.
26.

Approved Payment File. The disbursements described in paragraph 25

will be effected through disbursements to each entity that serves as custodian for one or
more of the Entitled Funds or Entitled Classes (“Custodian”). The electronic file
described in paragraph 25 will list the aggregate amounts that will be disbursed to each
Custodian and will be supplemented by a confidential paper document that specifies the
Distributable Share and Specific Distributable Amount for each Entitled Fund or Entitled
Class at each identified Custodian (“Payment File”). The Commission staff will obtain
Commission approval of the Payment File as part of obtaining Commission authorization
to disburse funds as described in paragraph 25.
27.

Reimbursement of Advances to Subsequently Liquidated Funds. The

electronic file submitted to the Staff pursuant to paragraph 25 of this Plan will specify the
instructions and aggregate amounts to be wired to Respondents to reimburse Respondents

11
 


for advances previously made by Respondents to subsequently liquidated funds, as
described in paragraph 15 of this Plan. The Payment File will detail the amounts
advanced by Respondents to any such subsequently liquidated fund and the date such
amounts were advanced and will be accompanied by supporting documentation
confirming the advances and receipt thereof by the relevant Funds. Upon authorization
of disbursement by the Commission, Respondents will be reimbursed for these amounts
through the FMS system at the same time as, and together with, the payments to the
Funds’ custodians described in paragraph 26 of this Plan.
28.

Third-Party Validation and Custodian Confirmation. Respondents shall

retain, at their expense, a third party not unacceptable to the staff of the Commission to
validate: (a) Respondents’ computations of the Distributable Shares in the Payment File;
(b) the amounts advanced by Respondents to subsequently liquidated funds as described
in paragraph 15 of this Plan; and (c) Respondents’ computations of the Specific
Distributable Amount of each Entitled Fund or Entitled Class in the Payment File. Such
validation shall be performed by a method and to standards not unacceptable to the staff
of the Commission. The third party shall report to, and provide a copy of the validation
results to, the staff of the Commission together with Respondents’ submission of the
Payment File as described in paragraph 26 of this Plan. Respondents shall arrange for
each Custodian to provide written confirmation to the staff of the Commission, within 10
calendar days after receipt of the disbursements described in paragraph 25 of this Plan, of
the amounts received and credited to each Entitled Fund or Entitled Class.
29.

Undistributed Funds. A residual account within the Citigroup Fair Fund is

established for any amounts remaining after all Specific Distributable Amounts have

12
 


been distributed and after all advances to Subsequently Liquidated Funds have been
reimbursed. The residual account may include, without limitation, funds reserved for
future taxes and related expenses; distributions that were not delivered or not accepted;
funds returned by the Entitled Funds; or tax refunds for overpayment or for waiver of
penalties. All funds in the residual account will be transferred by the Commission staff to
the U.S. Treasury after the final accounting is approved by the Commission.
30.

Final Accounting. Once all funds are disbursed through FMS, the Fund

Administrator will submit, on a standardized accounting form provided by Commission
staff, a Final Accounting for approval by the Commission prior to the termination of the
Citigroup Fair Fund and the discharge of the Fund Administrator. The Fund
Administrator will consult with Respondents about the preparation of the Final
Accounting.
31.

Termination of the Citigroup Fair Fund. Upon distribution of the

Citigroup Fair Fund, the Fund Administrator and the Respondents shall make
arrangement for the final payment of taxes and Tax Administrator’s fees. The Citigroup
Fair Fund shall be eligible for termination after all of the following events have occurred:
(1) the Final Accounting in an SEC standard accounting format by the Fund
Administrator has been submitted and approved by the Commission; (2) all taxes and
fees have been paid; and (3) any remaining residual has been transferred to the
Commission for transfer to the U.S. Treasury. When the Commission has approved the
final accounting, the staff shall seek an order from the Commission to approve sending
the remaining residual amount to the United States Treasury and shall seek an order for
the termination of the Citigroup Fair Fund and the discharge of the Fund Administrator.

13
 


32.

Amendments and Procedural Deadline Extensions. The Respondents will

inform the Commission staff of any changes in the Plan. If the Fund Administrator
determines a change to be material, Commission approval is required prior to
implementation by amending the Plan, which may be done upon the motion of the
Respondents or the Fund Administrator, or upon the Commission’s own motion. For
good cause shown, the Commission staff may extend any of the procedural dates set forth
in this Plan.
