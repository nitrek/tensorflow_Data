ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-15764
In the Matter of
GARY L. MCDUFF

ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR
EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE
RESPONSIVE POST-HEARING BRIEFS

Responsive post-hearing briefs in this matter are currently due September 9, 2016.
Today, the Division of Enforcement submitted a motion for a two-week extension of that
deadline to September 23, 2016, citing, among other things, the fact that it only just recently
received a number of new exhibits offered by Respondent. The Division’s motion contemplates
that the extension would apply equally to Respondent.
For good cause shown under 17 C.F.R. § 201.161, the Division’s motion for extension is
GRANTED. Responsive post-hearing briefs are now due by September 23, 2016.
