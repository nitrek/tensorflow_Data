OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMENT

Respondents.
Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission’s (“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans
(“Rules”), 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103, that the Division of Enforcement has submitted to the
Commission a proposed plan of distribution (“Distribution Plan”) for the distribution of monies
paid by GMB Capital Management LLC (currently known as “Clearstream Investments LLC”)
(“GMB Management”), GMB Capital Partners LLC (“GMB Partners”), Gabriel Bitran, and
Marco Bitran (collectively, the “Respondents”) in the above-captioned matter.
On April 20, 2012, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21C
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
and Sections 203(e), 203(f), and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against the
Respondents. 1 The Order found that in 2005, Gabriel Bitran founded GMB Capital Management
LLC for the stated purpose of managing hedge funds using quantitative models he developed,
based on his academic optimal pricing research, to trade primarily in exchange traded funds
(“ETFs”). According to the Order, Gabriel Bitran and Marco Bitran solicited potential investors
with three primary selling points: (1) very successful performance track records purportedly
based on actual trades using real money from 1998 to the inception of the hedge funds; (2) the
firm’s use of Gabriel Bitran’s proprietary optimal pricing model to trade ETFs; and (3) Gabriel
Bitran’s pedigree and his involvement as the founder and portfolio manager of the hedge funds.

Securities Act Rel. No. 9315 (Apr. 20, 2012).

Over a period of three years, raising over $500 million for eight hedge funds and various
managed accounts, Respondents made misrepresentations to investors about each of these selling
points, and at times, all three of them. As a result of this misconduct, the Order found the
Respondents willfully violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”),
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5
thereunder, and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and Rule
206(4)-8 thereunder; GMB Management, Gabriel Bitran and Marco Bitran willfully violated
Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act; GMB Management willfully violated Section
204(a) of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2(a)(16) thereunder; and, Gabriel Bitran and Marco
Bitran willfully aided and abetted and caused GMB Management’s and/or GMB Partners’
violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule
10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 204(a), 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rules
204-2(a)(16) and 206(4)-8 thereunder. The Order required the Respondents to pay a total of
$4,800,000 in disgorgement and civil money penalties to the Commission and created a Fair
Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended.
