FOREWORD
This 24th Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Congress for the fiscal year July 1, 1957 to June 30, 1958
describes the Commission's activities during the year in discharging its
duties under the statutes which it administers. These include supervision of the registration of securities for sale to the public by the use
of the mails and in interstate commerce, enforcement of the anti-fraud
provisions of the federal securities laws, surveillance of the exchange
and over-the-counter markets in securities, regulation of the activities
of brokers and dealers and investment advisers, and regulation of
registered public utility holding company systems and investment
companies.
In the fiscal year 1958 new issues of securities registered for public
sale totalled $16.5 billion, the largest amount in the Commission's history. The amount of such issues has increased at least $1.5 billion in
each year since 1953, when the total amount registered was $7.5 billion,
less than half the present amount.
With a continued high level of financial activity in the security
markets, the Commission has continued an intensified enforcement
program of discovering, preventing and punishing fraudulent and
other illegal activities in securities transactions. An important aspect
of this enforcement program during the fiscal year was an increase of
approximately 20% in the number of inspections conducted of securities brokers and dealers registered with the Commission.
During the fiscal year the Commission submitted to the Congress
proposals for a comprehensive revision of various of the acts which
it administers. These proposals were described in the Commission's
23rd Annual Report. Additional legislative proposals of the Commission, as well as other bills affecting the Commission, are discussed
in this report.
All phases of the Commission's activities have been under study
during the fiscal year by the Special Subcommittee on Legislative
Oversight of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. The Commission has endeavored to cooperate fully with the
Subcommittee in its work. At its request, the Chairman, members of
the Commission and members of the staff have appeared before it and
a substantial amount of information requested by the Subcommittee
has been supplied.

PART I
CURRENT ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS AND PROGRAM
A stated purpose of Congress in enacting the Federal securities laws
was to provide full and fair disclosure with respect to securities sold
in interstate and foreign commerce and to prevent fraud and inequitable and unfair practices in the securities markets. Under present conditions, the enforcement program of the Commission is an
essential instrument in attaining these objectives. That program has
been carried out, under the day-to-day direction of the Commission,
by its operating divisions in Washington and by its nine regional
and eight branch officesin principal cities throughout the country.
Recent years have witnessed a continuing surge of interest and
activity in the securities markets without parallel under the depressed
conditions of the thirties or under the circumstances of war and reconversion. Despite recent fluctuations in business volume, the dollar
amount of new securities registered with the Commission in fiscal
1958 totaled $16.5 billion-the largest amount in the history of the
Commission. This compares with $7.5billion of new financing during
fiscal 1953 and $6.4 billion in fiscal 1948. The aggregate market value
of all stock on all stock exchanges, which never exceeded $100 billion
between 1933 and 1945, was $250 billion at June 30, 1956, $262 billion
at June 30, 1957 and $258 billion at June 30, 1958.
The increased activity in the securities markets has reflected in part
the extraordinary increase in the number of holders of shares in publicly owned corporations. The number of holders of shares of publicly owned corporations was estimated by the New York Stock Exchange to have increased from 6,490,000in early 1952 to 8,650,000at
the end of 1955and has further increased since then.
The size of the securities markets is reflected in the fact that
there were on June 30,1958,4,752 broker-dealers and 1,562investment
advisers registered with the Commission, 2,997 stock issues traded
on stock exchanges and approximately 4,500 stock issues (excluding
investment company issues) each having more than 300 stockholders
which are traded over-the-counter. There are also thousands of
smaller issues which trade to some extent in the over-the-counter
market.
Conditions such as these have now persisted for several years and
produced enforcement problems of the first magnitude for the Com1
486867-59-2

2

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

mission. These conditions have attracted into the securities field a
fringe element of confidencemen who are determined to take whatever
advantage they can of the American public. The operations of these
confidence men have been encouraged by the expectations of a substantial segment of the public that it is possible for the unsophisticated
investor to reap large and quick profits in the securities markets. Uninformed investors are often willing to purchase unknown and speculative securities which are represented as offering unusual opportunities for gain.
Indeed, somewhat paradoxically, declines in the prices of seasoned
securities may increase the public appetite for such speculative offerings. Conditions in the capital market have been favorable for
mergers, acquisitions and programs of expansion, including not only
the great majority which result from legitimate economic forces, but
also a substantial number which appear to be designed largely to reap
profits for promoters and speculators at the expense of the public.
Opportunities for illicit profit by the illegal or fraudulent sale of
securities have multiplied, and inevitably the number, resources and
ingenuity of violators seeking to capitalize upon these opportunities
have likewise multiplied.
Illustrative of the enforcement problems now confronting the Commission are the matters briefly summarized below:
THE PROBLEM OF "BOILER ROOMS"

The term "boiler room", which unfortunately has become quite
familiar in the last few years, refers to an organization engaged in the
sale of securities primarily over the telephone, particularly the longdistance telephone, by high pressure methods ordinarily accompanied
by misrepresentation, deception and fraud. Such organizations generally concentrate on the distribution of one or a few issues of speculative securities at a time, seeking to sell these issues in quantity by
whatever misrepresentations are necessary to make a sale.
The "boiler room" continues to raise difficult enforcement problems
but these have recently taken a somewhat different form. Most of the
larger "boiler rooms" have disappeared due to the vigorous enforcement program of the Commission and state agencies. In the place
of the old-fashioned "boiler room" has appeared a group of small
firms which spring up suddenly, sell one or two spurious issues quickly
and then disperse, their fraudulent purpose accomplished. This
method of operation has made speed and alertness on the part of the
Commission and its staff essential to enforcement activities.
The operators of these small "boiler rooms" have recently shown
a tendency to operate not only in the large financial centers but also
in other locations around the country. There has been a noticeable

TWENTY-FOURTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

3

increase, for example, in migratory operators moving from state to
state, particularly in the Western part of the country. Not infrequently, long-distance telephone salesmen work out of hotel rooms,
apartments and alleged business offices. Extensive use is made of intermediaries, often in foreign countries, to conceal the nature of transactions and the identity of individuals. Payments are often made in
cash rather than by check.
The Commission has utilized all available enforcement techniques to
meet the problem. It has found, however, that resort to the civil injunction and administrative proceeding, no matter how vigorously
employed, is not completely effective in halting the operation of "boiler
rooms". The Commission believes that imposition of the sanctions
resulting from a criminal prosecution is necessary to stop effectively
this "cancerous diffusion". In carrying out its statutory duties, the
Commission will continue to press for criminal prosecution of
violators of the Federal securities laws where the facts warrant such
prosecution.
In addition to its enforcement powers the Commission has sought
through the dissemination of information to alert the investing public
to the risks involved in the purchase of securities from unknown highpressure telephone salesmen. In the last resort the problem of "boiler
rooms" can be eliminated only if the investing public in dealing with
unknown stock salesmen evaluate their representations with an attitude of hard-headed skepticism.
SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES BASED ON CLAIMED
EXEMPTIONS

It appears that a substantial but undetermined number of securities
have been sold in violation of the registration, prospectus and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to claimed
exemptions from registration which in fact were not available.
These sales have been made, in the main, under claims to exemption
based upon the intrastate exemption of section 3 (a) (11) and the
so-called "private offering" exemption of section 4 (1) of the Act.
The improper use of these exemptions to evade registration requirements usually occurs where an issue, or the sales procedures to be
employed, would not stand the light of the full disclosure requirements of registration. The Commission ordinarily learns of these
offerings only after they have been commenced and has no means of
ascertaining whether or not the exemption is available except by initiating an investigation. The staff of the Commission is now studying measures for remedying this situation, some of which may involve
legislative proposals to the 86th Congress.

4

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Various devices have been employed in an effort to evade registration by abuse of the intrastate exemption under section 3 (a) (11) of
the Securities Act of 1933. The issuer may attempt to use a resident
of the state as a nominee for non-resident beneficial owners, or the
alleged sales to residents may be merely a step in a planned distribution in interstate commerce.
One of the most frequently used devices to bring a distribution
within the "private offering" exemption is the use of the so-called
"investment intent" letter given by purchasers. In some cases an attempt is made to evade the basic policy of registration under the Securities Act by the technique of mechanically obtaining "investment
intent" letters from successive groups of purchasers when, in fact,
these purchasers buy with a view to distribution.
Further complicating the Commission's problems in this area has
been the fact that an increasingly large number of securities claimed
to have been issued pursuant to these exemptions have been transferred to United States citizens through Canadian, Swiss, Lichtenstein and other foreign financial institutions. When this occurs the
Commission has been handicapped in tracing transactions and determining the facts upon which the proof of availability or non-availability of the claimed exemption depends, particularly where the laws
of a particular foreign country preclude disclosure of the pertinent
information. There is reason to believe that in many instances these
channels are utilized for the deliberate purpose of complicating or
frustrating the Commission's enforcement effort although there is no
evidence of complicity on the part of foreign banks which may be
involved.
The Commission ordinarily receives no notice of a distribution for
a foreign account unless and until the matter comes to its attention
either as a result of a complaint from a public investor or in the
course of its inspection or investigation work.
In order to cope with illegal distributions made through the use
of such foreign devices, the Commission has recently proposed a rule
requiring members of national securities exchanges and brokers and
dealers to report to the Commission orders received from non-resident
persons to purchase a significant amount of a security as well as
purchases of a significant amount of a security from a foreign
source, if the purchase is made for the account of the member, broker
or dealer or is made for the account of any other person who, to the
knowledge of the member, broker or dealer, proposes to sell or is
selling the securities in the United States.' A rule of this nature
would give the Commission prompt notice of significant transactions
for foreign accounts, insofar as brokers and dealers in the United
1

TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

States are involved in the transactions, and this in turn should facilitate the efforts of the Commission to deal more effectively with illegal
distributions of securities through foreign sources.
EVASION

OF REGISTRATION

REQUIREMENTS

THROUGH

THE

"NO-SALE" THEORY

Under Rule 133,which embodies an interpretation of long standing,
the issue of securities in connection with certain types of corporate
mergers, consolidations, reclassifications of securities and acquisitions
of corporate assets is not deemed to constitute a "sale" of securities
to stockholders of corporate parties to the transactions. This rule
has the effect of exempting issues of securities in these transactions
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. It has been
relied upon in a very large number of corporate transactions consummated without registration of the securities involved. A substantial number of transactions ostensibly entered into under the rule
may, in fact, involve violations of the registration requirements.
The Commission considers that Rule 133 provides no exemption
from the registration and prospectus requirements of the Securities
Act with respect to any public distribution of securities received in
such a transaction by a security holder who may be deemed to be a
statutory underwriter. Recently the staff of the Commission proposed an amendment to Rule 133 designed to restate the purpose and
effect of that rule and to clarify its application and Iimitations." The
Commission has published the proposed amendment for comment by
all persons having an interest in the matter. The staff of the Com.
mission also is preparing a proposed form for registration of securities publicly distributed following transactions of the character
referred to in the rule, in order to simplify compliance with the registration requirements in such cases. Such a form may permit the use
of a prospectus in the form of a proxy statement meeting the requirements of Regulation 14 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
where such proxy statement has been employed in connection with the
transaction under Rule 133 supplemented by certain necessary additional information.
PROMOTIONAL

STOCKS

Recent economic conditions have been relatively favorable for the
sale of promotional stocks of new ventures, particularly in fields in
which the securities of established enterprises have shown marked
gains. For example, many new insurance and finance ventures have
been promoted, particularly in the South Central, Southwestern,
and Southeastern parts of the country, and their securities have been
• Securities A.ct Release No. 3965.

6

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

distributed interstate either through registration or under Regulation
A or, more commonly, in reliance upon the intrastate exemption.
Many of these issues and the sales techniques employed in their distribution appear to involve abuses and possible violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the Securities Act or the Securities
Exchange Act, which require extensive investigation. The large
number of these promotions and the rapidity with which they have
increased has placed most serious burdens on the Commission's
field enforcement personnel charged with the conduct of such
investigations.
MANIPULATIONOF THE SECURmES MARKETS

Increased activity on the Nation's securities markets has tempted
some to engage in manipulation of these markets. Devious schemes
may be employed to conceal both the fact of a manipulation and the
identity of the persons actually responsible. These include schemes
to increase the quoted over-the-counter prices for relatively obscure
issues being distributed without registration in reliance upon some
exemption, or the creation of fictitious markets for such issues. Such
schemes are not uncommon in connection with distributions effected
by "boiler rooms". These activities when conducted with ingenuity
through numerous intermediaries are difficult to detect. Persons engaged in, or proposing, a distribution of a security not outstanding
in the hands of the public may place orders for the purchase and
sale of small amounts of a security with numerous brokers and dealers,
or arrange to have others do this, with the result that such brokers
and dealers will publish quotations for the security at prices specified
in the orders, thus creating the appearance of an active over-thecounter market for the security, when in fact no such market exists
except as generated by the distributors. Wnen the distribution is
completed the orders are withdrawn and the "market" disappears.
Other apparent manipulations have occurred in issues in which
there is a substantial public stockholder interest, particularly issues
of companies engaged in expansion and diversification programs designed largely to reap profits for promoters and speculators at the
expense of the public. Here the motive is to facilitate the financing
of such programs, or to make the issuer's stock more attractive as a
mechanism of payment for other businesses, by creating the appearance of an active and rising market in such stock. The techniques
employed are various, including the dissemination of favorable information, the placing of buy orders at strategic moments and prices
so as to have the stock close each day with a rise, and encouraging
others to buy by giving them assurances against loss or lending money
to finance the purchase. Efforts are, of course, made to conceal the
identity of the persons ultimately responsible for the activity.

TWENTY-FOUR'l'H ANNUAL REPORT

7

The investigation and prosecution of a manipulation case requires
careful and painstaking work usually over a period of many months.
Investors must be identified and interviewed. Books and records of
brokers, dealers and others must be examined and analyzed. The
information thus obtained then has to be developed in a form which
would permit its introduction in evidence in legal proceedings. That
this is a difficult matter is illustrated by the fact that one of the Commission's experienced investigators has been engaged for almost a
year in assisting the United States Attorney in preparing one of
these cases for trial.
With the increasing tempo of activities in the securities markets,
the Commission has noted a growing number of instances of unusual
or unexplained market activity in particular securities. In some of
these cases a preliminary investigation has revealed that no violations
of law had occurred but in others the Commission has found it necessary to obtain an injunction or recommend criminal prosecution. The
Commission is much concerned with the increase in manipulative
activities and it is expected that it will be required to devote more of
its enforcement effort to this area.
STOP ORDER AND SUSPENSION PROCEEDINGS FOR NEW ISSUES

There continue to be numerous instances where issuers filing either
under the registration requirements of the Securities Act or under the
Commission's exemptive Regulation A do not appear to be making
an effort to comply in good faith with the disclosure and other
standards required for such filings. Consequently, it is necessary that
the Commission, for the protection of investors, institute stop order
proceedings or suspension orders. Each of these has been preceded
by an investigation and in many instances has required a formal administrative hearing. While the collection, presentation and analysis
of evidence imposes a substantial burden on the Commission's enforcement staff, nevertheless it has been possible in this way to prevent
the public sale of certain securities under circumstances likely to involve fraud upon the investing public.
BROKER-DEALER INSPECTIONS

Increased activity in the securities markets has also resulted in a
significant increase in the number of brokers and dealers. There were
4,752 registered broker-dealers on June 30, 1958 and the Commission
presently estimates that at the end of the fiscal year 1959 there will
be 4,900 registered broker-dealers. It is estimated that this number
will increase to 5,100 at the close of the fiscal year 19M. The Commission's concern with this increase in the number of registered brokers
and dealers arises from the fact that many of them are inexperienced

8

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

and un:familiar with the ethical and legal obligations owed to their
customers and that, therefore, there is a greater risk that injury may
result to public investors dealing with such persons. In order to
protect investors against possible abuses the Commission has intensified its broker-dealer inspection program. In the fiscal year 1958,
1,452inspections were completed-the greatest number since the Commission was organized.
SUMMARY

The Commission believes that an adequate and effective enforcement program is necessary not only to the discharge of its statutory
responsibilities but also, and perhaps more important, to the preservation of that investor confidence in the capital :formation process which
is so necessary to the continued progress and prosperity of an economy
based on the free enterprise system. To that end the Commission
has vigorously employed, and will continue to employ, all of its
enforcement weapons to protect the investing public.

PART
LEGISLATIVE

n
ACTIVITIES

Statutory Amendments Proposed by the Commission

In July and August 1957 the Commission submitted to the Congress
its proposals to amend an aggregate of 87 provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, the Investment Company Act of 194:0and the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. These proposals, together with requests for
hearings thereon, were submitted to the Committee on Banking and
Currency of the Senate and the Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce of the House of Representatives, to which Committees was
assigned the duty of exercising watchfulness over the execution of
the securities laws by section 136 of the Legislative Reorganization
Act of 1946. The proposals were introduced in the Senate by Senator
Frank: J. Lausche of Ohio, the then Chairman of the Subcommittee
on Securities of the Committee on Banking and Currency, as S. 2544,
S. 2545, S. 2546, S. 2547 and S. 2796. Subsequently, they were introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Oren Harris
of Arkansas, Chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce, as H. R. 9326, H. R. 9327, H. R. 9328, H. R. 9329 and H. R.
9330. The Senate bills were referred to the Committee on Banking
and Currency and the House bills to the Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce. No action was taken on these bills by either
Committee.
The overall purpose of the Commission's proposals was to
strengthen the safeguards and protections afforded the public by
tightening the jurisdictional provisions, correcting certain inadequacies revealed through administrative experience and facilitating criminal prosecutions and other enforcement activities. A discussion of
the more significant of these proposals is contained in the Commission's
23rd Annual Report, pp. 10-12.
On March 18, 1958, the Commission also submitted to Congress
proposals to amend various sections of the Bankruptcy Act in the
form of nine draft bills filed with the Committee on the Judiciary of
the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives,' These proposals are concerned with Chapters X and XI
1 For

of the Bankruptcy Act. Chapter XI affords a means of effecting a
composition of unsecured debts of debtors, including corporations.
Chapter X, on the other hand, affords a means for the reorganization
of corporations alone and has special safeguards to protect the interests of public security holders which are not provided in Chapter
XI. The more significant of the proposed amendments would permit
the Commission to appeal in a Chapter X proceeding if leave to appeal
is granted by the appropriate Court of Appeals; make Chapter XI of
the Bankruptcy Act unavailable to corporations whose outstanding
securities are beneficially owned by more than 100 persons; permit
the district judge to transfer proceedings brought under Chapter XI
of the Bankruptcy Act to Chapter X upon application of a party in
interest or the Commission, if the judge finds that the interest of
creditors and stockholders would best be served by a Chapter X proceeding; and allow the judge in a Chapter X proceeding to approve
a plan of reorganization which provides for less than full compensation to certain types of creditors, other than public investors, as is
now permitted in a proceeding under Chapter XI. '
These proposals were introduced in the House of Representatives
by Representative Emanuel Celler of New York, Chairman of the
Committee on the Judiciary as H. R. 11585-,H. R. 11586, H. R.
11587, H. R. 11588, H. R. 11589, H. R. 11590, H. R. 11591, H. R.
11592, and H. R. 11593 and were referred to the Committee on the
Judiciary. They were referred to the Judicial Council of the United
States Courts for review and a conference was held by the Commission with the Council in August, 1958, at Denver, Colo. No further
action was taken on these bills by the Congress.
The Commission expects to request further consideration of these
or similar proposals during the 86th Congress.
Other Legislative Proposals

H. R. 11050, introduced by Representative Abraham Multer of
New York, would remove the exemption provided by section 3 (a)
(11) of the Securities Act for a security offering confined to the residents of the state within which the issuer is both incorporated and
doing business. The Commission has not submitted its views on this
proposal. No hearings have been held on the bill.
H. R. 7671, which was introduced by Representative John Flynt
of Georgia and enacted into law, amends Section 116 (4) of Chapter
X of the Bankruptcy Act by depriving the district judge of power
to enjoin a lessor or conditional seller of aircraft equipment from
commencing a foreclosure action against an air carrier operating pursuant to a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Civil
Aeronautics Board. Since the assets of air lines consist principally of
equipment, the practical effect of the bill is to make reorganization

under Chapter X unavailable to certified corporate airline carriers
which lease their equipment or purchase it under conditional sales
contract. The Commission therefore filed a comment with the Congress opposing this hill, as well as a companion bill, S. 2205, introduced in the Senate by Senator John Butler of Maryland. The
Commission pointed out that the primary purpose of Chapter X
is to maintain the debtor as a going concern in order to protect the
public security holders, and that this is accomplished in part by
empowering the judge to restrain efforts to dismember the business
while the reorganization is in process.
The Commission devoted a substantial amount of time to matters
pertaining to other legislative proposals referred to it for comment.
During the fiscal year, a total of fifty-eight legislative proposals were
analyzed, as compared with thirty-three during the preceding fiscal
year. In addition, numerous congressional inquiries relating to matters other than specific legislative proposa:ls were received and
answered."
Congressional

Hearings

Small Business Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency.-On April 28, 1958, Chairman Gadsby and other
members of the Commission appeared before the Small Business
Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency
which was considering a number of bills designed to furnish financial
assistance to small business," The Commission had previously furnished the Committee with comments on S. 2160, S. 2185, S. 2286 and
S. 3191 and consequently the Chairman restricted his comments to
S. 3643 and S. 3651 which were the focal point of the hearings. The
latter bills provided for the establishment of small business investment companies for the purpose of providing financial assistance to
small business concerns, and for the regulation of certain aspects of
the organization and management of such proposed investment companies. Under both S. 3643 and S. 3651 the small business investment
companies would be authorized to purchase convertible debentures of
small business concerns and would obtain funds with which to make
the purchase by issuing their own securities to the public and by
borrowing funds from the Federal government.
S. 3643 provided an outright exemption from the Securities Act
and the Investment Company Act for the proposed small business
investment companies. S. 3651 granted the Commission authority to

exempt, by rule or regulation, from the provisions of the Securities
Act and the Trust Indenture Act, securities issued by the small business investment companies. The Commission opposed the exemptions
granted by S. 3643, pointing out the need for disclosure to investors
of information necessary for the formulation of an informed judgment
J,S to the investment merit of the securities of the small business investment companies offered to the public. With respect to S. 3651, it was
pointed out that the bill did not establish any definitive standards to
guide the Commission in the exercise of its discretionary exemptive
powers. The Commission was of the further view that the proposed
small business investment companies should be subject to the provisions
of the Investment Company Act, which provides needed additional
protections for investors (see Part IX infra). As S. 3651 was reported
out by the Committee on Banking and Currency and later passed by
the Congress, it made the small business investment companies subject
to the provisions of the Investment Company Act, except for section
18 of that Act, relating to asset coverage :for indebtedness. Authority
to grant exemptions :from the provisions of the Securities Act and the
Trust Indenture Act remained unchanged in the final draft.
Suhcommittee on Legislative Oversight of the House Committee
June 1957, all phases
on Interstate and Foreign Commerce.-Since

of the Commission's activities have been under study and investigation
by the Special Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight o:f the House
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. The Subcommittee
was organized in 1957, after Speaker Rayburn had recommended that
the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce set up a Subcommittee with authority to go into the administration of the laws by
agencies subject to the oversight of the House Committee on Interstate
and Foreign Commerce, "to see whether or not the law as we intended
it is being carried out or whether a great many of these laws are being
repealed or revamped by those who administer them."
The Chairman and members of the Commission, as well as several
members of the Commission's staff, appeared before the Subcommittee
during January and June of 1958. In addition, the Commission has
furnished the Subcommittee with answers to several detailed questionnaires. At least one attorney :from the Subcommittee's staff has
been working on matters involving this Commission on a full-time
basis since September 1957, and the Commission has :furnished working
space to the Subcommittee for the convenience of its staff. The Commission has cooperated with the Subcommittee in every possible way,
devoting approximately 10,000 man hours to the inquiry, which was
still pending at the end of the fiscal year.

REVISION OF RULES AND FORMS
The Commission maintains a continuous program of reviewing its
rules and forms under the various statutes administered by it in order
to determine whether any changes are appropriate in the light of
changes in techniques and conditions in the securities field. Certain
members of the staff are assigned the task of maintaining an overall
review of rules and forms, and the need for changes therein are
brought to the attention of the Commission. Changes are also suggested, from time to time, by other members of the staff who are
engaged in the examination of material filed with the Commission, as
well as by persons outside of the Commission, such as issuers and
underwriters and their attorneys, accountants or other representatives.
With a few exceptions provided for by the Administrative Procedure
Act, proposed new rules and forms and proposed changes in existing

Rule 133 provides in general that for the purpose of determining
the application of the registration and prospectus provisions of Section
5 of the Securities Act, no "offer" or "sale" shall be deemed to be
involved so far as stockholders of a corporation are concerned, where,
pursuant to provisions of a statute or the certificate of incorporation
there is submitted to the vote of such stockholders a plan involving a

transfer of assets of the corporation in consideration of the issuance
of securities of another corporation.
On October 2, 1956, the Commission invited comments on a proposal, the effect of which would have been to rescind rule 133 and to
provide that transactions of the character referred to in the rule
involve an "offer" and "sale" of a security subject to the registration
and prospectus provisions of the Act," The Commission received
numerous comments and a public hearing was held on January 17,
1957. On March 15, 1957, the Commission announced that it was
deferring action on the proposal pending further study of the problem
and questions raised and that any future modification of the rule
would be undertaken only after opportunity for further public
commentthereon.
On September 15, 1958the Commission issued a release S which recited that its staff had been engaged in a comprehensive review of
all relevant legislative and other statutory materials, prior Commission and staff actions, and the views expressed by those who appeared
at the Commission's public hearing on the 1956proposal or had otherwise commented on the question, and that on the basis of this study
the staff had recommended that the Commission abandon the 1956
proposal for revision of Rule 133, restate the purpose and effect of
Rule 133, and adopt rules designed to clarify the applications and
limitations of the rule.
The release invited comment on a proposed amendment of the rule
designed to implement the recommendations of the staff. This amendment would retain the existing rule but would incorporate into it
certain additional provisions which would make clear that registration is required in certain cases where a public distribution of securities initially required in transactions exempted by the rule is subsequently made by a person defined as a statutory underwriter. The
release stated that there was in preparation a proposed form which
could be used for registration of securities issued in distribution
transactions of the character referred to in the proposed amended
rule.

quire the inclusion of legends calling attention to the fact that a registration statement has been filed and cautioning the reader that offers
or sales may not be made until there has been compliance with State
and Federal requirements. These rules were amended during the fiscal
year to make minor verbal changes in the required legend to avoid conflict with the wording of the legend required by State securities administrators and make possible the use in such advertisements and preliminary prospectuses of a single legend meeting both Federal and
State requirements.'
Proposed Rule Changes Relating to Assessable Stock

During the fiscal year the Commission invited public comments on
a proposed new Rule 136 and a proposed amendment of Rule 140 with
respect to assessable stock and the levying of assessments thereon." In
connection with these proposals the Commission is also considering
further changes in its exemption rules under the Act so that the levying of small amounts of assessments may be effected pursuant to an
exemption, upon appropriate terms and conditions, from registration
under the Act. Action on the proposed new Rule 136 and the proposed
amendment of Rule 140 has been deferred pending the publication of
proposed rule changes to provide such exemption and consideration of
comments thereon.
The proposed new Rule 136 would operate to make the levying-of
assessments on assessable stock subject to the disclosure requirements
of the Act, either by way of registration under the Act or through
compliance with the terms and conditions of an appropriate exemption which is presently under study by the staff. The amendment to
Rule 140 is intended to clarify its application and specifically define
as an underwriter any company which is chiefly engaged in levying
assessments on its assessable stock in order to purchase the securities
of another issuer or of two or more affiliated issuers.
The above proposals are being considered because of continuing
complaints received by the Commission from the public as to the existence of abuses in connection with the levying of assessments by various
companies on their outstanding assessable stock. Certain companies
having assessable stock outstanding continue to levy assessments
against their stockholders without disclosing the status of the company or the purpose for which the proceeds are to be used. In some
instances stockholders who seek to obtain information from their companies receive very little information or even meet with a flat refusal
by company officials to furnish any information whatever. It appears
that in some cases proceeds received from the assessments will not be

productive of any present or potential benefit to the stockholders
against whom they are levied. In fact, some such companies appear to
be operated largely, if not solely, for the personal benefit of insiders.
There are indications that some companies having assessable stock
outstanding are being used as vehicles for raising funds for other
companies which are unable or unwilling to seek funds directly from
the public.
Amendment of Rule 161

Rule 161 provides that securities offered in conformity with the
rules and regulations under section 3 (b) of the Act may continue
to be offered in accordance with the rules and regulations in effect
at the time the offering commenced, notwithstanding subsequent
amendments to such rules and regulations. This rule was amended
during the fiscal year to provide that it shall not apply to offers
after January 1, 1959 of securities under Regulation D, which was
rescinded July 23, 1956, or under Regulation A as in effect prior
to its revision on July 23,1956.6 The purpose of the amendment was
to require any offerings under the previously existing Regulation
A or D to comply with the revised Regulation A if the offering is
continued after January 1, 1959.
Amendments to Regulation A

Regulation A provides an exemption from registration for issues
of securities not in excess of $300,000which are offered in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the regulation. A number of amendments to this regulation were adopted during the fiscal year.' One
of these amendments provides that where the securities to be offered
are interests in an unincorporated real estate syndicate there need
not be included in computing the amount of securities which may
be offered, the amount of interests in other unincorporated real estate
syndicates affiliated with the issuer. Another amendment to the regulation provides procedures for the filing of amendments to notifications and for the withdrawal of such notifications. There was also
added a requirement that underwriters must furnish a certification
that the information given in the notification and in the offering
circular with respect to underwriters, their directors, officersor partners is accurate and complete and does not omit any required information or any information necessary to make the statements made not
misleading. The remaining amendments were chiefly of a technical
or clarifying nature.

Revision of Fol'llUlS-2 and S-3

During the fiscal year revisions of Forms 8-2 and 8-3 were
adopted," Form 8-2 is used for registration under the Securities Act
of securities of commercial and industrial companies in the promotional and development stage. Form 8-3 is a similar form for mining companies in the exploratory or development stage. The revisions were for the purpose of bringing the forms up-to-date in the
light of the Commission's experience and current administrative practice. Form 8-11, another form for mining companies in the exploratory stage, was merged into Form S-3 so that there is now only
one form for use by this type of mining company.
Amendment of Forms S-4 and S-5

These forms are used for registration under the Securities Act of
securities of investment companies registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. A registration statement on either of these
forms includes certain of the information and documents which would
be required in a registration statement under the Investment Company Act of 1940 if such a statement were currently being filed.
Forms 8-4 and S-5 were amended during the fiscal year to adapt the
requirements of these forms to the Commission's amended Form
N-8B-1, described below, which is the corresponding basic form for
registration under the Investment Company Act,"
THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE Acr

Amendment of Rule lSb-8

Rule 15b-8 requires every broker-dealer who files an application for
registration to file with his application duplicate original statements
of financial condition disclosing, as of a date within 30 days of such
filing, the nature and amount of his assets, liabilities and net worth.
The amendment, effective September 15,1957, deleted from the rule an
exemption from this requirement formerly available to a partnership
succeeding to and continuing the business of another partnership registered as a broker-dealer at the time of such succession.w
Adoption of Rule lSd-20

During the fiscal year the Commission adopted a new rule, designated rule 15d-20, which provides for the granting of an exemption

Section 15 (d) requires each issuer of securities registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 to include in its registration statement an
undertaking to file annual and other periodic reports corresponding
to those required to be filed pursuant to-section 13 by issuers having
securities listed and registered on a national securities exchange, if
the aggregate offering price of the issue covered by the registration
statement plus all of the outstanding securities of the same class,
computed on the basis of the offering price, amounts to $2,000,000or
more. The obligation to file reports is suspended under certain conditions not pertinent here.
The new rule provides that the Commission may, upon application
and subject to appropriate terms and conditions, exempt an issuer
from the duty to file such reports if the Commission finds that all of
the outstanding securities of the issuer are held of record, that the
number of such record holders does not exceed 50 persons and that
the filing of such reports is not necessary in the public interest or
for the protection of investors.
The exemption expires if any of the issuer's securities cease to be
held of record, if the number of record holders increases to more
than 50 persons, or if the issuer fails to comply with any of the
terms or conditions upon which the exemption was granted. Provision is also made for termination of the exemption by the Commission, after an opportunity for a hearing, if the Commission finds
the termination to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest
or for the protection of investors.
Amendment of Rule 17a-3

Rule 17a-3 specifies the books and records required to be maintained and kept current by certain members, brokers and dealers.
The amendment, effective July 1, 1958/2 requires such persons to
prepare and maintain a record of the proof of money balances of all
ledger accounts in the form of trial balances currently at least once
a month.
Amendment of Rule 17a-5

Rule 17a-5 designates the members, brokers and dealers required
to file reports of financial condition containing the information called
for by Form X-17A-5, specifies the time when such reports must
be filed, and provides certain other requirements with respect to such
reports. Prior to the amendment, paragraph (a) required each member, broker and dealer subject to the rule to file the report within each
calendar year, except that reports for any two consecutive years could

20

not be filed within less than four months of each other. As amended,
this paragraph requires the report to be filed as of a date within each
calendar year, except that the first report (by others than successors)
must be as of a date not less than one nor more than five months after
the member, broker or dealer becomes subject to the rule. It also
provides that a member, broker or dealer who succeeds to and continues the business of a predecessor need not file a report as of that
year if the predecessor has filed the required report as of that year.
Paragraph (b) (1) of the rule describes the circumstances under
which a report must be certified. Prior to the amendment, there
was an exemption from the certification requirements for a member, broker or dealer who was not required to file a certified financial
statement with any State agency or any national securities exchange
and who, during the preceding calendar year, had not made a practice of extending credit to or holding funds or securities for customers except as an incident to transactions promptly consummated
by payment or delivery. The amendment to this paragraph provides that every Form X-17A-5 report must be certified by an independent accountant unless one of three limited exemptions is available. The first exemption is for a member of a national securities
exchange who, from the date of his previous report, has not transacted business with the public, has not carried any margin account,
credit balance or security for any person other than a general partner,
and has not been required to file a certified financial statement with
any national securities exchange. The second exemption is available
to a broker whose securities business is so limited that he has been
exempt from the Commission's aggregate-indebtedness-net-capitalratio rule 15c3-1. The third exemption is for a broker or dealer
whose securities business has been limited to buying and selling evidences of indebtedness secured by liens on real estate and who has
not carried margin accounts, credit balances or securities for securities customers."
Amendments to Form 8-C

Form 8-C is used for registration under the Act of a class of securities on a national securities exchange on which the registrant has no
securities registered, if such class is already listed and registered on
another national securities exchange. An application on Form 8-C
consists chiefly of copies of applications, reports and proxy statements filed with the original exchange, together with copies of the
required exhibits. This form was amended during the fiscal year to
provide for a considerable reduction-in the amount of material required to be filed in cases where the issuer intends to continue list11

Certain other changes in wording were also made in the form in
the interest of clarity.
Proposed Amendments to Form 8-K

During the fiscal year the Commission invited public comments
on certain proposed amendments to Form 8-K which is the form
prescribed for current reports filed pursuant to sections 13 and 15
(d) of the Act.15 The proposed amendments relate to Item 11 of
the form which requires information in regard to matters submitted
to a vote of security holders either at a meeting of such security
holders or otherwise. The purpose of the proposed amendments is
to clarify the item and the instructions thereto in certain respects.
The matter was still under consideration at the end of the fiscal
year."
Amendment to Form X-17 A-I

Form X-17A-1 is the form required to be used under rule 17a-2
by a "manager" of a distribution of securities and by other persons
subject to the rule who have a participation in an account for which
stabilizing purchases are effected. The amendments to the form
consist of a restatement of the instructions for use of the form, to
simplify and clarify its use, and of a requirement that the totals
of certain reported transactions be shown."
THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935
Rescission of Rule 9

On March 14, 1957 the Commission issued notice of It proposal
to rescind rule 9, which provides for the exemption of holding company systems having gross utility revenues not over $350,000 for
the preceding calendar year or having net utility assets not
over $1,000,000 currently or at December 31, 1946.18 After careful consideration of all the data, views and comments received in
response to its notice, the Commission concluded that adequate legal
basis for such exemption was lacking, and, on February 5, 19!'i8,
announced the rescission of the rule." The effective date of the

Amendment of Rule 70

During the fiscal year, the Commission amended rule 70 promulgated under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Section 17 (c) of that Act prohibits any registered holding company
or any subsidiary company thereof from having as an officer or
director any executive officer, director, partner, appointee or representative of any bank, trust company, investment banker, or banking
association or firm except as permitted by rules and regulations of
the Commission as not adversely affecting the public interest or the
interest of investors or consumers. Rule 70 defines those persons
or situations to which the Commission has granted- exception from
section 17 (c). Prior to the adoption of the amendment the rule
provided in effect that no holding company or subsidiary could have
as many as one-half of its directors persons with financial connections within the scope of section 17 (c). After issuing a notice of
proposal to amend the rule and requesting comments thereon," the
Commission adopted the amendment as circulated for comment;" As
amended, the rule exempts from the "less than one-half" limitation
a person whose only financial connection is that of a director, and
who is not an officeror employee, of one or more commercial banks
each having combined capital and surplus not in excess of $2,500,000
and who proposes to act as a director, but not as an officer or employee, of a registered holding company or subsidiary which is a
public utility company. In no event, however, may the number of
directors with financial connections proscribed by section 17 (c) exceed two-thirds of the total.

initiated by application or upon the Commission's own motion, pursuant to any section of the Act or any rule or regulation thereunder
except in cases involving sections of the Act where specified rules
prescribe a different procedure. Paragraph (c) of the rule prior to
the amendment was subject to the interpretation that the Commission
was required to order a hearing on a matter upon the request of any
interested person whether or not it appeared that a hearing was
necessary or appropriate. The amended rule makes it clear that the
Commission will order a hearing only if it determines that such is

Proposal to Adopt Rule 10F-3

In a proposed rule considered during the fiscal year the Commission sought, among other things, to alleviate the problems and administrative
burdens involved in processing applications
for
exemptions under section 10 (f), particularly in view of the tight
time schedules usually present in these cases. Notice of this proposal was issued on July 15, 1958.24
Section 10 (f) of the Act provides that an investment company,
unless exempted by rule, regulation or order, is prohibited from
purchasing a security during the existence of an underwriting syndicate, if any of the principal underwriters are affiliated persons of the
investment company. As a consequence, in such cases investment
companies must either first obtain an exemptive order of the Commission or purchase the securities conditioned on obtaining such
exemptive order within such periods of time as a particular underwriter might be willing to grant even though extending beyond the
date of the public offering. The proposed rule would permit the
investment company to make such purchases under certain conditions without having to obtain an order of exemption.
The experience of the Commission in its consideration of requests
for orders of exemption under its exemptive authority over the years
indicates that the protection of investors in such situations may be
adequately insured by the conditions and safeguards specified in the
rule. These include limitations with respect to the consideration paid,
as related both to the 'amount of the offering and the assets of the
investment company, the amount of underwriters' commissions, purchases from an affiliated underwriter, and effective registration of the
offering under the Securities Act of 1933. These conditions are designed to permit purchases where the circumstances are such as to
make it unlikely that such purchases would not be consistent with
the protection of investors.
Comments received on the proposal unanimously favored adoption
of the rule although they included a number of suggestions for modification of the conditions and prerequisition contained therein.
The Commission has taken the various comments under advisement,"
Proposal to Adopt Rule 220-1

On May 28, 1958, the Commission issued notice of a proposal to
adopt Rule 22D-l relating to permissible variations in the sales charge

made upon the sale of redeemable securities of registered investment
companies."
This action followed a comprehensive review of. t~e
legislative history of section 22 (d) of the Act, and all past administrative interpretations and exemptive orders issued under that section.
Section 22 (d) prohibits a registered investment company, its principal underwriter or a dealer in its shares from selling such shares
to any person except at a current public offering price described in
the prospectus. Its purpose is to prevent discrimination among purchasers and to provide for the orderly distribution of such shares
by preventing their sale at a price less than that fixed in the prospectus.
One objective of the proposed rule is to lessen the burden on the
Commission and the industry of preparing and processing exemption applications under section 6 (c) in cases identical to those where
such relief had been previously granted. An equally important objective of the rule is to codify and make public the Commission's
interpretation of section 22 (d), made on a case-by-case basis over
the past years, with such changes as believed necessary, and thus
ensure uniform compliance with its provisions.
The proposed rule would require some changes in current industry
practices, particularly with respect to the availability of so-called
"quantity discounts" for group purchases. The Commission in 1941
determined that section 22 (d) permitted the sale of an investment
company's redeemable securities to be made to "any person" on the
basis of a scale of reducing prices dependent upon the quantity of
shares purchased at a single time. Thereafter, the term "any person" was construed to include a trustee or other fiduciary, or a custodian or agent purchasing for more than one account. It was
particularly noted that the prohibitions of the statute apply only
to an investment company, its underwriters, and dealers in its shares,
and not to individuals who might form a group, such as members
of a medical society or college faculty, to purchase through an agent
in a quantity sufficient to entitle them to a discount.
A review of industry practices and complaints, showed a growing
tendency on the part of investment companies, underwriters and
dealers to organize, promote or solicit the formation of such groups.
Such activity raises a serious question as to whether these persons
were not in fact creating a favored "class" of individuals to effect
sales at a price less than that generally available to other members
of the public purchasing a like number of shares, contrary to the
purpose and intent of section 22 (d).
"Im"estment

25

ill addition, such sales made to the group's agent or 'representative,
as opposed to a fiduciary with investment discretion, 'involve the
danger that prospectuses will not be furnished to all members of
the group, contrary to the requirements of the Investment Company
Act of 1940 and the Securities Act of 1933.
The proposed rule would ,limit the granting of a quantity discount
to (i) a single individual purchasing shares with his own funds for
himself or as a gift to others, or (ii) a trustee or other fiduciary
purchasing for a single trust estate, although there may be more
than one beneficiary.
Another change in current practices which the proposed rule would
require relates to the use of so-called "letters of intent" pursuant
to which a purchaser is entitled to 'receive the discount applicable
to the total quantity of shares purchased within a stated period,
usually 13 months. The proposed rule does not sanction this method
of pricing, and the Commission stated that it was tentatively of the
opinion that the mere intent to purchase shares in the future would
not be a sufficient basis for computing a quantity discount.
The proposed rule also does not include any provision permitting
sales at reduced sales loads to officersand employees of an investment
company, its principal underwriter, and its investment adviser. The
Commission in the past has issued orders exempting such sales where
made for investment purposes, on the ground that they promoted
employee incentive and good will. The Commission's release announcing the proposed rule stated that upon reconsideration of this
matter it was tentatively of the opinion that the business purposes
to be served by reduced sales loads to such persons are insufficient to
warrant continuation of this practice in the light of the policy and
intent of section 22 (d).
Over forty-five comments were received in response to the Commission's notice. Most of the comments favored adoption of the
rule, although there was strenuous objection to its failure to sanction
use of letters of intent and a number of suggestions were made for
changes in language. Some comments also contended that the Commission should continue to sanction sales to employees of investment
companies at a reduced sales load.
The Commission heard oral argument on the proposed rule on
July 23, 1958, and took the matter under advisement."
:rr Upon reconsideration, the Commission determined to include provisions in the rule
permitting sales at a reduced sales load pursuant to letters of intention and to officers
and employees of an Investment company, Its underwriter and Investment adViser subject
to appropriate safeguards. The Commission adopted RUle 22D-1 on December 2, 1958.

Amendments to Form N-8B-I

Form N-8B-1 is prescribed for registration statements filed under
the Act by all management investment companies except those which
issue periodic payment plan certificates. This form was amend~d
during the fiscal year to require the furnishing of a table which In
effect shows on a per-share basis a ten-year comparative summary of
earnings and capital changes together with certain ratios." It is the
purpose of the new requirement to provide for investors a more
informative presentation of the operations of the registrant than
was provided by the table required previously.
OTHER MA1TERS
Amendments to Statement of Policy Relating to Investment Company Sales
Literature

The Commission, during the 1958 fiscal year, adopted certain
amendments to its Statement of Policy relating to sales literature
used by investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.29 The Statement of Policy is designed to serve
as a guide for issuers, underwriters and dealers in the preparation of
such sales literature so as to avoid violation of the anti-fraud provisions of section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933. It was adopted in
1950 and was amended in 1955. The amendments adopted during
the past fiscal year were published in preliminary form and a public
hearing was held thereon. The amended Statement of Policy permits a more liberal use of charts and tables, provided they meet
certain standards of disclosure and arrangement.
Proposed Amendment of Rules Regarding Incorporation by Reference

The rules of the Commission permit filings with the Commission
to incorporate by reference rather freely papers and documents previously filed with the Commission under the same statute or under
different statutes administered by the Commission. This practice,
however, has interfered with the Commission's disposal of out-ofdate records since many filings made in recent years incorporate by
reference papers and documents filed in earlier years. As a necessary
step to conforming the Commission's Records Program to the overall
Federal Records Legislation, the Commission, during the 1958 fiscal
year, published for comment certain proposed amendments to its
rules regarding incorporation by reference." The effect of the proposed amendments would be to limit incorporation by reference to
documents which have been in the Commission's files not more than

10 years, and to require reference to specific prior filings. This time
limit would remove one of the conditions which now prevent the :final
disposition of many original records, and the specific filing reference
would substantially reduce the research now necessary to assemble
previously filed documents for consideration in connection with current filings. A number of letters of comment were received in regard
to the proposed amendments which pointed out certain practical difficulties which such amendments might create. At the end of the
fiscal year, the staff was preparing for the Commission's consideration
a revised proposal which would accomplish the objective desired and
would also obviate the mechanical problems indicated in the comments.

PART IV
ADl\DNISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Securities Act of 1933 is designed to provide disclosure to
investors of material facts concerning securities publicly offered for
sale by use of the mails or instrumentalities in interstate commerce,
and to prevent misrepresentation, deceit, or other fraudulent practices in the sale of securities. Disclosure is obtained by requiring
the issuer of such securities to file with the Commission a registration
statement and related prospectus containing significant information
about the issuer and the offering. These documents are available for
public inspection as soon as they are filed. The registration statement must become "effective" before the securities may be sold to the
public. In addition the prospectus must be furnished to the purchaser at or before the sale or delivery of the security. The registrant and the underwriter are responsible for the contents of the
registration statement. The Commission has no authority to control
the nature or quality of a security to be offered for public sale or to
pass upon its merits or the terms of its distribution. Its action in
permitting a registration statement to become effective does not constitute approval of the securities, and any representation to a prospective purchaser of securities to the contrary is made unlawful by Section
23 of the Act.
DESCRIPTION

OF THE REGISTRATION

PROCESS

Registration Statement and Prospectus

Registration of any security proposed to be publicly offered may
be effected by filing with the Commission a registration statement on
the applicable form containing prescribed disclosures. When a registration statement relates, generally speaking, to a security issued,
by a corporation or other private issuer, it must contain the information, and be accompanied by the documents, specified in Schedule A
of the Act; when it relates to a security issued by a foreign government, the material specified in Schedule B must be supplied. Both
schedules specify in considerable detail the disclosure which should
be made available to an investor in order that he may make an informed decision whether to buy the security. In addition, the Act
provides flexibility in its administration by empowering the Commission to classify issues, issuers and prospectuses, to prescribe ap28

TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

29

propriate forms, and to increase or in certain instances vary or
diminish the particular items of information required to be disclosed
in the registration statement as the Commission deems appropriate
in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
In general the registration statement of an issuer other than a
foreign government must describe such matters as the names of persons who participate in the direction, management, or control of the
issuer's business; their security holdings and remuneration and options
or bonus and profit-sharing privileges alloted to them; the character
and size of the business enterprise, its capital structure, past history
and earnings, and its financial statements, certified by independent
accountants; underwriters' commissions; payments to promoters made
within two years or intended to be made; acquisitions of property not
in the ordinary course of business, and the interest of directors, officers,
and principal stockholders therein; pending or threatened legal proceedings; and the purpose to which the proceeds of the offering are to
be applied. The prospectus constitutes a part of the registration
statement and presents the more important of the required disclosures.
Examination Procedure

The staff of the Division of Corporation Finance examines each
registration statement for compliance with the standards of accurate
and full disclosure and usually notifies the registrant by an informal
letter of comment of any material respects in which the statement
appears to fail to conform to those requirements. The registrant is
thus afforded an opportunity to file a curative amendment. In addition, the Commission has power, after notice and opportunity for
hearing, to issue an order suspending the effectivenessof a registration
statement. In certain cases, such as where a registration statement is
so deficient as to indicate a willful failure to make adequate disclosure,
no letter of comment is sent and the Commission either institutes an
investigation to determine whether stop-order proceedings should be
instituted or immediately institutes stop-order proceedings. Information about the use of this "stop-order" power during 1958 appears
below under "Stop Order Proceedings."
Time Required to Complete Registration

Because prompt examination of a registration statement is important to industry, the Commission completes its analysis in the
shortest possible time. Congress provided for 20 days in the ordinary
case between the filing date of a registration statement or of an amendment thereto and the time it may become effective. This waiting
period is designed to provide investors with an opportunity to become
familiar with the proposed offering. Information disclosed in the

30

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

registration statement is disseminated during the waiting P?ri?d ~y
means of the preliminary form of prospectus. The COmmISSIOnIS
empowered to accelerate the effective date so as to shorten the 20-day
waiting period where the facts justify such action. In exercising
this power, the Commission is required to take into account the adequacy of the information respecting the issuer theretofore available
to the public, the facility with which investors can understand the
nature of and the rights conferred by the securities to be registered,
and their relationship to the capital structure of the issuer, and the
public interest and the protection of investors. The note to Rule
460 under the Act indicates, for the information of interested persons, some of the more common situations in which the Commission
feels that the statute generally requires it to deny acceleration of the
effective date of a registration statement.
The median time which elapsed between the date of filing and the
effective date with respect to 685 1 registration statements that became effective during the 1958 fiscal year was 24 days, compared with
23 days for the 1957 and 1956 fiscal years. This time was divided
among the three principal stages of the registration process, approximately as follows:
(a) From the date of filing the registration statement to the date
of the letter of comment, 14 days;
(b) From the date of the letter of comment to the date of filing
the first material amendment, 6 days; and
(c) From the date of filing the first amendment to the date of
filing the final amendment and effective date of registration, 4 days.
All of these periods include Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.
This increased average lapsed time is a matter of concern to the
Commission. It is being carefully watched, and all appropriate steps
are being taken to reduce the time lapse as much as possible, including
steps to cure personnel shortages.
VOLUME OF SECURITIES REGISTERED
Securities effectively registered under the Securities Act during fiscal 1958totalled $16.5billion, the highest volume for any fiscal year in
the 24-year history of the Commission. Registrations have more than
doubled since 1953, when $7.5 billion of securities were registered,
reflecting annual increases of at least $1.5 billion. The chart below
shows the dollar amount of effective registrations from 1935 to 1958.
1 Does not include 130 registration
statements of investment companies filed and elfective as post-elfective amendments to previously elfective registration statements pursuant
to section 24 (a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The median elapsed time
for these 130 registration statements was 23 calendar days.

The most important category of registrations, issues to be sold for
cash for account of the issuer, amounted to $13.3 billion in 1958, an
increase of about 10 percent over the previous year. Most of the
difference was due to the large volume of debt securities, $6.9 billion
as compared with $5.7 billion in 1957. There was little change in
the amount of either common or preferred stock registered. Of the

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

32

1958 volume, 52 percent was made up of debt securities, 45 percent
common stock and 3 percent preferred stock. Close to half of the
total for common stock represented securities of investment companies.
The number of statements, total amounts registered, and a classification by type of security for issues to be sold for cash for account of
the issuing company in each of the fiscal years 1935 through 1958 are

TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

Of the 913 registration statements filed in 1958, 254, or 28 percent,
were filed by companies that had not previously filed any registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, compared with 305, or 32
percent, of the corresponding total during the 1957fiscal year und 415,
or 42 percent, for the 1956 fiscal year.
The growth in the volume of proposed financing under the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 is shown by the following tabulation, which reflects a 4-year increase in 1958 of 88 percent over 1954in the aggregate dollar amount of offerings as stated in

RESULTS OBTAINED BY THE REGISTRATION PROCESS
As the result of the staff's examination of registration statements,
numerous significant changes were effected in the disclosures made
to the investing public. Among these results were changes in accounting presentation, as illustrated by the following examples:
Stock Issued in Exchange for Partnership Assets.-Several partners organized a corporation to which they transferred certain
partnership assets in exchange for some 1,900,000 shares of $1 par
value common stock of the new company. The number of shares
issued was based principally on appraised values assigned to the assets
transferred.
A registration statement was filed by the new corporation in which
its assets were stated at such appraised values. In view of the absence of an arm's length relationship between the partners and the
corporation the registrant was requested to amend its financial statements so that the assets would be stated on the basis of the cost to
the partners.
As a result of this request the assets were restated and the equity
section of the balance sheet showed as a deduction from the aggregate
par value of shares outstanding about $1,400,000representing the excess of par value of shares issued and other consideration over incorporators' cost of assets acquired at or since incorporation. This
change reduced the total assets of the corporation from $2,700,000to
$1,300,000.
Subsequently the company was recapitalized, with the 1,900,000
shares of $1 par value common stock being converted into 425,000
shares of $1 par value Class A stock, a reduction in capital more than
sufficient to eliminate the excess item from the equity section of the
balance sheet.

TWENTY-FOURTH

ANNUAL REPORT

35

Pooling of Interests vs, Purchase Accounting.-The
principle of
"pooling of interests" accounting permits the combining of the earned
surplus accounts of companies involved in a merger or combination
and avoids the recording of goodwill or an upward revaluation of
other assets as would be required in many purchase or acquisition
transactions under "acquisition" accounting.
In a recent registration statement in which an exchange offer was
described, acquisition accounting was proposed for the combination
of two companies, of which the proposed parent company was onefifth the size of the company being acquired. The smaller company,
which had some 400,000 shares of stock outstanding, was to issue
1,600,000 shares of its $.25 par value common stock for the entire
outstanding stock of the larger company, assigning to its own shares
a value of $2 per share. The prospectus also carried a public offering
of 250,000 shares at a price to net the company $2.10 per share.
As originally proposed in the registration statement, $2,600,000 of
the excess of the ascribed. value of the new shares was to be assigned
to certain undeveloped real estate owned by the larger company.
After reviewing the terms of the proposed combination, our staff objected to the use of acquisition accounting and the resulting substantial write-up in the value of the land. Certain unusual features of the
plan prompted this position. The registrant's previously outstanding common shares were redesignated as Class A convertible stock
which was convertible into debentures until a specified date, after
which it automatically became common stock. Both Class A stock
and the debentures had voting rights for the election of five directors,
and the new common stock to be issued under the plan of exchange was
limited to the right to elect five directors, making a total of ten directors. Two members of the new group in the organization were to
become president and secretary of the parent company.
After discussions, an amended registration statement was filed in
which the pooling of interests concept was applied to the combination
and the investment in the subsidiary was recorded on the books of the
parent at the underlying book value based on cost, and hence no revaluation of the real estate emerged.
STOP ORDER PROCEEDINGS
Section 8 (d) provides that, if it appears to the Commission at any
time that a registration statement contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
the Commission may institute proceedings looking to the issuance of
a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement.
Where such an order is issued, the offering cannot lawfully be made,

or continued if it has already begun, un~il the registration .st~tement
has been amended to cure the deficiencIes and the COmmISSIOnhas
lifted the stop order. During the 1958fiscal year, 8 new proceedings
were authorized by the Commission under section 8 (d) of the Act
and 7 such proceedings were continued from the preceding year. Two
of such cases were thereafter consolidated. In connection with these
14 proceedings 5 stop orders were issued during the year, one of which
was subsequently vacated when the registration statement was appropriately amended. In 2 other cases the registration statement was
withdrawn. The remaining 7 cases were pending as of June 30, 1958.
A proceeding in which a stop order was issued with respect to a
registration statement filed by Republic Cement Corporation was described in the 23rd Annual Report." The other 4 proceedings which
resulted in the issuance of stop orders during the fiscal year are described below as well as 1 proceeding in which a stop order was issued shortly after the end of the fiscal year.
Horton Aircraft Corporation.- This registrant, a Nevada corporation, was organized for the purpose of manufacturing and selling a so-called Horton Wingless Airplane. The company filed two
registration statements with the Commission. The first statement,
filed in 1955, covered a proposed offering of 500,000 shares of no par
value common stock of which 400,000 shares were to be offered by the
registrant and 100,000 shares by the president, William E. Horton,
at $1.00 per share or the market price, whichever was higher. The
other registration statement, filed in 1956, covered 100,000 shares of
common stock of the registrant held by Horton which was to be offered
at $25.00per share. A consolidated hearing was held as to both registration statements and the Commission issued a stop order suspending the effectiveness of both statements.
The Commission :found the registration statements false and misleading in the following material respects, among others,"
The representation in the registration statements that Horton had
assigned to the registrant a patent with respect to the wingless airplane was materially misleading in view of the :fact that Horton had
previously assigned all of his right, title and interest in his "invention"
to another person. The description in the registration statements of
the Horton Wingless Airplane, the aeronautical principles involved,
and the coverage of the patent obtained by Horton, was also materially false and misleading. False and misleading statements were
also made with respect to the performance of Horton's model of the
wingless plane. The registration statements also contained false and
misleading statements with respect to the use of the proceeds from the

previous sale of unregistered securities, the price of the securities
being registered and the proposed use of the proceeds therefrom.
In addition, the Commission found that while the second registration statement disclosed the entry of an injunction against registrant
and Horton based on false and misleading claims and the return of
an indictment against Horton based on fraud, registrant nevertheless
omitted to disclose the nature of the false and misleading statements
and the fraud involved.
Columbia General Investment Corporation.- The registrant, a
Texas corporation organized for the purpose of engaging in the investment business, filed a registration statement covering 100,000
shares of its common stock, $1 par value, to be offered to its stockholders at $4.50 per share. The Commission, finding that the registration statement contained materially misleading statements, denied
a request for withdrawal of such statement and issued a stop order.
The registration statement stated, among other things, that 42,000
shares of the common stock of Columbia General Life Insurance
Company, acquired from the promoters of the insurance company
and registrant in exchange for 210,000shares of registrant's common
stock, and representing a substantial portion of registrant's assets,
had an "estimated fair value" of $420,000. The $420,000value was
stated to be based on the fact that at and prior to such acquisition,
shares of such stock had been sold at prices of $10 and more by the
insurance company in the course of a public offering and by one of
the promoters through a company established for the purpose of
maintaining and stabilizing the market in that stock. However, the
Commission held that the prices paid in such sales could not be considered a true reflection of the market or fair value of the stock at
such time in view of the materially misleading statements employed
in connection with the sales. The Commission found that the failure
to disclose the facts surrounding the insurance company offering
rendered the statements regarding the value of the 42,000 shares
misleading.
The Commission further found that registrant had sold 53,059of
its own shares to stockholders of the insurance company at $9 per
share, and 10,07'7shares to the general public at $12per share, without
disclosing that such prices had been arbitrarily determined, that there
had been recent sales of such stock at $2 per share to insiders and
others, and that registrant's capital and surplus figures included the
misleading $420,000valuation attributed to the 42,000 shares of insurance company stock. As a result of such sales, the Commission
ruled, a contingent liability to the purchasers was created which
should have been disclosed in the registration statement .•

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Lewisohn Copper Corporation.-This
registrant, a Delaware corporation, was organized for the purpose of exp!oring, devel?ping a~d
operating mining properties in Arizona. PrIOr to ~he £?mg of Its
registration statement, the company had, commencmg m October
1955,sold 200,000 shares of its common stock at a..
stated public offering
price of $1.50 a share under claim of exemption from registration
under Regulation A. The registration statement, filed in March
1956, covered a proposed offering of 100,000 shares at a price to be
determined prior to the effective date of the registration statement
and which had tentatively been estimated at at least $10 a share. Stop
order proceedings, instituted in August 1956, with respect to the
registration statement were consolidated with proceedings under
Regulation A, instituted in June 1956, with respect to suspension of
the exemption thereunder of the earlier 200,000share offering.
More than half of the 200,000 share offering was sold to a few
broker-dealer firms, including one firm closely connected with the
underwriter, for their own accounts, or for the accounts of members
or their families, at the stated offering price of $1.50 a share. Such
firms and persons in turn resold a large part of the stock, mostly at
prices in excess of $1.50 and ranging as high as $9.50 or more. The
Commission found the offering circular used in connection with the
offering false in stating that the public offering price was $1.50 a
share and deficient in failing to disclose that profits would be received
by the various firms and individuals, upon the resale of the stock
by them at higher prices. The Commission found that such resales
constituted part of the public distribution of the stock. Since most
of the resales were at prices in excess of $1.50, the aggregate offering
price to the public exceeded the $300,000 maximum prescribed by
section 3 (b) of the Act and Regulation A and accordingly '110 exemption under the regulation was available. On this and other
grounds, including misleading publicity circulated by the issuer and
underwriter in connection with the offering, the Commission permanently suspended the exemption of the offering under Regulation A.
With respect to the registration statement, the Commission issued
a stop order, finding the prospectus deficient in failing to disclose the
facts as to the 200,000 share offering referred to above and the contingent liability resulting from the sale of the 200,000 shares when
no exemption from registration was available. The Commission
further found the prospectus misleading in failing to disclose the
activities of the issuer, the underwriter and others having a tendency
to influence the market price of the company's stock. These activities included market activities by the underwriter and others and
publicity circulated by the company and the underwriter, which

gave the misleading impression that there had been an immediate
public demand for and acceptance of the stock and which contained
optimistic and misleading statements about the company's drilling
program, results of assays, possible tonnages of ore on its properties
and am. application for a certificate of tax necessity on a large concentrating mill, and did not disclose that the existence of a mineable
ore body had not been established. Additional deficiencies found
in the prospectus included the failure to disclose the underwriter's
profit in the resale of 33,000 shares of the issuer's stock purportedly
purchased by the underwriter for investment and the contingent
liability of the issuer for the sale of these shares without registration.
In view of the serious nature of the deficiencies in the registration
statement the Commission denied the registrant's request to be allowed
to withdraw it. The Commission indicated that the fact that the
company had a substantial amount of stock outstanding in the hands
of investors distinguished the situation presented ill this case from
that involved in Jones v. S. E. 0., 298 U. S. 1 (1936) where
withdrawal was required,"
The Fall River Exploration and Mining Company.-The
registrant, a Colorado corporation, then named The Fall River Power
Company, filed a registration statement covering a proposed public
offering of 500,000 shares of its no par value common stock at $2.00
per share. After hearings illstituted pursuant to section 8 (d) of
the Act, the Commission ordered suspension of the effectiveness of
the registration statement. The company consented to the entry of
the stop order. 6
Among the deficiencies constituting the grounds for the issuance
of the Commission's stop order were: (1) representations that the
registrant's business was in part that of a public utility, notwithstanding the fact that there was no demand for power from the longidle hydro-electric plant owned by the registrant, (2) the use of an
appraisal of the hydro-electric plant, based on estimated replacement
cost, where the appraisal was not prepared in accordance with accepted
standards and failed, among other things, to consider the lack of demand for power, (3) the use of an appraisal of water rights not
founded on a basis sufficient to sustain it, (4) the representation that
a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the stock would be applied
toward the purchase of milling facilities, without disclosing that there
were no known ore bodies and no present need for milling facilities,
and (5) the inclusion in the financial statements of an appraisal, at
present day cost, of tunnels represented as development work on min• Securities Act Release No. 8907 (March 18, 1958). A petition for review of the Commission's order has been filed In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

ing claims, which were constructed by prede~essors of the registr~nt
in large part to transport ore from mines which were no longer bemg
worked.
Shortly after the close of the fiscal yeWl'under review the registration statement was amended. In ,its amended form, the statement
disclosed that the registrant's name, which in its original form suggested the company was an operating 'Publicutility, had been changed
to indicate that the business was exploration and mining. Since the
amended statement had been revised to meet the various objections
previously cited, the Commission vacated the stop order, and the
registration statement was ordered effective."
Woodland Oil & Gas Co., Inc.-The registrant, a Delaware corporation, filed a registration statement covering a proposed public
offering of 700,000shares of its common stock at $1.50 per share, of
which 600,000shares were to be offered on behalf of the registrant
and 100,000shares were to be offered on behalf of the principal promoter and general manager of the registrant. The company was
organized for the purpose of exploring, developing and operating oil
and gas properties. Its assets consisted of interests in certain partially
developed Pennsylvania properties, and an interest in some wildcat
acreage in Western Kentucky. The proceeds of the issue were
intended for drilling and testing on both properties.
After examination of the registration statement and hearings, pursuant to section 8 (d) of the Securities Act, the Commission found
that the registrant had failed to make adequate disclosures with
respect to (1) its poor production record which had resulted in sustained operating losses, (2,) its recoverable reserves and the extent to
which they could be produced profitably, (3) the remote possibilities
of investors realizing income from or a return of their investment,
(4) unsuccessful drilling tests on the Kentucky property, and
(5) certain underwriting agreements. The Commission found that
misleading statements were contained in (1) the statements regarding
use of the proceeds, (2) references to large quantities of oil in the
Western Kentucky general area, and (3) the geologist's report. The
Commission found that in order to make the speculative features of
the enterprise "plainly evident" to the ordinary investor, they had to
be set forth in summary fashion in one place in the early part of the
prospectus under an appropriate heading.
A stop order was issued by the Commission shortly after the close
of the fiscal year under review,"

EXAMINATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS
The Commission is authorized by section 8 (e) of the Act to make
an examination in order to determine whether a stop order proceeding
should be instituted under section 8 (d). For this purpose the Commission is empowered to subpena witnesses and require the production of pertinent documents. Four such examinations were initiated
during the 1958 fiscal year and one examination was pending from
the previous fiscal year. In two cases the examination led to proceedings under section 8 (d) of the Act, in two others the registration
statements were withdrawn and in the fifth the registration statement
was amended and the examination closed. No examinations under
section 8 (e) of the Act were pending at the end of the fiscal year.
The Commission is also authorized by section 20 (a) of the Act to
make an investigation to determine whether any provisions of the Act
or any rule or regulation prescribed thereunder have been or are about
to be violated. The Commission has instituted investigations under
this section as an expeditious means of determining whether a registration statement is false or misleading or omits to state any material
fact. During the 1958 fiscal year 16 such investigations were instituted. Eight such investigations were pending from the previous
fiscal year. Five investigations resulted in the institution of stop order
proceedings under section 8 (d) of the Act, five were closed, in one
the registration statement was withdrawn and in the remaining case a
permanent suspension order was entered under Regulation A. Twelve
investigations were pending at the end of the 1958fiscal year.
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION OF SMALL ISSUES
Under section 3 (b) of the Securities Act, the Commission is empowered to exempt, by its rules and regulations and subject to such
terms and conditions as it may prescribe therein, any class of securities from registration under the Act, if it finds that the enforcement
of the registration provisions of the Act with respect to such securities
is not necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors by reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of the public offering. The statute imposes a maximum
limitation of $300,000 upon the size of the issues which may be
exempted by the Commission in the exercise of this power.
Acting under this authority the Commission has adopted the following exemptive regulations:
Regulation A:
General exemption for United States and Canadian issues up to
$300,000.
Regulation A-M:
Special exemption for assessable shares of stock of mining companies
up to $100,000.

42

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Regulation A-R:
Special exemption for first lien notes up to $100,000.
Regulation B:
Exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights up
to $100,000.
Regulation B-T:
Exemption for interests in oil royalty trusts or similar types of trusts
or unincorporated association up to $100,000.

Exemption from registration under section 3 (b) of the Act does
not carry exemption from the civil liabilities for false and misleading
statements imposed upon any person by section 12 (2) or from the
criminal liabilities for fraud imposed upon any person by section
17 of the Act.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A

The Commission's Regulation A permits a company to obtain not
exceeding $300,000 (including underwriting commissions) of needed
capital in anyone year from a public offering of its securities without
registration if the company complies with the regulation. Regulation A requires the filing of a notification with the appropriate
Regional Office of the Commission, supplying basic information about the company, certain exhibits, and except in the case of a
company with an earnings history which is making an offering not
in excess of $50,000, an offering circular which is required to be used
in offering the securities.
During the 1958 fiscal year, 732 notifications were filed under Regulation A, covering proposed offerings of $133,889,109, compared with
919 notifications covering proposed offerings of $167,269,900 in the
1957 fiscal year. Included in the 1958 total were 71 notifications
covering stock offerings of $14,433,379with respect to companies engaged in the exploratory oil and gas business and 69 notifications
covering offerings of $14,257,615by mining companies.

Most of the offerings which were underwritten were undertaken by
commercial underwriters, who participated in 185 offerings in 1958,
252 in 1957, and 528 in 1956. The remaining cases where commissions were paid were handled by officers,directors, or other persons not
regularly engaged in the securities business.
Suspension of Exemption

Regulation A provides for the suspension of an exemption thereunder where, in general, the exemption is sought for securities for
which the regulation provides no exemption or where the offering is
not made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the regulation or in accordance with prescribed disclosure standards. Following
the issuance of a temporary suspension order by the Commission, the
respondents may request a hearing to determine whether the temporary suspension should be vacated or made permanent. In the case
of filings made under Regulation A as revised in July 1956, if no
hearing is requested within thirty days after the entry of the temporary suspension order, and none is ordered by the Commission on
its own motion, the temporary suspension order becomes permanent.
During the 1958 fiscal year, temporary suspension orders were issued in 88 cases as compared with 132 in the 1957 fiscal year. Of the
88 orders, 3 were later vacated. Requests for hearing were made in
18 cases and in 7 of such cases the requests were later withdrawn; proceedings in the remaining 11 cases are pending. The names of the
companies involved in the orders issued during the 1958 fiscal year
are set forth in table (6) of the appendix. A few cases are summarized below to illustrate the misrepresentations and other noncompliance with the regulation which led to the issuance of suspension
orders.
Washington Planning Corporation of Maryland.- In its order
temporarily suspending the Regulation A exemption, the Commission
alleged that the offering circular contained untrue statements of material facts and failed to disclose required information concerning the
net loss sustained from the issuer's business operations. There was
also a failure to disclose that the offering of securities was being made
on an installment payment basis, that commissions were paid for the
sale of the securities despite statements in the offering circular to the
contrary, and that part of the proceeds from the offering were used
to pay expenses and make advances to companies other than the issuer. The Commission's order further alleged that the use of the
offering circular without appropriate disclosure had been and would
be in violation of section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933. In addition, the terms and conditions of Regulation A were not complied
with in that the issuer failed to file a complete and accurate report

44

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of the sales of its securities. No hearing was requested and the suspension order became permanent.
Seaboard Drug Company, Inc.-The
Commission temporarily
suspended the exemption because the terms and conditions of Regulation A were not complied with since the aggregate offering price of
shares sold by stockholders in the market and shares sold on behalf of
the issuer exceeded the $300,000 ceiling. The Commission also stated
that the offering circular operated as a fraud and deceit upon the purchasers and contained untrue statements of material facts and omitted
to state certain material facts with respect to the issuer's assumption
of expenses of certain affiliates and predecessor companies, and the
utilization of proceeds of the offering for a personal loan to an officer,
director and principal security holder of the issuer. No hearing has
been requested and the suspension order remains in effect.
Tejanos Mining Corporation.-In
its order temporarily suspending the exemption, the Commission alleged that the notification failed
to disclose the issuance of certain shares within one year prior to the
subject filing, and failed to disclose the identity of the underwriter.
The Commission further alleged that the Regulation A exemption was
not available since the president of the issuer had been indicted for
selling unlicensed securities and selling securities without registering
as a dealer in the State of Texas. The order also alleged that misleading statements were made concerning the use of proceeds and the
interests of the officers, directors and promoters in the issuer. No
hearing was requested and the suspension order became permanent.
Microveer, Incorporated.-The
Commission's temporary suspension order alleged that the offering circular was misleading and contained untrue statements of material facts with respect to statements
made concerning the physical properties of the issuer's product, a thin
wood veneer, the existence of potential purchasers of the company's
product and the amount of funds needed to equip the issuer's plant
adequately with machinery. No hearing was requested and the suspension order became permanent.
Central Oils, Incorporated.- The Commission suspended the
Regulation A exemption for an offering of the above company because
of misleading, inaccurate and incomplete statements in the offering
circular concerning, among other matters, the interests of the directors and promoters in the company's properties, the past and prospective productivity of the company's oil properties, and the misleading nature of the geological materials. A request for hearing was
filed and later withdrawn, and the suspension became permanent.
Gem State Securities Corporation.- In its order temporarily suspending the Regulation A exemption, the Commission alleged that
the Regulation A exemption was unavailable because securities were

TWENTY-FOURTH

45

ANNUAL REPORT

sold prior to the time permitted by the regulation, at a different price
from that stated in the offering circular, and without delivery of an
offering circular. No hearing was requested and the suspension order
became permanent.
Garner Aluminum Corporation.-The
Commission temporarily
suspended the Regulation A exemption because it had reasonable
cause to believe that oral misrepresentations were made in the sale
of securities under the offering which operated as a fraud and deceit
upon the purchasers, particularly with respect to statements made
concerning the refunding of investors' money, the amount of securities already sold, and the use of proceeds received therefrom. No hearing has been requested and the suspension order remains in effect.
The Commission is given discretionary authority in rule 252 (f)
of Regulation A to determine upon a showing of good cause that certain disabilities, arising in general from past conduct of the issuer,
underwriter or others associated with them in the purchase or sale
of securities, and which ordinarily have the effect of making the Reg.
ulation A exemption unavailable, shall not operate to bar an exemption under the regulation. During the 1958 fiscal year, 14 applications for relief from various disabilities were granted under rule 252
(f) by the Commission.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B

During the fiscal year ended June 30,1958,109 offering sheets were
filed pursuant to Regulation B and were examined by the Oil and Gas
Unit of the Commission's Division of Corporation Finance. During
the 195'7fiscal year, 133 offering sheets were filed and during the 1956
fiscal year, 114 were filed. The following table indicates the nature
and number of Commission orders issued in connection with such

UTIGATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Commission is authorized by the Securities Act to seek injunctions in cases where the continued or threatened violations of
the Act may result in damage to members of the public. Many such
actions were brought by the Commission during the year in cases
involving violations of the registration and anti-fraud provisions of
the Act.
Litigation Involving Violations of Registration and Anti.fraud Provisions

The Commission obtained injunctions against :further violations of the registration provisions in actions in which it was found
that the defendants were selling fractional interests in oil leases or
in oil and gas properties without registration.
Permanent injunctions were obtained in S. E. O. v, Gerald L. Reasor and John O. Karstrom, Jr.,9 S. E. O. v. Horace E. Watkins, doing business as Watkins

S. E. O. v. Edward J. Prestonr? In S. E. O. v, Ben Franklin Oil and
Gas Corporation; et al.,14 a preliminary injunction was obtained prohibiting the sale of shares of Ben Franklin Oil and Gas Corporation
without registration.
Sales of unregistered securities in mining companies also required
Commission action within the year.
In S. E. O. v, Tannen and 00.,

to prevent further sales of unregistered stock. Similar injunctions
were obtained in S. E. O. v, Cataract Mining Oorporatioti. et al.,10

In S. E. O. v. Backers Discount and Finance Oompany and James
Sorce, Jr.29 the defendant, who was in the business of purchasing
installment notes received by contractors, offered to investors participating certificates in these installment notes guaranteeing 12%
net return on the investment and purportedly assigning a mortgage
to the investor. The amount invested had in fact no relation to
the face amount of the mortgage assigned, and if the mortgagor
defaulted, another mortgage was substituted. In some instances
no mortgage was assigned to the investor but rather a participation
in general portfolio holdings of Backers. These "guarantee saving certificates" were found not to be guaranteed by any outside
independent guarantor, but merely secured by Backers. Notwithstanding assurances by Backers that it would discontinue interstate
sales until such time as it had complied with the registration requirements of the Act, over $10,000 of the certificates were sold to
residents of 6 states. A final injunction was entered by the Court
to enjoin further sales of these securities.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In S. E. O. v. Micro-Moisture Oontrols, et al.30 16 defendants, including 7 registered broker-dealer firms, were permanently enjoined
from further violations of the registration requirements of the Act
in the offer and sale of common stock of Micro-Moisture Controls,
Inc. This action, which was also referred to in the 23rd Annual Report," involved an increased number of outstanding shares resulting
from an exchange of assets of Converters Acceptance Corporation of
Canada for stock of Micro-Moisture. A subsequent public distribution by certain controlling stockholders of Micro-Moisture was made
through the defendant broker-dealer firms and 2 residents of Canada,
also named as defendants.
In S. E. O. v. Land Development Oompany of Nevada, et al.,32the
complaint charged, among other things, that the defendants had been
offering and selling the capital stock of Land Development Company
of Nevada and certain evidences of indebtedness, investment contracts
and profit sharing agreements when no registration statement was
in effect as to such securities. The defendants consented to the entry
of a preliminary injunction.
Violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act were
also charged in S. E. O. v. Roy B. Kelly, et al.,33 S. E. O. v, TrlUJkee
Showboat, fnc.,34 and S. E. O. v. Doctors' Motels, Inc.35 In the Kelly
case the complaint was dismissed by agreement of the parties, subject
to a stipulation effectively preventing sale of the stock without registration. In the Truckee Showboat case the application for a preliminary injunction was denied, the court indicating that it was convinced
that the defendant was not threatening to violate the law and that an
injunction was therefore unnecessary. In the Doctor'S' Motels case the
complaint. was dismissed by stipulation of the parties subsequent to
the filing of a registration statement.
A final injunction was obtained by consent in S. E. O. v. Edward L.
Elliott, et al.36 to prevent distribution of unregistered securities of
Crowell-Collier Publishing Company. The related administrative
proceedings are discussed in this report under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.37

misleading statements were used in such sales, brought about the entry

of a final injunction in S. E. O. v. Triwmph Mines, Ltd., et aZ.aa and
resulted in a preliminary injunction in S. E. O. v. Alan Russell Securities, Incorporated, et al.39 Preliminary injunctions to prevent further
violations of Section 5 and 17 of the Securities Act were also entered
in S. E. O. v. Franklin Atlas Oorp., et al.,40 and S. E. O. v. American
Founders Life Insurance Oompany of Denver, Colorado, et al.41 In
the latter case an injunction was entered against the corporate defendants, American Founders Life Insurance Company of Denver,
Colorado and Colorado Management Corporation.
Among other
statements found to be misleading by the Court were the omission to
disclose the intercorporate relationships existing between the corporate defendants; for example, that Colorado Management Corporation
entered into a management contract with American Founders for a
consideration equal to at least 5 % of the gross income of the insurance
company for a 10-year period.
A permanent injunction was entered against Judson I. Taggart in
S. E. O. v. Ada:ms Bond and Share, Inc. and Judson I. Taggart.42
The complaint alleged that Taggart as vice president of defendant
company had, in the sale of stock in that company, made false and misleading statements by, among other things, omitting to state to purchasers that another company, whose business his company was purchasing, had been continually operating at substantial losses, amounting to over $46,000 within a specified SIx-month period. In S. E. O.
v, Evergreen Memorial Park Association, et al.,43 the defendants consented to the entry of an injunction restraining further violations of
Section 17 of the Securities Act.
False and misleading statements in violation of Section 17 of the
Securities Act as well as sales in violation of the registration provisions were alleged in the Commission's complaint in S. E. O. v.
Crusader Oil and Uraniwm Oompany, et al.44 In that case, the Commission alleged that in connection with the offer and sale of unregistered common stock of the Wyoming Oil Company (Delaware) the
defendants had represented that the selling price of 20~ to 50~ per
share was a special price offered to a few stockholders, whereas in fact
it was far in excess of the market price, and the offering was not
limited to a few stockholders. A final judgment was entered by consent permanently enjoining Crusader Oil and Uranium Company and

lations of Sections 5 (a) and (c) and 17 (a) of the Act, and Robert W.
Wilson, a broker-dealer, from further violating Section 17 (a) of the
Act.
In S. E. O. v. Southwest Securitiee, Ino., et al.4IJ a permanent injunction was entered enjoining General Insurance Investment Company,
Harvey E. Smith, Margaret Brand Smith, and Bennie L. Dean from
further violations of the registration provisions of the Securities
Act. At the same time the Court entered an order extending until
further order the effectiveness of a temporary restraining order which
had been previously entered against Southwest Securities, Inc., Allen
Goldsmith and Faye Goldsmith, restraining them from further violations of the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities
Act, as well as of the broker-dealer registration requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
S. E. O. v. Robinson Development Oorporation, Skid Oonirot 001'poration, et al.46 also involved violations of Section 5 (a) and (c) and
Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act. The Commission's complaint
alleged, in addition to the fact that the securities being offered and
sold were unregistered, that the defendants employed a scheme to defraud by means of displaying a false and misleading motion picture
and made false and misleading statements regarding, among other
things, the identity of the inventor, the guarantee against competition, acceptance of the skid-control device by trucking and taxicab
companies, profits to result, success of tests and future value of dividends. The court granted a final injunction against the defendants,
Robinson Development Corporation, Louis M. Robinson, Skid-Control Purchasing, Inc., Robinson Skid-Control Associates, Inc. and
Cedar-Vale Development Corporation.
Universal Service Corporation had been the subject of a Commission stop order issued February 5, 1957 following the :filing of a false
and misleading registration statement and prospectus. The stop
order was lifted when Universal filed amendments purportedly correcting the original filings. However, the Commission found it necessary to institute action to enjoin Universal Service Corporation and
its officers from proceeding to sell under the amended :filing. The
Commission's complaint in S. E. O. v. Unive1'salSe1'Vice Oorporation,
et al.47 alleged that the registration statement and prospectus of the
defendant contained untrue statements of material facts and that they
omitted to state facts required to be stated, in violation of the antifraud and registration provisions of the Act. As an example, Universal had asserted ownership of 253 mining claims in the State of
Texas, when in fact the claims had been forfeited to the State of Texas

:for failure to pay rentals. A final injunction was entered against
Universal and its board chairman Bert Thompson, and the temporary
restraining order already in effect was continued against the remaining
defendants.
In S. E. O. v. Mississippi Valley Portland Oement,48the defendant
was permanently enjoined from further violation of Sections 17 and 23
of the Securities Act. One of the allegations of the Commission's
complaint was that the defendant had falsely stated that the fact that
a registration statement had become effective meant that the Commission and its "cement consultant" had determined that cement could be
economically produced from materials owned by the defendant near
Vicksburg, Mississippi.
The defendant was also enjoined in S. E. O. v. James O. Gl'aye,
doing business as J. O. Graye 00.,49 from further violations of Section 17 of the Securities Act. He had been selling stock of Atlas
Gypsum Corporation, Ltd. largely on the strength of an untrue and
misleading statement announcing a proposed merger between Atlas
Gypsum Corporation, Ltd. and Johns-Manville. Another permanent
injunction was obtained at about the same time against the same defendant as a broker-dealer in an earlier action charging violation of
the Commission's net capital rule.50
In S. E. O. v. Los Angeles Trust Deed and Mortgage Exchange,
et al.51 the defendants sold securities described in the complaint as
evidences of indebtedness, investment contracts, and receipts for or
guarantees of such securities arising out of the sale of promissory
notes secured by deeds of trust covering real estate in California. The
complaint alleged violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act as well as violations of the anti-fraud provisions of that
Act and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Charges were made
in the complaint that the advertising and selling literature contained
incomplete, ambiguous, flamboyant, misleading, untrue and deceptive
statements of material facts, such as a statement to the effect that the
plan affords investors an opportunity to buy an income for life without reducing their principal and that the plan constitutes a safe and
secure method of realizing rapid capital appreciation through the
"magic of compound interest", omitting to disclose, among other
things, the speculative nature of investments in second trust notes,
and the differences between trading securities listed and registered
on national securities exchanges and the open-market trading in deeds
of trust conducted by the defendants. After the close of the fiscal
year a temporary injunction was obtained against all but one of the

defendants and a receiver appointed. The Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit subsequently granted a stay pending appeal.
The Commission has been very much concerned in recent years with
the high-pressure tactics of broker-dealer firms which use long distance telephone calls to prospective investors to sell unregistered securities. The salesmen for these securities firms frequently make
claims of a spectacular future for the security they are attempting
to sell.
During the fiscal year, the Commission secured preliminary injunctions in 8. E. O. v. Globe Securitie« Corporation; et al.52 and in 8. E. O.
v. Herbert Rapp, doing business as Webster Securitie« Corporation;
et al.53 These broker-dealer firms were offering and selling unregistered common stock of Taylorcraft, Inc. to United States residents by
means of long distance telephone calls. They made many misleading
and extravagant claims as to the present and future merits of an investment in Taylorcraft, Inc. stock; among them, (1) that Taylorcraft,
Inc. had received a multi-million dollar government contract for
guided missiles research, (2) that Taylorcraft, Inc. had enough government contracts to keep them busy three to five years, (3) that
they anticipated an annual volume for Taylorcraft, Inc. in excess of
$5 million and (4) that Taylorcraft, Inc. stock, at the time selling for
$1 a share would rise to $3, $4, $8 or $15 per share in short periods of
time.
The defendants in 8. E. O. v, J. H. Lederer 00., Inc.; et al.54 consented to the entry of a permanent injunction restraining them from
further violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act
in the offer and sale of unregistered common stock of Continental
Mining Exploration, Ltd., a Canadian corporation. The Commission
had alleged that practically all of the shares of Continental acquired
by J. H. Lederer Co., Inc. were sold by means of long distance telephone calls to thousands of residents of the United States.
In 8. E. O. v. Mono-Kearsarge Oonsolidated Mining Oompany,
Jean R. Vedite 00., Ino., et al.55 the Commission's complaint alleged
that the individual defendants, who were persons closely connected
with the corporate defendants, acted as conduits to facilitate the public distribution of nearly a million unregistered shares of MonoKearsarge stock. It was further alleged that 380,000 of such shares
had already been offered and sold to U. S. residents by means of long
distance telephone calls and the United States mails. After the close

permanent injunction, and permanent injunctions were entered against
other defendants, including the companies named above.
The Commission .filed a complaint near the close of the fiscal year
in S. E. O. v. Linooin: Securities Oorporation; et 01.56 charging that
defendants had been offering and selling by means of long distance
telephone solicitations unregistered shares of Shoreland Mines, Ltd.
The complaint further charged that the defendants in order to induce
sales of Shoreland Mines, Ltd. used false and misleading statements,
among others, (1) that the company had iron ore claims adjacent
to iron mines actually in operation by one or more large steel corporations (2) that Shoreland Mines, Ltd. was engaged in the exploration and development of newly discovered resources, and (3)
that the price of Shoreland Mines, Ltd. would substantially increase
in the near future. The affidavits .filed in support of the Commission's motion for preliminary injunction stated that there had been
no exploration work on the claims allegedly owned by Shoreland
Mines, Ltd.; that Shoreland Mines, Ltd. had no working capital; that
no mines are in operation adjacent to Shoreland Mines property; and
that the claims of Shoreland Mines, Ltd. were not owned outright
but subject to a payment of $15,000 to the president of the company.
A temporary restraining order was entered and the action is still
pending.
The Commission's complaint and supporting affidavits in S. E. O.
v. Alan RU8selZSecurities, Ina.57 charged that the defendants had been
offering International Ceramics Mining, Limited stock, which is listed
on the Canadian Stock Exchange in Montreal, to residents of the
United States by means of long-distance telephone calls. The defendants in these telephone calls had falsely represented to prospective
investors that International Ceramics had large government contracts;
that it was producing a product for use in the guided missile and
rocket field; and that individuals associated with the Office of the
President of the United States had invested in the stock. In addition
to asserting the falsehood of such representations and others, the affidavits averred that International Ceramics for the past ten years had
been a pilot operation and operated at a deficit. A permanent injunction was entered restraining the defendants from further antifraud violations.
.
Subpoena Enforcement

During the past fiscal year the Commission on several occasions
was obliged to resort to the courts to seek enforcement of subpoenas
issued in connection with investigations of violations of the Securities

Act. In S. E. O. v. Linda Lord 58 the Commission applied for an order
to require obedience to the subpoena issued in an investigation of defendant's activities in the sale, by telephone, of the stock of Shoreland Mines, Ltd. An order to show cause was issued on June 2,1958
to which defendant failed to respond. On July 30, 1958 a criminal
information was filed against the defendant for violation of Section
19 (b) of the Securities Act and Section 21 (b) of the Exchange Act
for willful failure to respond to the subpoena. She is presently a
fugitive and a bench warrant has been issued for her arrest. The injunctive action initiated subsequent to the investigation is described
at page 53, S'Wpra.59
InS. E. O. v. Doeskin Products, Inc., et al.,60 the Commission sought
court enforcement of a subpoena duces tecum calling for the production
of certain records of Doeskin Products, Inc., charging that the refusal
to produce the information was impeding the Commission's investigation of whether the Securities Act had been violated in the issuance
and sale of securities of Swan-Finch Oil Corporation and Doeskin
Products, Inc. This action was subsequently dismissed by consent,
the records having been produced after the action was commenced.
For an account of related litigation, see pp. 54--55,infra. In S. E. O.
v. Dudley P. South,61 the District Court ordered the production of
certain books and records of the Surinam Corporation in obedience
to the Commission's subpoena duces tecum.
Other Litigation

In S. E. O. v. Doeskin Produote, Inc.,62 the Commission's complaint
was dismissed against two of the seven defendants, final judgment
having been entered by consent against the other five. This litigation,
which involved violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act, is discussed, together with the related proceedings in S. E. O. v, SwanFinch Oil Oorporaiion, et. al., on pages 52-3 of the 23rd Annual Report. In addition to the subpoena enforcement proceedings discussed
above on this page, there arose, in connection with the proceedings,
a civil suit against the Commission and various members of the Commission's staff. In that action Doeskin Products, Inc., filed a complaint in the New York Supreme Court," claiming damages of
$1,000,000 as a. consequence of the alleged unwarranted interference
by the Commission and its staff with the sale and transfer of plain~iff's~mmon stock in connection with the Commission's investigation

Upon petition by the Commission and individual defendants the
case was removed to the Federal District Court for the Southern
District of New York.64 Defendants subsequently filed a motion to
dismiss, on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim
upon which relief could be granted as against the individual
defendants, in that the acts complained of were performed in discharge of their duties as governmental officials and consequently no
liability attached, and further as against the Commission, in that
the Court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter. The motion to
dismiss was granted and a notice of appeal was filed but subsequently
withdrawn.
.
The Commission has been alert to the need to use all possible means
to protect investors from fraudulent promotions originating in foreign
countries. To this end a Foreign Fraud Order was obtained against
several companies and indiv:iduals engaged in a fraudulent distribution from Cuba into the United States of Latin American Exploration Company stock. The fraud order was based upon evidence
supplied by the Commission that the United States mails were being
used in. the conduct of the scheme to obtain money by means of
false and fraudulent representations concerning the geological nature
of the area in which the companies' property was located; the likelihood of bringing in profitable oil production from wells to be drilled
on such properties; anticipated increases in the value of stock; the probability of a big strike in oil on the property of the company and various
other similar lJ.'epresentations. The fraud order, which is directed to
all postmasters authorized to dispatch mail to Cuba, instructs them
to stamp "FRAUDULENT"
on all mail directed to any of the companies or persons listed in the order, and to return the same to the
sender.
In Oomico Oorporation v. S. E. 0.,65 a petition was filed for review
of the Commission's order denying petitioner's application for withdrawal of the registration statement. The Commission moved to
dismiss the petition on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction.
A per curiam order was subsequently entered dismissing the petition.

PART V
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE SECURITIES
OF 1934

EXCHANGE ACT

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides for the registration
and regulation of securities exchanges, and the registration of securities listed on such exchanges and it establishes, for issuers of securities
so registered, financial and other reporting requirements, regulation
of proxy solicitations and requirements with respect to trading by
directors, officers and principal security holders. The Act also provides for the registration and regulation of brokers and dealers doing
business in the over-the-counter market, contains provisions designed
to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative acts and practices
on the exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets and authorizes
the Federal Reserve Board to regulate the use of credit in securities
transactions. The purpose of these statutory requirements is to ensure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in securities.
REGULATION OF EXCHANGES AND EXCHANGE TRADING
Registration and Exemption of Exchanges

At the close of 1958, 14 stock exchanges were registered under the
Exchange Act as national securities exchanges:
American Stock Exchange
Boston Stock Exchange
Chicago Board of Trade
Cincinnati Stock Exchange
Detroit Stock Exchange
Midwest Stock Exchange
New Orleans Stock Exchange
New York Stock Exchange

Pacific Coast Stock Exchange
Philadelphia-Baltimore

Disciplinary Actions

Each national securities exchange reports to the Commission disciplinary actions taken against their members for violation of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or of exchange rules. During the year
56

TWENTY-FOURTH

ANNUAL REPORT

57

7 exchanges reported 44 cases of such disciplinary action. The actions taken included the imposition of .finesaggregating $18,430 in 10
cases; the suspension of 1 individual and 2 firms from exchange
membership; cancellation of the registration of 1 individual as a
specialist; and censure of a number of individuals and firms.
Commission Rate Study

Section 19 (b) of the Exchange Act imposes on the Commission
certain responsibilities and duties with respect to the rules of national securities exchanges including rules in respect of such matters
as the fixing of reasonable rates of commission and other charges.
Under an amendment to its Constitution, effective May 1, 1958, the
New York Stock Exchange provided for an increase in the minimum
commission rates to be charged by members and member firms. On
April 14, 1958, the Commission announced that it had directed its
staff to conduct a study of such commission rates and to report to the
Commission whether such commission rates and other charges are
reasonable and in accord with the standards contemplated by applicable provisions of the Exchange Act.' Pursuant to the directive of
the Commission the staff is now making a comprehensive study of
commission rates on the New York Stock Exchange.
Nine other registered national securities exchanges, including the
American Stock Exchange, have recently adopted scheduIes of commission rates identical with that of the New York Stock Exchange.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES

It is unlawful for a member of a national securities exchange or a
broker or dealer to effect any transaction in a security on such exchange unless the security is registered on that exchange under the
Securities Exchange Act or is exempt from such registration.
In
general, the Act exempts from registration obligations issued or guaranteed by a State or the Federal Government or by certain subdivisions or agencies thereof and authorizes the Commission to adopt
rules and reguIations exempting such other securities as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate to exempt in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Under this authority the
Commission has exempted securities of certain banks, certain securities secured by property or leasehold interests, certain warrants and,
on a temporary basis, certain securities issued in substitution for or
in addition to listed securities.
Section 12 of the Exchange Act provides that an issuer may register
a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission and
1

SecurIties Exchange Act Release No. 5678.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the exchange an application which discloses pertinent information
concerning the issuer and its affairs. An application requires the
:furnishing of information in regard to the issuer's business, capital
structure, the terms of its securities, the persons who manage or control its affairs, the remuneration paid to its officers and directors, the
allotment of options, bonuses and profit-sharing plans, and financial
statements certified by independent accountants.
Form 10 is the form used for registration by most commercial and
industrial companies. There are specialized forms for certain types
of securities, such as voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit
and securities of foreign governments.
-Section 13 requires issuers having securities registered on an exchange to file periodic reports keeping current the information furnished in the application for registration.
These periodic reports include annual reports, semi-annual reports, and current reports.
The
principal annual report form is Form 10-K which is designed to keep
up-to-date the information furnished in Form 10. Semi-annual reports required to be furnished on Form 9-K are devoted chiefly to
furnishing mid-year financial data. Current reports on Form 8-K
are required to be filed for each month in which any of certain specified events have occurred. A report on this form deals with matters
such as changes in control of the registrant, important acquisitions
or dispositions of assets, the institution or termination of important
legal proceedings and important changes in the issuer's capital securities or in the amount thereof outstanding.
Statistics Relating to Registration

eAs of June 30, 1958, a total of 2,236 issuers had 3,795 classes of securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges of which
2,663 were classified as stocks and 1,132 as bonds. Of the total 2,236
issuers, 1,28~ had 1,526 stock issues and 1,087 bond issues listed and
registered on the N ew York Stock Exchange. On a percentage basis,
the New York Stock Exchange had listed 57% of the issuers, 57% of
the stock issues and 96% of the bond issues.
During the 1958 fiscal year, a total of 54 issuers listed and registered
securities for the first time on a national securities exchange and the
listing and registration of all securities of 74 issuers was terminated
during the year. The number of applications filed during the fiscal
year for registration of classes of securities on national securities exchanges was 207.
The following table shows the number of annual, semi-annual and
current reports filed during the year by issuers having securities listed
and registered on national securities exchanges. The table also shows

No deductions have been made from the market values in the three
preceeding tables for intercompany investments tending toward duplication of values. The leading example of this duplication is the
Standard Oil (New Jersey) ownership of more than $10 billion market
value of shares of Creole Petroleum Corp., Humble Oil & Refining
Co., Imperial Oil Ltd., and International Petroleum Co., Ltd. This
ownership comprises well over half of the total value of all unlisted
shares admitted to trading on the American Stock Exchange. It is
reflected, of course, in the market value of the Standard Oil shares on
the New York Stock Exchange.
The number of shares admitted to trading on the stock exchanges
on December 31,1957, was approximately 6,773,000,000,compared with
6,334,500,000 on December 31, 1956. Some 6,246,900,000 shares, or

aggregate market value of about $197 billion listed on registered

exchanges as of December 31, 1957. The assets of the issuers involved
were about $273 billion, based on a showing of $255.2 billion by the
New York Stock Exchange and an estimate as to issuers represented
on other exchanges. The figures represent a conglomerate of individual and consolidated company reports and various treatments of
such matters as reserves for depreciation.
Foreign Stock

The market value on December 31, 1957, of all shares and certificates representing foreign stocks on the stock exchanges was reported
at about $9.7 billion, of which $8.9 billion represented Canadian and
$0.8 billion represented other foreign stocks. The market values of
the entire Canadian stock issues were included in these aggregates.
Most of the other foreign stocks were represented by American
Depositary Receipts or American Shares, only the outstanding
amounts of which were used in determining market values.
Comparative Over-we-Counter Statistics

Section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that
registration statements filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933
contain undertakings by the issuers to file the reports required by
section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act when the class of securities
offered and outstanding exceeds $2,000,000. The number of issuers
required to file these reports increased from 1,086 to 1,151 during the
fiscal year, excluding issuers also filing under the Investment Company Act of 1940. These issuers had securities outstanding with a
market value in excess of $20 billion on June 30, 1958.
The number of issuers registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 increased from 432 to 453, and their aggregate assets
increased roughly from $15 billion to $17 billion during the fiscal
year. Of the 453 issuers, 37, having assets totalling about $1.8 billion,
had their stocks listed on an exchange and the stocks of 3 whose
assets totalled about $56 million, were traded on an exchange on an
unlisted basis. The securities of the remaining 413 issuers were traded
exclusively in the over-the-counter market.
The number of active domestic issuers of over-the-counter stocks
(exclusive of registered investment companies) reporting 300 or more
holders appears not to have changed materially in recent years from
the estimated total of 3,500 mentioned in previous annual reports. The
numerous annual additions have been substantially offset by removals
due to listing, merger or other causes. The growth in issuers of
over-the-counter stocks appears more with respect to assets, market
values and number of shares outstanding and shareholders, than in
number of companies. In this respect they resemble issuers having
securities listed and registered on exchanges, whose number was 2,210

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

62

on June 30, 1953 and 2,236 on June 30, 1958, but whose aggregate
assets, market values, shares outstanding and shareholders have greatly
increased. The aggregate market value on December 31, 1957 of
the over-the-counter domestic stocks with 300 or more reported holders,
was about $44 billion or about 20% of the $224.2 billion market value
for all stocks on the exchanges on that date. The approximate number
of issuers and the aggregate market values of their over-the-counter
stocks were: for 700 bank issuers, $12 billion; for 275 insurance issuers,
$8 billion; for 300 utility issuers, $6 billion; and for 2,225 industrial
and miscellaneous issuers, $18 billion. The principal estimate in the
above amounts is the inclusion of about $1 billion in stock values for
500 issuers not found in the standard securities manuals nor reporting
to the Commission. The data are exclusive of issuers registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 and of foreign issuers.
The principal dollar volume in bonds of the United States and its
political subdivisions, in high-grade corporate bonds and preferred
stocks, and in bank, insurance, and investment trust shares is consummated in the over-the-counter market. The principal dollar volume
in stocks, other than those noted above, is consummated on the exchanges.
DELISTING OF SECURITIES FROM EXCHANGES

Pursuant to Section 12 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act a security registered on a national securities exchange may be withdrawn
or stricken from listing and registration in accordance with the rules
of the exchange and, upon such terms as the Commission may deem
necessary to impose for the protection of investors, upon application
by the issuer or the exchange to the Commission.
During the fiscal year 1958, the Commission granted applications
by exchanges and issuers to remove 42 securities from listing and registration pursuant to section 12 (d) and rule 12<12-1(b) thereunder,
as follows:

The New York Stock Exchange has adopted a revised policy with
respect to delisting,
It has stated that it will consider initiation of a

TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

63

delisting application where the size of a company has been reduced to
$2,000,000 or less in aggregate market value of the common stock
outstanding or net tangible assets applicable to common stock and the
average net earnings after taxes for the last three years is below
$200,000; or where distribution of the listed issue is limited to such an
extent that, in the case of common stock, there are 250 or fewer stockholders of record discounting holders of odd lots, or the stock
outstanding exclusive of concentrated holdings amounts to 30,000
shares or less or has a market value of $500,000 or less, or, in the case
of other listed securities, the issue outstanding exclusive of concentrated holdings has a market value of $200,000 or less or totals 2,000
shares or less in the case of stock or $200,000 or less of principal
amount in the case of bonds. The exchange has also stated that it will
consider initiation of a delisting application in instances, among
others, where stockholders have authorized liquidation or where sale
of assets has been made without authorizing liquidation.
All of the
delisting applications filed by the New York Stock Exchange were
initiated in accordance with this policy. The revised policy with
respect to delisting of securities on the New York Stock Exchange
was at issue in two cases described on p. 96 of last year's Annual

Report,"
The 8 delistings by the American Stock Exchange included 4:
closely-held stocks, 3 stocks suspended for failure to meet reporting
requirements among other reasons, and 1 stock following upon distribution of the company's principal assets. The 13 delistings by the
regional exchanges included 6 stocks with small volumes on the exchanges, and 7 stocks of issuers (including 5 mining companies) failing to meet reporting requirements among other things.
Of the 10 delistings upon applications by issuers, 5 were for the
purpose of reducing multiple listings, 3 were by mining companies
of uncertain financial condition, 1 was for long absence of exchange
transactions, and 1 followed a stockholder vote heavily in favor of
delisting.
During the fiscal year 1958 the Salt Lake Stock Exchange and the
San Francisco Mining Exchange adopted rules providing for suspension of trading in issues of companies which have not filed the
annual reports required under section 13 of the Securities Exchange
Act within 60 days after such reports are required to be filed, and
for the filing of delisting applications with the Commission if the
failure is not cured within 90 days after suspension. There were 8
delistings upon application of these exchanges and issuers of securities listed thereon during fiscal 1958, based principally on failure or

inability to comply with the new rule. The Spokane Stock Exchange
also adopted a similar rule during the fiscal year.
The Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange on April 9, 1958,
established a rule similar to that of the New York Stock Exchange
and several other exchanges, providing that, in the absence of special
circumstances, there must be a vote of security holders on delisting
proposals by issuers. In such cases, proxy statements must be cleared
through the Commission in accordance with its proxy rules. The
Salt Lake Stock Exchange adopted a substantially similar rule on
August 2,1957.
Delisting Proceedings Under Section 19 (a)

Section 19 (a) (2) authorizes the Commission to suspend for a
period not exceeding twelve months, or to withdraw, the registration
of a security on a national securities exchange if, in its opinion, such
action is necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors and,
after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that
the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision
of the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 19 (a)
(4) authorizes the Commission summarily to suspend trading in any
registered security on any national securities exchange for a period
not exceeding ten days if in its opinion such action is necessary or
appropriate for the protection of investors and the public interest
so requires.
Seven cases were pending under section 19 (a) (2) at the beginning
of the fiscal year and two cases were initiated during the fiscal year.
One case was closed during the fiscal year and eight cases were
pending at the end of the year. The case which was closed during
the year and six cases which were closed shortly after the end of the
year are described below.
In the past the Commission has used the power under section 19
(a) (4) infrequently. However, during the year it found it necessary and appropriate in connection with proceedings under section
19 (a) (2) involving Bellanca Corporation to use its authority summarily to suspend trading in that corporation's securities registered
on the American Stock Exchange.
Bellanca Corporation.- Bellanca Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was a small manufacturer of aircraft parts until February
1955 when Sydney L. Albert, a buyer and liquidator of failing businesses, acquired over 80% of its stock. Soon after Albert's acquisition
the market price of Bellanca stock rose to a peak of 30%, but in
early June, 1956, the market price of the stock broke sharply and
continued to decline through 1956 to about $2.00 per share. The
Commission instituted proceedings under section 19 (a) (2) of the

TWENTY-FOURTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

65

Act to determine whether the common stock of Bellanca should be
suspended or withdrawn from registration on the American Stock
Exchange.
In ordering the withdrawal of the registration of the common
stock of Bellanca on the American Stock Exchange, the Commission
found that the company violated sections 13 and 14 of the Act which
require, respectively, the filing of reports with the Commission and
the exchange, and the filing of preliminary proxy soliciting material
with the Commission," The Commission ruled that Bellanca's failure
to file certain required information as well as its filing of false information with respect to a number of securities transactions reflected
a "flagrant disregard for its responsibilities to public investors."
The Commission found that beginning in March, 1955, and continuing until June, 1956, Bellanca through Albert, who had become its
president, and others engaged in a program of acquiring interests
in other companies by means of a series of complex transactions
many of which resulted in benefits to the insiders rather than to
Bellanca. It was held that the reports that were filed through June,
1956, served only to mislead the public and obscure the facts by failing
to disclose unfavorable aspects of Bellanca's transactions and related
financing arrangements.
Among the reporting deficiencies discussed by the Commission
were those relating to N. O. Nelson Company and Automatic Washer
Company. According to the decision, Bellanca failed to report that
its purchase of N. O. Nelson Company in 1955 was accomplished
by means of a $4,000,000 loan for which a premium of $500,000 was
paid in addition to interest of 6%, nor was the subsequent refinancing
of the Nelson purchase disclosed. Bellanca exchanged its Nelson
stock for a controlling block of stock of Automatic Washer Company,
at a time when Bellanca's president was in a controlling position
with respect to Automatic.
The Commission found that Bellanca
should have filed a current report to disclose the agreement with
Automatic, and that a subsequently filed current report was misleading and inadequate in failing to disclose the interest of Bellanca's
president and others in the transactions.
In addition, the Commission found that the financial statements in the annual report for 1956
and in preliminary proxy soliciting material filed with the Commission in 1957 were misleading and inadequate with respect to the
value placed on Bellanca's shares of Automatic stock.
The Commission further found that securities owned or held by
Bellanca or a subsidiary were used by the president for his own
personal benefit and that such information should have been disclosed
• Securities Exchange Act Release No. 5706 (June 2,1958).

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

in the company's annual report for 1956 and in the preliminary proxy
soliciting material, as required under the Commission's rules. Although all such shares were eventually returned or replaced, it was
noted that in some instances the market value of the shares when
they were returned was considerably lower than at the time they
were taken.
The Commission held that the evidence showed a "course of conduct over an extended period involving flagrant violations of the
reporting and proxy provisions of the Act. The purpose of the
reporting provision is to inform existing and potential investors of
material corporate activities as they occur and the purpose of the
proxy provisions is to enable stockholders to exercise their voting
rights upon the basis of an informed judgment." The Commission
concluded that the record established that the protection of investors
required the withdrawal of the registration of Bellanca's securities
on the Exchange and pointed out that such withdrawal would conform with the Congressional intent reflected in section 19 (a) (2) as
well as the Commission's previous decision in the Great Sweet Grass
Oils case.'
Eureka Company.-In the Eureka Oompany case, the Commission
found that reports filed by the company with the San Francisco
Mining Exchange and the Commission during 1956 and 1957pursuant
to section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act were false and misleading. In addition, the company failed to file an annual report
for 1955 and semi-annual reports for the periods ending June 30,
1955 and June 30, 1956, and filed a false and misleading proxy statement with respect to its annual meeting of stockholders for November
14,1955.
The reports filed, some of which were filed late, were found to contain false and misleading statements concerning the acquisition of
significant amounts of oil, gas and mining properties and other physical assets. Morover, the reports misrepresented that certain securities
sold and issued by the company in exchange for various assets were
exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of
1933 pursuant to the provision of section 4 (1) of the Act which exempts "transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering."
The Commission found that in a series of transactions from J anuary to February, 1957, the company issued a substantial amount .of
its common stock in exchange for various interests in oil, gas and mining properties and related machinery and equipment. Current reports
required to be filed to reflect these transactions were filed late, and no
reports were filed with respect to certain acquisitions of assets. Fur4

TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

67

thermore, the reports which were filed did not furnish required information regarding the date and manner of acquisition, a description
of the assets involved, the nature and amount of consideration given
therefor, the identity of the persons from whom the assets were acquired and the nature of the material relationships which existed between such persons and the company, its directors and officers, and
associates thereof.
Each of the current reports filed concerning the issuance of common stock in exchange for assets stated that such securities were not
registered under the Securities Act and that such "securities were
taken for investment by the purchaser."
In this connection, the
Commission held that representations by a purchaser that he is acquiring securities for investment or that he will not transfer them for
a certain period are not of themselves sufficient to establish a private
offering exemption pursuant to section 4: (1) of the Securities Act. In
this case the Commission found that the number and nature of the
purchasers and the manner of distribution were such as to clearly involve a public offering. The stock issued by the company in 1956 for
properties and services were distributed to about 35 original purchasers. By February 1957, a large number of shares issued to the
original recipients were transferred to 70 other persons or firms, including more than 15 broker-dealer firms. A substantial number of
such shares eventually were widely distributed to the public.
The Commission found that the transfers and distributions were
known or should have been known to Eureka, and held that the current reports were false and misleading in representing that the shares
listed in such reports were exempt from registration under the Securities Act and were taken for investment by the purchasers. Such reports should have disclosed that the shares were sold in violation of
section 5 of the Act.
The Commission stated that use of the facilities of a national securities exchange by an issuer is a privilege involving important responsibilities under the Securities Exchange Act, including compliance with
the reporting and proxy solicitation requirements. It pointed out
that Congress has specified that when violations occur, such privilege
may be withdrawn if necessary or appropriate for the protection of
investors, and decided that under the circumstances of the case, the
protection of investors required that the registration of the common
stock of Eureka on the San Francisco Mining Exchange be withdrawn,"
Nev-Tah Oil and Mining Company.-In the case of Nev-Tah Oil
and Mining Company the Commission found that the company had
failed to file current reports giving information as to acquisition of
S

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

certain interests and the subsequent loss thereof and also as to a judgment for $100,000 in connection with one of the transactions.
Moreover certain current reports represented that large issues of
stocks were registered under the Securities Act of 1933 whereas, in
fact, such shares were not registered and were offered to the public
in violation of the Act. Neither the sales of such shares nor an injunction obtained by the Commission by consent in the United States
District Court for the District of Nevada enjoining the registrant and
certain officers from further sales, were disclosed in current reports.
A vigorously contested issue in this case was whether control was exercised by the principal promoter who was the manager and generally
the largest single stockholder, who selected the president, two directors and the general counsel, who controlled the finances and operations, negotiated most of the acquisitions 'and dispositions and determined the prices and participated in a substantial way at board meetings although not a director. The Commission found that such
person in fact controlled and was the parent of the registrant and
that the required reports not only failed to disclose such control but
also falsely denied it existed. The registrant asked for a 90-day delay
of the Commission's determination so as to permit it to submit a plan
of rehabilitation, but the Commission found that the record did not
indicate any basis on which such a plan could be achieved and ordered
that the registration of the common stock on the Salt Lake Stock
Exchange be withdrawn,"
Nevada Monarch Consolidated Mines Corporation.In the Nevada
Monarch case, the company had not filed annual reports for the years
1951 through 1956. Its report for 1956 was ultimately filed some five
months after it was due. In addition, the company failed to file until March, 1958, (after institution of delisting proceedings by the Commission) a current report due in July, 1957, reporting that in June,
1957, it had executed a three-year lease on all its properties coupled
with an option to the lessee to purchase the properties.
Moreover, the
annual report finally filed for 1956 contained a balance sheet which
stated that proceeds of $50,000 from a government loan had been expended by the lessee for the development of a tungsten ore body, when
as a matter of fact the lessee received only $4,875 from such a loan
and in addition expended a maximum of $18,000 "in connection with"
such loan.
In reaching the conclusion that the protection of investors required
the withdrawal of registration from the Salt Lake Stock Exchange,
the Commission pointed out that the purpose of the reporting provisions of the Act is to inform existing and potential investors of ma• Securities Exchange Act Release No. 5738 (July 22, 1958).

69

terial corporate activities and the corporation's financial condition,
and found that the registrant had ignored its obligations under these
provisions. The Commission also pointed out that the company's
asserted belief that the loan had been granted in its full amount could
not absolve the company of responsibility for the substantial overstatement of assets in its financial statement.'
Intermountain Petroleum, Inc.-In
the Intermountain Petroleum,
Inc. case the Commission found that reports filed by the company with
the Salt Lake Stock Exchange and the Commission pursuant to section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act were not filed within the prescribed time and, when filed, were false and misleading. These
reports were found to contain false and misleading statements regarding the availability of exemptions from registration under the Securities Act, the recipients of stock issues and the value of mining and
oil claims.
The Commission in its opinion held that she record did not establish that the claimed exemption under section 4 (1) of the Securities
Act was available for the issuance of about 1,400,000 shares to approximately 90 persons in one transaction and the issuance of 274,500
shares to about 58 persons in another transaction.
The opinion
points out that in the proceedings, and in amended reports for the
months in question, the company abandoned its contention that private offering exemptions under section 4 (1) of the Securities Act
were available and instead urged that registration was not required
because no sale of the securities occurred within the meaning of Rule
133 under the Securities Act. The Commission, in holding that this
position was without substance, stated that the theory of Rule 133 is
that no sale of securities to stockholders is involved where the distribution of securities to them results from the authorization by them,
voting as a group, of a corporate act such as a transfer of assets for
stock of another corporation, a merger or a consolidation, because in
such situations there is not present the element of individual consent
ordinarily required for a "sale" of securities in the contractual sense.
However, it was found in this case that the conditions of Rule 133, including the requirement of a vote of stockholders, were not met. It
was further stated that, even if the terms and conditions of that rule
had been literally met, no exemption would have been available under
that rule if a vote by the shareholders of the acquired company would
have been merely a formal act due to its affairs being controlled by a
single individual who negotiated the exchange.
The Commission also found that the reports in question were misleading with respect to mining and oil claims which had not been the
'Securities

Exchange .Act Release No. 5146 (July 30. 1958).

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

subject of geological appraisals or exploratory drillings. The Commission stated that the use of the terms "appraised value" and
"valued" in connection with unexplored and undeveloped mining and
oil prospects was misleading since such terms carried with them an
implication that value had been determined by a scientific method.
Moreover, it was especially important that there be no misleading
implications as to the "value" of the claims covered by one of the reports, since those claims were sold to the company by an officer and
controlling person of the company.
The company asserted that there was no intent to mislead or withhold information and that the deficiencies were the result of a lack
, of understanding of the requirements and the failure to consult
counsel. The Commission concluded that while the company's asserted
lack of understanding of applicable law and regulations and its lack
of legal counsel did not condone the violations which it had found, it
appeared that such violations did not stem from any plan or intent
to defraud investors and that the company now fully appreciates its
obligations and exhibited a willingness to file accurate information.
Under all the circumstances, the Commission concluded, the protection of investors would be satisfied without withdrawal of the registration of the company's stock on the exchange if complete and
accurate reports were filed. Accordingly, the registration of the company's stock on the exchange was suspended shortly after the end of
the fiscal year for a period of 60 days, with the provision that if within
such time the company filed corrected current reports, an order terminating the suspension and discontinuing the proceedings would be
entered. If no such reports were filed within the stated period, an
order withdrawing the registration on the exchange of the company's
stock would be entered,"
Verdi Development Company.-The
Commission found that the
company had failed to file current reports required to be filed pursuant
to section 13 of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and to
report material dispositions of the company's assets, defaults on its
debt securities, the institution and termination of material litigation
and the granting by the company of stock options. In addition, the.
Commission found that annual reports filed by the company after
the institution of proceedings against the company failed to include
required financial statements, and concluded that the company's stock
should be withdrawn from registration on the San Francisco Mining
Exchange,"

statement. The company filed a proxy statement with the Commission, which was mailed to stockholders, indicating that one of the
matters to be acted on at the meeting was a proposal to increase the
amount of authorized common stock from 2,000,000 shares to 10,000,000
shares and that a portion of the new shares would be traded or
In

this connection it stated: "However no negotiations in this respect
have been undertaken and the Board of Directors does not presently
have in mind any specific properties for acquisition.
In addition,
there have been no plans, agreements or discussions concerning the
present program of expansion or acquisitions in which the company
or its officers and directors or any prospective officer or director have
been or are now engaged."
The Commission found, however, that the evidence adduced at
the hearing established that at the time the proxy statement was
issued, the company's controlling person did in fact have in mind
specific properties for acquisition, and that there had been plans
and negotiations with respect thereto. The Commission concluded
that the proxy statement was materially false and misleading and
that the company in its use of such proxy materiel violated section
14 (a) of the Act and rule X-14a-9 thereunder,
This fact, plus
the failure to file a current report on Form 8-K in connection with
the dssuance of 6,'750,000 shares of the company's stock for assets
acquired, led the Commission to find that it was necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to withdraw the registration
of the company's common stock on the Salt Lake Stock Exchange,'?
UNLISTED TRADING PRIVILEGES ON EXCHANGES
Unlisted Trading Categories

Under the provisions of section 12 (f) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, the Commission may approve applications by national
securities exchanges to admit securities to unlisted trading privileges
without action on the part of the issuers, if it finds such admissions
are necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Such admissions dmpose no duties-on issuers
beyond any they may already have under the Act. Section 12 (f)
provides for three categories of unlisted trading privileges.
Clause (1) of section 12 (f) provides for continuation of unlisted
trading privileges existing on the exchanges prior to March 1, 1934.
The number of unlisted trading privileges under Clause (1) in issues
listed 0'11 other exchanges has declined Hom '75 bond and 991 stock
admissions on December 31, 1935, to 2 bond and 536 stock admissions
on June 30, 1958. The number of unlisted trading privileges in

issues not Iisted on other exchanges has declined from 496 bond
and 817 stock admissions to 20 bond and 246 stock admissions duning
the same period."
Clause (2) of section 12 (f) provides for granting by the Commission of applications by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges
in securities listed on other exchanges. There were 926 unlisted trading privileges in effect under Clause (2) on June 30, 1958, of which
925 involved stocks and 1 a bond issue.
Clause (3) of section 12 (f) provides for granting by the Commission of applications for unlisted trading privileges conditioned,
among other things, upon the availability of information substantially equivalent to that required to be filed by listed issuers. On
June 30, 1958, unlisted trading privileges existed pursuant to clause
(3) in only 12 bond and 4 stock issues, and 2 of the stock issues
have also become listed on other exchanges. There have been no
applications under clause (3) since 1949.
Volume of Unlisted Trading in Stocks on Exchanges

The reported volume of shares traded on an unlisted basis on the
stock exchanges during the calendar year 1957 included approximately 28.8 million shares in stocks admitted to unlisted trading only
and 29.2 million shares in stocks listed on exchanges other than where
unlisted trading occurred. These amounts were respectively about
2.69 and 2.73 percent of the total share volume reported on all exchanges. Appendix table 9 shows the distribution of share volume
among the various categories of unlisted trading privileges on exchanges.
Applications for Unlisted Trading Privileges

Pursuant to applications filed by exchanges with respect to stock
listed on other exchanges, unlisted trading privileges were extended
during the year ended June 30, 1958, as follows:

REPORTED BY EXCHANGES

Rule 10b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in substance
prohibits any person participating or otherwise financially interested
in the primary or secondary distribution of a security from paying
any other person for soliciting a third person to buy any security of
the same issuer on a national securities exchange. This rule is an
anti-manipulative rule adopted under section 10 (b) of the Act which
makes it unlawful for any person to use any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of Commission rules prescribed in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Paragraph (d) of rule 10b-2 exempts transactions where compensation
is paid pursuant to the terms of a plan, filed by a national securities
exchange and declared effective by the Commission, authorizing the
payment of such compensation in connection with the distribution.
The Commission in its declaration may impose such terms and conditions upon such plan as it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
At the present time two types of plans are in effect to permit a block
of securities to be distributed through the facilities of a national securities exchange when it has been determined by the exchange that the
regular market on the floor of the exchange cannot absorb the particular block within a reasonable time and at a reasonable price or prices.
These plans have been designated the "Special Offering Plan," essentially a fixed-price offering based on the market price, and the "Exchange Distribution Plan," which is a distribution "at the market".
Both plans contemplate that orders will be solicited off the floor but
executed on the floor. Each of such plans contains certain antimanipulative controls and requires specified disclosures concerning
the distribution to be made to prospective purchasers.
In addition to these two methods of distributing large blocks of
securities on national securities exchanges, a third method is commonly employed whereby blocks of listed securities may be distributed
to the public on the over-the-counter market. This method is commonly referred to as a "Secondary Distribution" and such a distribution usually takes place after the close of exchange trading. It is
generally the practice of exchanges to require members to obtain the

approval of the exchange before participating in such secondary
distributions.
The following table shows the number and volume of special
offerings and exchange distributions reported by the exchanges having
such plans in effect, as well as similar figures for secondary distributions which exchanges have approved for member participation and

MANIPULATION AND STABILIZATION
Manipulation

The Exchange Act describes and prohibits certain forms of manipulative activity in any security registered on a national securities
exchange. The prohibited activities include wash sales and matched
orders effected for the purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance of trading activity in, or with respect to the market for, any
such security; a series of transactions in which the price of such security is raised or depressed, or in which actual or apparent active
trading is created for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales of
such security by others; circulation by a broker, dealer, seller, or
buyer, or by a person who receives consideration from a broker,
dealer, seller or buyer, of information concerning market operations
conducted for a rise or a decline in the price of such security; and
the making of any false and misleading statement of material information by a broker, dealer, seller, or buyer regarding such security
for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales. The Act also empowers the Commission to adopt rules and regulations to define and
prohibit the use of these and other forms of manipulative activity
in any security registered on an exchange or traded over the counter.
The Commission's market surveillance staff in its Division of
Trading and Exchanges in Washington and in its New York Regional
Office and other field offices observes the tickertape quotations of
securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange and on the Ameri-

75

TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

can Stock Exchange, the sales and quotation sheets of the various
regional exchanges, and the bid and asked prices published by the
National Daily Quotation Service for about 6,000 unlisted securities
to observe any unusual or unexplained price variations or market
activity. The financial news ticker, leading newspapers, and various
financial publications and statistical services are also closely followed.
When unusual or unexplained market activity in a security is observed, all known information regarding the security is examined and
a decision made as to the necessity for an investigation.
Most investigations are not made public so that no unfair reflection will be
cast on any persons or securities and the trading markets will not be
upset. These investigations, which are conducted by the Commission's regional offices, take two forms, A preliminary investigation
or "quiz" is designed to discover rapidly evidence of unlawful activity.
If no violations are :found, the preliminary investigation is closed.
If it appears that more intensive investigation is necessary, a formal
order of investigation, which carries with it the right to issue subpenas
and to take testimony under oath, is issued by the Commission.
If violations by a broker-dealer are discovered, the Commission may
institute administrative proceedings to determine whether or not
to revoke his registration or to suspend or expel him from membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or from
a national securities exchange. The Commission may also seek an
injunction against any person violating the Act and it may refer information obtained in its investigation to the Department of Justice
recommending that persons violating the Act be criminally prosecuted.
In some cases, where State action seems likely to bring quick results
in preventing fraud or where Federal jurisdiction may be doubtful,
the information obtained may be referred to State agencies for State
injunction or criminal prosecution.
The following table shows the number of quizzes and formal investigations pending at the beginning of fiscal 1958, the number initiated
in fiscal 1958, the number closed or completed during the same period,

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

When securities are to be offered to the public, their markets are
watched very closely to make Sure that the price is not unlawfully
raised prior to or during the distribution.
Eight hundred and nine
registered offerings having a value of $16,489,700,000 and 732 offerings exempt under section 3 (b) of the Securities Act, having a value
of about $134 million were so observed during the fiscal year. One
hundred and ninety seven other offerings, such as secondary distributions and distributions of securities under special plans filed by
the exchanges, having a total value of $446 million, were also kept
under surveillance.
Stabilization

Stabilization involves open-market purchases of securities to prevent or retard a decline in the market price in order to facilitate a
distribution.
It is permitted by the Exchange Act subject to the
restrictions provided by the Commission's rules 10b-6, 7 and 8. These
rules are designed to confine stabilizing activity to that necessary for
the above purpose, to require proper disclosure and to prevent unlawful manipulation.
During 1958 stabilizing was effected in connection with stock offerings aggregating 18,221,647 shares having an aggregate public
offering price of $453,580,132 and bond offerings having a total offering price of $201,138,350. In these offerings, stabilizing transactions resulted in the purchase of 316,945 shares of stock at a cost of
$8,335,724and bonds at a cost of $3,755,794. In connection with these
stabilizing transactions, 4,445 stabilizing reports showing purchases
and sales of securities effected by persons conducting the distribution
were received and examined during the fiscal year.
INSIDERS' SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND HOLDINGS

A corporate "insider," by virtue of his position, may have knowledge of the company's condition and prospects which is not available
to the general public and may be able to use such information to
advantage in transactions in the company's securities. Section 16 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and similar provisions contained
in section 17 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
and section 30 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 were designed
to provide other stockholders and investors with information as to
the transactions and holdings of insiders and to prevent the unfair
use of confidential information by insiders to profit from in-and-out
trading in a company's securities.

TWENTY-FOURTH

77

ANNUAL REPORT

Section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires every person
who is a direct or indirect beneficial owner of more than 10 percent
of any class of equity securities (other than exempted securities)
which is registered on a national securities exchange, or who is a
director or officer of the issuer of such securities, to file reports with
the Commission and the exchange disclosing his ownership of the
issuer's equity securities. This information must be kept current by
filing subsequent reports for any month in which a change in his
ownership occurs. Similar reports are required by section 17 (a) of
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of officers and directors
of public utility holding companies and by section 30 (f) of the
Investment Company Act of officers, directors, principal security
holders, members of advisory boards and investment advisers or
affiliated persons of investment advisers of registered closed-end investment companies.
All ownership reports are available for public inspection as soon
as they are filed at the Commission's officein Washington and reports
filed pursuant to section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act may
also be inspected at the exchanges where copies of such reports are
filed. In addition, for the purpose of making the reported information available to interested persons who may not be able to inspect
the reports in person, the Commission summarizes and publishes such
information in a monthly "Official Summary of Security Transactions
and Holdings," which is distributed by the Government Printing Office on a subscription basis. The increasing interest in this publication is evidenced by the increase of more than 1,000 in subscriptions
during the past year. The total circulation is now nearly 6,000.
The number of ownership reports filed continued at a high level33,126 for the fiscal year. This is a decline from the record high of
34,443 reports filed during the 1957 fiscal year. The following table

Recovery of Short-Swing Trading Profits hy Issuer

In order to prevent insiders from making unfair use of information
which may have been obtained by reason of their relationship with a
company, section 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act, section 17 (b)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and section 30 (f) of
the Investment Company Act provide for the recovery by or on behalf
of the issuer of any profit realized by insiders from certain purchases
and sales, or sales and purchases, of securities of the company within
any period of less than six months. The Commission has certain exemptive powers with respect to transactions not comprehended within
the purpose of these provisions, but is not charged with the enforcement of the civil remedies created thereby. The Commission has,
however, filed briefs as amicus curiae in several suits instituted by
private parties where the construction of applicable statutory provisions or rules was involved.

REGULATION OF PROXIES
Scope of Proxy Regulation

Under sections 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 12 (e) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and 20 (a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 the Commission has adopted Regulation 14 requiring the disclosure in a proxy statement of pertinent information in connection with the solicitation of proxies, consents and
authorizations in respect of securities of companies subject to those
statutes. The regulation also provides means whereby any security
holders so desiring may communicate with other security holders when
management is soliciting proxies, either by distributing their own
proxy statements or by including their proposals in the proxy statements sent out by management.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminary form prior to the date of the proposed solicitation.
Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed disclosure
standards, the management or other group responsible for its preparation is notified informally and given an opportunity to avoid such defects in the preparation of the proxy material in the definitive form in
which it is furnished to stockholders.
Statistics Relating to Proxy Statements

During the 1958 fiscal year a total of 1,929 proxy statements in definitive form were filed under the Commission's Regulation 14 for the
solicitation of the proxies of security holders; 1,897 of these were filed
by management and 32 by non-management groups or individual stockholders. These 1,929 solicitations related to 1,769 companies, some 110
of which had more than one solicitation during the year, generally
for a special meeting not involving the election of directors.
Of the 1,929 proxy statements filed during the 1958 fiscal year, 1,780
involved the solicitation of proxies for the election of directors, 134
were for special meetings not involving the election of directors and 15
solicited assents and authorizations for actions not involving a meeting of security holders or the election of directors.
In addition to the election of directors, stockholders' decisions were
sought in the 1958 fiscal year with respect to the following types of
matters:
Mergers, consolidations, acquisitions of businesses, purchases and sales
of property and dissolutions of companies___________________________101

Stockholder Proposals

During the 1958 fiscal year, 39 stockholders submitted a total of
165 proposals which were included in the 95 proxy statements of 95
companies under rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14.
Typical of such stockholder proposals submitted to a vote of security holders were resolutions relating to amendments to charters or
by-laws to provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors,
limitations on the granting of options to and their exercise by key
employees and the management group and limitations on salaries
and pensions. Other resolutions related to such matters as the sending of a post-meeting report to all stockholders and the approval by
stockholders of the selection by management of the independent
accountants.
The management of 24 companies omitted from their proxy statements, under the conditions specified in rule 14a-8, a total of 51 additional proposals submitted by 32 individual stockholders. The
principal reasons for such omission and the number of times each
such reason was involved were as follows: (a) eight proposals were
not a proper subject matter under state law; (b) twelve proposals
related to the ordinary conduct of the company's business; (c) twelve
proposals involved a personal grievance; (d) six proposals were not
timely submitted to the company; (e) three proposals did not receive sufficient votes at the previous stockholders' meeting; (f) two
proposals involved the nomination of particular candidates for election as directors; (g) two proposals were based on reasons considered
to be misleading; (h) the company determined not to solicit proxies
after receipt of one proposal; and (i) five proposals were withdrawn
by the stockholder.

applicant or broker-dealer is subject to one or more of the disqualifications set forth in the Act. These disqualifications, in general, are
(1) willful false or misleading statements in the application or documents supplemental thereto, (2) conviction within ten years of a
felony or misdemeanor involving the purchase or sale of securities or
any conduct arising out of the business as a broker-dealer, (3) injunction by a court of competent jurisdiction from engaging in any practices in connection with the purchase or sale of securities and (4) willful violation of the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934or any of the Commission's rules or regulations thereunder.
In addition, brokers and dealers may be suspended or expelled by the
Commission from membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and national securities exchanges for participating
in violations of the various federal securities laws or the regulations
thereunder. The Commission may not deny registration to any person
who applies therefor absent evidence of misconduct of the specified
types enumerated in the Act. Bad reputation or character, lack of
experience in the securities business or even conviction of the registrant of a felony not involving the sale of securities do not constitute
.statutory bars to registration as a broker-dealer.

from the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ior a period
of twenty days," and the firms of Gilligan Will & CO.13and Dempsey
& Company 14 were similarly suspended for periods of five days each.
Elliott & Company had sold convertible debentures on behalf of
Crowell-Collier to a. small group, including Gilligan, Will & Co.
and Dempsey & Company, and had obtained from these purchasers
statements of intention to hold the securities for investment. However, a number of the original purchasers, including those two firms"
shortly thereafter resold portions of their purchases to additional
persons, who also furnished statements of investment intent. Elliott
& Company claimed the exemption from registration provided by
the Securities Act of 1933 for private offerings, and the other two
firms in addition claimed that they were not underwriters and were

therefore exempt. The Commission ruled that these exemptions
were not available. Although Elliott & Company denied that it had
had knowledge of the resales, the Commission stated that actual
knowledge of resale was not essential to a finding of violation of section 5 of the Securities Act, there being many factors sufficient to put
persons experienced rill securities matters on notice of the probability
of further sales, including the speculative nature of the securities,
the fact that the debentures were issued in bearer form and in small
denominations, the establishment of a conversion price below the
market price of the common stock and the listing of the common
stock on the American Stock Exchange. The Commission 3;180 held
that the basic policy of registration under the Securities Act could
not be frustrated by the technique of mechanically obtaining socalled ''investment intent" Ietters from successive groups of purchasers.
The firm of Batkin & 00.15 was found by the Commission to have
practiced fraud in the purchase and sale of securities, failed to
comply with bookkeeping and net capital requirements, and sold
unregistered securities. The registration of Batkin & Co. as a brokerdealer was revoked and 'it was expelled from the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
The application of Gregory & Oompany, lno.,I6 a Canadian brokerdealer, for registration as a broker-dealer was denied by the Commission and Kenneth H. Gregory, president, director and controlling
stockholder, was found to be the cause of the denial. The Commission
found that Gregory & Company, Inc. had made false and misleading
statements in its application for registration and had been effecting
transactions rill interstate commerce in unregistered securities while
it was not registered as a broker-dealer. The Commission also found
a violation of the antd-fraud provisions of section 17'of the Securities
Act of 1933 in that the applicant and Gregory offered securities to
customers at prices substantially higher than, and bearing no reasonable relationship to, the market price.
The application for broker-dealer registration of P. J. Gruber &
00., lno.l1 was denied where it was found that the applicant used
the mails and interstate facilities in the sale of 49,500 shares of
Acoustica Associates, Inc. stock when no registration statement was
in effect. In addition, false and misleading entries were found in the
blotters and ledgers maintained by the Gruber office. The Com:us Securities Exchange Act Release No. 5709 (June 9, 1958).

mission found Peter J. Gruber, controlling stockholder, and Phil
Sacks, president, to be the cause of such denial.
The registrations of four broker-dealer firms were revoked by the
Commission on the basis of injunctions issued against each of these
firms for selling unregistered securities. The broker-dealers so revoked were Harold L. Nielsen, doing business as Nielsen Investment

and Percy Dale Lanphere, doing business as Dale Lamphere.":
Battery Securities Corporation was also expelled from the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
In a number of cases the Commission revoked broker-dealer registrations on the basis of injunctions against further violations of the
Commission's net capital rule which requires that a broker-dealer
maintain for the protection of customers a prescribed ratio between
aggregate indebtedness and net capital. Revocations were based on
such injunctions in the following cases: Milton J. Shuck, doing business as M. J. Shuck Oompany/2 Quintin Securities, Inc.,23..4.. J. Gould
&: 00., Inc.,24Foster-Mann, Inc.,25 and W. L. Mast &: 00.26 The last
named broker-dealer firm was also expelled from the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. The broker-dealer registration of
Stein, Botwinick &: Oompany,IncP was revoked by the Commission
on a finding that the broker-dealer firm was enjoined from engaging
in the securities business for effecting securities transactions while
insolvent and making false statements in the purchase and sale of
securities.
The broker-dealer registration of Wendell Elmer Kindley, doing
business as Wendell E. Kindley 00.28was revoked for failure to keep
books and records and to comply with the net capital requirements, as
well as for doing business while insolvent. It was found by the Commission that in eight transactions in one month the registrant had purchased securities from broker-dealers through the use of the mails and
other means of interstate commerce when he was not in a position to

tions in connection with the sale of common stock of Bostona Mines
Company between January 1, 1952and October 1, 1956.
On September 4, 1957 William T. Bowler had pleaded guilty and
was convicted in the Court of Quarter Sessions of McKean County,
Pennsylvania, of (1) embezzlement of a customer's securities; (2)
larceny in failing to return securities held by him as bailee; (3) fraudulent failure to disclose to the Pennsylvania Securities Commission
that he sold certain securities without informing purchasers that
neither he nor the issuer had any authorization from that Commission
to sell them; (4) sale of certain securities without filing a notice of
intention to sell such securities with that Commission; and (5) participation and assistance in the sale of certain securities by salesmen
who were not registered with that Commission. It was also found
that both the sole proprietorship and the partnership had violated
the record-keeping requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934and the rules thereunder.
Christopulos & Nichols Brokerage Company, Inc., had been enjoined from improperly extending credit, failing to send confirmations
of transactions to customers and failing properly to record transactions, in violation of sections 7, 15, and 17 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,and had also been convicted of criminal contempt
of that injunction.
The revocations of the broker-dealer registrations of Horace Linson
Michener 86 and Cobb and Oompany, hW.,31 were based on findings of
misappropriation of customers' funds and the Commission found that
Michener had bought and sold securities without delivering the securities sold or paying for the securities purchased, in violation of sections
10 (b) and 15 (c) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act and the rules
thereunder. Cobb and Company, Inc., induced certain persons in 68
transactions to order securities and to make payment therefor, but,
instead. of purchasing the securities ordered, appropriated such payments to its own use. In connection with six of these transactions
Cobb and Company falsely represented that it had purchased the
securities ordered. 21 of the 68 transactions took place when the firm
was insolvent. In these transactions, registrant accepted monies and
securities upon the false representation that it was able to execute the
orders and appropriated such monies and securities to its own use.
Mclnnes & 00., Ina.,3s a registered broker-dealer, was also found to
have accepted customers' funds and securities without disclosing its
insolvency. The Commission also found, among other things, that in

company. The Commission revoked the broker-dealer registration of
McInnes & Co., Inc. expelled it from the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. and further found Raymond McInnes to be a
cause of such revocation and expulsion.
The Commission denied the application of F. W. Horne & 00.,
Ina.3D for registration as a broker-dealer because of the methods it
utilized to effect purchases and sales of securities of First New Hampshire Corporation. The Commission found that violations of the
anti-fraud provisions had been committed and that the firm had
effected securities transactions while not registered.
Looper and Oompany40 was found to have induced customer transactions which were excessive in volume and frequency in view of the
character of the accounts, and took secret profits and improperly
extended and arranged for credit in cash accounts, in willful violation
of the Securities Act and Securities Exchange Act and the rules
thereunder. Its broker-dealer registration was revoked.
The application of Indiana State Securities Oorporatioiu" for registration as a broker-dealer was denied by the Commission upon a
finding that applicant had willfully violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act and the Securities Act in sales of
stock of Insurance Corporation of America. Applicant's sales were
made with the use of a prospectus which indicated that the stock was
offered by the issuer at a public offering price of $6.00 per share, but
applicant failed to disclose that there was an over-the-counter market
for the stock at a substantially lower price and that some of the stock
so offered was owned by the applicant and the proceeds of its sale
would not be received by the issuer. The Commission further found
Charles E. Johnson, Marvin H. Weisman, and Rudy Klapper, officers
and directors of subject corporation, to be the causes of the denial.
The application of The Whitehall Corporation.42 for registration
as a broker-dealer was also denied by the Commission upon a finding
that the applicant had been selling unregistered securities, had used
false and misleading statements in connection with such sales, had
submitted as part of its application a misleading financial statement
and had engaged in interstate transactions in securities without being
registered. A petition for rehearing filed by The Whitehall Corporation was denied .

The registration of Allen E. Beers Oompany 44 was revoked and
Allen E. Beers, the controlling partner, was found to be a cause of
the revocation. The Commission found in part that the company's
salesmen sold stock of Minerals Processing Company to customers by
means of false and misleading representations that, among other
things, the company's profits would be substantial because of the
discovery of rich mica and beryl, there would be increases in the
company's production, profits and earnings, and the value of its

a false financial report and had failed to deliver securities for which
customers had paid, to comply with net capital requirements and to
maintain required books and records.
The Commission also found it to be in the public interest to revoke
the broker-dealer registration of Harold L. Nielsen, doing business
as Nielsen Investment 00.53 on the basis of an injunction entered
against the registrant prohibiting him from further net capital and
bookkeeping violations as well as from selling unregistered securities
and engaging in business while insolvent. The broker-dealer registration of Michael Raymond 00., Ina.54 was revoked following a
New York State injunction restraining it from further engaging in
security transactions while insolvent, making fraudulent representations and defrauding customers.
During the year, the broker-dealer registrations of William Mal.oolm. Ellsworth,55 Elmer Allen Haley, doing business as Elmer A.
Haley,56 Maxwell M. Sacks, doing business as Maxwell Brokerage
:00.,51 and Tasch &: 00., Ina.56 were revoked for failure to file the
annual reports of financial condition required by rule 17a-5.
:Net Capital Rule

Rule 15c3-1 adopted under section 15 (c) (3) of the Securities Ex'Change Act, commonly known as the net capital ru1e, provides safeguards for funds and securities of customers dealing with brokerdealers. This rule restricts the amount of indebtedness which may be
incurred by a broker-dealer in relation to his capital. Under the
ru1e, no broker-dealer subject thereto may permit his "aggregate
indebtedness" to exceed 20 times his "net capital" as those terms
are defined in the ru1e.
Prompt action is taken by the Commission whenever it appears
that any broker-dealer fails to meet the capital requirements prescribed by the rule. Unless the broker-dealer takes necessary steps
forthwith to correct any capital deficiency found to exist either by
inspection or by reports filed with the Commission, injunctive action
may be taken and proceedings instituted to determine whether or not
the broker-dealer registration should be revoked. During the fiscal
year, violations of the net capital ru1e were alleged in injunctive actions
filed against 15 broker-dealers and in revocation proceedings
instituted against 12.

made to determine whether he has adequate net capital to be in compliance with the rule. Acceleration of effectiveness of registration
statements under the Securities Act is not permitted if it appears
that any underwriter would as a result of his commitment be in violation of the net capital rule. In a number of instances during the
past year, broker-dealers who were named as underwriters appeared
to be inadequately capitalized to take down their commitments in
conformity with the rule. The broker-dealers were informed of the
situation and the effect it would have on a pending registration statement, and they thereupon obtained sufficient capital so that full compliance with the rule could be had, reduced their commitments to
the extent to which they could be undertaken without violating the
rule or withdrew entirely as underwriters.
Financial Statements

During the year the Commission adopted an amendment to rule
17a-5 -
under the Securities Exchange Act requiring brokers and
dealers to :filereports of financial condition. The amendment became
effective on November 15, 1957 and was deemed necessary (1) to
eliminate administrative difficulties which arose from the requirement
that a report be :filledwithin each calendar year, but that reports for
two consecutive years could not be :filed within less than 4 months
of each other and (2) to provide more protection to customers by requiring that more reports be certified. As amended, the rule now
requires a report to be :filedas follows: (A) as of a date within each
calendar year, except that the first report (other than in the case
of successors) must be as of a date not less than one, nor more than
five months after the broker or dealer becomes subject to the rule,
and a broker or dealer who succeeds to and continues the business
of a predecessor is not required to :filea report if the predecessor has
filed one as of that year; (B) reports may not be as of dates within
four months of each other; and (0) a report must be :filednot more
than 45 days after the date of the report.
Under the amended rule, every report must be certified by a certified
public accountant or a public accountant who is in fact independent
except a report filed by (1) a member of a national securities exchange
who, from the date of his previous report, has not transacted business
in securities directly with or for others than members, has not carried
any margin account, credit balance or security for any person other
than a general partner and has not been required to :filea certified
financial statement with any national securities exchange; (2) a broker
who, from the date of his previous report, has limited his securities
business to soliciting subscriptions as an agent for issuers, has transmitted funds and securities promptly and has not otherwise held

92

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

funds or securities for or owed monies or securities to customers; and
(3) a broker or dealer who, from the date of his last report, has limited
his securities business to buying and selling evidences of indebtedness
secured by liens on real estate and has not carried margin accounts,
credit balances or securities for securities customers.
The reports of financial condition filed under rule 17ar-5 serve to
inform the Commission and the public as to the financial responsibility of broker-dealers and they are analyzed by the staff to determine whether the registrant is in compliance with the Commission's
net capital rule. Revocation proceedings are brought against registrants who fail to make the necessary filing. During the year 4,473
reports of financial condition were filed, representing an increase of
145 over fiscal 1957.
Broker-Dealer

Inspections

During 1958, the Commission continued to place increased emphasis
upon its inspection program.
Regular and periodic inspections of
registered broker-dealers as provided for in section 17 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act are a vital part of the Commission's activities
for the protection of investors. The purpose of these inspections is to
assure compliance by broker-dealers with the Federal securities acts
and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission and to
detect and prevent violations.
An inspe-tion ordinarily includes, among other things, (1) a determinatioi of the financial condition of the broker-dealer;
(2) review of pr ,ing practices; (3) review of the treatment of customers'
funds and ecurities ; and (4) a determination whether adequate disclosures a
made to customers. The inspectors also determine
whether tL required books and records of the broker-dealers are
adequate r ' 1 currently maintained, and whether broker-dealers are
conformir ~
 with the margin and other requirements of Regulation
T, as prescribed by the Federal Reserve Board. They also check for
excessive trading in customers' accounts involving "churning" and
"switching," sale of unregistered securities, use of improper sales
literature or sales methods and other fraudulent practices.
Inspections frequently discover situations which, if not corrected, might
result in losses to customers.
The policy inaugurated in fiscal year 1956 of increasing the number
of inspections was continued in fiscal year 1958. Inspections completed during the year numbered 1,452, an increase of more than 19%
over the previous year.
While an inspection may disclose violations of the Commission's
statutes or rules, formal action is not taken against every broker-

TWENTY-FOURTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

93

dealer found to be in violation. In determining whether to institute
action against a broker-dealer found as a result of an inspection to
be in violation, consideration is given to the nature of the violation
and to the effect it has upon members of the public. Inspections usually reveal a number of inadvertent violations which are discovered
before they 'becomeserious and before they jeopardize the rights of
customers. In such situations, where no harm has come to the public,
the matter is usually called to the attention of the registrant and arrangements made to correct the improper practices. Where, however,
the violation appears to be willful and the public interest or the protection of investors is best served by instituting proceedings against
the broker-dealer, such action is promptly taken.
The following table shows the various types of violations disclosed
as a result of the inspection program during the fiscal year 1958:

In addition to the Commission's inspection program, the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and the principal stock exchanges also conduct inspections of their members and some of the
States also have inspection programs. Each inspecting agency conducts inspections in accordance with its own procedures and with
particular reference to its own regulations and jurisdiction. Consequently, inspections by other agencies are not an adequate substitute
for Commission inspections since the inspector will not be primarily
concerned with the detection and prevention of violations of the
Federal securities laws and the Commission's regulations thereunder.
The Commission and certain other inspecting agencies, however, maintain a program of coordinating inspection activities for the purpose
of avoiding unnecessary duplication of inspections and to obtain the
widest possible coverage of 'brokers and dealers. This seems appropriate in view of the limited number of inspections which it is possible for the Commission to make. The program does not prevent
the Commission from inspecting any person recently inspected by
another agency, and such an inspection by the Commission is made
whenever reason therefor exists, but it has been necessary because of
budget limitations for the Commission to rely to a considerable extent

94

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

upon the inspection programs of the major exchanges, such as the
New York Stock Exchange.
Inspecting agencies now participating in the coordination program
include the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Boston Stock Exchange, the Midwest Stock Exchange, the
Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia-Baltimore
Stock Exchange, the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange and the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc.
SUPERVISION OF ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
SECURITIES DEALERS, INC.

Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("the Maloney
Act") provides for registration with the Commission of national securities associations. The statute requires that the ru1es of such associations must be designed, among other things, to promote just and
equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipu1ative
acts and practices and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market. Such associations serve as a medium for the cooperative selfregu1ation of over-the-counter brokers and dealers. They operate
under the general supervision of this Commission, which is authorized
to review disciplinary actions and decisions which affect the membership of members or applicants for membership and to consider all
changes in the rules of associations. The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) is the only association registered with
the Commission under the Act.
In adopting legislation to authorize the formation and registration
of such associations, Congress provided an incentive to membership
by permitting such associations to adopt, and the NASD has adopted,
ru1es which preclude a member from dealing with a non-member, except on the same terms and conditions as the member affords the general public. As a consequence, membership is necessary to the profitable participation in underwritings and over-the-counter trading in
general and for price concessions. Discounts and similar allowances
may properly be granted by members only to other members.
On June 30, 1958, there were 3,820 NASD members, a decrease of 36
during the year as a resu1t of 419 admissions to and 455 terminations
of membership. There were also registered with the NASD as registered representatives on that same date, 65,314 individuals, including
all partners, officers, traders, salesmen and other persons employed by
or affiliated with member firms in a capacity which involve their doing
business directly with the public. The number of registered representatives increased by 8,211 during the year as a result of 15,278 initial
registrations, 7,246 re-registrations and 14,313 terminations of registrations.

TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

DisciplinarT Actions

The Commission receives from the NASD summaries of decisions on
all disciplinary actions against members and registered representatives
of members. Each such decision is reviewed by the Commission's staff
to determine whether the underlying facts indicate conduct violative
of the statutes administered by the Commission or the rules adopted
thereunder. This consideration often includes an examination of the
Association's files on particular cases. Where the facts appear to
indicate actionable violations of the Commission's rules or statutes,
independent Commission enforcement inquiry or action is initiated
through the appropriate Regional Office.
During the fiscal year the Association reported to the Commission
final action on 116formal complaint cases. Each such action involved
charges that a member firm had violated specified rules of fair practice.
In addition, however, 48 of these complaints included charges that 75
different registered representatives had also violated one or more such
rules.
Of the 116 complaints on which final Association action was taken,
10 were withdrawn or dismissed on findings that the allegations in the
complaints had not been sustained. In the remaining cases, one or
more violations were found as alleged in the complaint and the members and registered representatives found to have committed the violations were subjected to penalty. The penalties imposed covered a
wide range of available sanctions and in many cases more than a single
penalty was imposed on a firm or registered representative. Thus, 32
firms were expelled and six were suspended for periods ranging from
30 days to 3 years; 48 firms were fined amounts ranging from $50 to
$8,240 and aggregating $28,765; and 13 were censured. Moreover,
the registrations of 37 registered representatives were revoked;
one representative was suspended for six months; nine representatives
were fined sums ranging from $50 to $5,000 and aggregating $9,400;
and 16 representatives were censured. In 56 of the complaints, costs
were assessed in amounts aggregating $16,349.61during the year.
In addition to disciplinary action by formal complaint procedure as
described above, action was also taken against members pursuant to
a minor violation procedure as specified in the NASD Code of Procedure and as described in the last annual report. Under this procedure, in a disciplinary action where the facts are not disputed and
the matter involves only minor or technical violations of the rules and
no significant damage to customers, other parties or the public interest, the member may waive a hearing and accept a penalty not to exceed censure and a fine of $100. The respondent is not required to
accept this procedure and may elect to have a hearing as in the case of
a complaint involving more serious violations.

96

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In all, reports were received from the Association descriptive of 47
cases handled by the minor violation procedure. One case was subsequently remanded by the Board of Governors to the District Business Conduct Committee of initial jurisdiction for consideration pursuant to the ordinary complaint procedure. The remaining 46 cases
resulted in censure in 29 instances, fines in 2 instances, and censure
and fines in 15 instances. The fines ranged from $25 to $100 and
aggregated $1,175.
Commission Review of NASD Disciplinary

Action

Section 15A (g) of the Act provides that disciplinary actions of the
NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its own motion or
on the timely application of any aggrieved party. The effectiveness
of any penalty imposed by the Association is automatically stayed
pending determination of any matter before the Commission on review. At the beginning of the fiscal year, three such review cases were
pending before the Commission, and during the year three other applications for review were filed. One such application, filed by G.
Wayne Gibbs, doing business as Gibbs & Company, was withdrawn
prior to determination.
Another application, filed by Daniel M.
Sheehan, Jr., doing business as Sheehan & Company, was considered
unacceptable by the Commission as it had not been filed within sixty
days of the date the action was taken and because there were then
pending against the firm administrative proceedings under section
15 (b) of the Act to determine whether the Commission should find it
in the public interest to revoke the firm's registration as a brokerdealer. In rejecting this application the Commission advised the firm
that it would reconsider accepting the case for review after completion of the section 15 (b) proceedings should the firm then decide
to file a new petition. Two review cases were decided by the Commission during the year and two were pending at the end of the fiscal
year.59
The Commission set aside disciplinary action taken by the Board of
Governors of the Association against Samuel B. Franklin & Co. for
alleged violation of the NASD rule of fair practice that requires a
member to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and
equitable principles of trade in the conduct of his business." The
case was an outgrowth of a dispute between Franklin & Co. and
Pledger & Co., Inc., the complainant, and involved a transaction in
stock of Western Oil Fields sold by Franklin & Co. to Pledger & Co.,
'"'The pending cases concerned applications filed by Batkin & Co. (File 16-1A67) and
Churchill Securities Corp. (File 16-1A71).
The Batkin appeal was dismissed as moot
shortly after the close of the fiscal year. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 5763 (August

Inc. at $2.70 per share. After delivery and payment, Pledger returned the shares on the grounds that the shares delivered were certificates which had been the subject of a 1 for 4 reverse stock split.
Pledger refused to cancel the original transaction since the price of
the stock had advanced to 318 per share. Franklin suggested the
purchase of new shares and agreed to pay the attendant loss of about
$225, but Pledger advised against such a purchase at that time since
it believed the price would go down. However, the price of the stock
continued to advance. Pledger subsequently bought the stock in at
4% and requested that Franklin make good an asserted loss to
Pledger of $1,282.50. Pledger first accepted the suggestion of Franklin that the matter be arbitrated, but then withdrew its consent and
filed a complaint before the NASD.
The Board of Governors affirmed a decision of the District Business Conduct Committee that
Franklin had violated the NASD rule by failing to make a good
delivery of the stock and failing to reimburse the buyer for damages. The Board of Governors censured Franklin, assessed costs in
the amount of $441.22 and directed the firm to make good the loss
sustained by Pledger.
In its opinion the Commission observed that it was not its function,
nor that of the NASD, in applying the rule, to decide private contract rights between the parties, and that "not every failure to perform a contract violates the NASD rule; it must appear that such
failure was unethical or dishonorable."
The Commission concluded
that the facts here present did not justify a finding that Franklin
had violated the NASD rule. In support of this conclusion, it
pointed out that there was no evidence of an intention to mislead
Pledger or that the delivery of the old certificates was anything but
an unintentional error. Nor could the Commission find that Franklin sought to evade responsibility arising from the delivery of the
old certificates, as evidenced by its immediate acceptance of the return
of the old certificates and its refund to Pledger of the purchase price,
its prompt offer to buy in shares of the new stock and accept the $225
loss resulting from the increase in the market price thereof, its
reliance on Pledger's advice in not making delivery of new stock at
that time, and its offer to submit to arbitration after Pledger had
bought in new stock at a much higher price some six months after
the return of the old certificates. The Commission noted that its
action reversing the NASD action was in no way a determination
regarding the validity or the amount of Pledger's claim against
Franklin.
In the other decided case, the Commission affirmed a six-month
suspension, $3,000 fine and censure imposed by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., upon Graham & Co., of Pittsburgh,

Pennsylvania, and the censure of E. W. Sterling Graham, its only
active partner, for violation of NASD rules requiring the maintenance of high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable
principles of trade."
The NASD's disciplinary action was based largely upon sales of
securities of Texas Adams Oil Co. by Graham & Co. to its customers
at a price which was "unfair and not reasonably related to the current
market price." The Commission also sustained the additional rulings
of the NASD that Graham & Co. have violated its rules (1) by failure
to register salesmen employed at its Birmingham, Alabama branch
officein 1955, (2) by failure to disclose, in the sale of Bassett Press &
Mailing Co. stock, that that company and Graham & Co. were under
common control and (3) by failure to endorse the records of salesmen's
transactions to show approval of such transactions.
Commission Review of NASD Action on Membership

Section 15A (b) of the Act provides that, except where the Commission finds it appropriate in the public interest to approve or direct
to the contrary, no broker or dealer may be admitted to or continued
in Association membership if he, or any controlling or controlled
person, is under any of the several disabilities specified in the statute.
The disqualifications included in the statute are repeated in the Association's by-laws which, however, also include other disqualifications
permitted by, but not explicitly set out in, the statute. Among other
things, the statutory disabilities include an outstanding order of revocation by the Commission of a broker-dealer registration and the Association's by-laws include conviction within the preceding 10 years of
a felony found by the Association to have involved abuse or misuse
of a fiduciary relationship.
A Commission order approving or directing admission to or continuance in Association membership, notwithstanding a disqualification under section 15A (b) (4) of the Act or under an effective
Association rule adopted under that section or section 15A (b) (3),
is generally entered only after the matter has been submitted by the
member of, or applicant for membership to, the Association. Where,
after consideration, the Association is favorably inclined, it ordinarily
files with the Commission an application on behalf of the petitioner.
A broker-dealer refused Association sponsorship, however, may file
an application directly with the Commission. The Commission carefully reviews the record and documents filed in support of the application and, if considered necessary, obtains additional evidence bearing
on the matter. At the beginning of the fiscal year, three such petitions
were pending before the Commission; during the year one
filed

and three were disposed of; and one was pending at the year end.
The Commission approved an application filed by the NASD permitting the continuance of Clayton Securities Corporation in Association membership with Harold S. Goldberg as an employee and
registered representative."
Goldberg had been convicted on May 3,
1955, following a plea of guilty, of violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the mail fraud statute based
on failure adequately to supervise the activities of salesmen who had
induced excessive trading in the accounts of customers to obtain excessive commissions. In granting the approval requested by the Association, the Commission recognized that none of the charges concerned
Goldberg's own dealings with customers, that he would not be employed in a supervisory capacity and that he would be subject to
close supervision by officers of the employing firm.
The Commission also approved applications sponsored by the
NASD for the continuation in the Association membership of two
firms each with a revoked person employed as a registered representative. In approving the employment of Leonard H. Whitaker by
an NASD member firm, the Commission stated: "While the misconduct which led to revocation of Whitaker's registration was serious
in nature, we do not think it should constitute a permanent bar from
the securities business. Upon the basis of our review of the entire
record and giving due consideration to the lapse of time since the
revocation, the close supervision to be exercised over him, and the
-
 favorable recommendation of the NASD, we conclude that we may
approve the application of the NASD in the public interest provided
that Whitaker is bonded so as to afford additional investor protection
against possible loss as a result of any misconduct by him." 63
In granting similar approval for the employment of David Gordon,
the Commission observed that Gordon's conduct resulting in the
revocation and expulsion of Gordon & Company did not involve his
conduct as a salesman but his activities in directing the affairs of
his firm, and that in his employment as a salesman of the member
firm he will be under close supervision, including supervision of the
type of security he sells, that he will not have custody of funds or
securities of customers and that he will be bonded."

engaging in conduct which violates the provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Some of the actions brought as a result of
such violations also alleged violations of other statutes administered
by the Commission.
Anti.Fraud Litigation

In discharging its responsibility to protect the investing public
by preventing frauds by broker-dealers, the Commission, during the
fiscal year, obtained injunctions in S. E. O. v. T. G. Anderson, Ine.,e:;
S. E. O. v, J. Arthur Warner & 00., Inc., et al.6fl and S. E. O. v, Louis
E. W olfson:" In the Anderson case the complaint alleged, among
other things, that the defendants induced customers, by false representations and omissions of material facts, to sell securities of one mining
company and buy securities of another, and at the same time induced
other customers to effect contra transactions in the same securities.
In the Warner case, an injunction was obtained against violations
of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act, as well
as violations of numerous other sections of that Act and various provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. Its dominant aspect was the
overtrading or "churning" of customers' accounts. The criminal
prosecution arising out of the transactions is described in detail at
page 109 of the 21st Annual Report.
In the Wolfson case, a temporary restraining order was obtained to
enjoin further violation of the anti-fraud and anti-manipulative provisions of the Securities Exchange Act in the purchase and sale of
common capital stock of American Motors Corporation, listed
on the New York Stock Exchange. The Commission's complaint
alleged that Louis E. Wolfson and other persons whose identities
are unknown to the Commission, engaged in acts, practices
and courses of business which operated and would operate as a fraud
and deceit upon the public. The complaint and underlying affidavits
allege and state, among other things, that Wolfson had sold over
200,000 shares of American Motors stock at a time when an article
in a widely circulated financial newspaper quoted him to the effect
that he and his associates owned about 460,000 shares of that stock
and were "perfectly satisfied" with the company's progress. Wolfson
and his agents were also alleged to have later caused a statement to be
published, in a widely circulated newspaper, to the effect that the stock
of American Motors looked fully priced on the basis of the immediate
outlook and that he (Wolfson) was "about one-quarter of the way

home" in disposing of the 400,000 shares of American Motors stock
that he and his immediate family owned, and that the remaining shares
would be disposed of probably in the open market and "should be
cleaned up completely well before the end of the summer." The complaint further charged that in connection with the last mentioned statement Wolfson omitted to disclose that he had sold or otherwise disposed of all of his holdings in American Motors, and that he, together
with his associates, had a very substantial short position in the stock
and was, at the time of the publication of the newspaper article, engaged in purchasing stock of American Motors to cover the short position. The complaint also charged that the anti-manipulative
provision of the Act was violated in that the statements made were false
and misleading and Wolfson knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that such statements were false and misleading.
Cases Involving the Net Capital Rule

As indicated earlier, section 15 (c) (3) of the Securities Exchange
Act and rule 15c3-1 thereunder are designed to provide protection
against loss of customers' securities and monies by reason of financial
difficulties broker-dealers
may encounter by requiring registered
broker-dealers to maintain a prescribed ratio between net capital and
aggregate indebtedness.
In numerous cases the Commission resorts to injunctive relief when
broker-dealers are conducting their business in violation of this financial requirement. During the fiscal year injunctions were sought by
the Commission to enjoin broker-dealers from further violations of
this net capital rule in S. E. O. v. J. D. Oreqer and 00./68 S. E. O. v.

Delisting Cases

In Great Sweet Grass Oils, Ltd. v. S. E. 0.87 the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, in a per curiam opinion, affirmed
an order of the Commission withdrawing the registration on the
American Stock Exchange of the capital stock of the petitioner,
Great Sweet Grass Oils, Ltd. The Commission "delisted" the securities under section 19 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
because it found that petitioner had made false and misleading statements in reports required to be filed pursuant to section 13 of that
Act. The Commission found the reports to be deficient inter alia
in that they overstated oil and gas reserves, falsely claimed exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 in
purported reliance upon rule 133 and failed to indicate contingent
liabilities resulting from the sales of unregistered securities. Petitioner contended unsuccessfully that the Commission had abused its
discretion in delisting the securities without setting forth conditions
upon which listing could be regained, and had erred in holding that

Litigation Involving Broker-Dealer

Registration

and Reporting Requirements

In Peoples Securities Oompany v, Gadsby, et al.,s9 the plaintiff
sought a preliminary and permanent injunction restraining the members of the Commission from conducting a hearing to determine
whether Peoples' application for registration as a broker-dealer should
be denied or permitted to becomeeffective, and a permanent injunction
requiring the defendants to enter an order cancelling Peoples' application for registration on the ground that it has ceased to do business.
Upon denial of the preliminary injunction, plaintiff applied to the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for an injunction pending appeal, which application was denied." The complaint
was ultimately dismissed on defendant's motion, the District Court
finding that it had no jurisdiction.
A petition for review of the Commission's order revoking petitioner's registration as a broker-dealer was filed in M. J. Shuck 00. v.
S. E. 0.,91 claiming that the Commission erred in finding that petitioner's violations of the net capital rule were wilfull and that the
Commission failed to comply with the requirements of section 9 (b)
of the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was argued before
the Court of Appeals and that Court affirmed the Commission's decision on December 4, 1958.
Section 17 (a), and Rule 17a-3 adopted thereunder, require the keeping of books and records by registered broker-dealers and others.

Proxy Litigation

The Commission intervened as a plaintiff in Barker v, McPhail,96
and filed a complaint against the defendants McPhail and certain
other officers and directors of Transue & Williams Steel Forging
Corporation.
The Commission's complaint alleged in essence that
defendants in violation of the proxy rules engaged in the solicitation
of proxies without having previously or concurrently furnished the
stockholders with a proxy statement, without having filed prior
thereto certain information with respect to the identity, background
and interest of the participants in the solicitation and without identifying on the forms of proxies the persons on whose behalf they were
to be used. Further, the complaint charged that McPhail in violation
of the proxy rules had sent out soliciting material without having
.first filed preliminary copies with the Commission and that such material contained false and misleading statements and omissions. The
Court granted a temporary restraining order, to which the parties
consented, enjoining the defendants from voting proxies already obtained and directing that the stockholders' meeting be adjourned, to
give opportunity for a proper resolicitation to be made, including
material correcting misrepresentations in previous soliciting material.
At the adjourned meeting McPhail and other management nominees
were elected directors over the slate of Harold O. Barker, President
and Chairman of the Board, and the Stockholders' Committee Against
Control of Transue & Williams Steel Forging Corporation by Russell
McPhail.
Subsequent to the end of the .fiscalyear a motion for summary judgment was filed by the Commission requesting that defendants be
permanently enjoined from further violations of the proxy rules.
Argument was had and the Court has not as of December 1st rendered
an opinion.
In Hott et al. v, Ostergren et al.91 an appeal was taken from the
judgment of the District Court enjoining appellants and one Josiah
Kirby from soliciting and voting proxies with respect to the common
stock of Lakey Foundry Corporation."
The District Court had
found, inter alia, that Kirby was a "participant" in the solicitation
by the defendants, whose proxy statement had not included the required information with respect to Kirby, and that Kirby had not
.filed with the Commission the information required by Schedule 14B.
The appeal from the District Court's judgment was subsequently dismissed upon stipulation of the parties, the Commission agreeing to
the dismissal since the injunction issued by the District Court remained in full effect.

InS. E. O. v. Sidney Gondelmam, et aL,99 the Commission took action
to enjoin Gondelman and other shareholders of the Central Foundry
Company from voting proxies at the annual meeting of shareholders
of the Corporation unless they furnished the shareholders an opportunity to revoke their proxies after furnishing information needed
to correct misstatements which had been made in previous proxy soliciting material. The Commission's complaint alleged that the defendants had made misrepresentations about the status of efforts by
Gondelman, a disbarred lawyer, to obtain reinstatement to the New
York Bar. The Commission's action was joined, for purposes of trial,
with a suit brought by the Management of the Central Foundry Company alleging several violations of the proxy rules and requesting the
complete invalidation of all proxies obtained by Gondelman prior to
the suit. Since the close of the fiscal year, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York held that the defendant
stockholders had violated the proxy rules and invalidated the proxies
which -they had obtained. The Court also ordered the correction of
misleading statements.

similar plans from the provisions of section 16 (b) allowing recovery
by the issuer of profits realized by officers, directors and controlling
persons in transactions in the securities of the issuer. The Commission
promptly moved for leave to file a brief amious curiae and for a clarification of the opinion and a rehearing. In a per curiam decision, one of
the three judges dissenting, the Court denied the petition for rehearing, stating that". . •

PART VI

ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBUC UTIUTY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935
The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935provides for the
regulation by the Commission of interstate public-utility holding
company systems engaged in the electric utility business or in the
retail distribution of gas. The matters dealt with embrace intricate
and complex questions of law and fact, and generally involve one or
more of three major areas of regulation. The :first embraces those
provisions of the Act, contained principally in Section 11 (b) (1),
which require the physical integration of public-utility companies
and functionally related properties of holding company systems, and
those provisions, contained principally in Section 11 (b) (2), which
require the simplification of intercorporate relationships and :financial structures of holding company systems. The second area of regulation covers the :financing operations of registered holding companies and their subsidiaries, the acquisition and disposition of securities and properties, and certain accounting practices, servicing arrangements and intercompany transactions. The third area of regulation includes the exemptive provisions of the Act, the provisions
covering the status under the Act of persons and companies, and those
regulating the right of a person affiliated with a public-utility company to acquire securities resulting in a second such affiliation.
The staff functions under the Act are performed in the Branch of
Public Utility Regulation of the Division of Corporate Regulation.
COMPOSITION OF REGISTERED HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMSSUMMARY OF CHANGES

On June 30, 1958, there were 22 registered holding company systems subject to the regulatory provisions of the Act. Of these 22,
four systems, namely, (1) Central Public Utility Corporation, (2)
Cities Service Company, (3) Electric Bond and Share Co., and (4)
Standard Shares, Inc., do not own as much as 10 percent of the voting
securities of any public-utility company operating within the United
States. The remaining 18 systems are referred to herein as "active
registered systems."
Included in the 18 active registered systems there were 19 registered
holding companies of which 13 function solely as holding companies
and 6 function as operating companies as well as holding companies,"
Inaddition, in these systems there are 100 electric and gas utility sub1In one ot these systems there are two companies each ot which is a registered holding

In the active systems four new corporations were organized during
the fiscal year of which one was a gas utility company and three
were non-utility companies. In addition, two going concerns were
acquired one of which was an electric utility company and one of
which was a non-utility company. One non-utility subsidiary was
dissolved and two electric 'Utility companies were merged. These
changes resulted in a net increase of three in the total number of companies comprising the active systems. While there were net decreases
during fiscal 1956 and 1957 of 32 and 11, respectively, in the number
of companies comprising the active systems, certain systems are
carrying out realignment programs and it is too early to state whether
a leveling off has occurred tin the total number of companies subject
to regulation under the Act.
While most of the Section 11 problems existing at the time of the
passage of the Act have been resolved, there still remain a number of
issues which have not as yet been determined. Examples are: In
its order under Section 11 (b) (1) with respect to The Columbia
Gas System, Inc., the Commission reserved jurisdiction concerning
the retainability tin the system of the properties of ten companies
(subsequently reduced to six) and in this connection there is a proceeding pending before the Commission which is discussed at
page 114 of this Report. In addition, this registered holding
company has an overall plan for the realignment of its properties
which likewise is discussed at page 114. There is a problem under
Section 11 (b) (1) of the Act with respect to Consolidated Natural
Gas Co. relating principally to the retainability of non-utility pipe
line properties. With respect to Delaware Power & Dight Co. there
exists the question of whether the gas and electric facilities are
retainable under common control. The Commission, by order dated
April 14, 1950,directed the disposition of the gas properties of Blackstone Va:11eyGas & Electric Co., a subsidiary of Eastern Utilities
Associates,
This system has pending before the Commission an
application-deelaeation covening several transactions designed to accomplish the disposition of the gas properties required to be divested.
That matter is discussed at page 114 of this Report. National Fuel
Gas Co. system has oil, real estate, and gas transmission businesses, the
retention of which has not been determined. With respect to New
England Electric System there is pending before the Commission a
proceeding under Section 11 (b) (1) of the Act to determine whether
the gas properties of the subsidiary companies are retainable. That
proceeding is discussed at page 116 of this report. In its application
pursuant to Section 3 (a) (2) of the Act requesting an exemption
from wll of the provisions of the Act, Union Electric Co. also requested that the Commission release jurisdiction previously reserved

by the Commission over the retainability of the gas properties owned
by system companies. There is also a problem under Section 11 (b)
(1) of the Act whether Utah Power & Light Co. may retain its subsidiary, The Western Colorado Power Co. Those problems have not
as yet been resolved.
The maximum number of companies subject to the Act as components of registered holding company systems at anyone point of
time was 1,620 in 1938. Since that time additional systems have
registered and certain systems have organized or acquired additional
subsidiaries, with the result that 2,385 companies have been subject
to the Act as registered holding companies or subsidiaries thereof
during the period from June 15, 1938, to June 30, 1958. Included
in this total were 216 holding companies (holding companies and
operating-holding companies), 1,021 electric and gas utility companies and 1,148 non-utility enterprises. From June 15, 1938 to
June 30, 1958,2,046 of these companies have been released from the
active regulatory jurisdiction of the Act or have ceased to exist as
separate corporate entities. Of this number 922 companies with
assets aggregating approximately $13 billion as at their respective
dates of divestment have been divested by their respective parents
and are no longer subject to the Act as components of registered
systems. The balance of 1,124 companies includes 776 which were
released from the regulatory jurisdiction of the Act as a result of
dissolutions, mergers and consolidations and 348 companies which
ceased to be subject to the Act as components of registered systems
as a result of exemptions granted under Sections 2 and 3 of the Act
and deregistrations pursuant to Section 5 (d) of the Act.
DEVEWPMENTS

IN INDIVIDUAL REGISTERED

SYSTEMS

There is discussed below each of the active registered systems and
the other systems in which there occurred during the fiscal year 1958
significant developments other than financing transactions. The
financing activities of registered holding companies and their subsidiaries are treated below in a separate section of this report.
A.

DEVELOPMENTS IN ACTIVE REGISTERED

SYSTEMS

American Electric Power Company

During the fiscal year American Gas and Electric Co. changed its
corporate name to American Electric Power Co. At December 31,
1957, the system had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of
some $1,283,000,000 and net dependable generating capacity of
4,585,000 Kw. The system had consolidated operating revenues of
about $283,755,000for the calendar year 1957.

TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

111

Although no significant corporate changes took place in the system
during the fiscal year, there was substantial activity with respect to
its expansion program and the financing arrangements therefor, new
developments in respect of a service agreement and the acquisition of
additional utility assets. This system is the largest holding company
system subject to the Act. Six additional generating units of
225,000 K w each or a total of 1,350,000 K ware expected to be completed during the calendar year 1958.
The system carries on research along many avenues of technology
and, during the fiscal year, continued to concentrate on nuclear research and development with a view to providing power at a cost
competitive with that of a conventional power plant. Three system
companies are members of the East Central Nuclear Group which
consists of 14 utility companies in the general Ohio Valley area.
This group is in the process of developing a program involving
research and development of a high-temperature, gas-cooled, heavy
water-moderated, pressure-tube reactor of 50,000Kw capacity. American Electric Power Co. is also a member of Nuclear Power Group,
Inc. and, as such, continues to derive technological and practical
experience from the research and design activities in Commonwealth
Edison Company's 180,000 K w boiling water reactor being installed
at Dresden, TIl.
The system's service corporation, which during the fiscal year
changed its name to American Electric Service Corp., designed and
engineered the power plants of Ohio Valley Electric Corp. American Electric owns 37.8% of the voting securities of OVEC which,
with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Indiana-Kentucky Electric Corp.,
furnishes electric power to an installation of the Atomic Energy
Commission near Portsmouth, Ohio. There is pending before the
Commission the issue of whether the acquisition of OVEC's stock
by American Electric and other sponsoring companies meets the
standards of Section 10 of the Act. This issue and the organization
and financing of OVEC and Indiana-Kentucky Electric Corp. are
discussed on page 126 of the Commission's 23rd Annual Report.
American Natnral Gas Co.

This registered holding company and its subsidiary companies, as
at December 31, 1957, had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves,.
of $689,780,000. The system had consolidated operating revenues of
$192,036,000 for the calendar year 1957. In the latter part of 1957,.
American Natural Gas Production Co. was organized as a subsidiary
of this registered holding company for the purpose of exploring for
gas and acquiring and operating gas-producing properties.

112

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In September 1957, American Natural filed a declaration requesting
permission to acquire from time to time additional shares of its 6%
non-redeemable preferred stock without regard to the limitations
imposed by Rule 42 under the Act and 'at such prices as might be
considered by the company's management to be reasonable," In November 1957, the Commission instituted a proceeding under Section
11 (b) (2) of the Act to determine whether the continued existence
of such stock in this holding company system's corporate structure
unduly and unnecessarily complicates such structure or unfairly and
inequitably distributes voting power among the security holders of
such system," The proceedings were consolidated and, in April 1958,
the Commission issued its Findings and Opinion denying effectiveness to American Natural's declaration seeking to purchase its nonredeemable preferred
stock and ordered the company to take
appropriate steps to eliminate such preferred stock from the holding
company system.' Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year American Natural filed a plan to eliminate the preferred stock by a
payment of $32.50 per share to the holders thereof. Before the plan
can be effectuated it must be found by the Commission to be fair and
equitable to all affected persons.
In June, 1958, hearings began on a declaration filed by Milwaukee
Gas Light Co. This subsidiary proposed to issue and sell promissory
notes to banks in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $15
million. After hearing, the Commission issued its Findings and
Opinion and Order permitting the Company's declaration to become
effective,"
Central and South West Corp.

This registered holding company and its subsidiaries, as at December 31, 1957, had 1,850,900 Kw of effective generating capability and
its consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, amounted to $_585,000,000. The system had total consolidated electric operating revenues of $137,300,000 for the calendar year 1957.
During the fiscal year Southwestern Gas and Electric Co., a
system subsidiary, was authorized, after hearing, to acquire, at a
cost of $36,000, shares of the preferred stock of First Arkansas Development Finance Corporation, a non-profit company organized under the laws of Arkansas for the purpose of promoting the location
of new businesses and new industries in the State of Arkansas,"

Three system subsidiaries are members of Texas Atomic Energy
Research Foundation which consists of a group of 11 electric utility
companies in Texas. The Foundation was organized early in the year
1957 for the purpose of engaging in research in the atomic energy
field as applied to the generation of electric power. These system
subsidiaries are committed to contribute a total of about $1 million,
of a combined total of $10 million, for the four-year research program
which has for its object studying heavy hydrogen or fusion reactions
at high temperature under controlled conditions. Two system subsidiaries have joined with 13 other electric utility companies in the
formation of Southwest Atomic Energy Associates which, over the
next four years, will contribute a total of $5,354,000, including about
$800,000 by the two system subsidiaries, for research and development
of an epithermal thorium power reactor undertaken by Atomics
International, a subsidiary of North American Aviation, Inc.
The CoIU!J1bia Gas System

This registered holding company and its subsidiaries, at December
31, 1957, had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of about
$8521;2million. The consolidated gross operating revenues for the
calendar year 1957 were approximately $376 million. The total sales
of gas by the system during the calendar year 1957 amounted to
646,402 million cubic feet. Of this total 268,383 million cubic feet
(41.5%) were sold at wholesale to 112 non-affiliated companies for
resale.
Since the close of the last fiscal year there has been an increase of
3 in the number of the system's operating subsidiaries. The first additional company, Columbia Hydrocarbon Corp., was incorporated in
Delaware on August 20, 1957, for the purpose of owning and operating a fractionating plant at Siloam, Ky., including a 35-mile pipeline
to transport a mixed stream of hydrocarbons from which ethane,
propane, butane and natural gasoline will be processed and marketed.
On November 27,1957, the Commission granted the company's application to sell its stock and promissory notes to its parent and
authorized the parent to acquire such seourities,"
The second company, Columbia Gulf Transmission Co., was incorporated on May 28, 1958, for the purpose of acquiring substantially
all of the assets of Gulf Interstate Gas Co. which until recently was a
non-affiliated company owning and operating a pipeline which transports gas purchased and used by system companies. Columbia has
entered into an agreement for the acquisition by Transmission Company of the assets of Gulf Interstate in exchange for shares of common

liabilities of Gulf. In June, 1958, the Commission authorized Columbia to acquire shares of preferred and common stock of Gulf Interstate," There was pending at the close of the fiscal year an application
of Transmission Company to acquire the assets of Gulf Interstate.
The third new operating subsidiary is The Ohio Valley Gas Co.
which was organized on August 28,1956. In June, 1958, the Commission approved the transfer to Valley of nearly all of the assets and
properties of United Fuel Gas Co. in the State of Ohio which it uses
in connection with the retail distribution of natural gas," This proposal is part of and was in furtherance of the system's realignment
program discussed at page 109 in the 23rd Annual Report. During
the fiscal year the Commission approved another proposal whereby
United Fuel Gas Co., a subsidiary, transferred all of its retail distribution properties in Kentucky to Central Kentucky Natural Gas CO.10
This is also in furtherance of the system's realignment program.
As indicated at page 132 of the 22nd Annual Report there is pending before the Commission a motion filed by Columbia requesting the
release of jurisdiction with respect to the retainability of certain properties controlled by the system. During this fiscal year both the Division of Corporate Regulation and Columbia filed proposed findings
of fact and conclusions of law. The Division recommended that the
Commission should not, on the basis of the record so far made in the
proceeding, find the properties involved are retainable.
Columbia
submitted that the properties involved are properly a part of its integrated gas system or are reasonably incidental thereto and are retainable. The matter is pending.
Eastern Utilities Associates

question of whether the NEES system may retain all or any of its gas
properties.
In July, 1958, NEES filed a plan under section 11 (e) of the Act to
eliminate the minority interests in the common stocks of its subsidiaries
engaged solely in the electric business. Subsequent to the close of the
fiscal year, the Commission issued an order for hearing on NEES'
plan and also instituted a proceeding under section 11 (b) (2) for the
purpose of determining whether the existence of the public minority
interests in the System's electric subsidiaries constitute an unfair and
inequitable distribution of voting power. The two proceedings were
consolidated for hearing and determination."

Union Electric Co.

Union Electric Co. is a registered holding company and an operating
electric utility company. As at December 31, 1957, the consolidated
assets, less valuations reserves, of Union and its subsidiaries amounted
to $524,865,000 and their consolidated operating revenues for 1957
totaled $129,178,000.
Union owns 40 per cent of the capital stock of Electric Energy, Inc.
There is pending for decision by the Commission the question of the
retain ability by Union and the other sponsoring companies subject
to the Act of their stock interest in Electric Energy, Inc. Further
details in connection with this proceeding are discussed at page 102
of the 17th Annual Report and at page 128 of the 23rd Annual Report.
During the fiscal year Union filed a declaration and amendments
thereto pursuant to Section 12 (e) of the Act and Rules 62 and 65
thereunder, in which it proposed to solicit proxies from its preferred
and common stockholders for use at the regular annual stockholders
meeting for the year 1958. The declaration was filed pursuant to a
Commission order issued on October 25, 1957, which prohibited Union
and all other persons from soliciting proxies or other forms of authorization in connection with this meeting unless authorized by the
Commission to do SO.25 .T. Raymond Dyer, a stockholder of Union,
in response to the Commission's notice," requested a hearing thereon.
A hearing was held in March, 1958,27and thereafter the Commission
permitted Union's declaration to become effective upon the filing of
an amendment making certain changes in the company management's
solicitation material. 28 The stockholders' motion for rehearing was
denied." The stockholder has filed a petition to review the action
of the Commission in the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,
where the matter is now pending.
Dyer had similarly sought review of a Commission order under
Section 12 (e) of the Act authorizing Union Electric to solicit proxies
in connection with its 1957 annual meeting of stockholders. In that
case, Dyer v. 8. E. 0.,251 F. 2nd 512 (C. A. 8, 1958), although the
Commission and the other parties had briefed and argued the case
on the merits, the Court of Appeals on its own motion dismissed the
case as moot, since the stockholders' meeting had been held and the
proxies voted.v Dyer filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the
United States Supreme Court. In its memorandum the Commission

agreed that the case was not moot but recommended that the Supreme
Court defer action on the petition until the Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit had an opportunity to rule on Dyer's petition seeking
review of the Commission's March 21 and 25, 1958, orders permitting
Union Electric Company to solicit proxy votes for its 1958 stockholders' meeting. By order entered on April 18, 1958, the Court of
Appeals denied Dyer's request for a stay pending review of the
Commission's March 1958 orders, but granted "leave to brief and argue
the question of mootness" of the review as related to the Court's
holding with respect to the same issue in Dyer v. S. E. 0., 251 F. 2d
512.
A related lawsuit was involved in S. E. O. v, Dyer.if! In this case
the Commission brought suit on April 9, 1957, to restrain Dyer from
violating Section 12 (e) and the order of the Commission which prohibited Union Electric and all other persons from soliciting proxies
for the 1957 annual meeting of stockholders except pursuant to a
declaration which the Commission permitted to become effective. The
basis of the Commission's complaint was the mailing of a postcard
which, under the circumstances, the Commission believed constituted
soliciting material. After the 1957 meeting was held, the Commission sought a voluntary dismissal of the case, but its notice of dismissal was vacated by the court on Dyer's motion."
Utah Power & Light Co.

Utah Power & Light Co., a Maine corporation, is a registered
holding company and an electric utility company.
As of December 31, 1957, Utah Power and Western Colorado Power
Company, then its only subsidiary, had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of $213,939,205. For the year ending that date their
consolidated operating revenues amounted to $43,320,377.
On May 6, 1958 the Commission authorized Utah Power & Light
to acquire the common stock of Telluride Power Company, a neighboring non-affiliated electric utility company, by exchange of one
share of Utah common stock for eleven shares of Telluride common
stock." In addition Utah was authorized to acquire for cash the
second preferred stock of Telluride at its redemption price of $1 per
share plus accrued dividends. Telluride's net utility assets aggregated approximately $3,595,000. Utah issued 52,940 shares of its
common stock in exchange for the common stock of Telluride.

DEVELOPMENTS IN OTHER SYSTEMS

Central Public Utility Corp.

Central Public Utility Corp. ("Cenpuc") is solely a holding company and is registered as such under the Act. As indicated above,
it no longer has any public utility subsidiaries operating in the United
States. As at December 31, 1957, the consolidated assets of the
system, less valuation reserves, amounted to $25,495,211 and for
the year 1957 the system's consolidated operating revenues totaled
$10,659,854;14
By order dated June 13, 1952, the Commission directed, among
other things, that Cenpuc, under section 11 (b) (2) of the Act, take
appropriate steps to terminate the existence of its subsidiary, The
Islands Gas and Electric Co., which was found by the Commission
to serve no useful purpose." On June 1, 1955, Cenpuc filed an application requesting modification of this order and further requesting
an order of exemption pursuant to section 3 (a) (5) of the Act.
Shortly thereafter a large block (about 30 percent) of Cenpuc's capital stock was acquired by certain new investors, thereby creating
several additional tiers of holding companies in the system's structure.
This complication delayed the Commission's determination of Cenpuc's application for an exemption.
On May 2, 1957, Cenpuc filed an amendment to its application renewing its request for an exemption and stating, upon information
and belief, that N. V. Amsterdamsche Bankierskantoor V/H Mendes
Gans Co., through Burnham and Co., as agent, purchased 259,492
shares of Cenpuc's capital stock and that Burnham and Co. is the
holder of record of 431,924 shares all of which, except 1,000 shares,
are subject to commitments of sale to approximately 33 Dutch and
Belgian investors. Accordingly, a large block of Cenpuc's stock has
been or is in the process of being transferred from domestic to foreign
investors. On July 15, 1958 Cenpuc filed a further amendment to
its application.
Hearings on the amended application were commenced on September 10, 1958.36
Cities Service Co.

At the beginning of the fiscal year there was a total of 79 37 companies in this system and its only remaining public-utility subsidiary,
'" Cenpuc owns, directly and indirectly, 100 percent of the voting securities of 8 of its
subsidiaries and 92.9 percent of another, all of which are included in consolidation except

as defined by the Act, was Dominion Natural Gas Co., Ltd. During
the fiscal year Dominion sold substantially all of its assets, including
all of its utility assets, to a non-affiliate 8S and thereby completed
Cities' liquidation of its investments in public-utility companies in
compliance with the Commission's order of May 5, 1944.89
A consolidated proceeding involving an exemption application by
Cities pursuant to section 3 (a) (5) of the Act and a section 11 (b)
(2) proceeding instituted by the Commission pertaining to the existence of a publicly held 48.5 percent minority interest in Cities'
subsidiary, Arkansas Fuel Oil Corp. ("Ark Fuel"), is described at
pages 108-109 of the 23rd Annual Report.
With respect to such
consolidated proceeding, the United States Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit on July 15, 1957 affirmed the Commission's denial
of Cities' application for exemption from the Act, 247 F. 2d 646 (C. A.
2, 1957), and the Supreme Court on January 6, 1958 denied certiorari.
Thereafter the Commission, by order, directed Cities and Ark Fuel
to comply with section 11 (b) (2) of the Act by eliminating the public
minority interest in Ark Fuel, or by disposing of the 51.5 percent
stock interest held by Cities in Ark Fuel,4° Both companies and a
stockholder of Ark Fuel appealed the Commission's order to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which, on July
22,1958, affirmed the order of the Commission.w- Cities on March 28,
1958 filed an application pursuant to section 5 (d) for an order declaring it not to be a holding company."
A hearing on this application
was held on May 13, 1958, and oral argument was heard by the
Commission on June 5, 1958. However, thereafter Cities withdrew its
application requesting the section 5 (d) order and the Commission, by
order, discontinued the proceeding."
Electric Bond and Share Company

Electric Bond and Share Company, which no longer holds as much
as 5 percent of the outstanding voting securities of any domestic public utility company, has pending before the Commission an application
for exemption from all provisions of the Act except section 9 (a) (2)
thereof, pursuant to section 3 (a) (5) of the Act. In the event such
exemption is granted, it is the intention of the company to convert
its status to that of an investment company and register under the

Investment Company Act of 1940. This proceeding involves a number
of very difficult and complex issues, among which are the questions
whether Bond and Share, through its wholly-owned engineering and
consulting service company subsidiary, Ebasco Services, Incorporated,
exercises controlling influence over, or is affiliated with, certain public
utility and holding company clients of Ebasco which formerly were
controlled by Bond and Share. Further hearings are scheduled for
the purpose of developing a more complete record with respect to
these matters.
Standard Shares, Inc.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Standard Shares, Inc., formerly
known as Standard Power and Light Corp., was a registered holding
company and had outstanding only one class of stock, namely, common stock. It then owned and still owns 45.6 percent of the common
stock of Standard Gas and Electric Co., a registered holding company,
which, in turn, owns 100 percent of the common stock of Philadelphia
Co., also a registered holding company. Both of these subsidiary
registered companies are required by orders issued under section
11 (b) (2) of the Act to liquidate and dissolve 43 and each is in a position to effectuate dissolution except that there exist undetermined
questions relating to Federal income taxes for the years 1942 through
1950.
During the fiscal year Standard Shares filed an application under
section 5 (d) of the Act for an order declaring it not be a holding
company and its registration as such under the Act not be in effect.
After public hearings, the Commission, by order, on September 23,
1958, granted the application."
The order became effective upon
issuance and, thereupon, the company's registration under the Act
ceased to be in effect. Immediately after the issuance of this order,
the company completed its registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and, as an investment company, is subject to the requirements of that Act and to the Commission's jurisdiction
thereunder.

During the fiscal year 1958, registered holding companies and their
subsidiaries issued and sold to the public and to financial institutions,
pursuant to authorizations granted by the Commission under Sections
6 and 7 of the 1935 Act, 36 issues of their stock and long term debt
securities with aggregate gross sales value of $583 million. Of this
amount two issues totaling $36 million were issued for the purpose of
refunding outstanding debt securities carrying higher rates of interest. In the fiscal year 1957, registered systems issued and sold 39
issues of such securities with total gross sales value of $637 million.
All of the proceeds of these securities were used to provide new capital.

., Findings of the Commission and litigation resulting therefrom with respect to previous
fee applications by Randolph Phillips and others are described in the Twenty-third Annual
Report, page 125. On May 19, 1958, Phillips filed a petition in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware, seeking an order adjudging the Commission in civil
and criminal contempt for an alleged willful violation of the order of the District Court,
entered after remand by the Court of Appeals, which had reversed in part the order of the
District Court affirming and enforcing the Commission's order with respect to fees. The
District Court order on the remand had contained a provision directing the Commission to
modify its previous findings, opinion and order as to fees in accordance with the determination of the Court of Appeals. The Commission had not done this until May 7, 1958,
after the matter had been called to its attention by Phillips (Who had received his full
compensation as soon as the District Court's order on the remand had been entered).
In
the interim, certain portions of the Commission's opinion had been used in a proxy contest
in which Phillips was engaged respecting another company. On motion of the Commission,
Phillips' petition was dismissed by order dated September 19, 1958, the Court finding that
there was "no basis for civil contempt" nor any "showing of probable cause" warranting
criminal contempt proceedings.

The decline of $54 million, or 8.5 percent, in the volume of external financing completed by registered holding company systems
in fiscal 1958 as compared with fiscal 1957 can be attributed to two
factors. In the first place, the installment issuances of securities by
subsidiaries of registered holding companies pursuant to long term
construction loan commitments, which had figured significantly in
the totals for earlier years, were completed in 1957. These installment borrowing arrangements were authorized by the Commission
several years ago and resulted in substantial amounts of private
placements of debt securities directly with institutional investors
each year through 1957.48
Another development which contributed to the decline in volume
of registered system financing was the sharp drop in the volume of
common stock financing completed by these systems from $179 million
in the fiscal year 1957 to $41 million in 1958. This represented a
decline of 77.1% and marked the lowest level of common stock financing by registered holding company systems under the 1935 Act in 6
years. Declines also were recorded in debenture, note, and preferred
stock financing during the year. Sales of mortgage bonds increased
$113 million or 33.7% in 1958.
The decline in registered system financing in fiscal 1958 does not
reflect the impact of any divestments of non-retain able subsidiaries
by registered holding companies in recent years. No sales of long.. In the fiscal year 1957, Ohio Valley Electric Corporation issued and sold $498,669 of
notes and American Louisiana Pipe Line Company issued and sold $26 million of notes
and $20.5 million of pipeline mortgage bonds pursuant to sueh construction loan commitments. The financing plans of Ohio Valley Electric and American Louisiana PIpe Line

term securities by companies subsequently divested out of holding

In addition to passing upon the 36 issues of long term securities
totaling $583 million which were issued and sold by registered systems in the fiscal year 1958,the Commission in that year also authorized the issuance and sale of 67 issues of securities aggregating
$210million by subsidiaries of registered holding companies to their
parents. In fiscal 1957subsidiaries sold 78 issues of securities with

All other companies in the electric and gas utility industries, (exclusive of companies associated with registered holding company
systems), issued and sold $3,447 million of long-term securities to
the public and to financial institutions in the fiscal year 1958. This
represented an increase of $524 million, or 17.9%, over the totals
recorded by these companies in 1957. All but $27 million of the

The decline in the proportion of total industry permanent financing
accounted for by registered holding company systems in :fiscal 1958
reflects the decline in debenture, note, and preferred stock issues by
registered systems in contrast with the increases in sales of such
securities by all other companies in the electric and gas utility industries.
The proportionately
greater decline in common stock
financing by registered systems in fiscal 1958 were wlso a factor.
All but 2 of the 36 issues of long term securities totaling $583 million which were sold externally by registered systems in 1958 were
offered for sale at competitive bidding pursuant to the requirements
of Ru1e 50. Brockton Edison Company, a 'Public 'Utility subsidiary
of Eastern Utilities Associates, a registered holding company, issued
and sold 30,000 shares of its $100 par value cumu1ative preferred
stock by means of a negotiated underwritten public offering on December 2, 1957. Brockton had publicly invited bids for the purchase

of this issue in October, 1957. Two groups of underwriters qualified
but no bids were received. The negotiated public offering was made
pursuant to an exemption from the competitive bidding requirements of Rule 50 granted by the Commission on November 29,1957.49
The second issue not sold through competitive bidding channels
was a private sale of common stock by Yankee-Atomic Electric Company, a subsidiary of New England Power Company, which in turn
is a public utility subsidiary of New England Electric System, a
registered holding company. The balance of $1,965,000 was sold to
the remaining 10 sponsor companies, no one of which is associated
with a regulated holding company system. This salle of stock by
Yankee was automatically exempt from the competitive bidding
requirements of Rule 50 pursuant to paragraph (a) (1) thereof,
because it was a pro rata issuance of securities to existing security
holders of Yankee.
The $1,035,000 of stock sold to New England Power and to Montaup Electric is included in the 67 issues of securities totaling $210
million sold by subsidiaries to their registered holding company
parents, as described more fully at page 126 above. The balance
of $1,965,000 sold to the other 10 sponsoring public utility companies
is included in the totals of external financing by registered systems."

mortgage indenture and charter provisions to determine whether or
not there is substantial conformity with the applicable Statements of
Policy which were adopted by it in 1956.51 These Statements of
Policy represent substantially a codification of certain principles
or policies prescribed for the protective provisions of these securities

in the light of experience and comments received from interested
persons who had been invited to submit their views. During fiscal
year 1958, applications or declarations were filed by public utility
companies under the Act with respect to 27 first mortgage bond issues
aggregating $459,700,000 principal amount and two preferred stock
issues with a total par value of $9,000,000.52
Of the 27 first mortgage bond issues, 14 issues, with a total principal
amount of $236,500,000,included provisions, as set forth in the Statement of Policy, imposing additional restrictions on the distribution
of earned surplus to the common stockholders, thereby assuring the
investing bondholders of a greater degree of safety of their investment through the maintenance of an appropriate common stock equity.
In respect of the other 13 issues with a total principal amount of
$223,200,000, no additional restrictions were required since the indentures already conformed in this regard to the Statement of Policy.
The additional restrictions on earned surplus distributions were proposed by the companies themselves or were inserted as a result of informal discussions between the staff of the Commission and representatives of the issuing companies. In the interest of flexibility, the
restriction on earned surplus distributions was generally coupled with
a further provision to the effect that additional "amounts of earned
surplus could be distributed upon application of the issuer to, and
approval by, the Commission.
A further provision contained in the Statement of Policy regarding
first mortgage bonds relates to the renewal and replacement of depreciable utility property which is subject to the lien of the mortgage.
It requires, in essence, that the issuer construct additions to its property, or else deposit cash or bonds with the indenture trustee, in an
amount which on a cumulative basis will provide for the replacement
in cash or property of the dollar equivalent of the cost of the depreciable mortgaged property during its estimated useful life. The Statement of Policy provides that the requirement be expressed as a
percentage of the book cost of depreciable property, except that if
the existing indenture provision expresses the requirement on a different basis, as, for example, in terms of operating revenues, no change
will be required if the company can demonstrate that the existing
provision provides an amount at least equal to a requirement based
on the book cost of depreciable property. As in the case of earned
surplus restrictions, the Commission, in the interest of flexibility, has
permitted the issuer to insert a provision under which the issuer, upon
application to, and approval by, the Commission may modify the
percent of depreciable property requirement .
.. For a discussion of the application of the Statement of Policy to filings from the
effective date thereof to June 80, 1957, see pages 141-148 of the Twenty-Third Annual
Report.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Of the 27 issues of first mortgage bonds, the indentures of 22,
having an aggregate principal amount of $384,700,000,expressed the
renewal and replacement fund requirement as a percent of depreciable
property, while the indentures in the remaining 5 issues, having a
principal amount of $75,000,000, expressed the requirement as a
percent of revenues. The renewal and replacement fund requirements in the indentures of these latter 5 issues were not required
to be restated in terms of a percent of depreciable property since they
appeared substantially to afford no less protection to the bondholders
than would be afforded by an appropriate percentage of property
formula.
Another provision contained in both the bond and the preferred
stock Statements of Policy requires that the securities be redeemable
at the option of the issuer at any time upon reasonable notice upon
the payment of a reasonable redemption premium, if any. The intent
of this provision is to ensure that public utility companies subject to
the Act shall not be prevented, if money rates decrease materially,
from refunding their bonds or preferred stock. This is in keeping
with the intent of the Act as expressed in Section 1 (b) (5) to ensure
economies in the raising of capital. While no formula is set forth in
the Statements of Policy as to what constitutes a reasonable redemption premium, the working policy of the Commission has been that
the initial redemption price shall not exceed the initial public offering price plus the interest rate on the bonds or the dividend rate on
the preferred stock. For example, in the case of bonds, if the initial
public offering price is at 101% of principal amount and the bonds
bear a 4"%% interest rate, the initial redemption price may not exceed
105"%% of the principal amount, and the 5% point premium must
thereafter be reduced pro rata to maturity.
The Commission has continued to receive informally a number of
requests from issuing companies to relax its requirements so as to
permit bonds to be nonrefundable for a period after issuance, generally five years, or to permit the initial redemption price to be higher
than that provided by the working formula. No showing was made
that nonrefundability or a requirement to pay higher premiums on
refunding would reduce the interest cost sufficiently to warrant the
loss of future refunding flexibility. On the contrary, studies made
by the staff of the Commission, at the direction of the Commission,
indicate that there does not appear to be any especially significant,
let alone a controlling, influence of restriction on refundability upon
the interest cost, or the number of bids received at competitive bidding by the issuer or the retail marketability of the bonds. Accordingly, the Commission considers its present working policy on refundability to be justified on the basis of available data.

TWENTY-FOURTH

ANNUAL REPORT

131

In connection with this policy on refund ability, it is to be noted
that during fiscal year 1958 two public utility companies subject to
the Act refunded an aggregate of $35,000,000 principal amount of
first mortgage bonds, of which $20,000,000principal amount had been
issued during the same fiscal year and $15,000,000 had been issued
during the immediately preceding fiscal year. The refunding of the
$20,000,000 issue resulted in an annual saving in interest cost (before
deducting expenses) of 0.73%, or $146,000 per annum, while the annual interest cost saving (also before deducting expenses) from the
$15,000,000 refunding was 0.72%, or $108,000 per annum.
By reason of the great importance of the question of refundability
to investors and consumers and the general public in periods of
high interest rates, the Commission in fiscal year 1957 authorized a
member of the staff of its Division of Corporate Regulation to serve
as a member of a committee organized by the "Wharton School of
Finance and Commerce of the University of Pennsylvania, which
is conducting a broad study of redemption provisions. The study is
under the sponsorship of the Life Insurance Association of America
and is expected to be concluded during fiscal year 1959.
In the two issues of preferred stock having an aggregate par value
of $9,000,000, one, involving $3,000,000 par value, had charter provisions conforming substantially to the provisions of the Statement
of Policy; in the other, involving an issue of $6,000,000 par value,
the Commission, with the consent of the issuer, conditioned its order
permitting the issue to provide, among other things, for limitations
on dividends on junior classes of stock, on issuances of additional
shares of preferred stock, on mergers or consolidations that might
be effectuated without the consent of preferred stockholders, on the
acquisition of its outstanding preferred stock which may fall into
arrears and on the authorization or issuance of any prior preferred
stock. These conditions supplanted conditions contained in a previous order of the Commission and supplemented the company's
preferred stock charter provisions.

PART VII
PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE
REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the United States District Courts. At
the request of the judge or on the Commission's own motion, if
approved by the judge, the Commission participates in the proceedings in order to provide independent, expert assistance to the court
and investors on matters arising in such proceedings and, where the
Commission considers it appropriate, files advisory reports on reorganization plans. The role of the Commission under Chapter X
differs from that under the various statutes which it administers in
that the Commission does not initiate the proceedings or hold its own
hearings. It has no authority to determine any of the issues in a
proceeding. The facilities of its technical staff and its disinterested
recommendations are simply placed at the service of the judge and
the parties, affording them the views of disinterested experts in a
highly complex area of corporate law and finance, and the Commission pays especial attention to the interests of public security holders,
who may not otherwise be effectively represented.
Section 172 of Chapter X provides that if the scheduled indebtedness of a debtor corporation does not exceed $3 million, the judge may,
before approving any plan of reorganization, submit such plan to
the Commission for its examination and report. However, if the
indebtedness exceeds $3 million, the judge must submit the plan to
the Commission before he may approve it. The Commission has no
authority to veto or require the adoption of a plan of reorganization
and is not obligated to file a formal advisory report on a plan.
Where the Commission does file a report, copies of it, or a summary
thereof, must be sent to all security holders and creditors when they
are asked to vote on the plan.
While the Commission's advisory reports on plans of reorganizations are usually widely distributed and serve an important function,
they represent only one aspect of the Commission's activities in cases
in which it participates. As a party to a Chapter X proceeding,
the Commission is actively interested in the solution of every major
issue arising therein and has found that adequate performance of
132

TWENTY-FOURTH

ANNUAL REPORT

133

its duties requires that it undertake in most cases intensive legal
and financial studies. Even in cases where the plans are not submitted to the Commission and no report is filed, it is necessary that
the Commission consider and discuss various reorganization proposals
of interested parties while plans are being formulated, and be prepared to comment fully upon all plans that are the subject of hearings
for approval or confirmation.
In the exercise of its functions under Chapter X the Commission
has endeavored to assist the courts in achieving equitable, financially
sound, expeditious, and economical readjustments of the affairs of
corporations in financial distress. To aid in attaining these objectives the Commission has stationed lawyers, accountants, and financial
analysts in its New York, Chicago, and San Francisco regional
offices who keep in close touch with all hearings and issues in the
proceedings and with the parties and are readily available to the
courts. Supervision and review of the regional offices' Chapter X
work is the responsibility of the Division of Corporate Regulation
of the Commission, which also handles the actual trial work in cases
arising in the Atlanta and Washington, D. C., regional areas.
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

During the past fiscal year the Commission actively participated in
39 reorganization proceedings involving 58 companies (39 principal
debtor corporations and 19 subsidiaries of those debtors) .1 The stated
assets of the 58 companies involved in these proceedings totaled approximately $561,794,000 and their indebtedness totaled approximately $536,509,000. The proceedings were scattered among district
courts in 19 states. During the year the Commission entered its appearance in 9 new proceedings, which involved the rehabilitation of
companies engaged in such varied businesses as industrial loans, steel
manufacturing, horse racing, drugs, investments, oil and gas production, and breweries. Proceedings involving 4 principal debtor corporations were closed during the year. At the end of the fiscal year
the Commission was actively participating in 35 reorganization proceedings.
THE COMMISSION AS A PARTY TO PROCEEDINGS

The Commission has not considered it necessary or appropriate that
it participate in every Chapter X case. Apart from the fact that the
administrative burden of participating in everyone of the over 80
cases instituted during the fiscal year would be unsurmountable with
our present staff, many of the cases involve only trade or bank creditors
1 The appendix
contains a complete list of reorganization proceedings in which the
~ommlsslon participated as a party during the fiscal year ended June 30. 1958.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

and a few stockholders.
As a general matter, the Commission has
sought to participate principally in those proceedings in which a substantial public investor interest is involved. This is not the only criterion, however, and in some cases involving only limited public investor interest, the Commission has participated because an unfair
plan had been or was about to be proposed, the public security holders
were not adequately represented, the reorganization proceedings were
being conducted in violation of important provisions of the Act, other
facts indicated that the Commission could perform a useful service or
the judge requested the Commission to participate.
PROCEDURAL

MATIERS

Usually the Commission does not enter a case until the court has
approved the petition for reorganization.
However, developments
in a particular case may impel the Commission to move to appear as
soon as practicable, without awaiting approval of the petition. During 1958 there were a number of such cases.
An involuntary petition was filed by creditors in the United District
Court for the Southern District of California at Los Angeles for the
reorganization of the Equitable Plan Company," an industrial loan
company having approximately $10,000,000 in Thrift Certificates outstanding. The affairs of the company had previously been taken over
by the California Commissioner of Corporations and were being administered by a Conservator under the jurisdiction of the state court
pursuant to the provisions of the California Industrial Loan Company
Act. The State and the Conservator opposed the petition contending,
among other things, that the pending proceedings in the state court
provided adequate relief. The Commission filed its appearance and
urged that the District Court approve the petition because Chapter X
and the machinery available under the Bankruptcy Act provided superior facilities for the administration of the assets, a large part of
which consisted of loans and receivables owed by non-residents of
California, and because Chapter X provides superior facilities for the
evolution of a plan of reorganization.
On May 29, 1958, after extended hearings, the judge approved the petition.
Another case which required the Commission's participation prior
to approval of the petition for reorganization involved Magnolia Park,
Inc. 8 Magnolia is a race track operator which leases land upon which
its race track and improvements are located. The lease contained a
forfeiture clause which provided that upon default by Magnolia, title
to the race track and the improvements passed to the landlords.

about $35,000, the landlords attempted to evict Magnolia in the Louisiana state court suit and thus obtain possession of Magnolia's property
which had cost over $2,000,000. However, a voluntary petition for
reorganization was filed under Chapter X and the District Court
issued an order restraining the proceedings in the state court. The
landlords objected to approval of the petition and hearings were held
before a Referee in Bankruptcy acting as Special Master. The Commission participated in the hearings as the sole representative of the
substantial number of public security holders and filed a memorandum
supporting approval of the petition.
The Special Master in a report filed on January 17, 1958, recommended that the petition be disapproved because it was not filed in
good faith in that it was unreasonable to expect that a fair and feasible
plan of reorganization could be effected within the framework of the
corporation itself. The Commission filed objections to the Special
Master's report and on February 12, 1958, participated in oral argument before the judge at which time the Commission pointed out that
good faith of a petition does not require the expectation of an internal
reorganization but that a merger, consolidation or an investment of
new capital from an outside source are other acceptable forms that a
reorganization can take. The judge denied a motion by the landlords
to adopt the report of the Special Master and instead followed the
Commission's advice and approved Magnolia's petition.' An appeal
by the landlords was pending in the United States Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit at the close of the fiscal year,"
The Commission has at all times sought to be of assistance to the
disinterested trustee appointed by the district court in carrying out his
responsibilities and to make available to him the fund of experience
and information accumulated by the Commission through its participation in hundreds of cases. Throughout the proceedings the staff
consults with the trustee and his counsel as to the steps to be taken
in the reorganization, the timing of those steps and the appropriate
method of taking them. This often results in substantial savings of
time and expense to the estate. The Commission, however, has been
alert to protect against attempts at encroachments by parties or even
the trustee upon the orderly operation of the statute. Typical of the
Commission's approach is a situation which arose in the reorganization
proceedings involving General Stores Corporation."
• A similar problem existed In South Texas on and Gas Company-USDC,

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

After the reorganization trustee prepared a Section 16'7report and
transmitted it to the creditors and stockholders, the trustee received a
plan proposal from a substantial stockholder of the debtor. The major
secured creditor of the debtor, dissatisfied with the treatment which
the proposal provided, moved the district court to vacate the injunctive
provisions of the order approving the petition for reorganization in
order to allow him to sell securities pledged by General Stores under a
trust agreement as collateral to secure the debtor's obligations to him.
At about the same time questions had been raised with respect to the
secured creditor's handling of the collateral under the trust agreemerit," The Commission opposed the secured creditor's motion to vacate the injunction and the judge entered an order denying the motion
on the ground that plan proceedings were pending and the application
was premature. In addition the district court entered an order requiring that the secured creditor give the Reorganization- Trustee ten
days' notice of transactions not in the ordinary course of business
which involved substantial amounts of money and providing that
upon objection by the Reorganization Trustee the transaction would
not proceed without leave of the court.
The collateral trustee and the secured creditor appealed from both
orders. The Commission supported the district court's determinations. The Court of Appeals in a per curiam opinion affirmed, holding that " . . . the petitioner's attempt to end the reorganization by
foreclosing the lien is premature. Until the district court has had
an opportunity to evaluate these assets, it can be in no position to
judge the propriety of any contemplated plan of reorganization."
As to the order respecting the conduct of the subsidiaries' business,
the Court of Appeals held that the district court had the power to
issue the order, stating that "The court simply took qualified possession of the stock pledged in order to preserve the debtor's possible
equity in it." s
TRUSTEE'S INVESTIGATIONS

One of the primary duties of the trustee is to make a thorough
study of the debtor to assure the discovery and collection of all assets
of the estate, including claims against directors, officers, or controlling
persons who may have mismanaged the company's affairs, diverted its
funds to their own use or benefit, or been guilty of other misconduct.
A complete accounting for the stewardship of corporate affairs by the
old management is a requisite under the Bankruptcy Act and Chapter
X. The staff of the Commission participates in the trustee's investi1 The collateral

gation so that it may be fully informed as to all details of the financial
history and business practice of the debtor. The Commission views
its duty under Chapter X as requiring it to call the attention of the
trustee, or the court if necessary, to any matters which should be acted
upon. Thus, during the course of the trustee's investigation in the
reorganization proceedings involving Automatic Washer Company,"
the staff of the Commission found that there had been certain insiders
who appeared to have profited from the purchase and sale of the stock
of the debtor which was listed on the Midwest Stock Exchange.
These transactions appeared to be subject to the provisions of Section 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which provides
that under certain circumstances such profits of insiders shall inure to
the benefit of the corporation. This information was called to the attention of the trustee. Thereafter the trustee filed civil actions
against these insiders seeking recovery of more than $1,500,000.
The trustee in the Automatic Washer proceedings in the District
Court for the District of Iowa after his investigation reported that
those who had been in control prior to his appointment had mismanaged the debtor. Many of those persons subject to the charge of mismanagement were also stockholders of the debtor. In view of these
facts the Commission advised the trustee that it would not be equitable if the insiders were allowed to participate in the estate on a
ratable basis with public stockholders, and that the stock of insiders
guilty of mismanagement should therefore be subordinated or disallowed. To prevent the stock of those insiders from being sold before appropriate action could be taken by the court, the Commission
filed a motion to enjoin all of these insiders from selling or transferring their stock. The court granted the motion, thus halting
transfers of approximately one half of the 2,000,000 outstanding
shares of the debtor's stock. Shortly thereafter the trustee filed a
motion to subordinate or disallow the stock of these insiders. This
motion was pending at the close of the fiscal year.
PROBLEMS

REGARDING

PROTECTIVE

COMMITTEES

The Commission has constantly been alert to insist upon the honesty of fiduciaries in their relationship to the estate and to investors,
and has always sought to disqualify security holder committees subject to a conflict of interest from acting in Chapter X proceedings.
During 1958 in the Automatic Washer Oompany proceedings the
Commission moved to disqualify a committee attempting to represent
stockholders, because the committee members were almost wholly
former insiders of the debtor who had been charged by the trustee

with mismanagement.
The court granted the motion of the
Commission.
The Commission scrutinizes material mailed out to security holders
by other security holders, their representatives and other persons, and,
where such material appears to be misleading, undertakes to obtain
curative and preventive relief. In the Stardust case 10 the Commission obtained an order to show cause why a security holder of the
debtor should not be required to distribute a communication retracting misleading statements sent out in a general communication to
stockholders. The district court required that this be done and enjoined him from sending further misleading communications.
In the Selected Investments Oorporation. proceedings," pending in
the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, the Commission brought information to the attention of the
court which indicated that two committees, both of which were in the
process of being formed, had mailed soliciting material containing
misleading information to 10,000 security holders of the debtor. The
court enjoined further solicitation of authorizations pending compliance with the provisions of Chapter X governing the formation of
committees and caused the committees to retract or clarify their previous statements. In addition, one of the committees had solicited contributions from individual security holders for representing them. The
Commission urged, the court to order that the money collected be returned and that future collections be enjoined on the ground that the
solicitation of :funds violated the spirit of committee representation
since the committee had a duty to represent all security holders and
not only those making contributions. Moreover, since the monies had
been solicited for the purpose of paying a fee to an attorney, the solicitation infringed on the reorganization court's discretion to allow reasonable compensation for services and reimbursement for costs and
expenses incurred by the committee and its attorney. The judge
ordered the committee to return the monies to the contributors.
ACTIVITIES WIm

REGARD TO AUOW ANCES

Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem
of determining the allowance of compensation to be paid out of the
debtor's estate to the various parties for services rendered and expenses incurred in the proceeding. The Commission, which under
Section 242 of the Bankruptcy Act may not receive any allowance
from the estate for the services it renders, has sought to assist the
courts in protecting reorganized companies from excessive charges and
at the same time equitably allocating compensation on the basis of the

claimants' contribution to the administration of the estate and. the
formulation of a plan.
During the fiscal year important determinations respecting the
granting or withholding of allowances were made by the District
Court for the Southern District of N ew York in the reorganization
proceedings involving Third Avenue Transit Corporation.>
During
the course of the proceedings an attorney for a committee of bondholders pledged with a bank as-collateral for a loan $25,000 of bonds
of the same class as represented by his committee, together with other
securities. Approximately eight months later when the market value
of the collateral, including the $25,000 of Third Avenue bonds, had
declined, the bank communicated with the attorney and advised that
some steps would be required to rectify the situation.
The attorney
directed his broker to sell the Third Avenue bonds. The bonds were
released from the collateral to effect the transaction and substantially
all of the proceeds of the sale were used to reduce the loan. When the
attorney applied to the court for an allowance, the Commission urged
. that the transaction constituted a sale of securities by the attorney
within the contemplation of Section 249 of the Bankruptcy Act, thus
disqualifying him from receiving a fee. It was noted that there were
other substantial securities in the collateral account which could. have
been sold in order to correct the situation without necessitating the
sale of the Third A venue bonds. The district court held that the attorney was disqualified from receiving a fee, notwithstanding the fact
that both the Commission and the court recognized that substantial
services had been rendered."
In another phase of the same proceeding it developed that the wife
of co-counsel for a committee had during the course of the proceeding sold $5,000 of Third Avenue Bonds of the same class represented
by the committee. It was cleaa- that the attorney had knowledge of
the transaction by his wife and had in fact participated in its mechanics, and benefitted thereby through the filing of a joint tax return
with his wife. The Commission advised the court that Section 249
of the Act barred compensation to an attorney where a sale of securities was made by his wife with his knowledge and to his benefit.
The Commission relied upon cases in the Court of Appeals for the
First and Fourth Circuits,"
The district court disagreed with the
Commission, feeling constrained by certain decisions of the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit which the Commission had contended
were distinguishable on their facts.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Yet another determination of significance was made in connection
with the allowances in the Third Avenue proceeding. This involved
the court's power to review arrangements for allocations of fees made
among attorney applicants. The Commission urged that the broad
powers to supervise allowances granted by the Bankruptcy Act included the power to review allocations of fees in appropriate circumstances in order to prevent an attorney from receiving excessive
or inadequate compensation. The Commission relied upon Canon 34
of the Canons of Professional Ethics, which provides in substance
that allocation of fees by attorneys shall be based on a division of
service or responsibility, and Section 62 (c) of the Bankruptcy Act
which prohibits the sharing of compensation "for ... services with
any person not contributing thereto . . . " The district court agreed.
It found that in the particular instance the parties had agreed that
their arrangement for equal division of compensation was based upon
a contemplated equal contribution of services and that it would be
subject to court approval. The court held that even in the absence
of such agreement "The broad supervisory powers accorded the court
under those provisions [Sections 241-250 of The Bankruptcy Act]
necessarily include the power to disregard the terms of attorneys'
agreements which are contrary to the terms and policy of the Act." 15
Respecting Section 62 (c) of the Bankruptcy Act the court held that
"It would be a clear evasion of the intent of this section if the court
were to sanction a fee-sharing arrangement whereby an attorney
having performed some service, received an allowance far in excess
of that to which his contribution to the estate entitled him." 16
As to still another request for compensation, the court followed the
Commission's recommendation in denying an application by a potential underwriter of an unsuccessful plan of reorganization.
The
Court expressed serious doubt as to whether the allowance provisions
of Chapter X were intended to cover as a possible applicant one
"whose interest in the debtor was solely to obtain the profits from
underwriting a plan of reorganization." 17 Even assuming that the
applicant did qualify as "a party in interest", the district court found
that there was no basis for a finding that any of the services rendered
contributed to a plan approved by the judge.
.
As for the allowances generally, the Commission had recommended
an aggregate of approximately $1,818,000. The court found that the
reorganized company could afford to and should pay allowances approximately $250,000 greater than the aggregate recommended by
the Commission. In making the individual awards, the district court

Several petitions for leave to appeal have
been filed in the United States Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit
and the matters were pending at the close of the fiscal year.19 The
Commission has taken the position that certain of these petitions
should be granted and that it would not oppose the granting of the
other petitions.
ADVISORY REPORTS ON PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

An advisory report of the Commission provides the district court
with an expert independent appraisal of a plan indicating the extent
to which, in the opinion of the Commission, the plan meets or fails
to meet the standards of fairness and feasibility. After the report is
filed, the judge considers whether the plan should be approved or disapproved. If the judge approves the plan, it is sent to the affected
security holders for acceptance or rejection accompanied by a copy
of the judge's opinion and a copy or summary of the report of the
Commission.
Since 1938 the Commission has issued 38 advisory reports and 36
supplemental advisory reports. They represent the principal means
by which the Commission has recorded its views publicly. Generally
speaking, an advisory report is prepared only in a case involving a
large public investor interest and in which significant problems exist.
However, there have been occasions where even though a case is of
significant size and importance, because of the exigencies of time or
for other reasons, no written report has been filed but instead, Commission counsel has made a detailed oral presentation of the Commission's views and the reasons therefor. Customarily, in the smaller
cases the Commission's views are presented orally by counsel.
An example of a case in which the Commission participated during
1958 where the Commission's views were presented orally instead of
by written report was the reorganization proceeding involving Star,. In commenting upon the role of the Commission in the allowance proceeding and in the
proceeding generally, the court stated:
"Though I have been forced to dl1l'er from the recommendations of the SEC in
many of the instances, I wish to pay tribute to the careful and helpful analysis that
the Commission made of the claims. Indeed, I take this opportunity to express my
gratitude for the active and intimate participation of the Commission and its counsel
in the reorganization proceedings. If any proof were needed of the wisdom of Congress in providing for representation of the pubIlc by the Securities and Exchange
Commission in reorganization proceedings, it has been furnished in this case. I
would have felt helpless without the aid given, unstintingly by . . . counsel for the
Commission. Each has cheerfully rendered, at the usual modest salary of a public
servant, services equal in value to those of any to whom awards are made by this
decision." In the Matter of Third Avenue Tran8it Corporation F. SuPP. (S. D. N. Y. 1958).

dust, Inc. in the United States District Court for Nevada. In that
case the Commission reviewed five proposed plans of reorganization
and offered comments and criticisms to the court. The Commission
contended that an essential element of feasibility in a plan of reorganization which contemplates the purchase of all the debtor's
assets or the investment of new capital in the debtor is the firm assurance that the money will be forthcoming when the plan is consummated. The Commission recommended that before any plan was approved by the judge the plans should be amended to make provision
for a substantial deposit by proponent of the plan, forfeitable if the
plan was confirmed and the new money was not paid. Only one
plan with firm provisions for the new financing was forthcoming.
It was approved by the judge and after acceptance by the creditors
and the preferred stockholders of the debtor was confirmed.
During the fiscal year the Commission submitted formal advisory
reports in two proceedings.
.A brief summary of these proceedings
follows:
Northeastern Steel Corporation-The
debtor was a non-integrated
steel producer with its plant located in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
Since it commenced operations in 1955 the company had had substantial losses. .At the time of filing a voluntary petition for reorganization in the United States District Court for the District of
Connecticut, the company's working capital was less than the amount
required by its first mortgage indenture and the company had failed
to pay the interest due on its first mortgage bonds. Operations were
continued by the trustees after their appointment in the belief that
maximum realization would come only by continued operation and
that cessation would result in a loss of the labor force and generally
in greater depreciation of the assets.
The plan of reorganization proposed by the trustees was based on an
offer by Carpenter Steel Company, a New Jersey corporation which
manufactures specialty steel products. In general, the plan provided
for the recapitalization
of Northeastern so that it would still have
outstanding $6,000,000 principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds
with defaults cured and 1,000,000 shares of new common stock. The
1,000,000 shares of stock were to be issued to Carpenter in exchange for
not less than 40,000 shares of Carpenter's own common stock, the
specific number to be determined by formula.
The Carpenter stock
was to 'be distributed, also on the basis of a formula, to a bank holding
a claim of $250,000, to holders of general unsecured claims, and to
debenture holders, in satisfaction of their claims. To the extent cash
was available after satisfaction of prior claims, it was to be used to
discharge a note held by the bank. The plan did not provide for the
participation by stockholders, warrant holders or option holders.

TWENTY-FOURTH

ANNUAL REPORT

143

The Commission's report concluded that the plan or reorganization
was unfair in that the formula for determining the allocation of the
Carpenter stock was discriminatory and the stock did not represent
fair compensation for the interest in the assets and facilities being
acquired by Carpenter."
However, the Commission considered the
exclusion of stockholders, warrant holders and option holders from
participation to be fair since the indicated value of the debtor was
less than the full claim of the creditors. The Commission's report
further concluded the plan was feasible in view of Carpenter's debtfree capitalization and working capital position. The plan was
amended to eliminate the discriminatory formula, but not to increase
the amount of Carpenter stock to be issued to the trustees. As thus
amended, the plan was approved by the court.
Inland Gas Corp., Kentucky Fuel Gas Corp., and American Fuel
& Power Co.21-Inland Gas Corporation, which was in equity receivership from 1930 to 1935 and has been in reorganization under Section
77B and Chapter X since 1935, produces, transmits, and sells natural
gas principally to industrial customers in Kentucky.
The plan of reorganization proposed by the Trustees of Inland
Gas Corporation and its non-operating parents, Kentucky Fuel Gas
Corporation and American Fuel & Power Company, provided for payment in cash of all priority and administrative claims and of the
claims to principal and full interest of public creditors of American
Fuel & Power Company. The Trustees' plan further provided for
payment in cash to the public holders of Kentucky Fuel bonds and
debentures of principal, but not of interest except for a single interest
coupon on the debentures which was in default prior to receivership.
The plan also provided for the reorganized company to borrow an
estimated $4,000,000 from a bank and to use the proceeds for payment
of a portion of the claims of the public creditors. All the new common stock of the reorganized company was to be issued to The C0lumbia Gas System, Inc., as holder of subordinated claims against
Inland.
The Commission's Third Advisory Report concluded that the Trustees' Plan was fair to the public creditors of American Fuel in according them the full amount of their claims including interest;" However, the Commission considered the plan to be unfair to the public
holders of Kentucky Fuel bonds and debentures because the plan gave
no recognition to the interest which accrued on their claims between
December 1, 1930, when the equity receivership proceeding comCorporate Reorganization Release No. 101. August 26, 1957.

instituted; and because the plan would give compensation to Columbia
for post-bankruptcy interest on the subordinated claims of Columbia
before post-bankruptcy interest was paid on the publicly held claims
against Kentucky Fuel.
The Commission concluded that the plan was feasible but pointed
out that if the plan was amended to make it fair, in accordance with
the principles enunciated in the Report, the proposed capital structure of the reorganized company would have to be further modified
to make the plan feasible.
The district judge did not accept the Commission's conclusion and
approved the plan. Several appeals from the judge's ruling were
pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit

PART VIII
ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes, debentures and similar securities publicly offered for sale, except as
specifically exempted by the Act, be issued under an indenture which
meets the requirements of the Act and has been duly qualified with the
Commission. The Act requires that indentures to be qualified include
specified provisions which provide means by which the rights of holders of securities issued under such indentures may be protected and
enforced. These provisions relate to designated standards of eligibility and qualification of the corporate trustee to provide reasonable
financial responsibility and to minimize conflicting interests. The
Act outlaws exculpatory provisions formerly used to eliminate all liability of the indenture trustee and imposes on the trustee, after default, the duty to use the same degree of care and skill "in the exercise
of the rights and powers invested in it by the indenture" as a prudent
man would use in the conduct of his own affairs.
The provisions of the Trust Indenture Act are closely integrated
with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant
to the Securities Act of securities to be issued under a trust indenture
subject to the Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective
unless the indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter Act,
and necessary information as to the trustee and the indenture must be
contained in the registration statement. In the case of securities issued in exchange for other securities of the same issuer and securities
issued under a plan approved by a court or other proper authority
which, although exempted from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act, are not exempted from the requirements of the
Trust Indenture Act, the obligor must file an application for the
qualification of the indenture, including a statement of the required
information concerning the eligibility and qualification of the trustee.

PART IX
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY

ACT OF 1940
The Investment Company Act of 1940provides for the registration
and regulation of companies engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, holding and trading in securities. The Act requires, among other things, disclosure of the finances and investment
policies of these companies, prohibits such companies from changing
the nature of their business or their investment policies without the
approval of their stockholders, regulates the means of custody of the
companies' assets, prohibits underwriters, investment bankers and
brokers from constituting more than a minority of the directors of
such companies, requires management contracts to be submitted to
security holders for their approval, prohibits transactions between
such companies and their officers, directors and affiliates except with
the approval of the Commission and regulates the issuance of senior
securities. The Act requires face-amount certificate companies to
maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity payments upon their
certificates.
The securities of investment companies which are offered to the
public are also required to be registered under the Securities Act,
and the companies must file periodic reports. Such companies are
also subject to the Commission's "proxy" and "insider" trading rules.
The Division of Corporation Finance and the Division of Corporate
Regulation both assist the Commission in the administration of the
statute, the former being concerned with the disclosure provisions
and the latter with the regulatory provisions.
COMPANIES REGISTERED UNDER THE Ac.r

As of June 30, 1958, there were 453 investment companies registered
under the Act, and it is estimated that on that date the aggregate market value of their assets was $17 billion. These figures represent an
increase of 21 registered companies and an increase of roughly
$2 billion in the market value of assets over the corresponding totals
at June 30, 1957. These companies were classified as follows:

COMPANIES

In the preceding fiscal year the Commission pursuant to section
14 (b) of the Investment Company Act instituted an inquiry into the

148

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

problems created by the growth in size of investment companies and,
as part of this inquiry, received a preliminary report containing a
general research plan for the study of the effects of investment company growth (23rd Annual Report, p. 159). In furtherance of this
study the Commission in the past fiscal year retained the Securities
Research Unit of the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce,
University of Pennsylvania, to make a fact-finding survey and report
on certain aspects and practices of registered investment companies.
This survey is under the supervision of Dean Willis J. Winn of the
Wharton SchooP
The general problems which will be examined are: (a) The manner and extent to which investment policies may be affected by the
size of investment companies; (b) the relationship between the size
of investment companies on the one hand and the character of management, cost of operation, and performance of investment companies
on the other; (c) the relationship between the size of the investment
companies and the manner in which blocks of securities are purchased and sold and the effects of such purchase and sales on the
security markets and the marketing channels for securities; and (d)
the extent to which large companies control or influence the policies
and decisions of portfolio companies. The immediate inquiry of
the study will be primarily directed to the question of the effects
of size on investment policies and comparative performance of investment companies, although other aspects of the inquiry will be
developed to the extent possible.
It is expected that the report of the Wharton School will enable the
Commission to determine whether the increased size of investment
companies has created any problems which require specific remedial
legislative recommendations by the Commission to the Congress.
INSPECTION

PROGRAM

As indicated in the 23rd Annual Report, the Commission has initiated a regular program for the periodic inspection of investment companies pursuant to its statutory authority under section 31 of the
Investment Company Act. In pilot operations under this program,
nine companies were inspected during fiscal year 1957,2and seven in
fiscal year 1958. These inspections were undertaken by staff teams
consisting of one attorney or analyst from the Division of Corporate
Regulation and one securities investigator from the appropriate field
office. In this way, the specialized training and knowledge of the
1 The Wharton
School will limit the scope and manner of conducting the study to accord
with the Commission's determinations with respect thereto.
A preliminary questionnaire
has been prepared by the staff of the Wharton School and has been transmitted to selected
investment companies for test checking.
2 At page 160 of the 23rd Annual Report It was erroneously
stated that only six Inspections were completed in tlscal year 1957.

TWENTY-FOUR'l'H ANNUAL REPORT

149

staff concerning the regulatory requirements of the Investment Company Act has been combined with the field experience and investigative expertness of field office personnel for more expeditious and
thorough review of the investment company.
These inspections, although involving only a very small fraction
of the total number of registered investment companies, have revealed
the need for continuous field supervision. The Commission's studies
ascertained that in several cases there was non-compliance with regulatory provisions of the Investment Company Act with respect to such
matters as (1) the affiliations of directors in violation of section 10
of the Act; (2) security purchases by registered investment company
during an underwriting where an affiliate relationship exists between
the underwriter of such security and the company in violation of section 10 (f) of the Act; (3) receipt of a commission for the sale of
property by an affiliated person contrary to section 17 (e) of the Act;
and (4) the failure to file an appropriate fidelity bond covering an
officer having access to portfolio securities pursuant to the requirements of rules under section 17 (g) of the Act.
In addition to non-compliance with various regulations and standards under the Act, some situations where books and records were
inadequate or lacking were noted by the staff. Thus, there were instances where a company failed to record the date and time of requests
for redemption which resulted in an inability to determine whether the
investors had received their correct net asset value. In other instances
a company failed to maintain journals reflecting purchases and sales
of securities, to maintain ledger accounts for broker-dealers used by
the company for its portfolio security transactions and to keep proper
vouchers for out-of-pocket expenses. In one case, an inspection revealed that the custodian did not adhere to the terms of the custodianship agreement and that there was a failure to comply with the
Commission's regulations regarding the safekeeping of portfolio
securities.
In several cases the staff observed that there was considerable delay
by dealers selling investment company shares in the transmission of
funds received by them to the investment companies or their custodians. It also creates a risk for the purchasers who have paid dealers
for their shares but to whom shares of stock are not delivered until
funds are actually received by the companies. This practice is undesirable because investment companies are deprived of the use of
such funds even though the sales of securities have already been
recorded on the books of the companies.
During the course of one inspection, in examining certain transactions of the investment company, the staff discovered the existence
of another investment company which had not registered under the

150

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Act. As a result of further inquiry, this company was compelled to
register.
In cases where deficiencies are noted, they are brought to the attention of the investment companies involved so that corrective action
may be taken. The Commission's experience to date indicates that
this aspect of the inspection program will prove to be particularly
helpful to the newly organized or the smaller investment company,
and of benefit to the investing public.
CURRENT INFORMATION

The basic information contained in notifications of registration and
in registration statements of investment companies ds required by
rules promulgated under the Act to be kept up-to-date, except rID
cases of certadn inactive unit trusts and face-amount companies.
During the 1958 fiscal year the ~dllowing current reports and documents were filed :

While not reflected in the foregoing statistics, dn the course of every
fiscal year, open-end mutual funds making a continuous offering of
their securities make frequent filings of revised prospectuses showing
material changes which have occurred in the operations of such companies since the effective date of the prospectuses on file. In this
respect the registration of the securities of such companies is essentially different from the registration of the usual corporate securities.
APPLICATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

Processing applications for exemptions constitutes one of the principal regulatory activities of the Commission under the Act. Under
Section 6 (c) the Commission is empowered, either upon its own
motion or by order upon application, to exempt any person, security
or transaction from any provision of the Act ii and to the extent
such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public dnterest and
consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes faJirly
intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Various other
sections, such as 6 (d), 9 (b), 10 (f), 11 (a), 17 (b), and 23 (c) contain specific provisions and standards pursuant to which the Commission may grant exemptions from particular sections of the Act or may
approve certain types of transactions. Under certain provisions of
Sections 2, 3 and 8 the Commission may also determine the status of
persons and companies under the Act.
During the 1958 fiscal year 159 applications on various matters
under the Act were pending before the Commission. Of these, 115

In Dow Theory Investment Fund, Inc., the applicant was granted
an order exempting it from the requirements of section 22 (d) of the
Act so as to permit it to continue to sell redeemable securities to
existing subscribers under an accumulation plan at a price including
a sales load of 5%, which was at variance with a 71;2% sales load
proposed to be charged to new shareholders. In a divided opinion,
the Commission pointed out that its decision to grant the application
was based on the specific facts in the case and that the type of exemption granted would at most have only a very limited application
in other situations. It declared that the decision "is not intended as
an adoption of a general policy of approving differing sales loads
based on differences in selling costs, or to restrict our discretion to
further define or revise our policy concerning exemptions from section
22 (d) if our continuing study should indicate that to be necessary." 8
In Insured Accounts Fund,9 the Commission denied an application
for an exemption pursuant to section 6 (c) from the requirements
of sections 16 (a) and 18 (i) of the Act. Section 16 (a) provides that
the directors (defined by section 2 (a) (12) of the Act to include
trustees) of a registered investment company be elected by the holders
of the outstanding voting securities, and section 18 (i) provides that
every share of stock issued by a registered management company
shall be a voting stock having equal voting rights with every other
outstanding voting stock.
The Company proposed to invest 80% of its funds in insured accounts of savings and loan institutions and its remaining assets in
federally insured bank accounts, government securities, and cash. To
have the benefit of this insurance to the extent contemplated, applicant represented that its trust form of organization was necessary
and that to grant its security holders voting rights would destroy its
status as a trust for this purpose. It further contended that there
was no need for the control over the trustees which would flow from
voting rights since their discretion was limited to investments among
insured institutions.
The Commission refused to grant the exemption, stating that it
would be inconsistent with the policy of the Act that the owners of
investment companies have the power to elect the management to the
end that such companies are operated in the investors' interests and
not in the interests of other persons. The Commission found that the
discretion to invest among various savings and loan companies with
differing risk factors and earnings was an important area of management discretion. The Commission further found that since sub8 Investment
Company Act Release No. 2694 (April 14, 1958). Subsequently the company decided not to avail Itself of the exemptIon.

stantially all such investments would be made in savings and loan
institutions which were members of the organization which promoted
the investment company, there would be a potential conflict of interest
between the management and investors.
In Ira Haupt &: 00., the applicant as sponsor and depositor of a
unit investment trust, requested an exemption from sections 2 (a) (3),
4 (2) and 22 (e) of the Act to the extent that those sections require
the securities issued by a unit trust to be redeemable either by the
trust or its agent. Upon the conclusion of the hearings on the application which were held during the fiscal year, the applicant requested
that the matter be temporarily held in abeyance and the case has
therefore not yet come before the Commission for disposition."
Great Northern Investments, Imo, (formerly Inter-Canadian Corporation), a closed-end investment company, filed an application pursuant to section 6 (c) to permit it to acquire all the voting stock of
Northwestern Fire and Marine Insurance Company and to finance
such acquisition by the issuance of up to $3,200,000 of bank notes.
The stock was to be acquired pursuant to a general offer to Northwestern's stockholders at a price of $41 per share. It was contemplated that after the acquisition Northwestern would be caused to be
liquidated promptly. The exemption was required because section
12 (d) (2) makes it unlawful for a registered investment company
to acquire more than 10% of the total outstanding voting stock of
an insurance company and section 18 (a) (1) makes it unlawful for
a registered closed-end investment company to issue debt obligations,
with certain exceptions, unless the asset coverage for the debt immediately after such issuance is equal to at least 300%, and Great
Northern's assets could not meet this 300% test after it borrowed
$3,200,000. In addition, since the proposal also involved transactions
between affiliates an exemption from the provisions of section 17 (a)
pursuant to section 17 (b) was requested. The Commission granted
the requested exemption," finding among other things that the purpose of the acquisition of the insurance company's stock was to obtain
. the assets of a corporation to be liquidated and not to control a going
insurance company, and that the asset coverage requirements of the
Act would be complied with through repayment of the note as a result
of the liquidation of Northwestern, or the distribution by it of substantial dividends.
It also found that the transactions between
affiliates were fair and reasonable and involved no overreaching."

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In The Great American Life Underwriters, Ino., applicant, a registered face-amount certificate company, sought an order pursuant to
section 6 (c) of the Act exempting it from the Act from and after
January 1, 1941. In the alternative, it requested an order pursuant
to sections 8 (f) and 6 (c) of the Act declaring that applicant is not
or has ceased to be an investment company and exempting from the
provisions of the Act transactions since January 1941 to which it or
any person controlled by it was a party." Applicant's request for
an exemption is based on the contention that it discontinued the sale
of face-amount certificates in the latter part of 1940, and that since
its inception in 1929 it has been primarily and continuously engaged
in the life insurance business through various controlled subsidiaries,
including, since 1939, Franklin Life Insurance Company, presently
its only life insurance subsidiary. The request for an order under
section 8 (f) of the Act is based on the contention that since 1953
more than 90% of the value of its investment securities has been
represented by its investment in the stock of Franklin Life Insurance
Company and that, accordingly, it is entitled to the exception from the
definition of an investment company contained in section 3 (c) (8) of
the Act.14
'
The transactions for which exemption has been sought under section 6 (c) involved applicant or its controlled companies and their
affiliates and, although subject to the prohibitions of section 17 (a)
of the Act, were carried out without prior Commission approval under
section 17 (b) of the Act. The various questions involved in this case
were explored during hearings which resulted in over 3,200 pages of
testimony and the introduction in evidence of 300 exhibits. The
parties in the case were engaged in completing the post-hearing procedures after the close of the fiscal year.
In ouu and Milita7"!JInvestors Mutual Fund, Ina., the Commission
decided that the name of a registered investment company "Civil and
Military Investors Mutual Fund, Inc.", inherently implies that such
company's securities have special investment and other advantages for
the civil and military government personnel to whom it was intended
to offer such securities, that such advantages do not in fact exist, and
that therefore the name was deceptive and misleading under section
35 (d) of the Act. The Commission found, however, that the name

or (7). The persons enumerated in section 3 (c) (7) include any company primarily
engaged. directly or through majority-owned subsidiaries, in one or more businesses described in sections 3 (c) (3), (5) and (6) of the Act. Section 3 (c) (3) excepts insurance

did not violate section 35 (a) of the Act 15 since it was not likely to
carry an implication that the company or its securities were sponsored,

REGISTRATION OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT COMPANIES

An application filed during the past fiscal year by American-South
Africa Investment Company, Ltd. for an order under Section 7 (d)
of the Act permitting its registration under the Act and for the sale
of its securities in the United States was the first such application
presented to the Commission by a non-Canadian, foreign investment
company. The company was organized as a closed-end investment
company, chartered under the Companies Act of 1926 of the Union
of South Africa.
Section 7 (d) of the Act, among other things, prohibits a foreign
investment company from selling its securities to the public by use of
the mails or any means or instrumentalities
of interstate commerce
. unless the Commission, upon application, issues a conditional or unconditional order permitting such company to register under the Act
and to make a public offering of its securities in the United States. To
issue such an order the Commission must find that, by reason of special
circumstances or arrangements, it is both legally and practically feasible effectively to enforce the provisions of the Act against such company and that the issuance of such order is otherwise consistent with
the public interest and protection of investors.
Rule N-7D-1 under the Act sets forth the specifications, conditions
and arrangements for Canadian management investment companies
requesting orders for registration,"
but makes no provision for en.. This section provides that "It shall be unlawful for any person, in issuing or sell1ng
any security of which a registered investment company is the issuer, to represent or imply
in any manner whatsoever that such security or company has been guaranteed, sponsored,
recommended, or approved by the United States or any agency or officer thereof."

Fund filed a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of

1958.
1f Since the rule was adopted on April 27, 1954 and up to June 30, 1958, ten Canadian
companies have obtained orders granting permission to register. These include: Resources

abling investment companies organized in other foreign countries to
register. Processing the application in this case, therefore, required
extensive research into South African corporate law to determine
whether it would be legally feasible to apply and enforce the standards
of the Act with respect to this company.
In support of its request, applicant agreed to abide by the undertakings and agreements provided for by rule N-7D-1 applicable to
Canadian investment companies as well as numerous additional undertakings and agreements to give assurance of the enforceability of the
Act. A hearing on the application was held in July, 1958, shortly
after the close of the fiscal year, and the Commission's Findings and
Opinion and Order approving the application was issued on August
13, 1958.1s
UNREGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES-SECURING COMPLIANCE
WITH THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT

In the course of administering the Investment Company Act, the
Commission must frequently take steps to require the registration of
companies. Such instances often arise with respect to companies
which have been engaged in industrial or other activities and which
over periods of time substantially reduce their regular business activities and sell large portions of their assets and invest the proceeds in
securities. Thus, these companies bring themselves within the purview of section 3 (a) (3) of the Act, which defines an investment company, among others, as one which is engaged in the business of owning
or holding, or proposing to own or hold, investment securities having
a value exceeding 40 per centum of the value of their total assets.
Companies which fall within this definition must register under section 8 (a) of the Act, or they may, before or after such registration,
apply for an order under section 3 (b) (2) declaring that they are
primarily engaged in a business or businesses other than the investment business.
In the usual case, companies which find themselves in, or approaching an investment company status seek the advice of the Commission's
staff as to the application of the Act. Others, however, through inadvertence or erroneous interpretation of the Act fail to register until
notified by the Commission to do so. The discovery of such situations
presents a serious administrative problem. It is obviously impossible
and undesirable to attempt to scrutinize the operations of the myriad
of business enterprises in this country to determine their status under
the Act. The Commission and its staff are dependent for information upon newspapers and other reportorial services, complaints of
stockholders or other interested persons and examination of reports or
" Investment

Company Act Release No. 2756.

other documents required to be filed with the Commission under other
Acts which it administers.
Companies which the staff and the Commission dealt with during
the past fiscal year involving registration and status problems under
the Act included the following: National Department Stores Corporation, McPhail Candy Corporation, New York Dock Company,
Portsmouth Steel Corporation, Dempster Investment Company, Real
Silk Hosiery Mills, Inc., American-Hawaiian Steamship Company
and Bankers Southern, Inc. All of these companies, with the exception of Bankers Southern, Inc., which is a newly organized company, had in recent years disposed of substantial portions or all of
their other business assets and purchased securities with the proceeds,
with the result that they fell within the presumptive test of an investment company contained in section 3 (a) (3). Prior to, or shortly
after, the close of the fiscal year all of these companies, with the exception of National Department Stores and American-Hawaiian
. Steamship, had registered under the Act. Hearings on National Department Stores application under section 3 (b) (2) had not been
concluded at the year's end. American-Hawaiian Steamship, upon
being advised by the Commission that its operations were subject to
the Investment Company Act, refused to register, claiming, among
other things, that it was not an investment company nor subject to
the Act. Thereupon, after the close of the fiscal year, the Commission
initiated proceedings in the United States District Court to enforce
compliance with the Act.
The problems of administration and enforcement encountered in
this type of case are illustrated by the McPhail Candy Corporation
matter. In early 1955 the staff learned, through a newspaper account, that a derivative stockholder's action had been instituted
against McPhail Candy Corporation in which it was alleged, among
other things, that the company was an investment company and that
its officers had, in effect, been guilty of a breach of trust. Reports
filed by the company with the Commission pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act indicated that over a period of years the company's
candy operations had been declining, that assets had been liquidated
and the cash, together with borrowings, had been invested in securities and that candy operations had been conducted at a loss while security transactions and dividend receipts were providing an increasingly important source of income. Security holdings constituted a
substantial portion of the company's total assets. Because of these
and other facts, it appeared that the company might have already
undertaken to be an investment company and that further inquiry
was warranted.
Informal investigation of the affairs of McPhail Candy Corporation proceeded during the spring of 1955. Examination of the annual

158

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

audited report of the company's operations, which was filed on August 15, 1955, served to strengthen the earlier tentative conclusion of
the company's status as an investment company and the company
was advised of this conclusion and further factual information was
sought from the company on a voluntary basis. By the end of the
year it became apparent that the company would not voluntarily
register under the Act and that an Investigation of its affairs would
have to be conducted to determine its status and if necessary, to compel registration.
As a result of further investigation it appeared
that the company was and had been an investment company and
should register as such and that it had engaged in a series of transactions with its principal officer and stockholder and otherwise used
its assets for his personal benefit under circumstances which, it appeared, might involve fraud and gross abuse of trust. Ultimately, on
October 28, 1957, the company registered but concurrently filed an
application under section 3 (b) (2) to be declared excepted from the
definition of an investment company, or in the alternative to be exempted pursuant to section 6 (c). During the hearing on this application the company requested its withdrawal and this request was
granted on April 24, 1958.19
LITIGATION UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940

During the fiscal year the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit, in S. E. O. v, Variable Annuity Life Insurance
Oompany of America et al.,20affirmed the dismissal by the district
court of the Commission's complaint charging violations of the registration provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Securities
Act of 1933. As noted on page 164 of the 23rd Annual Report, the
district court had dismissed the Commission's complaint after trial
on the ground that the McCarran Act placed exclusive regulatory
jurisdiction over the defendants in the insurance authorities of the
States and the District of Columbia. The Court of Appeals based
its decision on different grounds, holding that the variable annuity
contracts sold by defendants are exempt from registration pursuant
to section 3 (a) (8) of the Securities Act and that the defendants are
insurance companies falling within the provisions of section 3 (c) (3)
of the Investment Company Act.
111 On July 7, 1958, the Commission lIled a complaint In the United States District
Court
for the Southern District of New York against the directors of the company for gross
abuse of trust under section 36 of the Investment Company Act. The complaint alleges,
among other things, that the corporation was an Investment company on or before April 1,
1953; that between 1953 and 1957, the corporation, under the control and direction of its
omcers and directors carried on Its activities In violation of Section 7 of the Investment
Company Act and that Russell McPhail fraUdulently diverted the corporation's assets to

In 8. E. O. v, Oryan,21 the Commission is seeking an injunction pursuant to section 36 of the Investment Company Act permanently barring Frank: M. Cryan, former president and director, and John Setrian and Joseph Aversa, purported to be the new president and
secretary-treasurer,
respectively, from acting as directors and officers
of Jefferson Custodian Fund, Inc., an open-end registered investment
company, the appointment of a receiver, and other relief. The Commission's complaint alleges that Cryan sold to Setrian and his associates the stock of Jefferson Research Foundation, Inc., the Fund's
investment adviser, at an aggregate price of $261,000, its net book
value being about $2,300. The assets of the Fund at about that time
were approximately $1,270,000.
The complaint further alleges that the price agreed upon was "for
the surrender of the fiduciary and management positions with respect
to the Fund in favor of the defendant, John Setrian and his associates," and that "the purchasers of the stock did not have funds to
pay the price and that the intention was to use the Fund's resources
to finance the purchase."
A receiver was appointed, and the receiver
and the Fund's custodian were directed by the Court to honor redemptions at net asset value less 5% of the redemption price which
was to be credited to a contingent reserve for receivership expenses."
During the course of the proceedings, upon the recommendation of
the receiver and a vote of the stockholders, the Court approved a
transfer of the assets of the company to another mutual fund.
In 8. E. O. v. Insurance Seourities, 11UJ.,23 the Court of Appeals
affirmed the district court's dismissal of the Commission's complaint
which alleged. that the defendants were guilty of gross abuse of trust
within the meaning of section 36 of the Investment Company Act
because they, as directors, officers and controlling stockholders, had
sold stock control of an investment adviser for a registered investment
company at about 25 times the net asset value of the stock." The
Court of Appeals held that there was no breach of trust because no
funds of the investment company were involved. and Congress pro-vided a remedy in section 15 of the Act under which an investment
advisory contract is terminated when stock control of the investment
adviser is sold."

ADllfINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS

ACT OF 1940
A person engaged for compensation in the business of advising
others with respect to securities is required by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to register as an investment adviser. There are
certain exemptions from the requirement of registration such as in
the case of an investment adviser all of whose clients are residents
of the state of his principal business officeand whose activities do not
include advice or analysis with respect to securities listed Or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on any national securities exchange. The Act makes it unlawful for investment advisers to engage
in practices which constitute fraud or deceit. The Act also requires
investment advisers to disclose"the nature of their interest in transactions which they may effect for their clients, prohibits profitsharing arrangements and, for all practical purposes, prevents the
assignment of any investment advisory contract without the consent
of the interested client.
The Commission is not empowered by the Investment Advisers
Act to inspect the books and records of an investment adviser nor
to deny or revoke the registration of an investment adviser unless
he has been convicted of certain offenses involving securities or arising out of his conduct as an investment adviser or in certain other
specified capacities, or has been enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction on the same grounds or has falsified his application.
The number of registered investment advisers continued to increase and at the end of the fiscal year the total was 1,562,representing an increase of nearly 10% over the previous year. The following tabulation reflects certain data with respect to registration of
investment advisers and applications for such registration during

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS

The Commission revoked the investment adviser registration of
Ralph Seipel, doing business as Investors Surety Oompany/ on the
ground that the registrant had been permanently enjoined by a United
States District Court, in an action instituted by the Commission, from
employing any device, scheme or artifice to defraud a client or prospective client or from engaging in any transaction, practice or course of
business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon
any client or prospective client in violation of Section 206 of the Act,"
The injunction was based on findings by the court that Seipel had
violated that section by falsely representing to persons responding to
his newspaper advertisements inviting requests for stock market information, that he absolutely guaranteed clients against loss in the
stock market, that he maintained branch officesand a foreign exchange
department, and that he had twenty-five years of trading experience
and many clients, when in fact he had no office,organization, associates
or customers. Seipel contended that the injunction did not constitute
a basis for revocation, since he had no clients and was enjoined only
from making misrepresentations in an effort to attract clients and not
from engaging in any conduct connected with investment advisory
activities. This contention was rejected by the Commission.
James Oordas, doing business as The Oanadian Stock Letter.' a registered investment adviser, filed an amendment to his registration application with the Commission which wilfully misstated his business address as being in one state when in fact it was located in another state,
where he was enjoined from acting as an investment adviser. The
Commission held it to be in the public interest to revoke his registration
as an investment adviser.
LITIGATION UNDER mE

INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940

The Commission is authorized by the Investment Advisers Act to
obtain an injunction where violations of the Act have occurred or
appear to be imminent.
Pursuant to that authority the Commission secured a permanent injunction in 8. E. O. Y. Security Forecaster 00., Inc. and lIIelvin A.

cial Forecaster", which the company published and distributed, urged
clients and prospective clients to buy shares of Anacon Lead Mines,
Ltd., by means of the following misleading and fraudulent statements, among others: (1) the projected recovery by Anacon of an
estimated $50,000 per acre from certain of its gold mining holdings
would result in a recovery potential to Anacon of $50 million;
(2) the value of each outstanding share of Anacon was approximately
$3 per share, when in fact it was approximately 40 cents per share;
(3) millions of dollars were realized within days by traders, speculators and investors in other stocks managed by Johnson; (4) large
and extremely quick profits would be made as a result of a purchase of
Anacon stock; and (5) dividends had been paid in the past by Anacon,
without disclosing that no dividends have been paid since 1952.
The Commission filed memoranda amicus curiae and presented
oral argument in Hull v. Newman, Kennedy & 00.,5 an action to declare
an investment contract void, and for damages for violations of the
Investment Advisers Act. The Commission, addressing itself solely
to the questions of law involved, contended that a private civil action
may be brought for violation of the Act, regardless of the non-existence
of any express statutory provision authorizing it. The case was subsequently settled.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION

COURT PROCEEDINGS
Civil Proceedings

At the beginning of the fiscal year 1958 there were pending in the
courts 43 injunctive and related enforcement proceedings instituted
by the Commission to prevent fraudulent and other illegal practices
in the sale or purchase of securities. During the year 65 additional
proceedings were instituted and 54 cases were disposed of, leaving 54
such proceedings pending at the end of the year. In addition the
Commission participated
in a number of corporate reorganization
cases under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, in 7 proceedings in
the district courts under section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act and in 14 miscellaneous actions. The Commission also
participated in 35 civil appeals in the United States Courts of Appeals.
Of these, 17 came before the courts on petition for review of an administrative order, 6 arose out of corporate reorganizations in which the
Commission had taken an active part, 9 were appeals in actions brought
by or against the Commission, 1 was an appeal from an order
entered pursuant to section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act and 2 were appeals in cases in which the Commission appeared as amicus curiae. The Commission also participated in 4
appeals or petitions for certiorari before the United States Supreme
Court resulting from these or similar actions.
Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared before
a Federal or State court, either as a party or as amicus curiae, during
the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the year, are
contained in the appendix tables.
Certain significant aspects of the Commission's litigation during the
year are discussed in the sections of this report relating to the statutes
under which the litigation arose.
Criminal Proceedings

Fifteen new cases were referred to the Department of Justice
for prosecution during the past fiscal year. From 1934 to June 30,
1958, 2,376 defendants have been indicted in United States district
courts in 575 cases developed by the Commission. These figures include 14 indictments returned during the past fiscal year against 42

defendants. Also during the fiscal year there were 30 convictions in
14 cases, making the total 1,295 convictions in 546 cases. There were
6 appeals in criminal cases. In 3 of these cases the defendants unsuccessfully attempted to have their convictions set aside and the remaining cases were pending on appeal at the end of the year. There
were 4 criminal contempt proceedings during 1958, 2 of which were
instituted during the fiscal year. In 1 of these cases 3 defendants
were convicted, leaving 3 cases pending at the end of the year.
As in the past, defendants in the criminal cases developed and prosecuted during the year contrived a variety of fraudulent schemes, including broker-dealer frauds and fraudulent promotions involving
inventions, mining and oil and gas ventures, finance and insurance
companies and various other types of businesses. The defendants in
some of the cases were also charged with violations of the registration
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and violations of other nonfraud provisions.
A seven-year prison term was imposed on Eldridge S. Price (N. D.
Ga.) following his conviction on all 14 counts of an indictment charging violations of the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the
Securities Act and the Mail Fraud Statute in connection with the sale
of oil and gas interests and stock of the Dark Canyon Uranium Corporation and other securities. The indictment charged, among other
things, that the defendant knowingly made false promises of great
wealth to prospective investors, including misrepresentations that the
lands covered by the oil leases had already been proven for oil and were
highly productive; that there was no risk; and that the defendant
Price was a highly qualified and successful oil operator who had never
drilled for oil without bringing in a producing well when, in :fact, wells
drilled by Price were dry holes or yielded no oil in commercial quantities. It was further charged that the defendant falsely represented
that the land covered by the leases was the best oil land in Texas and
that the defendant owned large interests in the leases and drilling
equipment having a value of hundreds of thousands of dollars. The
indictment also alleged that the defendant concealed from prospective
investors the fact that he was in bankruptcy; that he had never been
successful as an oil operator; and that his profits had been made
wholly as a result of promotional activities. Mrs. Edith Wynne Price,
a co-defendant, was acquitted by the court prior to the submission of
the case to the jury and Price was released on $10,000 bail pending
appeal.
Mining and oil and gas ventures were also involved in the indictments pending in V. S. v, V. S. Manganese Oorporation et al. (S. D.
N. Y.); V. S. v, Stratoras) Oil, Inc. et al. (S. D. Tex.); and V. S. v.
Silas M. Newton et al. (D. Colo.) . In the V. S. Manganese case the in-

dictment charges that the corporation and defendants Commodore
Dewey Brock and Maurice A. Schuster conspired together and with
others to employ a scheme and artifice to defraud in the sale of the
corporation stock which resulted in substantial losses to investors.
The indictment alleges that the defendants caused to be printed and
issued a false and misleading offering circular which included misrepresentations that the corporation had acquired certain designated
mining properties and that one property contained 350,000 tons of
definite blocked out ore. It is further alleged that among the material
facts omitted from the offering circular were that the corporation
was obliged to pay approximately $700 a month on certain properties;
that the Defense Minerals Administration had refused to loan the
corporation $50,000 on the ground that its properties did not contain
sufficient ore to justify such loan; that substantially all the ore which
had been shipped by the corporation had been purchased from other
mines; that the total revenue received from the sales of the ore was
-
greatly exceeded by the cost of such sales and the corporation was
operating at a loss.
In the Stratoray case the indictment, in addition to charging failure
to comply with the registration provisions of the Securities Act, alleges
that the defendants effected sales of investment contracts evidenced
by oil and gas leases by means of untrue and misleading statements of
material facts. Included among the misrepresentations, according to
the indictment, were statements that the drilling of a certain oil well
would most likely result in the discovery of one of the largest oil
fields in the United States and that persons purchasing leases in the
area from the defendants were being afforded an opportunity of acquiring great wealth; that the defendants were convinced they had
a scientific oil hunting instrument, called a "scintillator," capable of
detecting virgin oil fields with near 100% dependability; that the
defendants, by means of their scintillator, had located what they believed to be a vast accumulation of oil, perhaps as large as the prolific
Yates field in Pecos County, Texas; and that one of the defendants
was a research scientist trained and experienced in the application of
electronic nuclear scientific principles.
The indictment in the Newton case alleges, among other things,
that the defendants, by means of false and misleading statements,
induced investors to purchase participating certificates in the Yellow
Cat Royalty Trust, the Tennessee Queen Royalty Trust, and fractional undivided interests in mining claims held by the Tennessee
Queen Mining Co. The alleged statements include misrepresentations
concerning the value of the properties, the experience of the mining
operators, the shipping of ore, and the certainty of royalty returns
on the investments.

In U. S. v. Francis E. Getchell et al. (S. D. Fla.), the defendants
were sentenced to terms ranging from 1 to 5 years following their
convictions after a trial extending over 11 weeks. The indictment
charged that the defendants engaged in a scheme to sell stock of
Florida Palms, Inc., 'and other securities, by falsely representing that
defendants Francis E. and Harry S. Getchell had developed a secret
and commercially feasible process whereby pulp could be manufactured from cabbage palms; that several large companies had offered
to buy this process for millions of dollars; that all money invested
would be used to build a plant and buy equipment and that all funds
received from the sale of the securities would be held in trust for this
purpose. It was further charged that false financial statements prepared by defendant William F. Powers, a certified public accountant,
were used to deceive investors and to conceal the misappropriation of
their funds. The fourth defendant, Hollis Rinehart, an attorney, was
alleged to have been an officerof Florida Palms, Inc. and to have assisted in these promotions.
In U. S. v. Olinton R. Bupp et al. (D. Idaho), the defendants
Clinton R. Rupp and Intermountain Development Company, Inc.
were found guilty of violating and conspiring to violate the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Mail Fraud Statute
in connection with the sale of Intermountain stock. The indictment
charged that the defendants misrepresented to investors that the
funds received from the sale of the Intermountain stock would be
deposited with the Idaho Insurance Commissioner and would be used
in compliance with the Idaho Insurance law; that 75% of the funds
so received would be deposited in escrow for use in purchasing controlling interests in small life insurance companies; that, as a result
of the purchase of National Security Life Insurance Company, the
Intermountain stock would, and did, increase in value; that none of
the proceeds would be used in carrying on any mining and exploration work; that the defendants had invested substantially in Intermountain securities; and that the son of the Commissioner of Finance
of the State of Idaho had purchased $10,000worth of Intermountain
stock. The indictment further charged that the defendants concealed from investors the fact that Intermountain had purchased National Security Life Insurance Company for $270; that Intermountain had never obtained an insurance permit from the State of Idaho;
that Intermountain's assets had been frozen and receivership proceedings were pending in the state courts and that the securities being
offered were the personally owned stock of certain individuals who
were receiving the benefits of the proceeds of the sale. Six of the defendants received sentences ranging from a $1000 fine to a $1000fine
and a year's imprisonment following pleas of guilty or 'lWZO con-

tendere to various counts. Defendant Rupp, who after trial was
found guilty of securities fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy, was sentenced to a 5-year prison term and a $10,000 fine. Intermountain was
fined $5,000. A remaining defendant, who had been a fugitive, was
recently apprehended.
Another indictment charging fraud in an insurance company
promotion, U. S. v. National Union Life Insurance Oompany et al.
(S. D. Fla.), alleges, among other things, that Basil P. Autrey and
the other defendants devised a scheme to defraud investors by means
of false and misleading statements; that the defendants bought the
capital stock of National Union at prices ranging from $2 to $40 per
share and thereafter by means of manipulative and other fraudulent
practices resold the stock to investors at prices ranging from $5 to
$63.50 per share; that the defendants caused the company to issue
10,000 shares of its stock allegedly in exchange for an officebuilding,
knowing that the stock was to be acquired by one of the defendants
rather than the vendor, the purpose of such transaction being to defeat the preemptive rights of the stockholders and also to enable the
defendants to acquire a large block of stock for resale; that the defendants caused the company to issue 5,000 shares of its stock ostensibly for seasoned first mortgages, knowing that the mortgages never
would be received by the company; that the defendants artificially
caused the market price of the stock to rise by effecting a series of
transactions among themselves, with investors and with brokers and
dealers, by placing and giving scale-up orders for the stock, by causing the company to declare a 25% stock dividend and by circulating
fraudulent misrepresentations concerning the company and its affairs. The indictment further charged that the defendants kept
false, inaccurate and incomplete books and records in order to conceal
the company's true financial condition. A motion by certain defendants for transfer of the trial to the Northern District of Alabama was
granted. A motion by the Department of Justice for retransfer to
the Southern District of Florida is pending.
A 12-count indictment was returned charging Carl D. Schaeffer
(N. D. ill.) with devising a scheme and artifice to defraud investors
in the sale of investment contracts and evidences of indebtedness relating to the development of a machine for generating steam through
hydraulic forces. According to the indictment Schaeffer made
numerous fraudulent statements to investors, including statements
that Schaeffer had a written contract with a syndicate of companies comprised of Dow Chemical Company, the duPont Company,
Chrysler Corporation, General Motors and others, whereby these
companies had agreed to purchase the rights to Schaeffer's steam
machine and had put $10,000,000in escrow with the Chase National
Bank; that General Motors was interested in buying Schaeffer's

machine; that Fairbanks-Morse
and Co. had offered to buy
Schaeffer's machine for a million dollars and that he could pick up
a million dollar check from that company any time he wished, although he had turned down this offer; that Crane Company had
offered to buy the rights to Schaeffer's machine for a million dollars
and that Schaeffer had turned down this offer; that the United
States Navy and a big chemical company were bidding against each
other for the right to purchase Schaeffer's machine and that whichever purchased it would pay in the vicinity of $30,000,000; that the
United States Navy was interested in Schaeffer's machine for use
in submarines and was experimenting with the machine in extracting ocean minerals; that monies invested with Schaeffer were placed
by him in the Northern Trust Co. in Chicago and that if an investor
ever wanted his money back he would get it because it was on deposit with that institution; and that all investors would realize $10
for every $1 invested.
Another scheme to defraud investors which involved an invention
was alleged in an indictment charging William L. Dorsey, Sr. (W. D.
Mo.) with fraud in the sale of the common stock of Southwestern
Industries, Inc., a corporation which he controlled. In connection
with the sale of this stock Dorsey made numerous false and misleading statements to investors, including representations that the company owned the patent to an irrigation pump known as the Cochran
Power Unit; that an investment in the company would yield dividends as high as 100% a year; and that Dorsey would not receive
any salary, commissions or expenses from the company until such
time as the pumps were manufactured and sold. It was further
charged that Dorsey concealed from investors the fact that Southwestern Industries owed royalties to the owner of the patent on the
irrigation pump; that the company had no orders for and had sold
no pumps; that the company had a continually increasing deficit
and that Dorsey was using the funds of the company for his personal
expenses. Dorsey pleaded guilty to 4 counts charging him with
violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act and 4
counts charging him with violations of the registration requirements of that .Act. He was sentenced to a term of a year and a day
on each of the fraud counts. The sentences are to run concurrently
and he is to be placed on probation for five years upon release
from confinement.
In U. S. v, Hugh Van Valkenburgh et al. (D. Neb.), one of the
defendants, Abraham Schapiro, was placed on probation for 30

counts of an indictment charging him and his co-defendant with
having engaged in a scheme to defraud in connection with the sale
of stock of Instant Beverage, Inc., a corporation organized and

TWENTY-FOURTH

promoted by the defendants to manufacture an instant powder
product which, when mixed with water, was stated to produce a carbonated beverage. Misrepresentations were alleged to include assertions that several large companies would be interested in buying
or handling the formula and that the United States Government
would take the entire output of the powder for the first six months
of its production. The indictment further charged that the defendants failed to disclose the number of shares of Instant Beverage
stock issued to promoters and the prices paid for such shares;
that Instant Beverage did not own the formula for the powder,
but only held a franchise for its use; and that the United States
Army had previously rejected samples of the powder as being unfit
for use by the Army.'
Fraudulent promotions involving finance company ventures were
alleged in the indictments in U. S. v. A. B. Shoemake et al, (S. D.
Tex.); U. S. v, Oonsul Mayo Forsyth et al. (E. D. Tex.); and U. S.
-
v, HUrling L. Jacobson (D. Neb.). In the F01'Syth case the indictment charged, among other things, that the defendants, in the sale
of stock of Central Finance Service, Jnc., falsely represented to investors that the stock being offered was unissued stock of Central
and the money received from the sale of such stock would be used
by Central in its business operations; that Central was realizing
substantial profits from its business operations; that Central would
pay substantial dividends; and that investors would receive a return
of all the money they invested in Central stock upon request. The
indictment further charged that the Central stock offered and sold
to investors was personally owned stock and not the unissued stock
of Central; that Central had operated at a substantial loss throughout
its existence and that it had no surplus and, therefore was not in
a position to pay any dividends. Defendant Forsyth entered a plea
of guilty to 2 counts of the indictment and was sentenced to 2 years'
imprisonment and a suspended sentence of 5 years; the other defendant, Roy W. Adams, has entered a plea of not guilty.>
In the Jacobson case the defendant was sentenced to a suspended
term of 2 years and 3 years' probation on each of 17 counts, the
sentences to run concurrently, upon his conviction of charges in an
information that he violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Mail Fraud Statute and filed false statements with
the Securities and Exchange Commission."

In the Shoemake case the indictment charges that the defendants
misrepresented that funds deposited with the U. S. Trust and Guaranty Company were insured and guaranteed up to $10,000 by 100%
reserves and that financial statements supplied to customers and
prospective customers contained a true and correct statement of the
financial condition of the company. The indictment further charged
that the defendants made false statements concerning the use to be
made of funds deposited with the company, made false and misleading entries in the books of the company, and obtained false
appraisals of real estate owned by the company.
Frauds by broker-dealers were charged in the indictments in V. S.
v. Oharles M. Graves (D. Alaska) and V. S. v. Branch J. Oarden,
Jr. (W. D. Va.). In the Graves case the defendants Graves and The
Locators, Inc. pleaded guilty to various counts of an indictment
charging violations of the broker-dealer registration requirements of
the Securities Exchange Act and violations of the anti-fraud provisions of that Act. Both the Locators, Inc. and Graves were fined
$250 and, in addition, Graves received a 6-month suspended sentence.
In the Carden. case the defendant pleaded guilty to an indictment
that charged him, among other things, with accepting payment for
securities and, by written confirmation, representing to customers
that the securities had been purchased and would be delivered to
them in accordance with customs and practices of the business when,
in fact, the defendant converted the customers' funds to his own use.
The indictment also charged the defendant with accepting securities
from customers to be sold for the customers' accounts and with converting such securities to his own use. The indictment charged further that, for the purpose of deceiving the customers and concealing
from them the scheme to defraud, the defendant intentionally refrained from recording certain transactions in his books and records.
The defendant was sentenced to two years' imprisonment.
Sentences ranging from 2 years' probation to 12 months' imprisonment were imposed upon Sidney Barcley (E. D. Mich.) and six other
defendants following their pleas of guilty to one count of an indictment charging violations of the broker-dealer registration provisions of the Securities Exchange Act. According to the indictment, investors in the United States were solicited by the defendants
through the mails and by long distance telephone from Montreal,
Canada, to purchase from T. M. Parker, Inc., shares of stock of
various Canadian corporations, at a time when T. M. Parker, Inc.
was not registered as a broker-dealer with the Commission in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act.3

In U. S. v. Jesse S. Gill, et at. (N. D. Georgia), convictions were
obtained against two of the defendants on all counts of an indictment charging that the defendants induced Paleo Oil & Gas Corp. to
retain their firm as an underwriter for an offering of shares of the
corporation, and the defendants converted to their own use a sum
of money advanced for expenses and maintained fraudulent records
to conceal their actual disbursements in connection with the offering of the Paleo stock. Sentences of imprisonment for a term of
one year were imposed, but execution of the sentences was suspended
and the defendants were placed on probation for five years on condition that restitution be made in the sum of $2,000 for each defendant.
The case was dismissed as to the one remaining defendant.
In V. S. v. David L. SMndler et al. (S. D. N. Y.), the indictment charges that the defendants conspired to defraud purchasers
of stock of Jerry O'Mahoney, Inc. by manipulative practices which
artificially raised the market price of the stock and maintained the
artificial price. The practices alleged include the buying of large
amounts of stock through dummy accounts, inducing others to buy
on the American Stock Exchange by promises to sell additional
shares off the exchange at a price below the exchange price, and
by purchasing large amounts of stock off the exchange to prevent
such stocks being sold on the exchange and thereby depressing the
price. In addition, the indictment charges that the defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud purchasers of the stock by omitting
to state that the exchange price had been artificially raised and
maintained by the manipulative practices of the defendants.
An indictment was returned charging Edward J. Vitale (E. D.
Mich.) with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act
and the Mail Fraud Statute in connection with his activities as manager of a branch office of a Boston broker-dealer firm registered
with the Commission. The indictment alleges that the defendant,
after gaining the trust and confidence of certain customers, induced
them to sell their holdings of investment company securities and turn
the proceeds over to him by falsely representing that such funds
would be invested in various profit-sharing ventures, such as the purchase, renovation and resale of houses, and the development of residential building projects and other business enterprises in which
the defendant was engaged when, in fact, such projects were either
not in existence or the defendant was not a participant therein.
In V. S. v. Paul H. Oollins (S. D. Ill.), the indictment charged
that the defendant, while acting as a branch manager for a brokerdealer, not only defrauded customers of the company, but also defrauded the company itself. The indictment alleged that Collins

Shortly after the end of the fiscal year Collins pleaded guilty to ten
counts of the indictment. The imposition of sentence was suspended
and Collins was placed on probation for three years.
Fraud in connection with the delivery of forged and counterfeit
securities was charged in the indictment in U. S. v, Albert Hefferan
(W. D. Mich.). The indictment alleged that, as a part of a scheme
to defraud, the defendant placed a series of newspaper advertisements
soliciting investors to advance sums of money. It was alleged that
these advertisements represented that the defendant would furnish
collateral described as "listed, high-grade securities" and "grade-A
negotiable listed securities" having values substantially in excess of
the amounts of the investments solicited and that the defendant
did not intend to and did not pledge genuine securities as collateral but, on the contrary, delivered forged securities which he
falsely represented to be genuine. Hefferan pleaded guilty to five
counts of the indictment and, shortly after the close of the fiscal
year, was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.
In United States v. Edgar Robert Errion. et al. (D. Oregon), sentences were imposed on the defendants who had previously pleaded
guilty or had been convicted on an indictment charging violations
of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act, as well as the
Mail Fraud and Conspiracy statutes. Errion, who pleaded guilty
to two counts of the indictment, received a sentence of three years'
imprisonment on each count. He also entered a guilty plea to two
counts of another indictment charging violations of the same statutes
in the sale of membership certificates of Beaver Plywood Cooperative
and Co-op Loggers, and was sentenced to a term of three years on each
of those counts. All the sentences are to run consecutively, making
Errion's sentence a total of 12 years. Five other defendants, who
had previously been convicted after a trial lasting three weeks, were
sentenced to terms ranging from one year to seven years. One of
these defendants, Helen A. Davenport, filed an appeal and subsequent to the end of the fiscal year her conviction was affirmed by the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

as well as the Mail Fraud and Conspiracy Statutes.
This is reported
to be the first indictment of this type returned in the District of
Massachusetts.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed
a conviction for securities fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy of Walter
F. Tellier, head of Tellier and Company, formerly a New York

Tellier and his co-defendants Elton B. Jones and Albert Joseph Proctor had been found guilty
of all 36 counts of an indictment following a trial lasting seven weeks
in the United States District Court in Brooklyn, N ew York. The
charges related to fraud in connection with the sale of 4 series of
debentures of the Alaska Telephone Corporation, totalling approximately $900,000. The evidence had disclosed that under Tellier's
direction and supervision Tellier and Company engaged in a boilerroom securities sales operation, employing a large number of highpressure telephone salesmen and deceptive printed material.
Tellier
had been sentenced to four and one-half years' imprisonment and
fined a total of $18,000.6 Still pending against Tellier are two indictments charging fraud in the sale of more than 19,000,000 shares

DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST PERSONS PRACTICING BEFORE
THE COMMISSION

In a private investigation to determine whether Union Electric
Company and certain other persons directly or indirectly made
political contributions in violation of section 12 (h) of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, William A. Dougherty, an
attorney, testified under oath with respect to the circumstances relating to a check for $5,000 which was drawn by him to his order and
endorsed by him and was deposited dn a private bank account of
Orville E. Hodge, then Auditor of Public Accounts of the State of
illinois.
Dougherty at first testified that the check represented a
loan to a "friend" who was not a public official and whom he refused
to identify, and indicated that he did not know how the check had
reached Hodge's account. Later he was recalled and he again refused to identify the recipient of the check, claiming his privilege
against self-incrimination.
He was directed to answer pursuant to
the immunity provision of section 18 (e) of the Act, whereupon he
identified the person for whom he issued the check as Hodge and
disclosed other information which directly contradicted his prior
sworn testimony.
Private proceedings were instituted pursuant to rule II (e) of the
Commission's Rules of Practice to determine whether Dougherty
. should be temporarily or permanently denied the privilege of practicing before the Commission. After a private hearing the Commission issued its opinion 11 in which it found that Dougherty's sworn
testimony contained false and misleading statements and that in giving
such testimony he had engaged in improper professional conduct. It
ordered that Dougherty be denied the privilege of practicing before
the Commission until he obtained the Commission's approval.
Subsequently, Dougherty filed an application for reinstatement, and the
Commission, giving consideration to his age, the fact that he had
engaged in active and substantial practice for 38 years without having
been involved tin any other case of improper professional conduct,
the serious financial loss resulting from his disqurulification, his

expression of contrition and his representation that his future professional conduct would be beyond question, readmitted him to practice
before it.10
On May 5, 1957, the Commission pursuant to rule II (e) of its
Rules of Practice instituted private proceedings against Morris Mac
Schwebel, a New York attorney, to determine whether he should be
temporriy
or permanently denied the privilege of practicing before
the Commission because of unethical and improper professional conduct in connection with his representation of clients before the
Commission.
Schwebel filed a complaint ill the District Court for the District
of Columbia for a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining
order enjoining the members of the Commission from prosecuting
disciplinary proceedings against him. In granting the Commission's
motion to dismiss the complaint, the District Court held that, because
00: the particular delicacy of an attorney's good reputation, it had
jurisdiction to determine whether the Commission had authority to
maintain the rule II (e) proceeding without first requiring Schwebel
to exhaust his administrative remedies, but that under the Commission's general statutory powers to prescribe rules necessary for the
execution of its functions the Commission has implied authority to
establish qualifications for attorneys practicing before it and to take
disciplinary action against those found guilty of unethical professional conduct. The Court further held that the Commission had
not violated section 9 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act in
instituting the proceeding without first giving Schwebel an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance,"
An appeal was taken by Schwebel to the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Oircuit which, in a per curiam decision, affirmed
the decision of the District Court, stating, "though we think the
District Court was right ill dismissing the complaint, we think the
plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedy and the court
therefore erred in ruling on the Commission's authority to disbar
attorneys." 12 Schwebel filed a petition for writ of certiorari which
was denied on ApriJI 7, 1958.13
The Commission's administrative proceeding under rule II (e) was
pending at the close of the fiscal year.

tion of the information received from these or other sources, it appears
that violations may have occurred, a preliminary investigation may
be made. In some cases the preliminary investigation will disclose
a violation due to ignorance of the law or some misunderstanding and,
where no serious harm to the public is involved, no further action is
ordinarily taken, except to inform the offender of the violation and
to insure that steps are taken for future compliance.
However, if the preliminary investigation indicates a more serious
violation or the need to acquire more facts, the case is docketed and
a full investigation is made, sometimes involving the issuance by the
Commission of a formal order of investigation appointing members
of its staff as officers to issue subpoenas and take testimony under oath.
During the year, seventy-six formal orders of investigation were
issued. Care is exercised by the Commission and its staff to keep
investigations private until some official action is taken by the Commission. The non-public nature of the investigation serves to protect innocent parties who may be involved and contributes largely
to the effectiveness of such investigations.
After an investigation has been completed and reviewed by both
the regional office concerned and the Division of Trading and Exchanges, a report of the investigation prepared by the regional office
is submitted to the Commission for decision together with the recommendations of the regional and principal office. The Commission
then has several courses of action available to it.
If it decides the public interest requires criminal action be taken,
the Commission may refer the evidence to the Department of Justice.
In such a case members of the staff most familiar with the situation
assist the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney
assigned to the matter in presentation of the case to the Grand Jury
and, where an indictment is returned, with the prosecution of the case.
At other times the Commission may, when such action is warranted,
authorize institution of a civil proceeding for injunctive relief or
institute administrative proceedings.

TVVENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL

REPORT

The Commission may, if it considers it appropriate, close the investigation. A case may be closed when all possible legal steps have
been taken or when any action taken would be ineffective; for example,
when the subject has fled the country with little chance of his return
or when the damage is so slight that further action is not warranted.
Before a case is closed, however, it is carefully examined by both the
staff of the regional officeconcerned and the staff of the principal office
to determine if any other course of action is practical or warranted
before closing is recommended to the Commission.

activities of the Commission during the fiscal year:

ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS WITH RESPECT TO CANADIAN SECURITIES

The Commission continues to be confronted with serious enforcement problems arising from the offer and sale of securities by Canadian issuers and broker-dealers in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act. Solution of these problems remains
difficult since the Commission is without authority to conduct investigations outside the United States and the evidence necessary to
establish proof of such violations in most of these cases, as well as the
violators, are usually located in a foreign country, beyond our subpena power. However, action is taken by the Commission to prohibit such violations in cases where personal service can be obtained
in the United States.
The problems arising under the Supplementary Extradition Convention between the United States and Canada and the narrow construction placed on this agreement by Canadian courts were discussed
in the 22nd Annual Report. Negotiations seeking to solve this problem are continuing through appropriate diplomatic channels.
In the meantime, effective enforcement work in this area is dependent almost wholly upon cooperation between this Commission and
the Canadian provincial enforcement authorities. There is no Do486867-59-13

mimon securities legislation, but each Province has its own legislation. In general excellent cooperation has been obtained during
the fiscal year from the Provinces in the enforcement work of the
Commission. Upon being supplied by this Commission with evidence that Canadian residents were engaged in violating the laws of
the United States some of the Provinces have taken action under their
respective statutes. The Canadian registrations of six broker-dealers
were canceled or suspended by provincial authorities during the past
fiscal year following receipt of information supplied by this Commission.
With the cooperation of Canadian authorities this Commission
brought three injunctive actions during the past .fiscal year based
upon the illegal sale of Canadian securities in the United States.
Additional details concerning these actions, in S. E. O. v, James O.
Graye, doing business as J. O. Graye 00. et al., S. E. o. v, Alan Russell
Securities, Inc.; and S. E. O. v, J. H. Lederer 00., Inc., are described
above in the section on Litigation under the Securities Act of 1933.14
Further proceedings were also had in the case of S. E. O. v, Kaieer
Development Corporation. Limited and E. David Novelle, referred to
in the 23rd Annual Report," Permanent injunctions were issued by
the court, restraining the defendants from further violations of the
registration and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act.
The Commission continues to maintain its "Canadian Restricted
List," which is a list of the names of Canadian issuers whose securities the Commission has reason to believe recently have been, or currently are being, offered and sold in the United States in violation of
the Securities Act of 1933. The list is designed to warn investors
of the possible risks involved in their purchase of unregistered Canadian securities and to alert broker-dealers to possible illegal distributions of Canadian securities so they may avoid participation in
such distributions.
Names are added to and deleted from this list as circumstances
warrant. During the fiscal year 1958, fourteen supplements were
issued which added .fifty names to the list and deleted two others.
On May 5, 1958, the Canadian Restricted List was revised and consolidated, resulting in the deletion of the names of seventy-nine companies concerning whose securities the Commission had no evidence
of a public offering and sale in the United States during the last five
years," In many instances, the companies were no longer in existence. This list as presently constituted, totals 201 names .

SECTION OF SECURITIES VIOLATIONS

A Section of Securities Violations is maintained by the Commission
as a part of its enforcement program to provide a further means of
detecting and preventing fraud in securities transactions. The Section maintains files providing a clearing house for other enforcement
agencies for information concerning persons who have been charged
with violations of various Federal and State securities statutes. Considerable information is also available concerning violators resident
in the provinces of Canada. The specialized information in these files

TWENTY-FOURTH

ANNUAL REPORT

181

is kept current through the cooperation of the United States Post
Office Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, parole and
probation officials, State securities authorities, Federal and State
prosecuting attorneys, police officers, better business bureaus, chambers of commerce and other agencies. At the end of the fiscal year
these records contained information concerning 65,563 persons against
whom Federal or State action had been taken in connection with
securities violations. In keeping these records current, there were
added during the fiscal year items of information concerning 8,942
persons, including 2,959 persons not previously identified in these
records.
The Section issues and distributes quarterly a Securities Violations
Bulletin containing information received during the period concerning violators and showing new charges and developments in pending
cases. The Bulletin includes a "Wanted" section listing the names
and references to bulletins containing descriptive information as to
persons wanted on securities violations charges. The Bulletin is distributed to a limited number of cooperating law enforcement officials
in the United States and Canada.
Extensive use is made of the information available in these records
by regulatory and law enforcing officials. During the past year the
Commission received 3,475 "securities violations" letters or reports
and dispatched 1,633 communications to cooperating agencies.
ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

Successive reports of the Commission have called attention to the
fact that the detailed provisions of the several acts administered by
the Commission recognize the importance of dependable informative
financial statements which disclose the financial status and earnings
history of a corporation or other commercial entity. These statements, whether filed in compliance with the statutes administered by
the Commission or included in other material available to stockholders
or prospective investors, are indispensable to investors as a basis for
investment decisions.
The Congress recognized the importance of these statements and
that they lend themselves readily to misleading inferences or even
deception, whether or not intended. It accordingly dealt extensively
in the several statutes administered by the Commission with financial
statement presentation and the disclosure requirements necessary to
set forth fairly the financial condition of the company. Thus, for
example, the Securities Act requires the inclusion in the prospectus
of balance sheets and profit and loss statements "in such form as the
Commission shall prescribe" 17 and authorizes the Commission to pre11 Section

10(a) (1). (SchedUle A, pars. 25, 26).

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

scribe the "items or details to be shown in the balance sheet and earnings statement, and the methods to be followed in the preparation of
accounts * * *.":18 Similar authority is contained in the Securities
Exchange Act,:l9 and more comprehensive power is embodied in the
Investment Company Act 20 and the Holding Company ActP
The Securities Act provides that the financial statements required
to be made available to the public through filing with the Commission shall be certified by "an independent public or certified accountant." 22 The other three statutes permit the Commission to require
that such statements be accompanied by a certificate of an independent public accountant," and the Commission's rules require, with
minor exceptions, that they be so certified. The value of certification
by qualified accountants has been conceded for many years, but the
requirement as to independence, long recognized and adhered to by
some individual accountants, was for the first time authoritatively
and explicitly introduced into law in 1933. Out of this initial provision in the Securities Act and the rules promulgated by the Commission," and the action taken by the Commission in certain cases,"
have grown concepts of accountant-client relationships that have
strengthened the protection given to investors.
The Commission's standards of independence are stated in rule
2-01, paragraphs (b) and (c), of Regulation S-X which provides
among other things that "an accountant will be considered not independent with respect to any person or any of its parents or subsidiaries in whom he has, or had during the period of report, any
direct financial interest or any material indirect financial interest;
or with whom he is, or was during such period, connected as a promoter, underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer or employee." 26
In determining whether an accountant may in fact be not independent
with respect to a particular person, the Commission will give appropriate consideration to all relevant circumstances, including evidence bearing on all relationships between the accountant and that
person or any affiliate thereof.
In the recent revision of this rule the Commission has recognized
the impact of mergers and the growth of corporations through widespread affiliations. The emphasis in the rule has been changed to

make it clear that where the relationships described in the rule exist
the Commission will find that an accountant is in fact not independent with respect to the company involved, but in those instances
where lack of independence is not established the Commission will
make no finding with respect to the accountant's independence.
Several situations, described in the 22nd and 23rd Annual Reports,
in which accountants were not eligible under our rules to certify
financial statements because they were lacking in independence continue to cause difficulty. In many of these instances the accountants
and their clients were coming in contact with the Commission's filing
requirements for the first time and the reason for the lack of independence was ownership by a member of the accounting firm of
stock of the client company during some of the periods certified. In
other cases the accountant or his firm may have been interested in
serving the client's management, or in some cases large stockholders,
in several capacities and in doing so had not taken care to maintain a clear distinction between giving advice to management and
serving as personal representatives of management or owners in making business decisions for them. Many of these problems could be
avoided if the accountants would look forward to the day when the
public interest in their clients would require certification of financial
statements by independent public accountants.
As shown above, the statutes administered by the Commission give
it broad rule-making power with respect to the preparation and
presentation of financial statements. Pursuant to authority contained in the statutes the Commission has prescribed uniform systems
of accounts for companies subject to the Holding Company Act; 27
has adopted rules under the Securities Exchange Act governing accounting and auditing of securities brokers and dealers; and has promulgated rules contained in a single, comprehensive regulation,
identified as Regulation S-X,2S which govern the form and content of
financial statements filed in compliance with the several acts. This
regulation is implemented by the Commission's Accounting Series
releases, of which 80 have so far been issued. These releases were
inaugurated in 1937, and were designed as a program for making
public, from time to time, opinions and accounting principles, for the
purpose of contributing to the development of uniform standards
and practice in major accounting questions. The rules and regulations thus established, except for the uniform systems of accounts,
prescribe accounting to be followed only in certain basic respects.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In the large area not covered by such rules, the Commission's principal
reliance for the protection of investors is on the determination and
application of accounting principles and auditing standards which
are recognized as sound and which have attained general acceptance.
Since changes and new developments in financial and economic
conditions affect the operations and financial status of the several
thousand commercial and industrial companies required to file statements with the Commission, accounting and auditing procedures cannot remain static and continue to serve well a dynamic economy. It
is necessary for the Commission to be informed of the changes and
new developments in these fields and to make certain that the effects
thereof are properly reported to investors. The Commission's accounting staff, therefore, engages in studies of the changes and new
developments for the purpose of establishing and maintaining appropriate accounting and auditing policies, procedures and practices
for the protection of investors. The primary responsibility for this
program rests with the chief accountant of the Commission who has
general supervision with respect to accounting and auditing policies
and their application.
Progress in these activities requires constant contact and cooperation between the staff and accountants both individually and through
such representative groups as, among others, the American Accounting Association, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the American Petroleum Institute, the Controllers Institute of
America, the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, the National Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, as
well as other government agencies. Recognizing the importance of
cooperation in the formulation of accounting principles and practices,
adequate disclosure and auditing procedures which will best serve
the interests of investors, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, the Controllers Institute of America, and the National
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies regularly appoint committees which maintain liaison with the Commission's staff.
The many daily decisions of the Commission require the almost
constant attention of some of the chief accountant's staff. These include questions raised by each of the operating divisions of the Commission, the regional officesand the Commission. This day-to-day activity of the Commission and the need to keep abreast of current
accounting problems cause the chief accountant's staff to spend much
time in the examination and re-examination of sound and generally
accepted accounting and auditing principles and practices. From
time to time members of this staff are called upon to assist in field
investigations, to participate in hearings and to review opinions,
insofar as they pertain to accounting matters.

TWENTY-FOURTH

ANNUAL REPORT

185

Prefiling and other conferences, in person or by telephone, with officials of corporations, practicing accountants and others, occupy a
considerable amount of the available time of the staff. This procedure, which has proven to be one of the most important functions of
the office of the chief accountant, and of the chief accountant of the
Division of Corporation Finance and his staff, saves registrants and
their representatives both time and expense.
Many specific accounting and auditing problems arise as a result of
the examination of financial statements required to be filed with the
Commission. 'Where examination reveals that the rules and regulations of the Commission have not been complied with or that applicable generally accepted accounting principles have not been adhered to, the examining division usually notifies the registrant by an
informal letter of comment. These letters of comment and the correspondence or conferences that follow continue to be a most convenient and satisfactory method of effecting corrections and improvements in financial statements, both to registrants and to the
Commission's staff. Where particularly difficult or novel questions
arise which cannot be settled by the accounting staff of the divisions
and by the chief accountant, they are referred to the Commission for
consideration and decision. By these administrative procedures the
Commission deals with many accounting questions.
Inquiries in ever-increasing volume as to the propriety of particular accounting practices come from accountants and from companies
not presently subject to any of the acts administered by the Commission who wish to have the benefit of the Commission's views and
thus utilize and apply the Commission's experience to the facts of
their own case. Teachers of accounting and their students also use
the public files and confer with the staff in the study of accounting
problems.
Cooperation between the Commission and professional groups interested in improving financial reporting has been mentioned. An
example is the publication in April, 1958, by the Committee on Accounting Procedure of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants of its Accounting Research Bulletin No. 49 dealing with
a number of the problems arising in connection with the computation
of earnings per share and the presentation of such statistics in prospectuses, proxy material and annual reports to shareholders and
in the compilation of business earnings statistics for the press,
statistical services and other publications.
Appropriate determination of earnings per share has been a frequent subject for comment by the staff in connection with filings
with the Commission. A decrease in improper presentations since
publication of the bulletin may fairly be credited in part to the wide

186

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

distribution of the bulletin. Such literature contributes to greater
uniformity in financial reporting, improves investor understanding,
and decreases staff time spent in processing material filed with the
Commission.
A further example of the importance of cooperation between the
staff and professional accounting organizations is found in the Commission's authorization for its chief accountant to serve as a member
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Special
Committee on Research Program. This committee, the other members of which are leaders of the accounting profession in public and
private practice and in teaching, was appointed to consider a new
approach to accounting research. Since investors in securities depend upon the results of the accounting process, it is appropriate
that the Commission be represented in this endeavor to find a better
means for the development of generally accepted accounting principles which serve as a guide for independent accountants practicing
before the Commission.
Some significant characteristics of the past year in the accounting
field may be mentioned. As in the prior two years, accounting for
mergers has again required much staff time in conferences with registrants and their accountants. Usually the problem has been to
determine the propriety of applying the pooling of interests concept
which avoids the booking of goodwill by using the accounting basis
of the constituent companies and permits the carrying forward of
the earned surplus of the parties to the merger.
In contrast to this desire of established companies to avoid the
recognition of intangibles is the insistence by promoters of new ventures to place excessive valuations on the books for both tangible and
intangible properties. Examples during the past year have been
reminiscent of the early days of the Commission when it was found
necessary to deal vigorously with promotional ventures in which
shares of the issuer's stock were exchanged for assets of doubtful
value but were recorded at the par value of the shares issued. For
an example of this kind see the discussion of the Commission's decision In the Matter of the Fall River Power Oompany29 at page 39
of this report.
Another characteristic of the past year has been the number of
cases coming to the attention of our accountants in which a change
in accounting policy has been adopted or desired. Where a change
has appeared to be motivated by a desire to improve current earnings
by deferring the expensing of incurred costs, we have objected unless
it could be shown that the new method was clearly in the interest
of improved financial reporting in the long run. Accounting for
.. Securities Act Release No. 3932 (;rune 4,1958).

TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

187

research and development costs for new products or expansion into
new sales territories are examples of this problem which require
further study.
Of a somewhat different order but a problem requiring further
study is the matter of accounting for pensions and other forms of
deferred compensation. There are so many difficulties in the way
of determining the amounts involved and the proper allocation of
such costs to accounting periods that a considerable lack of uniformity in accounting treatment persists between companies and between periods in the same company. Improvement in reported
earnings resulting from omission of any charge for pensions is an
extreme example of the problem which seems to be vulnerable to
severe criticisms but which has been defended when pensions have
been overfunded in prior years. These and other problems in the
reporting of corporate income are receiving active consideration by
the accounting profession and by the Commission's accounting staff.
OPINIONS OF THE COMMISSION

Opinions are issued by the Commission in contested and other cases
arising under the statutes .administered by it and under the Commission's Rules of Practice, where the nature of the matter to be
decided, whether substantive or procedural, is of sufficient importance
to warrant a formal expression of views. These opinions include
detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law based on evidentiary
records taken before a hearing examiner who serves independently of
the operating divisions, or, in an occasional case, before a single Commissioner or the entire Commission. In some cases, formal hearings
are waived by the parties and the findings and conclusions are based
on stipulated facts or .admissions.
The Commission is assisted in the preparation of findings and opinions by its Officeof Opinion Writing, a staff officecompletely independent of the operating divisions of the Commission and directly responsible to the Commission itself. The independence of the staff members
of this office reflects the principle, embodied in the Administrative
Procedure Act, of a separation between staff members performing
investigatory or prosecutory functions and those performing quasijudicial functions. In some cases, with the consent of all parties, the
interested operating division participates in the drafting of opinions.
Opinions are publicly released and distributed to representatives of
the press and to persons on the Commission's mailing list. In addition, the opinions are printed and published by the Government Printing Office in bound volumes entitled "Securities and Exchange Commission Decisions and Reports."
During the fiscal year 1958, the Commission issued findings and
opinions and other rulings in 121 cases of an adversary nature.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

APPUCATIONS FOR NON.DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN INFORMATION

The Commission is authorized under the various Acts administered
by it to grant requests for non-disclosure of certain types of information which would otherwise be disclosed to the public in applications,
reports or other documents filed pursuant to these statutes. Thus,
under paragraph (30) of Schedule A of the Securities Act of 1933, disclosure of any portion of a material contract is not required if the
Commission determines that such disclosure would impair the value
of the contract and is not necessary for the protection of the investors.
Under section 24 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trade
secrets or processes need not be disclosed in any material filed with the
Commission, and under section 24 (b) of that Act written objection
to public disclosure of information contained in any such material may
be made to the Commission which is then authorized to make public
disclosure of such information only if in its judgment such disclosure
is in the public interest. Similar provisions are contained in section
22 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and in section
45 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. These statutory provisions have been implemented by rules outlining the procedure to be
followed by persons applying to the Commission for a determination
that public disclosure is not necessary in a particular case.

STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES

The Section of Economic Research provides the Commission with
statistical information needed in the administration of the Securities
Acts and furnishes financial data to the Congress and other government agencies as part of the overall Government Statistical Program
under the direction of the Bureau of the Budget.
The regular statistical series which are prepared include data on
securities effectively registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
offerings of securities by all corporations in the United States (including issues not registered with the Commission, such as privately
placed issues and railroad securities), retirements of corporate securi-

ties, net change in corporate securities outstanding, stock prices and
trading. The research and statistical activity carried out under the
direction of the Bureau of the Budget includes individuals' saving in
the United States, income flow and investments of private pension
funds of United States corporations, current liquid position of United
States corporations, sources and uses of corporate funds, anticipated
expenditures for plant and equipment by United States businesses,
and a quarterly financial report for all United States manufacturing
concerns.
During the past year special effort was devoted to improvement in
methodology and source data for several of these series. A special
project was undertaken to re-examine the industrial classification of
all listed companies to comply with the revised Standard Industrial
Code of the Government, the revised codes for each company to be
published during the 1959 fiscal year. Plans were also laid for a detailed survey of the assets and liabilities of all registered brokers and
dealers in the United States. During the year data were prepared for
two papers, the first of which was entitled "Implications of Pension
Fund Accumulations" delivered in September, 1957,before the American Statistical Association, and the second of which was "The Structure and Realization of Business Investment Anticipations" presented
in November, 1957, at the Conference on the .Quality and Economic
Significance of Anticipation Data, National Bureau of Economic Research. There was also participation during the year in plans of the
National Bureau of Economic Research for a major study of the
Nation's pension funds. Certain basic data derived from the Commission's surveys of corporate pension funds are to be provided in this
study.
The statistical series described below are published in the Commission's Statistical Bulletin and in addition, except for data on registered
issues, current figures and analyses of the data are published in quarterly press releases. The Commission's stock price index is released
weekly, together with the data on round-lot and odd-lot trading on
the two New York stock exchanges.
The various statistical series are as follows:
Issues Registered Under the Securities Act of 1933

Monthly and quarterly statistics are compiled on the number and
volume of registered securities, classified by industry of issuer, type
of security, and use of proceeds. Data for the 1958 fiscal year appear
on page 30-32 and in appendix tables 1 and 2.
New Securities

Offerings

This is a monthly and quarterly series covering all new corporate and non-corporate issues offered for cash sale in the United

190

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

States. The series includes not only issues publicly offered but also
issues privately placed, as well as other issues exempt from registration under the Securities Act such as intrastate offerings and railroad securities. The offerings series includes only securities actually
offered for cash sale, and only issues offered for account of issuers.
Annual statistics on new offerings since 1953, as well as monthly figures from .Tanuary 1957 through .Iune 1958, are given in appendix
tables 3 and 4. A summary of the data is shown annually from
1934through June 1958in appendix table 5.
Corporate Securities Outstanding

Estimates of the net cash flow through securities transactions are
prepared quarterly and are derived by deducting from the amount
of estimated gross proceeds received by corporations through the
sale of securities the amount of estimated gross payments by corporations to investors for securities retired. Data on gross issues, retirements and net change in securities outstanding are presented for
all corporations and for the principal industry groups.
Stock Market Data

Statistics are regularly compiled on the market value and volume
of sales on registered and exempted securities exchanges, round-lot
stock transactions of the New York exchanges for accounts of members and non-members, odd-lot stock transactions on the New York
exchanges, special offerings and secondary distributions.
Indexes
of stock market prices are compiled, based upon the weekly closing
market prices of 265 common stocks listed on the New York Stock
Exchange. The indexes are composed of 7 major industry groups,
29 subordinated groups, and a composite group.
Saving Study

The Commission compiles quarterly estimates of the volume and
composition of individuals' saving in the United States. The series
represent net increases in individuals' financial assets less net increases
in debt. The study shows the aggregate amount of saving and the
form in which the saving occurred, such as investment in securities, expansion of bank deposits, increase in insurance and pension reserves,
etc. The Commission has been cooperating in a program on national
saving covering government, business and individuals' saving, and several changes and improvements have been made in the saving series in
the course of the last fiscal year. A reconciliation of the Commission's
estimates with the personal saving estimates of the Department of
Commerce, derived in connection with its national income series, is
published annually by the Commerce Department as well as in the
Securities and Exchange Commission Statistical Bulletin.

TWENTY-FOURTH

ANNUAL REPORT

191

Corporate Pension Funds

An annual survey is made of pension plans of all United States
corporations where funds are administered by corporations themselves, or through trustees. The survey shows the flow of money into
these funds, the types of assets in which the funds are invested and
the principal items of income and expenditures.
Financial Position of Corporations

The series on working capital position of all United States corporations, excluding banks, insurance companies and savings and loan
associations, shows the principal components of current assets and
liabilities, and also contains an abbreviated analysis of the sources
and uses of corporate funds.
The Commission, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission,
compiles a quarterly financial report for all United States manufacturing concerns. This report gives complete balance sheet data and an
abbreviated income account, data being classified by industry and
size of company.
Plant and Equipment

Expenditures

The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce, conducts quarterly and annual surveys of actual and anticipated plant
and equipment expenditures of all United States business, exclusive
of agriculture. Shortly after the close of each quarter, data are released on actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated
expenditures for the next two quarters. In addition, a survey is made
at the beginning of each year of the plans for business expansion
during that year.
PUBLIC DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

As indicated, one of the basic objectives of the Federal securities
laws is the public disclosure of financial and other information with
respect to securities so that they may be realistically appraised by
the investing public. Not only is the Commission a repository for a
vast amount of such information concerning several thousand companies which are subject to the Commission's registration and reporting <requirements, but the data receive widespread circulation among
members of the investing public through the medium of the prospectus on new issues, through the financial press and through various
securities manuals and statistical services used extensively by securities firms, investment advisers, investment companies, trust departments, insurance companies and others. Thus, the analysis and
evaluation of their securities by a broad segment of investors is made
possible.

192

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

To facilitate public dissemination of :financial and other proposals
filed with and actions by the Commission, a daily News Digest is
issued to the press containing a resume of these filings and actions.
For example, the News Digest contained a synopsis of each financing
proposal reflected in the 779 registration statements filed during the
year, as well as the 134 filings by investment companies increasing
the amount of securities previously registered.
Much of this information is published in the daily newspapers and in financial and
other periodicals.
Furthermore, most of the Commission's official
pronouncements take the form of orders, decisions and rules, copies
of which are issued in "release" form to mailing lists comprising the
names of persons who have requested particular types of releases.
During the year, a total of 800 such releases were issued and distributed to these lists; and a resume of each was included in the
News Digest. Another 77 releases were issued announcing the results
of the Commission's regular statistical studies referred to at page 188
hereof. An additional 173 releases were issued announcing actions
with respect to court injunctions and criminal prosecutions, plus 33
miscellaneous releases.
In order that the investing public may better understand the Commission's role of investor protection, the Chairman, other members of
the Commission and staff officials frequently deliver addresses before
local groups or participate in radio or television discussions of the
Commission's functions and activities.
They also address professional and trade bodies to discuss particular aspects of the Commission's law enforcement activities or its general policies and practices.
In addition, they make themselves available for interview by representatives of the press, individually or collectively, particularly when
visiting financial centers throughout the country.
To alert the public to the risks involved in buying securities from
unknown sources, such as the "boiler room" operators discussed in
Part I of this report, the Commission has distributed more than
60,000 copies of an "Investors Beware" poster setting forth a 10-point
guide for prospective purchasers of securities.' With the cooperation
1 The
poster warns Investors to observe the following ten-point guide to safer
investments :
1. Before buying . • • Think!
2. Don't deal with strange securities flrms.
(Consult your broker!)
3. Beware of securities offered over the telephone by strangers.
4. Don't listen to high-pressure sales talk.
5. Beware of promises of spectacular profits.
6. Be sure you understand the risks of loss.
7. Don't buy on tips and rumors ...
Get all the facts I
8. Tell the salesman to: Put all the information and advice in writing and mail
it to you ..•
Save it I
9. If you don't understand all the written information ...
Consult a person
who does.
10. Give at least as much consideration to buying securities as you would the purchase of any valuable property.

TWENTY-FOURTH

of the Post Office Department copies of the poster have been placed
on the bulletin boards of all post offices in the United States and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has assisted the Commission
in distributing copies of the poster to all insured banks. In addition, copies have also been distributed to state securities commissioners,
securities exchanges, brokers and dealers, better business bureaus,
chambers of commerce and other organizations interested in the prevention of fraud in the offer and sale of securities.
Information

Available lor Public Inspection

During every fiscal year thousands of requests for information are
received by mail and through telephone calls and personal visits.
Most of these requests are answered by employees in the Commission's
public reference rooms in 'lVashington, Chicago, and New York City.
The files of the Commission provide information of interest to a
large cross section of the public. Numerous people visit the public
reference rooms seeking information on which to base decisions to
buy or sell securities; they are furnished the files which contain financial and other information about the issuers of the securities. Many
visitors, on the other hand, consult Commission records. They may
be representatives of business or financial journals, or students doing
research for theses or other projects. Research of a slightly different
nature is carried on by representatives of legal and accounting firms,
corporations and labor unions; they are interested largely in gathering information to be used as specimens, as precedent material, or
for other specialized purposes. The inquiries received through the
mails and over the telephone follow the same pattern .
. Copies of any public information filed with the Commission may be
examined at the principal officein Washington, D. C. Such information includes registration statements, applications and declarations
filed under the various statutes administered by the Commission, together with the records of agency action. In Washington, as in the
regional offices,space considerations have necessitated the transfer of
some of this material to warehouse-type space in nearby federal
records centers. Files from these centers are usually available within twenty-four hours.
The New York Regional Office has copies of recent filings made
by companies having securities listed on exchanges other than the
New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange," and
copies of current filings of many companies which have effective reg.. Reports of Hsted companies
seen at the exchange offices.

All regional officeshave copies of prospectuses used in recent public
offerings of securities registered under the Securities Act, of active
broker-dealer and investment adviser registration applications originating in their respective regions and of Regulation A letters of notification filed in their respective regions.
The public reference room in Washington had about 3,400 visitors
during the fiscal year. Requests were filled for an additional 28,500
persons who were sent almost 660,000 copies of Commission publications. More than 112,000 photocopy pages of information were
sold pursuant to over 2,000 orders.
Additional thousands of persons made use of the facilities provided by the New York and Chicago public reference rooms.

ORGANIZATION

The staff of the Commission is composed of lawyers, accountants,
engineers, security analysts and examiners, and administrative and
clerical employees. It is divided into divisions and offices,including
nine regional offices and eight branch offices.
Under the Commission's program of continuing review of its organization and functions, a number of changes were made during
the fiscal year in the interest of increased efficiency.
On December 15, 1957, the New York Regional Officewas realigned
to provide for a more functional organization. Corporate reorganization work under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act was transferred
from the Branch of Operations to a new Branch of Reorganization.
The remaining functions of the former Branch of Operations, i. e.,
interpretative work and the administration of Regulation A, were
assigned to a new Branch of Interpretations and Small Issues.
In December 1957, a Branch of Examination and Training was
established in the Division of Corporation Finance for the purpose
of initiating, developing and executing a training program for professional employees assigned to the Division. The training activities
of this Branch supplement those conducted in the various Branches
of Corporate Analysis and Examination as part of the day-to-day
employee development resulting from work assignments. All new
employees are assigned to the Branch of Examination and Training
for intensive job instruction, as are middle-level employees who
have demonstrated the growth potential for supervisory positions.
The Commission established a Branch Office of the Atlanta Regional Office in Miami, Florida, on March 3, 1958, and a Branch
Office of the Fort Worth Regional Office in Houston, Texas, on
April 14, 1958.31 The establishment of these Branch Officeswill not
increase overall personnel requirements but will enable the Commission to increase the effectiveness of its investigative activities and its
broker-dealer inspection program in those areas in the public interest.

During fiscal 1958 the Commission continued to give specicial
emphasis to its ~ecruitmentprogram designed to attract outstanding
college and law school graduates for starting professional level positions such as financial analyst, attorney, and investigator. Through
on-campus ~nterviewsand contacts with the placement offices of various colleges and universities, the Commission was successful in appointing to its staff a substantial number of well qualified applicants
of college caliber.
On March 31,1958 the Commission approved a Promotion P r o g r m ~

were solicited. Merit Promotion Plans which implement these policies
and guidelines systematically in specific groups of positions are being
developed and will be adopted by January 1, 1959.
The proper allocation of top level positions continues to be of
utmost importance to the Commission for the effective execution of
its programs. In the interest of attracting and retaining highly
qualified persons for these positions, recommendations for the allocation of additional positions to grades GS-16, G8-17 and GS-18 were
presented to the Civil Service Commission.
The passage of the Government Employees Training Act on July
7, 1958 for the first time provides the Commission with general training authority.
As required under this Act, a complete review of
the needs and requirements of the Commission for the training of
its employees win be made and a suitable program providing far
in-service, mter-agency or out-service training to meet identified
needs and requirements will be established.
During fiscal 1958, special health programs for the benefit of the
staff were undertaken in the Commission. On November 6, 1957, 140
members of the staff in Washington were inoculated against Asian
influenza. Sixty-four employees in the regional offices also received
this inoculation under programs arranged by Regional Administrators.
The first and second of a series of three inoculations of anti-polio
vaccine were administered under the direction of a private physician
on March 3 and March 25, 1958, respectively. A total of 121 employees participated in this program which was sponsored by the
Commission's Employee Recreation and Welfare Association.
Recognition of career service with the Commission, meritorious
work performance awards and public recognition in the form of
awards made by outside organizations for outstanding achievements
by staff members continued to be stressed under the Commission's
incentive awards program. In September 1957, ten- and twenty-year
service pins and certificates were presented to a total of 51 employees
for service with the Commission. Six employees were awarded $195
for adopted suggestions. Cash awards totalling $5,805 and certificates of merit were presented to 66 employees.
Mr. Robert S. Wood of the Budget and Finance office was one of
120 successful candidates out of a total of 236 nominations submitted
by government agencies for participation dn the Civil Service Commission's 1958 Management Intern Program. In May 1958, a Certificate of Merit was awarded to Jule B. Greene, Attorney~in-Charge
of the Commission's Miami Branch Office, by the William A. Jump
Memorial Foundation.
In June 1958, the National Civil Service
League awarded certificates of merit to four Commission employees-

Canons of Ethics for Members of the Commission

The Commission for many years has had a Regulation regarding
conduct of Members and Employees and Former Members and Employees of the Commission, which was codified in substantially its
present form in 1953. This regulation prohibits any member or employee of the Commission from, among other things, acting in any
official matter with respect to which there exists a personal interest
incompatible with an unbiased exercise of official judgment; accepting, directly or indirectly, any valuable gift, favor, or service from
any person with whom he transacts official business; and becoming
unduly involved, through frequent or expensive social engagements
or otherwise, with any person outside the Government with whom
he transacts official business.
Supplementary to the overall Conduct Regulation, on July 22,
1958 the Commission adopted Canons of Ethics for Members of
the Commission. These canons, which are presented in appendix
table 30, set forth standards which the Commission has always believed are applicable to its executive, legislative and judicial responsibilities. They include statements of principle with respect to,
among other things, Commission members' personal conduct, maintenance of independence, relationships with persons subject to agency
regulation and avoidance of appearances of improper influence.

of Ethics

far Members
Commission:

of the

Securities

and Bechanoe

PREAMBLE
Members of the 'f';pcurities and Exchange Commtsslon are entrusted by various
enactments of the Congress with powers and duties of great social and economic significance to the American people. It is their task to regulate varied
aspects of the American economy, within the limits prescribed by Congress,
to insure that our private enterprise system serves the welfare of all citizens.
Their success in this endeavor is a bulwark against possible abuses and injustice which, if left unchecked, might jeopardize the strength of our economic
institutions.
It is imperative that the members of this Commission continue to conduct
themselves in their official and personal relationships in a manner which com.
mands the respect and confidence of their fellow citizens. Members of this
Commission should continue to be mindful of, and strictly abide by, the standards of personal conduct set forth in its Regulation regarding Conduct of
Members and Employees and Former Members and Employees of the Commission, most of which has been in effect for many years and which was codified
in substantially its present form in 1953. Rule 1 of said Regulation enunciates
a General Statement of Policy as follows:
"Lt is deemed contrary to Commission policy for a member or employee of
the Commission to-"(a) engage, directly or indirectly, in any personal business transaction
or private arrangement for personal profit which accrues from or is based
upon his official position or authority or upon confidential information
which he gains by reason of such position or authority;
.. (b) accept, directly or indirectly, any valuable gift, favor, or service
from any person with Whom he transacts business on behalf of the United
States;
"(c) discuss or entertain proposals for future employment by any person
outside the Government with whom he is transacting business on behalf
of the United States;
"( d) divulge confidential commercial or economic information to any
unauthorized person, or release any such information in advance of authorization for its release;
"(e) become unduly involved, through frequent or expensive social engagements or otherwise, with any person outside the Government with whom
he transacts business on behalf of the United States; or
"(f) act in any official matter with respect to which there exists a
personal interest incompatible with an unbiased exercise of official judgment.
"(g) fail reasonably to restrict his personal business affairs so as to avoid
conflicts of interest with his official duties."
In addition to the continued observance of these foregoing principles of
personal conduct, it is fitting and proper for the members of this Commission
to restate and resubscribe to the standards of conduct applicable to its executive,
legislative and judicial responsibilities.
1. Constitutional

Obligations

The members of this Commlsslon have undertaken in their oaths of office to
support the Federal Constitution.
Insofar as the enactments of the Congress
impose executive duties upon the members, they must faithfully execute the
laws which they are charged with administering.
Members shall also care-

TWENTY-FOURTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

257

fully guard against any infringement of the constitutional rights, privileges or
immunities of those who are subject to regulation by this Commission.
2. Statutory

Obligations

In administering the law, members of this Commission should vigorously
enforce compliance with the law by all persons affected thereby. In the exercise
of the rule-making powers delegated this Commission by the Congress, members should always be concerned that the rule-making power be confined to
the proper limits of the law and be consistent with the statutory purpose expressed by the Congress. In the exercise of their judicial functions, members
shall honestly, fairly and impartially determine the rights of all persons under
the law.
3. Personal Conduct
Appointment to the office of member of this Commission is a high honor
and requires that the conduct of a member, not only in the performance of
the duties of his officebut also in his everyday life, should be beyond reproach.
4. Relationship with Other Members
Each member should recognize that his conscience and those of other members are distinct entities and that differing shades of opinion should be anticipated. The free expression of opinion is a safeguard against the domination
of this Commission by less than a majority, and is a keystone of the commission
type of administration.
However, a member should never permit his personal
opinion so to conflict with the opinion of another member as to develop animosity or unfriendliness in the Commission, and every effort should be made
to promote solidarity of conclusion.
5. Maintenance of Independence
This Commission has been established to administer laws enacted by the
Congress. Its members are appointed by the President by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate to serve terms as provided by law. However, under
the law, this is an independent Agency, and in performing their duties, members should exhibit a spirit of firm independence and reject any effort by representatives of the executive or legislative branches of the government to affect
their independent determination of any matter being considered by this Commission. A member should not be swayed by partisan demands, public clamor
or considerations of persona! popularity or notoriety; so also he should be
above fear of unjust criticism by anyone.
6. Relationship with Persons Subject to Regulation
In all matters before him, a member should administer the law without regard
to any personality Involved, and with regard only to the issues. Members should
not become indebted in any way to persons who are or may become subject to
their jurisdiction.
No member should accept loans, presents or favors of undue
value from persons who are regulated or who represent those who are regulated.
In performing their judicial functions, members should avoid discussion of a
matter with any person outside this Commission and its staff while that matter
is pending. In the performance of his rule-making and administrative functions,
a member has a duty to solicit the views of interested persons. Care must be
taken by a member in his relationship with persons within or outside of the

258

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Commission to separate the judicial and the rule-making functions and to observe
the liberties of discussion respectively appropriate.
Insofar as it is consistent
with the dignity of his official position, he should maintain contact with the persons outside the agency who may be affected by his rule-making functions, but he
should not accept unreasonable or lavish hospitality in so doing.
7. Qualification to Participate

in Particular

Matters

The question of qualification of an individual member to vote or participate
in a particular matter rests with that individual member. Each member should
weigh carefully the question of his qualification with respect to any matter
wherein he or any relatives or former business associates or clients are involved.
He should disqualify himself in the event he obtained knowledge prior to becoming a member of the facts at issue before him in a quasi-judicial proceeding,
or in other types of proceeding in any matter involving parties in whom he has
any interest or relationship directly or indirectly.
If an interested person suggests that a member should disqualify himself in a particular matter because
of bias or prejudice, the member shall be the judge of his own qualification.
8. Impressions of Influence
A member should not, by his conduct, permit the impression to prevail that
any person can improperly influence him, that any person unduly enjoys his
favor or that he is affected in any way by the rank, position, prestige or affluence
of any person.
9. Ex parte Communications
Matters of a quasi-judicial nature should be determined by a member solely
upon the record made in the proceeding and the arguments of the parties or
their counsel properly made in the regular course of such proceeding. All communications by parties or their counsel to a member in a quasi-judicial proceeding which are intended or calculated to influence action by the member should
at once be made known by him to all parties concerned. A member should not
at any time permit ex parte interviews, arguments or communications designed
to influence his action in such a matter.
10. Commission Opinions
The opinions of the Commission should state the reasons for the action taken
and contain a clear showing that no serious argument of counsel has been disregarded or overlooked. In such manner, a member shows a full understanding
of the matter before him, avoids the suspicion of arbitrary conclusion, promotes
confidence in his intellectual integrity and may contribute some useful precedent
to the growth of the law. A member should be guided in his decisions by a
deep regard for the integrity of the system of law which he administers.
He
should recall that he is not a repository of arbitrary power, but is acting on
behalf of the public under the sanction of the law.
11. Judicial

Review

The Congress has provided for review by the courts of the decisions and orders
by this Commission. Members should recognize that their obligation to preserve the sanctity of the laws administered by them requires that they pursue
and prosecute, vigorously and diligently but at the same time fairly and impartially and with dignity, all matters which they or others take to the courts
for judicial review.

TWENTY-FOURTH

ANNUAL REPORT

259

12. Legislative Proposals
Members must recognize that the changing conditions in a volatile economy
may require that they bring to the attention of the Congress proposals to
amend, modify or repeal the laws administered by them. They should urge
the Congress, whenever necessary, to effect such amendment, modification or
repeal of particular parts of the statutes which they administer. In any such
action a member's motivation should be the common weal and not the particular
interests of any particular group.
13. Investigations
The power to investigate carries with it the power to defame and destroy.
In determining to exercise their investigatory power, members should concern
themselves only with the facts known to them and the reasonable inferences
from those facts. A member should never suggest, vote for or participate in
an investigation aimed at a particular individual for reasons of animus, prejudice or vindictiveness. The requirements of the particular case alone should
induce the exercise of the investigatory power, and no public pronouncement
of the pendency of such an investigation should be made in the absence of
reasonable evidence that the law has been violated and that the public welfare
demands it.
14. The Power to Adopt Rules
In exercising its rule-making power, this Commission performs a legislative
function. The delegation of this power by the Congress imposes the obligation
upon the members to adopt rules necessary to effectuate the stated policies of the
statute in the interest of all of the people. Care should be taken to avoid the
adoption of rules which seek to extend the power of the Commission beyond
proper statutory limits. Its rules should never tend to stifle or discourage
legitimate business enterprise or activities, nor should they be interpreted so as
unduly and unnecessarily to burden those regulated with onerous obligations.
On the other hand, the very statutory enactments evidence the need for regulation, and the necessary rules should be adopted or modifications made or
rules should be repealed as changing requirements demand without fear or
favor.
15. Promptness
Each member should promptly perform the duties with which he is charged
by the statutes. The Commission should evaluate continuously its practices and
procedures to assure that it promptly disposes of all matters affecting the rights
of those regulated. This is particularly desirable in quasi-judicial proceedings.
While avoiding arbitrary action in unreasonably or unjustly forcing matters to
trial, members should endeavor to hold counsel to a proper appreciation of their
duties to the public, their clients and others who are interested. Requests for
continuances of matters should be determined in a manner consistent with this
policy.
16. Conduct Toward Parties and Their Counsel
Members should be temperate, attentive, patient and impartial when hearing
the arguments of parties or their counsel. Members should not condone unprofessional conduct by attorneys in their representation of parties. The Commission should continuously assure that its staff follows the same principles in
their relationships with parties and counsel.

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

17. Business Promotions
A member must not engage in any other business, employment or vocation
while in office, nor may he ever use the power of his office or the influence of
his name to promote the business interests of others.
18. Fiduciary

Relationships

A member should avoid serving as a fiduciary if it would interfere or seem to
interfere with the proper performance of his duties, or if the interests of those
represented require investments in enterprises which are involved in questions to
be determined by him. Such relationships would include trustees, executors,
corporate directors and the like.
19. Organization
Members and particularly the Chairman of the Commission should scrutinize
continuously its internal organization in order to assure that such organization.
handles all matters before it efficiently and expeditiously, while recognizing that
changing times bring changing emphasis in the administration of the laws.
