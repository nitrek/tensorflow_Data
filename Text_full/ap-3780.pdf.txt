ORDER ADMITTING
CORRECTED EXHIBIT 360

On March 3, 2016, the Division of Enforcement submitted a letter to my office noting
that when it filed Exhibit 360 with the Office of the Secretary, a single page was omitted (page
48). The Division represents that its February 16 motion to admit this exhibit, which I granted,
contained this omitted page. See Bennett Grp. Fin. Servs., LLC, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release

Exhibit 360 be accepted and admitted into the record. The Divisionâ€™s motion is GRANTED.
