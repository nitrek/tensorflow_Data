In the Matter of

DAWN J. BENNETT

ORDER GRANTING IN PART
JOINT MOTION TO CORRECT
RECORD INDEX

On April 15, 2016, the Commission’s Office of the Secretary (OS) issued the record
index for this proceeding under Rule of Practice 351(b), 17 C.F.R. § 201.351(b). On April 29,
2016, the parties filed a joint motion to amend and correct the record index, stipulating to a series
of corrections that, for the most part, deal with duplicate entries and filing dates. I GRANT the
parties’ following requests and ORDER OS to issue a revised record index reflecting the
following corrections:






Delete the duplicate October 13, 2015, entry for the motion to continue prehearing
conference.
Delete the duplicate January 20, 2016, entry for the Division of Enforcement’s motion for
issuance of subpoena.
Delete the duplicate January 20, 2016, entry for the Division’s witness list.
Add Respondents’ counsel’s January 4, 2016, letter, originally emailed to my office, to
the record index.
Revise the entry for the notice of withdrawal of attorneys F. Whitten Peters, Simon
Latcovich, and Jessica L. Pahl, of Williams & Connolly LLP, as counsel for Respondents
from October 13 to October 5, 2015.

I DENY the parties’ remaining requests. For those requests, the dates listed on the record
index represent the date the filing was received by OS under Rule of Practice 151, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.151. Rule 151 allows parties to file by facsimile but requires them to do so “within the
time limit set for such filing.”1 17 C.F.R. § 201.151(a). Rule of Practice 104 states that the
1

Rule 151(a) states that:

Papers required to be filed with the Commission must be received within the time
limit, if any, for such filing. Filing with the Commission may be made by
facsimile transmission if the party also contemporaneously transmits to the

Commission is open Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30
p.m. 17 C.F.R. § 201.104. Read together, these rules mean that if a party files by facsimile, the
party must do so by 5:30 p.m., or risk the possibility that the submission will be considered as
filed the next business day. Filings received by OS are date-stamped during the Commission’s
business hours the day they are received; filings received outside of the Commission’s business
hours are date-stamped on the next day the Commission is open.2 The parties’ following
requests are therefore dated appropriately in the record index:


Gregory Morvillo’s notice of appearance was received by facsimile at 5:40 p.m. on
October 21, 2015, and date-stamped that day.
Eugene Ingoglia’s notice of appearance was received by OS on October 26, 2015, and
was date-stamped that day.
Respondent’s answer was received by facsimile at 5:43 p.m. on Friday, October 30, 2015,
but was not date-stamped until the following Monday, November 2, 2015.
The Division’s witness list was received by OS on January 13, 2016, and was
date-stamped that day.
The Division’s motion for issuance of subpoena (to James Hammond) was received by
OS on January 13, 2016, and was date-stamped that day.
The Division’s opening post-hearing brief was received by facsimile at 7:08 p.m. on
March 2, 2016, and was date-stamped the following day.
The Division’s declaration of Michael J. Rinaldi was received by facsimile at 7:14 p.m.
on March 2, 2016, and was date-stamped the following day.
The Division’s March 2, 2016, letter regarding corrected Exhibit 360 was received by
facsimile at 7:37 p.m., and was date-stamped the following day.

I also deny the parties’ request to revise the language in the December 2, 2015, entry to
add “Division’s under-seal filing, dated 12/1/15, filed and received” because it is redundant. The
previous entry, dated December 1, 2015, notes the Division’s motion.
