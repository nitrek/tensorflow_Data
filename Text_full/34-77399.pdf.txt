ORDER DISMISSING PETITION FOR
REVIEW OF GUNDAKER/JORDAN
AMERICAN HOLDINGS, INC.

On December 9, 2015, Gundaker/Jordan American Holdings (a/k/a Jordan American
Holdings, Inc.), a Florida corporation (“Gundaker”), filed a petition for review of an initial
decision that revoked the registration of Gundaker’s registered securities. The Commission
issued a scheduling order directing that Gundaker and the Division of Enforcement brief the
limited issue of whether Gundaker’s petition was timely.
While this issue was being briefed by the parties, Gundaker offered to settle with the
Commission. The Commission accepted his offer and issued a settled order making findings and
revoking the registration of each class of Gundaker’s registered securities.1 In light of the
settlement, we find it appropriate to dismiss Gundaker’s petition for review.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the petition for review of Gundaker/Jordan American
Holdings is dismissed.
By the Commission.
