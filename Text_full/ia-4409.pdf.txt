In the Matter of
EVAN ANDREW ZAREFSKY

ORDER VACATING NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING
ORGANIZATION AND MUNICIPAL ADVISOR BARS
Evan Andrew Zarefsky seeks to vacate an administrative order, dated September 27,
2012 (the "Order"), to the extent that it bars him from association with any nationally recognized
statistical rating organization ("NRSRO") or municipal advisor.1 The NRSRO and municipal
advisor bars at issue were imposed based solely on conduct occurring prior to July 22, 2010, the
effective date of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.2
Accordingly, in our discretion, we vacate the Order to the extent it prohibits Evan Andrew
Zarefsky from associating with any NRSRO or municipal advisor, but otherwise leave the Order
unmodified.
By the Commission.
