REPORT ON REVIEW OF DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF REGULATION S-K
As Required by Section 108 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
I.

Introduction
A.

Congressional Mandate

On April 5, 2012, Congress passed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS
Act”) 1. Section 108 of the JOBS Act requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“Commission”) to conduct, within 180 days of enactment of the JOBS Act, a review of
Regulation S-K to determine how such requirements can be updated to modernize and simplify
the registration process. Specifically, Section 108 provides as follows:
(a) Review. — The Securities and Exchange Commission shall conduct a review of its
Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.10 et seq.) to —
(1) comprehensively analyze the current registration requirements of such regulation;
and
(2) determine how such requirements can be updated to modernize and simplify the
registration process and reduce the costs and other burdens associated with these
requirements for issuers who are emerging growth companies.
(b) Report. — Not later than 180 days after the enactment of this title, the Commission
shall transmit to Congress a report of the review conducted under subsection (a). The
report shall include the specific recommendations of the Commission on how to
streamline the registration process in order to make it more efficient and less

burdensome for the Commission and for prospective issuers who are emerging growth
companies.
B.

Scope of the Review

The staff of the Commission has conducted a review of the Regulation S-K disclosure
requirements and prepared this report pursuant to Section 108 of the JOBS Act. 2 Title I of the
JOBS Act created a new category of issuer called an “emerging growth company,” which is
defined as a company that had not completed its first registered sale of common equity securities
on or before December 8, 2011 and has total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion during
its most recently completed fiscal year. 3 Among other things, emerging growth companies can
take advantage of a variety of scaled disclosure and other accommodations, including exemptions
from or modifications to certain Regulation S-K disclosure requirements, as discussed in more
detail in Section III of this report. 4 These scaled requirements for emerging growth companies

2

The staff notes the specific mandate to analyze the “registration requirements” of Regulation S-K. As
Regulation S-K does not contain registration requirements, the staff undertook a review of Regulation S-K’s
disclosure requirements and provides recommendations on how to approach modernizing and simplifying
those requirements.

3

See JOBS Act Section 101; Securities Act of 1933 Section 2(a)(19) [15 USC 77b(a)(19)]; Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Section 3(a)(80) [15 USC 78c(a)(80)]. A company retains its status as an emerging
growth company until the earliest of the following:
•
•
•
•

4

the last day of its fiscal year during which its total annual gross revenues are $1 billion or more;
the date it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the Commission’s rules;
the date on which it has issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in the previous three years;
or
the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first registered sale of common
equity securities of the issuer.

The scaled requirements for emerging growth companies were effective upon enactment without the need
for rulemaking by the Commission. Title I of the JOBS Act is based on a recommendation of the IPO Task
Force in its October 2011 report presented to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The IPO Task Force
developed from a working group formed at the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Access to Capital
Conference in March 2011. See IPO Task Force, Rebuilding the IPO On-Ramp: Putting Emerging Growth
Companies and the Job Market Back on the Road to Growth (Oct. 20, 2011), available at
http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/acsec/rebuilding_the_ipo_on-ramp.pdf.

2

were based in part on the scaled disclosure system applicable to smaller reporting companies. 5
According to the IPO Task Force, these revisions were expected to reduce internal and external
compliance costs for emerging growth companies by 30% to 50%. 6 Section 108 of the JOBS Act
directs the Commission to comprehensively analyze Regulation S-K to find additional ways for
the requirements to be updated to modernize and simplify the registration process and reduce the
costs and other burdens of the disclosure requirements for emerging growth companies.
To identify areas of Regulation S-K that may be appropriate for simplification or
modernization as they relate to emerging growth companies as specified in Section 108 of the
JOBS Act, the staff concluded that it would be important to first understand and consider the
history of all the provisions in Regulation S-K. The staff also concluded that a full review of
Regulation S-K would be appropriate since there may be simplifications, modernizations,
revisions or eliminations that would be suitable for all issuers. In addition, and as discussed
below, the staff recognized the limitations of conducting a review that did not look at the
disclosure regime as a whole. The disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K have an impact on
the costs and burdens of conducting registered offerings, including IPOs by emerging growth
companies, but also have an impact on the ongoing compliance burden associated with public
company status. A review of all requirements of Regulation S-K would have a benefit for issuers
beyond the period that they may qualify for emerging growth company status. Therefore, in

Market Back on the Road to Growth (Oct. 20, 2011), at 19, available at
http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/acsec/rebuilding_the_ipo_on-ramp.pdf. (“While helpful for companies
with market capitalizations of less than $75 million, the existing small company regulations do not provide
relief for most companies considering an IPO, including high-growth, venture-backed companies that
generate significant job growth….These companies go public in order to finance their growth and typically
raise between $50 million and $150 million dollars to do so. While still far smaller and with fewer resources
than larger companies, they must adhere to the same rules that the very largest companies do and therefore
bear compliance costs disproportionate to their size.”)

conducting its review of the requirements of Regulation S-K, the staff evaluated the requirements
for public companies generally, as a first step towards addressing Section 108’s focus on the
impact of the requirements on issuers who are emerging growth companies. In this regard, the
staff’s review is intended to facilitate the improvement of disclosure requirements applicable to
companies at all stages in their development, not only for companies that qualify as emerging
growth companies.
The staff reviewed, among other things, Regulation S-K, Commission releases and
comment letters on Commission regulatory actions pertaining to Regulation S-K. In addition, the
Commission has provided the opportunity for the public to comment generally on regulatory
initiatives to be undertaken in response to the JOBS Act. 7 The public comments that were
submitted regarding the Section 108 study are discussed in Section III of this report.
In light of the focus of the mandate in Section 108, the staff’s review of line-item
disclosure requirements did not include two subparts of Regulation S-K — Regulation AB and
Regulation M-A — that were adopted relatively recently and are carefully tailored and relevant to
specific types of registrants or transactions. Regulation AB, which was adopted in 2004, sets
forth the basis for disclosure in both registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
“Securities Act”) and reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) for
asset-backed securities. 8 Under Regulation AB, asset-backed securities issuers are subject to a

http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-8518.htm. In addition, the staff recently undertook a comprehensive
review of Regulation AB and the Commission issued a proposal in April 2010 to revise several aspects of
that regulation. See Asset-Backed Securities, Release No. 33-9117 (Apr. 7, 2010) [75 FR 23328], available
at http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2010/33-9117.pdf. In July 2011, the Commission revised and reproposed certain asset-backed securities rules that were initially proposed in April 2010 in light of
provisions added by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and comments
received on the April 2010 proposals. See Re-proposal of Shelf Eligibility Conditions for Asset-Backed

separate disclosure and reporting regime that is designed to address their particular structure and
operations. 9 Regulation M-A, which was adopted in 1999, sets forth the disclosure requirements
for business combination transactions. 10 Regulation M-A was adopted to simplify and integrate
the disclosure requirements for tender offers, going-private transactions and other extraordinary
transactions in one central location within the Commission’s regulations. 11 In addition, the staff’s
review did not encompass the disclosure requirements for foreign private issuers. 12
The disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K are closely intertwined with other
requirements under the Commission’s rules and forms that were not included in the staff’s review,
such as the disclosure requirements contained in the forms for periodic and current reports, the
rules relating to disclosure format and presentation and the regulations governing the process of
registration under the Securities Act. 13 Likewise, Regulation S-X 14 establishes disclosure

Among other changes, the 2004 rules updated and clarified the Securities Act registration requirements for
asset-backed securities offerings, consolidated and codified interpretive positions to allow modified
Exchange Act reporting that is more tailored and relevant to asset-backed securities and provided tailored
disclosure guidance and requirements for Securities Act and Exchange Act filings involving asset-backed
securities.

Id. These rule amendments also significantly liberalized the communications rules in connection with
business combination transactions.

12

The Commission has adopted separate disclosure requirements relating to foreign private issuers which
cover many of the same matters as set forth in Regulation S-K. Form 20-F [17 CFR 249.220f] is the
combined registration statement and annual report form for foreign private issuers under the Exchange Act.
It also sets forth disclosure requirements for registration statements filed by foreign private issuers under the
Securities Act. The disclosure requirements in Form 20-F are based on international disclosure standards
endorsed by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). See International
Disclosure Standards, Release No. 33-7745 (Sept. 28, 1999) [64 FR 53900], available at
http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-41936.htm.
Some requirements and instructions of Regulation S-K refer to foreign private issuers; these have been
included in the review set forth in Section III.

13

17 CFR 230.401-230.498. As noted in Part IV below, Regulation S-K also contains several items that relate
to technical requirements for the content and presentation of registration statements and prospectuses. Such
items are not a focus of the staff’s current review. See text accompanying notes 81 - 85.

5

requirements related to the form and content of, and requirements for, financial statements
included in a filing and requires that domestic issuer financial statements filed with the
Commission be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”), 15 and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) also establishes
requirements for disclosure to be presented in the notes to the financial statements of a domestic
issuer. The staff’s review did not encompass a review of disclosure requirements developed
through interpretations in Commission releases and staff interpretations and guidance. The staff’s
review also did not look at whether there are factors external to the Commission’s rules that may
have contributed to the length and complexity of company filings and the costs of compliance,
such as Commission enforcement actions and judicial opinions.
As discussed in detail below, the Commission has undertaken several initiatives over the
years to review and update its disclosure and registration requirements, ranging from targeted
revisions of certain rules to comprehensive reviews of its rules and regulations. Certain disclosure
items have been updated and reviewed relatively frequently, while others have changed little since
they were first put in place after the enactment of the Securities Act. The staff believes that a
comprehensive inventory of the Commission’s disclosure regulations that identifies the origin and
purpose of existing disclosure requirements and sets forth the history of updates to those

17 CFR part 210.

15

Regulation S-X requires that financial statements filed with the Commission be prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. See Rule 4-01(a) of Regulation S-X.
The Commission has recognized the financial accounting and reporting standards of The Financial
Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) as “generally accepted” for purposes of the federal securities
laws, unless the Commission directs otherwise. See Commission Statement of Policy Reaffirming the Status
of the FASB as a Designated Private-Sector Standard Setter, Release No. 33-8221 (April 25, 2003) [68 FR
23333].
Under Rule 4-01(a) of Regulation S-X, foreign private issuers may use U.S. GAAP, International Financial
Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or a comprehensive body of
accounting principles other than U.S. GAAP accompanied by a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.

requirements is an essential first step in formulating recommendations with respect to
modernizing and simplifying disclosure. The staff is not aware of a single source that presents a
clear picture of the scope, frequency and purpose of past revisions to the disclosure requirements.
In light of this, the staff determined to structure the study as follows:
The study first presents the regulatory history of the integrated disclosure system and
Regulation S-K as well as an overview of prior Commission initiatives to review and modernize
disclosure requirements. This overview includes initiatives to adapt the disclosure regime to
changes in technology and changing trends in communications. Next, the study presents a
detailed review of the disclosure items in Regulation S-K, the Industry Guides, 16 and related rules
and forms and summarizes input received from commenters on Section 108 of the JOBS Act.
Finally, the study concludes with a discussion of staff recommendations for the Commission’s
consideration as potential next steps, including an outline of economic principles to consider and
preliminary conclusions that can be drawn from the staff’s review of the disclosure requirements.

16

From time to time, beginning in 1962, the Commission has published guides for the preparation and filing of
registration statements and periodic reports, representing the policies and disclosure standards followed by
the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance in order to assist issuers in the preparation of their
registration statements and reports. See Acceleration of Registration Statements, Release No. 33-4475
(April 26, 1962) [27 FR 3990]. By 1979, there were 63 guides for the preparation and filing of registration
statements and five guides for the preparation and filing of periodic reports. This report refers to these
historical guides interchangeably as “the guides” or “the guides for the preparation of registration statements
and reports” or identifies a particular guide by its number. The five guides that applied only to periodic
reports are identified in this report as “Exchange Act Guides.”
As described in detail in Section III below, over time, some of these Guides were codified as requirements in
Regulation S-K, some were eliminated and those that pertained to specific industries were included in the
list of industry guides in Items 801 and 802 of Regulation S-K but were not codified as rules. See
Rescission of Guides and Redesignation of Industry Guides, Release No. 33-6384 (Mar. 3, 1982) [47 FR
11476], at 11476 (“The list of industry guides has been moved into Regulation S-K, which serves as the
central repository of disclosure requirements under the Securities Act and Exchange Act, in order to more
effectively put registrants on notice of their existence. These guides remain as an expression of the policies
and practices of the Division of Corporation Finance and their status is unaffected by this change.”)
Although they have not been codified as Commission requirements, the industry guides listed in Items 801
and 802 (the “Industry Guides”) have been included in the review summarized in this report.

II.

Summary and Background of Disclosure Rules
Regulation S-K sets forth requirements for disclosure (other than financial statement

disclosure) under both the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and is applicable to both public
offerings and ongoing reporting requirements. 17 It is a key part of the Commission’s “integrated
disclosure system,” which was created in 1982 following many years of analysis of the disclosure
rules under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. 18 Under the integrated disclosure system,
most registration and reporting forms under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act refer to
Regulation S-K for many of their substantive disclosure requirements. 19
Prior to the adoption of the integrated disclosure system, separate disclosure regimes
applied to Securities Act registration statements and Exchange Act periodic reporting, which
often resulted in overlapping and duplicative requirements. The Securities Act requires that a
registration statement under that Act contain the information specified in Schedule A, 20 but the
Commission may exercise its rulemaking authority to prescribe additional information or may
permit prescribed information to be omitted as it deems necessary or appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors. 21 The Commission has exercised this broad authority
17

As specified in Item 10(a) [17 CFR 229.10], Regulation S-K states the requirements for the content of the
non-financial statement portions of registration statements under the Securities Act and various filings under
the Exchange Act to the extent provided in the relevant forms.

18

See Adoption of Integrated Disclosure System, Release No. 33-6383 (Mar. 3, 1982) [47 FR 11380].

19

For example, Form S-1, the basic registration form under the Securities Act, and Form 10-K, the annual
reporting form under the Exchange Act, each require registrants to provide a description of their business in
accordance with the requirements of Item 101 of Regulation S-K.

20

Schedule A requires issuers to provide information such as: general information about the company, its
business and capital structure; information about the directors, principal officers, promoters and 10%
stockholders and remuneration of officers and directors; information about the offering, including the
purposes of the offering and use of proceeds, the offering expenses, estimated net proceeds, the proposed
public offering price and underwriters’ commissions or discounts; financial statements of the issuer and of
any business to be acquired through the proceeds of the issue; and copies of agreements made with
underwriters, opinions of counsel on legality of the issue, material contracts, the issuer’s organizational
documents and agreements or indentures affecting any securities offered.

over the years to promulgate various registration forms and disclosure requirements. As
discussed in detail below, many of the disclosure requirements contained in Regulation S-K today
originated in Schedule A and in the specialized registration statement forms developed by the
Commission over the years to adapt the Schedule A requirements to specific circumstances. 22
In 1966, Milton Cohen, in an influential article, suggested the integration of the
requirements under the two statutes. 23 Cohen’s suggestion of a coordinated disclosure system was
echoed in the Commission’s 1969 Disclosure Policy Study led by Commissioner Francis Wheat
(often referred to as the Wheat Report). 24 The Wheat Report recommended expansion of the
availability of Form S-7, which was the first streamlined registration form adopted by the
Commission, and greater coordination of the disclosure requirements of the Securities Act and
Exchange Act.
The Commission’s Advisory Committee on Corporate Disclosure issued a report in 1977
that recommended that the Commission adopt a single integrated disclosure system; specifically a
single form that would replace all registration forms and periodic reporting forms then in

22

Since early in its history, the Commission has created registration forms tailored to elicit information from
different types of market participants and transactions. For example, in 1941, the Commission adopted
Form S-3 for use by mining companies in the promotional stage (rescinded 1981), and in 1953, Form S-8
was adopted for use by stock purchase plans. In 1954, Form S-9 was adopted for registration of high grade
debt securities (rescinded 1976). In 1967, the Commission adopted Form S-7, for the first time allowing
streamlined registration for certain reporting companies (rescinded 1982). In 1979, the Commission adopted
Form S-18 for use by smaller issuers (rescinded in 1992). Several other forms have been adopted and
repealed over time. The current structure for domestic companies comprises Form S-1, the basic registration
form, Form S-3, a short form registration statement for certain reporting companies, Form S-4 for
registration of securities issued in business combination transactions and other exchange offers, Form S-6
for securities of certain unit investment trusts, Form S-8 for securities offered to employees under certain
plans and Form S-11 for securities of certain real estate companies.

existence and that would set forth all Commission-established general disclosure requirements. 25
After this report was issued, the Commission adopted the first version of Regulation S-K, which
included two items – Item 1, Description of Business (now Item 101) and Item 2, Description of
Property (now Item 102). 26 This marked the first time that the principal disclosure items were
made uniform for both registration statements and periodic reports. Over time, and as discussed
in detail below, additional disclosure items were added to Regulation S-K, 27 and it was expanded
and reorganized in 1982 as the repository for the uniform non-financial statement disclosure
requirements of documents filed with the Commission under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act. 28

27

In 1978, additional disclosure requirements were moved from Securities Act and Exchange Act forms and
reconciled into uniform disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. These requirements were: Item 3,
Directors and Officers (now Item 401), Item 4 Management Remuneration and Transactions (now Item
402), Item 5 Legal Proceedings (now Item 103) and Item 6 Principal Security Holders and Security Holdings
of Management (now Item 403). See Uniform and Integrated Reporting Requirements: Directors and
Officers, Management Remuneration, Legal Proceedings, Principal Security Holders and Security Holdings
of Management, Release No. 33-5949 (July 28, 1978) [43 FR 34402].
In 1980, five more disclosure requirements were moved from Securities Act and Exchange Act forms and
reconciled into uniform disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. See Amendments Regarding Exhibit
Requirements Release No. 33-6230 (Aug. 27, 1980) [45 FR 58822] (adopting Item 7, Exhibits (now Item

28

See Adoption of Integrated Disclosure System, Release No. 33-6383 (Mar. 3, 1982) [47 FR 11380]. As part
of this process, some of the item requirements were revised or reorganized in minor ways; the adopting
release notes, however, that certain items (Items 101, 102, 103, 302, 401, 402 and 403) were expected to be
the subject of a future “sunset” review and therefore major changes were not considered. At the same time,
the Commission authorized the rescission of the Division of Corporation Finance guides for the preparation
and filing of registration statements and reports under the Securities Act and Exchange Act, other than those
setting forth disclosure guidelines applicable to specific industries. The guides relating to procedural matters
were incorporated into Regulation C and the General Rules under the Securities Act and Exchange Act, the
guides related to disclosure requirements were incorporated into Regulation S-K and the guides calling for

As the Commission stated at the time the integrated disclosure system was adopted, the
“goal of the Commission’s integrated disclosure program has been to revise or eliminate
overlapping or unnecessary disclosure and dissemination requirements wherever possible, thereby
reducing burdens on registrants while at the same time ensuring that security holders, investors
and the marketplace have been provided with meaningful nonduplicative information upon which
to base investment decisions.” 29 Set forth below is a chronological overview of several of the
relevant revisions, studies and reviews that have been undertaken in the past. Many initiatives
have focused on the Commission’s disclosure requirements, while others have focused on the
process of securities offerings and company reporting under the Commission’s rules. In addition
to the Commission’s own initiatives, certain modifications or additions to Regulation S-K have
been mandated by legislative changes, some of the most significant of which are also discussed
below.
Simplified Reporting for Small Issuers.
In 1979, the Commission, in recognition of the difficulties small businesses were facing in
accessing the public capital markets, adopted on an experimental basis a simplified registration
form, Form S-18, for use by issuers that were not already subject to reporting obligations with the
Commission and that were seeking to register securities for sale to the public for cash not
exceeding an aggregate offering price of $5 million. 30 The Form S-18 adopting release notes

industry-specific disclosure were redesignated as “industry guides” and listed in Items 801 and 802 of
Regulation S-K. See Rescission of Guides and Redesignation of Industry Guides, Release No. 33-6384
(Mar. 3, 1982) [47 FR 11476]. See also note 16, supra.
29

See Adoption of Integrated Disclosure System, Release No. 33-6383 (Mar. 3, 1982) [47 FR 11380].

30

See Simplified Registration and Reporting Requirements for Small Issuers, Release No. 33-6049 (April 3,
1979) [44 FR 21562]. The offering ceiling was raised to $7.5 million in 1983. See Revisions to Optional
Form S-18, Release No. 33-6489 (Sept. 23, 1983) [48 FR 45386].
When the Commission proposed Form 18 and corresponding amendments to the Form 10-K financial
statement requirements, the Commission simultaneously announced its intention to hold a series of public

11

“[t]he rationale behind … the amendments adopted today is that an issuer not subject to the
reporting requirements of the Commission at the time the registration statement is filed under the
Securities Act may, consistent with the protection of investors, raise a limited amount of capital
without immediately incurring the full range of disclosure and reporting requirements imposed
upon other issuers. These procedures are intended to facilitate the process by which a small
business, over a period of time, might raise a limited amount of capital publicly and then come
into full compliance with the periodic reporting requirements imposed upon other issuers, thereby
gaining a broader access to the capital markets without being impeded by the immediate burdens
confronting many small, non-reporting issuer[s].” The disclosure items included in Form S-18
were generally consistent with the corresponding items in Form S-1, the general registration form,
but Form S-18 called for narrative disclosure that was less extensive than that required by Form
S-1. For example, unlike Form S-1, Form S-18 did not require a five-year comparative summary
of operations, detailed disclosure about lines of business, or, if the offering would not result in a
material change in the issuer’s capital structure, disclosure about capitalization. In addition, Form
S-18 allowed issuers to file, as part of the registration statement, audited consolidated statements

hearings about a variety of issues relating to small businesses’ access to capital. See Examination of the
Effects of Rules and Regulations on the Ability of Small Businesses to Raise Capital and the Impact on
Small Businesses of Disclosure Requirements Under the Securities Acts, Release No. 33-5914 (Mar. 6,
1978) [43 FR 10876]. The Commission held 21 days of hearings and considered the comments at the
hearings and in the public comment record on the proposal in its final rules. See Simplified Registration and
Reporting Requirements for Small Issuers, Release No. 33-6049 (April 3, 1979) [44 FR 21562]. As
described in both the proposing and adopting release, the simplified registration and reporting requirements
of Form 18 were “in the nature of an experiment.” See Simplified Registration and Reporting Requirements
for Small Issuers, Release No. 33-5915 (Mar. 6, 1978) [43 FR 10887] and Simplified Registration and
Reporting Requirements for Small Issuers, Release No. 33-6049 (April 3, 1979) [44 FR 21562]. After a
period of a year or more of monitoring its use, the Commission intended to “determine whether the form
functioned as an effective means for small issuers to raised limited amounts of capital through a registered
public offering…whether the form should be retained, and if so, whether the conditions for its availability
should be revised.” Id. Following that review, and in response to a recommendation of the SEC
Government Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation (Final Report, November 1982), the
Commission raised the offering ceiling in 1983. See Revisions to Optional Form S-18, Release No. 33-6489

of income, source and application of funds, and other stockholders’ equity for two fiscal years
instead of the three years of such financial statements required by Form S-1. These financial
statements were required to be prepared in accordance with GAAP, but the other requirements of
Regulation S-X did not apply.
Introduction of the Electronic Disclosure System.
When the integrated disclosure system was introduced, corporate disclosure and offering
documents were submitted to the Commission and made available to investors and market
participants exclusively in paper form. The Commission first began to develop an electronic
disclosure system in the early 1980s, 31 and since that time has been continually enhancing and
modernizing electronic access to filings, as well as requiring more filings to be made
electronically rather than in paper form.
Today, registrants generally must make their Commission filings electronically through
the EDGAR system, 32 and the Commission provides free access to EDGAR on a real-time basis
through the Commission’s web site. 33 In addition to ongoing efforts to improve EDGAR, the
Commission has required companies to provide financial information on EDGAR in interactive
data files, in order to make financial information easier for investors to analyze, as well as to help

31

The pilot program for the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) was established in
1983 pursuant to a Congressional mandate, and the system was fully implemented, effective January 30,
1995. The pilot program utilized technology available at the time — documents were submitted to and
accepted by the Commission using three different media: computer diskettes, magnetic tapes and direct
transmission over telephone lines using modems. For a summary of the development of EDGAR, see the
staff’s report, “Electronic Filing and the EDGAR System: A Regulatory Overview,” (Oct. 3, 2006),
available at http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/regoverview.htm.

32

A limited number of forms continue to be required or permitted to be filed in paper. For example, the
Commission requires paper filing of Form 1-A [17 CFR 239.90] and permits paper filing of Form 144 [17
CFR 239.144].

33

Real-time access to filings was initiated on May 30, 2002; previously, there was a delay of at least 24 hours
before filings appeared on the Commission’s website. See Press Release dated May 30, 2002, available at

interactive data in its own analytics, to improve its understanding of the functioning of the market
and the impact of regulation. 35
Regulation S-B.
In 1992, the Commission adopted an integrated disclosure system tailored specifically to
small business issuers. 36 Under this integrated system, issuers that met the definition of small
business issuer 37 were eligible to use specialized forms under the Securities Act and Exchange Act
that referenced disclosure requirements located in a newly-created Regulation S-B. 38 Regulation

Companies create interactive data files by defining – or “tagging” – their financial statements using elements
and labels from a standard list of interactive data tags. Data tagging provides a format for enhancing
financial and other reporting data using electronic formats such as eXtensible Mark-Up Language (XML)
and its derivatives, such as eXtensive Business Reporting Language (XBRL). General information
concerning interactive data is available on the Commission’s web site at
http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/xbrl.shtml. See also XBRL Voluntary Financial Reporting Program on the
EDGAR System, Release No. 33-8529 (Feb. 3, 2005) [70 FR 6556]; and Extension of Interactive Data

Information, Release No. 33-8823 (July 11, 2007) [72 FR 39290].

report.

37

At the time Regulation S-B was adopted, small business issuers were defined as companies with annual
revenues of less than $25 million whose voting stock did not have a public float of $25 million or more. As
discussed below, in 2007 the Commission established a category of “smaller reporting companies,” for
which the primary determinant for eligibility is that the company has less than $75 million in public float.

38

The new forms created in connection with the adoption of an integrated registration, reporting and
qualification system for small business issuers were a new Securities Act registration form, Form SB-2 and
new Exchange Act Forms 10-SB, 10-KSB and 10-QSB to satisfy registration, annual and quarterly reporting
obligations under that statute, respectively. Form SB-2 was the designated Securities Act registration form
for small business issuers and had no dollar limit for offerings. See Small Business Initiatives, Release No.
33-6949 (July 30, 1992) [57 FR 36442], available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/6949.txt.
The Commission subsequently adopted an additional Securities Act registration form, Form SB-1, which

14

S-B provided for simplified disclosure requirements for these issuers and was intended to reduce
compliance costs and improve ability of start-ups and other small businesses to obtain financing
through the public markets.
The narrative disclosure requirements of Regulation S-B generally paralleled those in
Regulation S-K at the time, although where such requirements had been simplified or not required
by Form S-18, Regulation S-B generally tracked the substantive disclosure requirements of Form
S-18. With the adoption of Form SB-2, a new registration form for small business issuers, Form
S-18 was repealed. The financial information required by Regulation S-B was substantially the
same as that required by Form S-18, with an added component to address interim financial
statement requirements. Consistent with the Form S-18 requirements, Regulation S-B did not
require disclosure equivalent to Regulation S-K Item 301 (selected financial data) or Regulation
S-K Item 302 (supplementary financial information). Among the items that were simplified for
small business issuers were Item 101(a) (description of business), which permitted small business
issuers to disclose three years of business development instead of five years as required for larger
issuers, and Item 402 (executive compensation), which permitted small business issuers to
provide disclosure based upon Form S-18’s more limited requirements as opposed to Item 402 of
Regulation S-K. 39 As discussed below, Regulation S-B’s scaled disclosure requirements have
subsequently been incorporated into Regulation S-K (retaining the scaled requirements) 40 and the
specialized small business issuer forms have been rescinded.

Task Force on Disclosure Simplification.
The Task Force on Disclosure Simplification, comprising staff from across the
Commission, was formed in 1995 to “review rules and forms affecting capital formation, with a
view toward streamlining, simplifying, and modernizing the overall regulatory scheme without
compromising or diminishing important investor protections.” 41 In March 1996, members of the
Commission staff delivered the Report of the Task Force on Disclosure Simplification to the
Commission. It recommended a number of areas where simplification and modernization of the
registration and offering process could be accomplished. The Task Force made several
recommendations relating to changes to Regulation S-K, including recommendations to:
•

Streamline Item 101’s disclosure requirements relating to the description of the
registrant’s business by eliminating duplication of quantitative information provided in the
financial statements;

•

Revise Item 102 relating to the description of property to elicit more meaningful and
material disclosure;

•

Limit the scope of Item 507, relating to securities offered for the account of a company’s
individual security holders, so that a company only would have to disclose information
regarding certain of its selling affiliates and significant beneficial owners rather than all of
its selling security holders; and

•

Modernize the existing Industry Guides, consider adopting additional industry-specific
disclosure rules and relocate all such guides and rules within Regulation S-K.

In 1996 and 1997, the Commission adopted rule changes and eliminated several forms and rules
based on many of the Task Force’s recommendations. 42

Report of the Advisory Committee on the Capital Formation and Regulatory Processes.
In 1995, the Commission also chartered the Advisory Committee on the Capital Formation
and Regulatory Processes to provide advice to the Commission on, among other things, the
regulatory process and the disclosure and reporting requirements relating to public offerings of
securities. The members of the Advisory Committee included representatives of investment
banks, securities lawyers, accountants and academics. In 1996, the Advisory Committee issued
its report and recommendations. 43 Although the Advisory Committee’s primary recommendation
was that the Commission further the integrated disclosure system by implementing a system
based on “company registration,” 44 the report also recommended specific changes to disclosure
requirements, including requiring management certifications to the Commission of Forms 10-K,
10-Q and 8-K, enhancements to current reports on Form 8-K and requiring risk factor disclosure
to be provided in annual reports on Form 10-K.

two forms and one rule, and adopting and amending rules to eliminate unnecessary requirements and to
streamline the disclosure process). The changes to Regulation S-K included eliminating a requirement in
Item 501(b) of Regulation S-K that registrants provide a cross-reference sheet immediately following the
facing page of the prospectus showing the location of the information required to be included in response to
the items in the form, eliminating the red ink requirement in Item 501(c)(8) of Regulation S-K that had been
applicable to the prospectus caption “Subject to Completion” and related legend, and eliminating four
infrequently used items from the list of required exhibits in Item 601(b). The recommended changes to
Items 101, 102 and 507 of Regulation S-K, described above in the accompanying text, were not
implemented.

Generally, as envisioned by the Advisory Committee, under a company registration system, an issuer would,
on a one-time basis, file a registration statement (deemed effective immediately) that includes information
similar to that currently provided in an initial short-form shelf registration statement. This registration
statement could then be used for all types of securities and all offerings. All current and future Exchange
Act reports would be incorporated by reference into that registration statement, and around the time of an
offering, transactional and updating disclosures would be filed with the Commission and incorporated into
the registration statement. See Securities Act Concepts and Their Effects on Capital Formation, Release No.

Securities Act Concept Release.
In 1996, after receiving the reports of the Task Force on Disclosure Simplification and of
the Advisory Committee on the Capital Formation and Regulatory Processes, the Commission
issued a concept release regarding regulation of the securities offering process. 45 The release
sought input on a number of significant issues, including whether the concept of company
registration should be pursued, whether other methods of increasing the integration of Securities
Act and Exchange Act disclosure and other processes should be considered and whether existing
or further reliance on Exchange Act filings should be accompanied by enhancements to Exchange
Act reporting. Many of the issues raised in the concept release were revisited in the
Commission’s 1998 proposals to modernize the securities offering process, 46 and in the
Commission’s 2005 Securities Offering Reform rulemaking, which are both discussed below. 47
Plain English Initiative.
In 1996, in an effort to improve the clarity and utility of disclosure documents, the
Division of Corporation Finance started a pilot program for public companies willing to file
documents under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act written in plain English. Following that
experience, in 1998 the Commission adopted new rules requiring issuers to write certain sections
of prospectuses in plain English and gave specific guidance on how to make prospectuses clear,

how to prepare plain English documents. 48
1998 Securities Act Rule Proposals.
In 1998, the Commission proposed new rules under the Securities Act that were intended
to modernize the securities offering process to recognize the evolution of the securities markets
and securities products since the Securities Act’s adoption. 49 The release proposed to replace most
existing registration statement forms with two basic forms and would have provided large
seasoned issuers with flexibility to craft disclosure about offerings, allowed the most seasoned
issuers to control the timing of filing and effectiveness of offering registration statements, eased
restrictions on communications around offerings and placed increased emphasis on Exchange Act
reporting. Although the underlying premise of the proposals was supported by commenters at the
time, most commenters indicated dissatisfaction with a number of the specifics in the 1998
proposals. Final rules were not adopted.
Guidance on the Use of Electronic Media.
The Commission first published guidance on the use of electronic media to deliver
information to investors in 1995. 50 This guidance focused on electronic delivery of prospectuses,
annual reports to security holders and proxy solicitation materials under the Securities Act, the

published guidance on the electronic delivery of required information by broker-dealers
(including municipal securities dealers) and transfer agents under the Exchange Act and
investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 52 and provided additional
examples supplementing the 1995 guidance. 53 In 1999, the Commission addressed the use of
electronic media in the context of offshore sales of securities and investment services, 54 and crossborder tender offers. 55 In 2000, the Commission acknowledged the significant impact that the
internet, by facilitating rapid and widespread information dissemination, had on capital raising
techniques, public company communications and business operations and the structure of the
securities industry and provided guidance on the application of the federal securities laws to
electronic media for issuers of all types. 56 In doing so, the Commission considered the significant
benefits that investors could gain from the increased use of electronic media, as well as the
potential for electronic media, as instruments of inexpensive mass communication, to be used to
defraud the investing public.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) mandated a number of changes
to improve the responsibility of public companies for their financial disclosures. The SarbanesOxley Act required the Commission to take several rulemaking actions in order to implement its
provisions, many of which resulted in changes to Regulation S-K’s disclosure requirements. For
example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act required the Commission to adopt rules requiring chief
executive officers and chief financial officers of registrants to certify financial and other
information in their companies’ quarterly and annual reports. 57 As a part of this, the Commission
added Items 307 and 308 to Regulation S-K, requiring certain disclosures related to disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to be made in periodic
57

The Commission had proposed certification requirements prior to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandate. In
1977, the Report of the Advisory Committee on Corporate Disclosure to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which led to the establishment of the integrated disclosure system, first advanced the idea of
requiring senior executives to review the Exchange Act reports filed on behalf of the company they manage.
This recommendation was based on the Advisory Committee’s finding that the disclosures made in
Exchange Act reports tended to be of a lesser quality than the disclosures made in Securities Act filings.
In 1980, the Commission amended Form 10-K to require that the annual report be signed on behalf of a
company by the company’s principal executive officer, its principal financial officer, its controller or
principal accounting officer and by at least the majority of the board of directors, based on the expectation
that corporate officers and directors would pay more attention to the disclosures made and would participate
more fully in the preparation of the reports if they had to sign them. See Amendments to Annual Report
Form, Related Forms, Rules, Regulations, and Guides; Integration of Securities Act Disclosure Systems,
Release No. 34-17114 (Sept. 2, 1980) [45 FR 63630].
The 1998 release proposing reform of the Securities Act offering process also proposed revisions to the
signature sections of registration statements and periodic reports to mandate that the persons required to sign
them certify that they had read them and that they knew of no untrue statement of a material fact or omission
of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. While some commenters supported the proposal, a larger number opposed
it, asserting that the requirement would impose unreasonable administrative burdens and expose corporate
officers to increased liability. See The Regulation of Securities Offerings, Release No. 33-7606A (Nov. 13,
1998) [63 FR 67174], available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/337606a1.txt;
http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/337606a2.txt; and http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/337606a3.txt.
In June 2002, before the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Commission proposed new certification
requirements for annual and quarterly reports, and proposed to require companies to maintain procedures to
provide reasonable assurance that the company is able to collect, process and disclose the information
required in its annual, quarterly and current reports. See Certification of Disclosure in Companies’
Quarterly and Annual Reports, Release No. 34-46079 (June 14, 2002) [67 FR 41877], available at

reports that contain certifications. 58 Other Regulation S-K changes resulting from the SarbanesOxley Act include the adoption of Item 406, which implemented the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
requirement that companies disclose whether they have a code of ethics for their CEO, CFO and
senior accounting personnel, 59 amendments to Item 303 to implement the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
requirement that companies disclose all material off-balance sheet transactions, 60 and the addition
of a requirement to Item 401, which implemented the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirement that
companies disclose information about financial experts serving on their audit committees. 61 In
addition, the Commission adopted amendments to the disclosure requirements for current reports

Before the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Commission twice proposed an internal control report
requirement. See Disclosure Required by Sections 404, 406 and 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
Release No. 33-8138 (Oct. 22, 2002) [67 FR 66208], available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/338138.htm. First, in 1979, following the enactment of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the
Commission proposed internal controls reporting by management and an assessment by accountants,
intended to implement the internal accounting controls requirements in the FCPA. Some commenters
criticized the proposal for its close correlation to the FCPA requirements and for the scope and content of
the management report, while others noted significant private-sector initiatives that had been undertaken on
these issues. See Statement of Management on Internal Accounting Control, Release No. 34-15772 (April
30, 1979) [44 FR 26702]. The Commission formally withdrew the proposal in 1980. See Statement of
Management on Internal Accounting Control, Release No. 34-16877 (June 6, 1980) [45 FR 40134]. In
1988, following the recommendations of the Treadway Commission, the Commission again proposed rules
that would have required a report of management’s responsibilities with respect to financial reporting,
including its responsibilities for the company’s internal control system, and an assessment of the
effectiveness of that system. While a majority of commenters generally supported the proposal, several
noted that private sector organizations were working to develop standards for reporting on the effectiveness
of internal controls. See Report of Management’s Responsibilities, Release No. 34-25925 (July 19, 1988)

Securities Offering Reform.
In 2005, the Commission adopted rules modifying the registration, communications and
offering processes under the Securities Act. 63 The rule changes continued the Commission’s
efforts toward integrating disclosure and processes under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
by addressing communications related to registered securities offerings, delivery of information to
investors and procedural aspects of the offering and capital formation processes.
In addition, the Commission sought to recognize the role that technology plays in timely
informing the market and investors about important corporate information and developments. 64
Accordingly, the rule changes contemplated and accommodated the use of communications
technology to communicate with investors. The 2005 reforms also encouraged electronic and

See Additional Form 8-K Disclosure Requirements and Acceleration of Filing Date, Release No. 33-8400
(Mar. 16, 2004) [69 FR 15594] (expanded the number of reportable events and shortened the filing deadline
for many events to four business days after the occurrence of a triggering event), available at
http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-8400.htm. The Commission originally proposed the amendments in June
2002, before the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The final rules added eight new disclosure items,
transferred two items from other periodic report forms and expanded two items.
The eight new disclosure items include: entry into a material non-ordinary course agreement; termination of
a material non-ordinary course agreement; creation of a material direct financial obligation or a material
obligation under an off-balance sheet arrangement; triggering events that accelerate or increase a material
direct financial obligation or a material obligation under an off-balance sheet arrangement; material costs
associated with exit or disposal activities; material impairments; notice of delisting or failure to satisfy a
continued listing rule or standard; transfer of listing; and non-reliance on previously issued financial
statements or a related audit report or completed interim review (restatements). The two disclosure items
transferred, in part, from the periodic reports are disclosure of unregistered sales of equity securities and
material modifications to rights of security holders. The amendments expanded the requirements for
departure of directors or principal officers, election of directors or appointment of principal officers and
amendments to articles of incorporation and bylaws and change in fiscal year.

Advisory Committee on Smaller Public Companies.
The Commission chartered the Advisory Committee on Smaller Public Companies in
2005 to assess the regulatory system for smaller companies and make recommendations to the
Commission for changes. 65 The Advisory Committee was composed of representatives of small
and mid-sized issuers in a variety of industries, investors, legal and accounting professionals,
investment banking and venture capital professionals and academics. In 2006, the Advisory
Committee published its recommendations, which included several recommendations relating to
scaling disclosure and financial reporting requirements for smaller companies. 66 Specifically,
among other things, the Advisory Committee recommended that the Commission:
•

establish a new system of scaled or proportional securities regulation for smaller public
companies; 67

•

incorporate the scaled disclosure accommodations (then available to small business issuers
under Regulation S-B) into Regulation S-K, make them available to all “microcap
companies” and cease prescribing separate specialized disclosure forms for smaller
companies; and

•

incorporate the primary scaled financial statement accommodations available to small
business issuers under Regulation S-B into Regulation S-K or Regulation S-X and make
them available to all “microcap companies” and “smallcap companies.”

65

The Advisory Committee’s Final Report, as well as webcasts, transcripts and copies of materials distributed
in connection with all of the Advisory Committee’s meetings, are available at
http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/acspc.shtml.

See Final Report of the Advisory Committee on Smaller Public Companies to the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (April 23, 2006), available at http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/acspc/acspcfinalreport.pdf.

67

In its recommendations, the Advisory Committee refers to “smaller public companies” to mean public
companies with equity capitalizations of approximately $787 million or less; companies with equity
capitalizations between approximately $128 million and $787 million generally would qualify as “smallcap
companies” and companies with equity capitalizations below approximately $128 million generally would
qualify as “microcap companies.” See id.

Smaller Reporting Company Regulatory Relief and Simplification.
In 2007, the Commission adopted amendments intended to provide regulatory relief for
smaller companies reporting under its rules, including changes to Regulation S-K that moved the
scaled disclosure requirements for smaller companies from Regulation S-B into Regulation S-K. 68
Several of the 2007 amendments had their genesis in the recommendations made by the Advisory
Committee on Smaller Public Companies in 2006, discussed above. These rules expanded the
number of smaller companies eligible to use scaled disclosure by establishing a category of
“smaller reporting companies,” for which the primary determinant for eligibility is that the
company has less than $75 million in public float (i.e. the aggregate market value of the issuer’s
outstanding voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates). When a company is
unable to calculate public float, however, such as if it has no common equity outstanding or no
market price for its outstanding common equity exists at the time of the determination, the
standard is less than $50 million in revenue in the last fiscal year. The 2007 amendments
simplified the disclosure and reporting requirements for smaller companies by moving Regulation
S-B’s scaled disclosure items into Regulation S-K (and Regulation S-X, as applicable),
eliminating the SB forms and permitting smaller reporting companies to comply with the scaled
disclosure requirements on an item-by-item basis.

also adopted rules that liberalized the eligibility requirements for certain short-form registration statements.

Advisory Committee on Improvements to Financial Reporting.
In 2007, the Commission established the Advisory Committee on Improvements to
Financial Reporting (frequently called the “CIFiR Committee”) to examine the U.S. financial
reporting system with the goal of reducing unnecessary complexity and making financial
information more useful and understandable for investors. The CIFiR Committee was composed
of representatives of issuers and investors, legal, accounting and investment professionals,
banking regulators, credit rating agencies, broker-dealers and proponents of interactive data. As
its focus was on financial reporting, the CIFiR Committee did not recommend specific changes to
Regulation S-K. Several of its recommendations, however, were directed at increasing the
usefulness of information in periodic reports. 69 The CIFiR Committee recommended requiring a
short executive summary at the beginning of a company’s annual and quarterly reports that would
concisely describe the most important themes and significant matters from managements’
perspective, along with an index identifying where investors could find more detailed information
on particular subjects. In addition, it recommended updating the Commission’s interpretive
guidance on the use of electronic media in order to promote greater use of corporate websites for
the dissemination of information on a company’s financial performance. The CIFiR Committee
also recommended requiring the filing of interactive data-tagged financial statements with
periodic reports.

69

See Final Report of the Advisory Committee on Improvements to Financial Reporting to the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (Aug. 1, 2008), available at
http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oca/acifr/acifr-finalreport.pdf. In addition, the CIFiR Committee
advocated a joint process between the FASB and the Commission to develop a disclosure framework that
would eliminate redundancies and provide a single source of disclosure guidance across all financial
reporting standards. Its other recommendations focused on enhancing the accounting standards-setting
process, improving the substantive design of new accounting standards, delineating authoritative interpretive
guidance and clarifying guidance on financial statements and accounting judgments.

26

Guidance on the Use of Websites.
In 2008, the Commission published guidance on the use of company websites, in order to
promote the use of company websites as a means for companies to communicate and provide
information to investors under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. 70 The guidance focused
on the following areas: (1) when information posted on a company website is “public” for
purposes of the applicability of Regulation FD, 71 (2) company liability for information on
company websites, including previously posted information, hyperlinks to third-party
information, summary information and the content of interactive web sites, (3) the types of
controls and procedures advisable with respect to such information and (4) the format of
information presented, with the focus on readability not printability.
21st Century Disclosure Initiative.
In 2008, the Commission announced an agency-wide initiative, with the goal of preparing
a plan for future action to modernize the Commission’s disclosure system. The Initiative’s report,
issued in 2009, recommended that the Commission design and implement a new disclosure
system in which interactive data would replace plain-text disclosure documents, while retaining
the substantive content and filing schedule of the current system. 72

available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2008/34-58288.pdf. As noted above, this guidance was
prompted in part by a recommendation by the CIFiR Committee. See Progress Report of the SEC Advisory
Committee on Improvements to Financial Reporting, Release No. 33-8896 (Feb. 14, 2008) (“CIFiR Progress
Report”), available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/other/2008/33-8896.pdf.
More recently, in April 2013, in connection with an investigation of the use of social media to announce
operational metrics, the Commission provided guidance to issuers regarding how its 2008 guidance and
Regulation FD apply to disclosure made through social media channels. See Report of Investigation
Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, Release No. 34-69279 (Apr. 2, 2013), available at

The Dodd-Frank Act.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank
Act”), enacted in 2010, made significant changes in the regulatory landscape for the Commission
and tasked the Commission with writing a large number of new rules and conducting several
studies and reports. 73 In addition to provisions relating to derivatives regulation, clearance and
settlement activities, registration of private fund advisers, credit rating agency regulation, reforms
to the asset-backed securitization process, and many others, the Dodd-Frank Act includes an array
of corporate governance, executive compensation and specialized disclosure provisions that have
an impact on the requirements of Regulation S-K.
The requirements currently in place include disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K
of an issuer’s consideration of the “say-on-pay” vote required by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank
Act, 74 disclosure under Item 407 of Regulation S-K relating to issuers’ compensation committees
and the use of compensation consultants required by Section 952 of the Dodd-Frank Act, 75 and
disclosure under new Item 104 of Regulation S-K of mine safety matters required by Section
1503 of the Dodd-Frank Act. 76 The Commission also is required by the Dodd-Frank Act to adopt

companies to provide financial statement information in the XBRL interactive data format in 2009. See

In addition, in August 2012, as mandated by Sections 1502 and 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the
Commission adopted new rules and forms for the disclosure of certain payments by resource extraction
issuers and for information about the use of conflict minerals. These disclosure requirements are not part of

28

several additional rules related to corporate governance and executive compensation that either
are required to be, or may be, included in Regulation S-K, such as new disclosure requirements
about executive compensation and company performance under Dodd-Frank Act Section 953(a)
and chief executive officer pay ratios under Dodd-Frank Act Section 953(b). 77
Other Recent Initiatives.
The Commission’s Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies, 78 which was
formed in 2011, has had several discussions at public meetings since its formation about the
Commission’s disclosure requirements and in February 2013 voted to make recommendations to
the Commission with respect to scaling certain disclosure requirements for small to mid-size
public companies. 79

Regulation S-K. See Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers, Release No. 34-67717 (Aug.

been vacated and remanded by the District Court for the District of Columbia (see American Petroleum
Institute v. SEC, Civ. A. No. 12-1688, 2013 WL 3307114, (D.D.C. Jul. 2, 2013) and the conflict minerals
rule remains the subject of ongoing litigation (see National Ass’n of Mfrs. v. SEC, Civ. A. No. 12-cv-635,
2013 WL 3803918 (D.D.C. Jul. 23, 2013).
Similarly, in August 2012, the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, Pub.L. No. 112158, was enacted, which requires issuers to provide disclosure in their annual and quarterly reports filed with
the Commission about certain business activities relating to Iran. This requirement was self-executing and
therefore the disclosure requirement is not part of Regulation S-K.

78

The Advisory Committee’s objective is to provide the Commission with advice on its rules, regulations, and
policies as they relate to capital raising by emerging privately held small businesses and publicly traded
companies with less than $250 million in public market capitalization through securities offerings, including
private and limited offerings and initial and other public offerings, trading in the securities of emerging
companies and smaller public companies, and public reporting and corporate governance requirements of
emerging companies and smaller public companies.

The Advisory Committee’s February 2013 recommendations, as well as transcripts and copies of materials
distributed in connection with all of the Advisory Committee’s meetings, are available at
http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/acsec.shtml.
In particular, the Advisory Committee recommended that the Commission revise its smaller reporting
company rules to incorporate the exemptions applicable to emerging growth companies, exempt smaller
reporting companies from requirements to provide interactive data in connection with periodic reports and
revise the exhibit requirements in Item 601 to permit the omission of immaterial schedules and attachments

III.

Review of Disclosure Requirements in Regulation S-K
This section provides a summary of the staff’s review of the disclosure items in

Regulation S-K. For each item, the summary notes general background information about the
adoption of the requirement and the origins of particular disclosure requirements where they predate, in some form, their inclusion in Regulation S-K. The summary also provides a brief
description of the significant substantive amendments to the disclosure requirements and, where
applicable, summarizes the recommendations submitted by commenters through the
Commission’s website. The items have been grouped into topical categories in order to provide
an overview of the current disclosure framework. The topical categories, however, differ from
the current headings in Regulation S-K to provide a better understanding of the substantive areas
that are covered by current rules as well as the substantive areas that might be addressed in future
recommendations for disclosure reform. 80
As noted above, in implementing the integrated disclosure system, the Commission
included in Regulation S-K various requirements that had been instructions to the registration
statement and periodic reporting forms and rules. Accordingly, several items in Regulation S-K
relate to requirements for the contents and presentation of registration statements and
prospectuses, including the following:
to material contracts.
80

For example, requirements for risk factor disclosure are currently set forth under Subpart 229.500 –
Registration Statement and Prospectus Provisions. This report, however, discusses the risk factor
requirements of Item 503(c) under a heading entitled “Requirements Relating to Risk and Risk
Management.”
The staff acknowledges, moreover, that some items or portions of Regulation S-K item requirements may
fall into more than one topical category (e.g., some provisions in management’s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) under Item 303, such as liquidity and capital
resources, off-balance sheet arrangements or tabular disclosure of contractual obligations, could have been
grouped together with provisions relating to risk and risk management). The categories used in this report
are intended to provide a conceptual structure to the review of disclosure requirements and are not intended
to have any interpretive or substantive effect with respect to current requirements.

In addition, Item 601 (Exhibits) sets forth the requirements for exhibits to registration statements

81

Item 10, formerly Item 1, was adopted as part of the original Regulation S-K in order to set forth the rules
for application of the regulation. See Release No. 33-5893 (Dec. 23, 1977). In 1982, the Commission added
its policy on the use of securities ratings in filings. See Release No. 33-6383 (March 3, 1982) [47 FR
11380]. In 1995, in connection with comprehensive revisions to the Commission’s Rule of Practice, former
Rule 24 concerning incorporation by reference was moved from the Rules of Practice into Item 10. See
Rules of Practice, Release No. 34-35833 (June 9, 1995) [60 FR 32737]. In 2003, the Commission adopted
amendments to add requirements regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures in filings. See
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Release No. 33-8176 (Jan. 6, 2003) [68 FR 4820].
In 2007, Item 10 was amended to add the scaled disclosure requirements from former Regulation S-B. See
Smaller Reporting Company Regulatory Relief and Simplification, Release No. 33-8876 (Dec. 19, 2007) [73
FR 934].

82

A requirement for the registrant’s address and telephone number to be included in the prospectus (not only
in a related registration statement) was originally published as an interpretive guide in 1970. See Definitive
Guide Relating to Disclosure in Prospectus of Registrant’s Business Address and Telephone Number,
Release No. 33-5102 (Nov. 12, 1970) [35 FR 17990]. This was in response to complaints received from
investors and state regulatory agencies that had been “unable to communicate conveniently with registrants
because that information had not been given.” See The Commission’s Annual Report for 1971 available at
http://www.sec.gov/about/annual_report/1971.pdf.

83

This requirement for disclosure about the Commission’s position on indemnification was adopted in its
current form as part of the expansion and reorganization of Regulation S-K in 1982. See Adoption of
Integrated Disclosure, Release No. 33-6383 (March 3, 1982) [47 FR 11380]. It was based on a provision
added in 1968 to the guides. See Guide 46 in Guides for Preparation and Filing of Registration Statements
Release No. 33-4936 (Dec. 9, 1968) [33 FR 18617]. See also note 16, supra. The original disclosure
requirements relating to indemnification of directors and officers were included in Form S-1 in 1947, in
order to codify disclosure practice at the time. See Miscellaneous Amendments, Release No. 33-3186 (Jan.
8, 1947) [12 FR 224].

84

A requirement for the disclosure of undertakings to file periodic reports was first added to Form A-2 in
1937. See Amendment No. 30 to Form A-2, Release No. 33-1345 (March 26, 1937) [2 FR 604].

85

The requirement for the filing of copies of various documents as exhibits to the registration statement arises
from the provisions in Schedule A of the Securities Act. Paragraphs (28) through (31) require the filing of
underwriting agreements, opinions of counsel as to the validity of the shares and legality of the offering,
material contracts, corporate charter documents, and agreements or indentures affecting the offered
securities. Over time, additional requirements for exhibits were adopted as part of the forms for registration

31

focus on the requirements that call for registrants to prepare detailed, company-specific
disclosures because we believe that those are the requirements that would benefit most from a
review of the policy goals and historical context of current rules. 86
A.

Requirements Relating to the Registrant’s Business and Operations

Item 101 – Description of Business
General background. This requirement is derived from Schedule A of the Securities Act,
which requires a description of the general character of the business actually transacted or to be
transacted by the issuer. 87 Requirements similar to Item 101(a) (General development of
business) and (c) (Narrative description of business) were included in the earliest forms of
registration statements and annual reports adopted by the Commission. 88 In 1947, the

statements and periodic reports. In the late 1970s, in connection with the implementation of an integrated
disclosure system, the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance conducted a review of the exhibit
requirements contained in the various forms under the Securities Act and Exchange Act. An exhibit
requirement, similar to existing Item 601, was added to Regulation S-K in 1980, which standardized the
filing requirements for exhibits and eliminated 13 exhibit requirements that were deemed to be of limited
interest to investors and the Commission. See Release No. 33-6230 (Aug. 27, 1980) [45 FR 58822].
86

Concerns have been raised about some of these areas, in particular, the exhibit requirements. See February
2013 recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Smaller and Emerging Companies, supra note 79,
Letter from Daniel J. Winnike, Fenwick West LLP et al., dated June 19, 2012 (“Silicon Valley Letter”),
available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/jobs-title-i/reviewreg-sk/reviewreg-sk-1.pdf and Letter from
Mike Liles, dated April 10, 2013 (“Letter from Mike Liles”)(endorsing the recommendations in the Silicon
Valley Letter), available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/jobs-title-i/reviewreg-sk/reviewregsk-4.pdf.
As discussed below under the heading “Potential Areas for Further Study,” the staff believes these
requirements, including the exhibit requirements, relating to filings under the Securities Act and Exchange
Act should be reviewed in connection with a reassessment of the presentation of non-financial statement
information contained in offering documents and periodic reports.

87

See Schedule A, paragraph (8).

88

See, e.g., Items 5 and 6 of Form A-2 adopted in 1935, which required registrants “to outline briefly the
general character of the business done and intended to be done by the registrant and its subsidiaries” and
“the general development of the business for the preceding five years.” See Release No. 33-276 (Jan. 14,
1935) [not published in the Federal Register]. In addition, Items 3 through 5 of Form A-1, adopted in 1933,
required registrants to briefly describe the “character of business done or intended to be done,” disclose a list
of states where the issuer owned property and was qualified to do business, and the length of time the
registrant had been engaged in its business. See Release No. 33-5 (July 6, 1933).
Form A-1 was the first form adopted under the Securities Act and was designed to be generally applicable.
Form A-1 generally consisted of the requirements in Schedule A of the Securities Act, with additional detail

32

Commission adopted requirements in Form S-1 that required a description of the relative
importance of a registrant’s materially important lines of business and required, where material, a
brief description of the general competitive conditions in the industry. 89 In 1951, the Commission
adopted amendments to Form S-1 that required a description of the relative importance of each
product or service (or class of similar products or services) that contributed 15% or more to the
gross volume of business for the fiscal year. 90 In 1969, the Commission adopted amendments to
Form S-1 that required, for companies engaged in more than one line of business, separate
reporting of the percentage of total sales and revenue or loss for each line of business that
contributed 10% or more to total sales and revenues or income. 91 In 1973, pursuant to the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 92 additional disclosure regarding compliance with
environmental laws was added to the description of business disclosure requirements in Form S-1
and Forms 10 and 10-K. 93 Also in 1973, following its investigation of the hot issues markets, 94

on financial data requirements. Later in 1933, several specialized forms were adopted for certain types of
securities, such as certificates of deposit and voting trust certificates, and certain types of transactions, such
as exchange offers and securities issued pursuant to a plan of reorganization. See Harold H. Neff, Securities
Registration Forms, 51 Harv. L. Rev. 1354 (1937-1938).
Form A-1 was deemed impracticable for use by older, more seasoned issuers, and in the first year following
the enactment of the statute only four seasoned companies had used the form. To address these concerns,
Form A-2 was adopted in 1935 with specific requirements for seasoned issuers, emphasizing disclosure
relating to the operations during the periods for which financial statements were required rather than
requirements relating to the company’s history and formation. See id.

activity in the early 1960s, which focused attention from anti-trust advocates and investors on issues relating
to conglomerates, generally, and the transparency of the profitability of segments in a diversified enterprise.

the Commission adopted several new disclosure requirements, including information about the
status of the development of new products, more detailed information about the competitive
conditions and position of the issuer in the industry in which it operates and, for certain
development stage companies, a description of their plans of operation. 95 In 1976, the
Commission adopted an amendment to Form S-1 to require disclosure about capital expenditures
relating to environmental compliance. 96 As first adopted in 1977, Regulation S-K required a
description of the general development of the business, financial information about the industry
segments, 97 a narrative description of the business and financial information about foreign and

through (d) of current Item 101.

See New Ventures, Meaningful Disclosure, Release No. 33-5395 (June 1, 1973) [38 FR 17202]. The
adopting release notes that, in making investment decisions, venture capitalists and underwriters generally
obtain specific information from companies about their competitive position and the methods of competition
in their respective industries, and accordingly, the new requirements would provide that type of information
to investors.
These amendments also added requirements for the disclosure of the amount of backlog orders, the source
and availability of raw materials essential to the business, the importance, duration and effect of all material
intellectual property held by the company, the number of employees, and the estimated dollar amount of
research and development expenditures during the last two years.

disclosure regime.

In 1976, the FASB issued SFAS No. 14, “Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise,”
which required corporations to disclose certain financial information by “industry segment” (as defined in
SFAS No. 14) and by geographic area. The business description requirements adopted in 1977 as part of
Regulation S-K sought to integrate the information to be furnished under SFAS No. 14 with the narrative
and financial disclosures required in various forms. See Industry Segment Reporting; Adoption of
Disclosure Regulation and Amendments of Disclosure Forms and Rules, Release No. 33-5893 (Dec. 23,
1977) [42 FR 65554]. The FASB subsequently superseded SFAS No. 14 through the issuance of SFAS No.
131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, in June 1997. The guidance
from SFAS No. 131 is currently included in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) in
Topic 280, Segment Reporting.

Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In connection with the Plain
English disclosure reforms adopted in 1998, the requirements for “Available Information,”
“Reports to Security Holders” and “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities Against Foreign Persons”
were moved to the description of business, rather than being required on the inside front and back
cover of the prospectus. 99 In 1999, requirements for financial information about a registrant’s
business segments were revised to reflect changes in U.S. GAAP standards for operating
segments and guidance was provided to clarify that the requirements calling for disclosure about
principal products and services are broader than the U.S. GAAP requirements and require a
discussion of the principal markets for and methods of distribution of each segment’s products
and services. 100
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. Item 101(h)
provides scaled disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies. A smaller reporting
company is required to provide a description of the development of its business during the most
recent three years, including its form and year of organization, any bankruptcy proceedings, any
material reclassification, merger, sale or purchase of assets outside the ordinary course of business
and a description of the business. The description of business requirements are less detailed than
those for other reporting companies and do not require information about seasonality (as required
for other registrants in Item 101(c)(1)(v)), working capital practices (Item 101(c)(1)(vi)),
identification of significant customers (Item 101(c)(1)(vii)), backlog information (Item
and Rules, Release No. 33-5893 (Dec. 23, 1977) [42 FR 65554].

See Plain English Disclosure, Release No. 33-7497 (Jan. 28, 1998) [63 FR 6370]. Current requirements for
disclosure regarding the enforceability of civil liabilities against foreign persons are generally similar to the
provisions of Guide 8 published in 1964. See Guides for Preparation and Filing of Registration Statements,

101(c)(1)(viii)) and certain material government contracts (Item 101(c)(1)(ix)). The scaled
requirements also call for information about the need for government approval of principal
products and services, which is not a specific requirement for other reporting companies.
Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. Two commenters
recommended eliminating from Item 101 the requirement to disclose the amount of backlog
orders believed to be firm, asserting that the concept of backlog is not a meaningful metric for
most emerging growth companies and that eliminating the requirement for emerging growth
companies will not compromise the delivery of meaningful disclosure to investors. 101 These
commenters also raised a question as to whether the concept of backlog (or for businesses other
than industrials, some other measure of committed revenue that is not yet reflected in the financial
statements) is more appropriately addressed in MD&A. Similar recommendations were made by
another commenter, who suggested eliminating the requirement for all companies, not only
emerging growth companies, or moving the requirement to MD&A. 102 This commenter believed
that this was one example of requirements that should be reviewed because they are industry
specific rather than applicable to all entities.
Item 102 – Description of Property
General background. In 1935, the Commission adopted, as part of registration statement
Form A-2, a requirement for a brief description of the general character and location of “principal
plants and other important units” of the registrant and its subsidiaries (and, for property not held
in fee, a description of how the property was held). 103 That requirement also called for a brief

description of the material franchises and concessions held by the registrant or its subsidiaries. In
1977, a similar requirement for a description of property was one of the two original disclosure
items contained in Regulation S-K. 104 The 1977 requirement was substantially similar to the
current requirement, except that it also contained provisions relating to extractive enterprises. At
the time, the Commission proposed a requirement that would have required registrants to describe
the physical properties that were material to each of its segments; instead, in response to
commenters, the adopted requirement focused on properties that were material to the registrant
and its subsidiaries and required registrants to identify the segments that use the property, in order
to “improve an investor’s understanding of a particular segment’s future operations.” 105
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In 1982, in connection with the
integration of disclosure requirements, the Commission moved the provisions in this item relating
to oil and gas operations into a new Industry Guide, Guide 2. 106 In 1999, in connection with
changes to segment reporting requirements, Item 102 was revised to require the identification of
segments as reported in the financial statements. 107 In 2008, the instructions to Item 102 were
revised to reflect the new oil and gas disclosure provisions in Subpart 1200.108

Requirements Relating to the Registrant’s Financial Condition

Item 301 – Selected Financial Data
General background. This requirement was originally adopted in 1980 as part of Form
10-K, to replace a former requirement calling for a summary of operations data, 110 in light of a
concern that the operations summaries provided by registrants duplicated information otherwise
available in the financial statements and may have unduly emphasized income over other
enterprise performance measures. 111 The selected financial data requirement was designed to
highlight historical trends in significant data relating to financial condition and results of
operations over a five-year period. In 1982, upon the adoption of integrated disclosure
requirements, this requirement was moved from Form 10-K into Regulation S-K. 112 At that time,
the requirement was amended to move provisions relating to the ratio of earnings to fixed charges
to Item 503 of Regulation S-K and to add a requirement for a brief description of factors that
could materially affect the comparability of the data or uncertainties that could cause the data to
not be indicative of the registrant’s future financial condition or results of operations.
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In 1982, in connection with the
adoption of an integrated disclosure system for non-U.S. registrants, this requirement was

amended by adding provisions applicable to foreign private issuers regarding exchange rates and
currency used. 113
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. Smaller reporting
companies are not required to provide disclosure under Item 301. 114 In a registration statement, an
emerging growth company is permitted to provide selected financial data only for the periods for
which audited financial statements are included in the registration statement. In periodic reports
following its IPO, an emerging growth company may provide selected financial data for periods
for which financial statements were presented in the IPO and periods thereafter. 115
Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. None.
Item 302 – Supplementary Financial Data
General background. A requirement for disclosure of selected quarterly financial data
was originally adopted as part of Regulation S-X and required the disclosure as part of the
financial statements. In 1980, in connection with an initiative to streamline Regulation S-X, this
requirement was moved to Regulation S-K. 116 As indicated in the adopting release, this move
was made, in part, because the information was not required to be audited and, therefore, it was
considered appropriate to move the disclosure outside of the financial statements. For the same

emerging growth companies with a variety of scaled disclosure and other accommodations, including
exemptions from or modifications to certain Regulation S-K disclosure requirements. These provisions
were effective upon enactment of the JOBS Act without rulemaking by the Commission.

reason, disclosure requirements relating to disagreements with accountants was also moved at that
time from Regulation S-X to this item in Regulation S-K.
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In 1982, the Commission added
requirements for supplemental oil and gas disclosure in connection with a change in accounting
standards. 117 In 1987, as a result of changes in accounting standards, the Commission adopted
amendments that eliminated former requirements for the disclosure of the effects of changing
prices on the registrant’s business. 118 In 1999, the Commission expanded the application of this
item to all registrants, other than foreign private issuers, with securities registered under Section
12(b) or (g) of the Exchange Act. 119
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. Item 302 only
applies to registrants, other than foreign private issuers, that have securities registered under
Section 12(b) or (g) of the Exchange Act, and, accordingly, it would not apply to a typical IPO
company until after the IPO. In addition, smaller reporting companies are not required to provide
disclosure under Item 302. 120

disclosure of selected quarterly financial data as well as reconciliations and descriptions of any adjustments
to quarterly information previously reported in a Form 10-Q, and the selected quarterly financial data was
required to be reviewed by the company’s independent auditors. One of the objectives noted in the release
was that “[i]nappropriate earnings management could be deterred by imposing more discipline on the
process of preparing interim financial information before filing such information with the Commission.” Id.,

Item 303 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations (MD&A)
General background. In 1968, the Commission published Guide 22, which called for a
summary of earnings, including a discussion of unusual conditions that affected the
appropriateness of the earnings presentation and requiring footnotes indicating adverse changes in
operating results subsequent to the latest period included in the earnings summary. 121 In 1974, the
Commission expanded this requirement, publishing Exchange Act Guide 1 (for periodic reports)
and amending Guide 22 to call for a narrative discussion of a registrant’s financial statements,
under captions entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Summary of Earnings”
and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Summary of Operations.” 122 In addition to
the summary, the amended guides called for a full narrative explanation that would enable
investors to appraise the quality of earnings and operating results and included a percentage test
for disclosure. 123 In 1980, the requirement was added to Regulation S-K, with expanded
requirements relating to liquidity and capital resources, new requirements emphasizing trends and
the identification of significant events or uncertainties, requirements for disclosure of the effects
of inflation and changing prices, and the percentage tests for disclosure were eliminated. 124
Rather than focusing on prescriptive, line-item disclosure requirements, MD&A requirements

were intended to function as principles-based requirements, in order to elicit meaningful,
company-specific disclosure. 125
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In 1982, the Commission
adopted instructions for compliance by foreign private issuers. 126 In 1987, the Commission
adopted amendments to the instructions to this item to clarify that registrants are only required to
discuss the impact of inflation and other changes in prices when those changes are considered
material. 127 In 2003, as mandated by Section 401 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Commission
adopted requirements for the disclosure of off-balance sheet arrangements. At this time,
requirements for tabular disclosure of contractual obligations were also adopted, in order to
consolidate information about a registrant’s future payment obligations and commitments in a
single location to provide context for an assessment of a registrant’s liquidity and capital resource
needs and demands. 128
In addition, from time to time, the Commission has published interpretive guidance on
various aspects of the MD&A requirements. 129

principal objectives: (1) to provide a narrative explanation of a company’s financial statements that enables
investors to see the company through the eyes of management, (2) to enhance the overall financial disclosure
and provide the context within which financial information should be analyzed, and (3) to provide
information about the quality of, and potential variability of, a company’s earnings and cash flow, so that
investors can ascertain the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance. See id.

Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. Several commenters
submitted recommendations for updating MD&A requirements. Two commenters recommended

See Silicon Valley Letter and Letter from Mike Liles. These commenters acknowledge that Item 303 does
not expressly require this disclosure. These commentators suggest that the disclosure is being provided by
companies to address the Commission’s interpretive guidance regarding disclosure about critical accounting
policies, the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies and the likelihood that
materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or different assumptions. See

43

another commenter strongly opposed that recommendation, noting that such disclosure is
meaningful for institutional investors. 131
One commenter recommended that the requirement in annual reports for the repetition of
prior year-over-year analysis should be eliminated, because the comparison detracts from a
comprehensive analysis of a three-year trend, and, in any event, MD&A disclosures for the
previous year can be easily obtained on EDGAR. 132 This commenter also observed changes in
accounting standards have created redundancies with MD&A requirements. As an example, this
commenter noted that many of the required financial statement disclosures related to variable
interest entities, now specified by FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, address the objectives of
the MD&A off-balance sheet arrangements requirements. 133
Item 503 (d) – Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges
General background. A requirement to present a ratio of earnings to fixed charges was
first adopted in 1954 in connection with the adoption of Form S-9, a short-form registration
statement for registration of non-convertible, fixed interest debt. 134 Use of Form S-9 was
conditioned on the issuer’s ability to demonstrate a minimum coverage of fixed charges. Over
time, the Commission added similar ratio requirements to other Commission registration
statement and reporting forms (including Forms S-1, S-7, S-11, 10 and 10-K) as part of the

this disclosure in response to comments from the Division of Corporation Finance.

“Summary of Operations” requirements and adopted numerous changes in the requirements
governing the calculation and presentation of the ratio. 135 In 1971, the Commission published
interpretations on the calculation of the ratio. 136 In 1980, the Commission issued a concept release
that requested comments on whether the requirements for presentation of historical and pro forma
ratios should be retained or deleted. 137 In 1980, as part of amendments to Form 10-K in
connection with the integrated disclosure project, the then-existing ratio requirements in the
various forms were moved from the Summary of Operations to the Selected Financial Data
provisions. 138 In 1982, the Commission adopted amendments to the ratio of earnings to fixed
charges and added the requirement to Item 503 of Regulation S-K. 139

of the issuance of the related concept release, the ratio requirements were being included in the forms as an
interim measure and a rule proposal was expected to be considered in the future). In 1981, the Commission
proposed to amend Item 10 (“Selected Financial Data) of Regulation S-K to include a modified version of
the ratio requirement. See Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges, Release No. 33-6285 (Feb. 6, 1981) [46 FR

See Adoption of an Integrated Disclosure System, Release No. 33-6383 (March 3, 1982) [47 FR 11380]. At
the time, the Commission rescinded and withdrew the related Accounting Series Releases (Nos. 119 and
122) and Topics 3B and 9B of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 40, because they discussed elements of the
computation of the ratio that were covered in the amended rules. The release also notes that the provisions
were located among the other offering-related items because the ratio was only being required in certain
Securities Act filings.

basis of their primary financial statements. 140 In 1998, the Commission adopted a requirement to
present the ratio in the summary section of the prospectus. 141 In 2007, in connection with the
simplification of rules for smaller reporting companies, the Commission added an exemption for
smaller reporting companies to this item, in conformity with the former Regulation S-B
requirements. 142
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. Smaller reporting
companies are not required to comply with this item. 143
Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. One commenter
recommended the elimination of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges requirement, as it “appears
an anachronism in the age of sophisticated financial modeling and analysis, facilitated by the
wealth of data available from issuer financial statements.” 144
Item 304 – Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial
Disclosure
General background. A requirement for disclosure of disagreements with accountants
was originally adopted as part of Regulation S-X. In 1980, the disclosure requirement relating to
disagreements with accountants was moved from Regulation S-X into the Regulation S-K

Item 307 – Disclosure Controls and Procedures
General background. In 2002, in connection with the adoption of certification
requirements mandated by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Commission also adopted
new Item 307 requiring disclosure in the registrant’s quarterly and annual reports about its
evaluation of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and whether there have
been significant changes in the registrant’s internal controls or in other factors that could
significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the evaluation. 148 This requirement does not
apply to filings made under the Securities Act.

Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In 2003, the Commission
amended the date to be used for the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures (from “as of
a date within 90 days of the filing date” to “as of the end of the period”). 149 These amendments
also moved disclosure requirements relating to changes in internal control over financial reporting

Item 308 – Internal Control over Financial Reporting
General background. As mandated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the
Commission adopted this provision in 2003 requiring registrants that are subject to Exchange Act
reporting requirements to include in their annual reports a report of management on the
registrant’s internal control over financial reporting and an attestation report by the registrant’s
auditors on management’s assessment of the internal controls. 150 This requirement does not apply
to filings made under the Securities Act.

Id. As initially adopted, accelerated filers were to comply with the requirements for their first fiscal year
ending on or after June 15, 2004, and issuers that were not accelerated filers as of June 15, 2005 were to
comply for their first fiscal year ending on or after April 15, 2005. In 2004, the Commission extended the
compliance dates for accelerated and non-accelerated filers. See Management’s Report on Internal Control

Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In 2006, a transition provision
was adopted for newly public companies, permitting such a registrant to delay compliance until it
either had filed or had been required to file an annual report for the prior fiscal year. 151 In 2007,
the requirements were amended to clarify that the auditors are only required to provide a single
opinion on the effectiveness of the registrant’s internal controls over financial reporting (rather
than two separate opinions covering the effectiveness of the internal controls and another on
management’s assessment of their effectiveness). 152 In 2010, pursuant to Section 989G of the

In December 2006, the Commission extended the compliance date for Section 404(a) for non-accelerated
filers to their first fiscal year ending on or after December 15, 2007 and extended the Section 404(b)
compliance date for non-accelerated filers to their first fiscal year ending on or after December 15, 2008.

In June 2008, the Commission approved a further extension of the Section 404(b) compliance date for nonaccelerated filers to fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2009. See Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting in Exchange Act Periodic Reports of Non-Accelerated Filers, Release No. 33-8934 (June 26,
2008) [73 FR 38094] available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2008/33-8934.pdf.
In October 2009, the Commission provided a final extension of the Section 404(b) compliance date for nonaccelerated filers to fiscal years ending after June 15, 2010. See Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Although the term “non-accelerated filer” is not defined in Commission rules, it is used in this report to refer
to a reporting company that does not meet the definition of either an “accelerated filer” or a “large
accelerated filer” under Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. Under Exchange Act Rule 12b-2, an accelerated filer is
an issuer that “had an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held
by its non-affiliates of $75 million or more, but less than $700 million, as of the last business day of the
issuer’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter” and a large accelerated filer is an issuer that “had an
aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates of
$700 million or more, as of the last business day of the issuer’s most recently completed second fiscal
quarter”. In addition, for both definitions, the issuer needs to have been subject to reporting requirements for
at least 12 calendar months, have filed at least one annual report, and not be eligible to use the requirements
for smaller reporting companies for its annual and quarterly reports.

Dodd-Frank Act (which provides that Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act does not apply to
registrants that are non-accelerated filers), the Commission adopted an exemption for nonaccelerated filers. 153
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. Non-accelerated
filers, a category that generally includes smaller reporting companies, are not subject to the
requirements of Item 308(b) (attestation report of the registered public accounting firm). In
addition, a newly public company is not required to comply with Item 308(a) (management’s
annual report on internal control over financial reporting) or Item 308(b) until it either has filed or
has been required to file an annual report for the prior fiscal year. Under the JOBS Act, emerging
growth companies are not required to provide Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b) auditor
attestations of internal control over financial reporting and, accordingly, are not subject to Item
308(b).

Although no comments were submitted about this item to the Commission’s website, the staff notes that one
of the recommendations emerging from the 31st Annual SEC Government-Business Forum on Small
Business Capital Formation in 2012 was that the Commission should expand the exemption from the auditor
attestation requirement of Item 308(b) to companies with less than $250 million in public float and possibly
up to $500 million in public float. See 31st Annual SEC Government-Business Forum on Small Business
Capital Formation Final Report (Nov. 15, 2012), available at http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor31.pdf.
The staff of the Office of the Chief Accountant published a study in 2011 on the auditor attestation
requirements for companies with less than $250 million in public float, as mandated by Section 989G(b) of
the Dodd-Frank Act. See Study and Recommendations on Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 For Issuers With Public Float Between $75 million and $250 million, available at

Requirements Relating to Management, Security Holders and Corporate
Governance

Item 401 – Directors, Executive Officers, Promoters and Control Persons
General background. This requirement is derived from the provisions in Schedule A of
the Securities Act calling for the names and addresses of directors, executive officers, promoters
and certain beneficial owners of securities. 155 In 1933, the Commission’s predecessor adopted a
similar requirement as part of registration statement Form A-1. 156 In 1935, the Commission
adopted Form A-2, which added a requirement for a brief description of “the business experience
of the principal executive officers for the last five years.” 157 In 1973, following its investigation
of the hot issues markets in 1971, the Commission adopted amendments to Form S-1 to expand
the disclosure requirements relating to the performance and background of management,
including expanded information about the nature of responsibilities in prior positions, the age of
officers and directors, the nature of any family relationships amongst directors and officers, the
involvement of officers and directors in specified types of legal proceedings during the past ten
years, and, for IPO companies, information about the experience of key personnel (such as
research scientists or production managers) who, although they are not executive officers, are
expected to make significant contributions to the business. 158 In 1978, the requirement was added
to Regulation S-K, combining the requirements from various forms. 159

Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In 1982, in connection with a
comprehensive reexamination of the disclosure requirements and procedural provisions for the
solicitation of proxies, the Commission revised the disclosure requirements relating to the
business experience of executive officers and directors, by adding a requirement to also disclose
whether the individual has been employed at an entity that is a parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the
registrant. 160 In 1984, in response to hearings in December 1983 held by the Subcommittee on
Securities of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, the Commission
expanded the information required regarding involvement in legal proceedings relating to federal
commodities law and added a requirement for disclosure about involvement in legal proceedings
by promoters and control persons. 161 In 2003, in connection with Section 407 of the SarbanesOxley Act, the Commission added new disclosure requirements applicable to annual reports or
proxy statements calling for information about whether the registrant has an audit committee
financial expert and information about the registrant’s audit committee. 162 Later in 2003,
following a review by the Division of Corporation Finance of the proxy rules relating to the

(July 28, 1978) [43 FR 34402]. At this time, the Commission reduced the number of years (from ten years
to five years) for which involvement in legal proceedings must be reported.

executive compensation disclosure requirements in 2006, the requirements for disclosure regarding
promoters was changed to require disclosure if the registrant had a promoter at any time during the last five
fiscal years, rather than if the registrant was organized within the last five fiscal years. See Executive
Compensation and Related Party Disclosure, Release No. 33-8732A (Aug. 29, 2006) [71 FR 53158, at

election of directors, the Commission added a provision requiring disclosure when a registrant
makes material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to
the board of directors. 163 In 2009, amendments were adopted to respond to investors’ increased
focus on corporate accountability, expanding the requirements for disclosure of involvement in
legal proceedings to span ten years (from five years) and adding additional covered proceedings
including fraud and violations of Federal or state securities and commodities laws. These
amendments also added new requirements for annual disclosure of the particular experience,
qualifications, attributes or skills of each director or nominee that led the board to conclude that
the person should serve as a director of the registrant. 164
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. None. In 2007, in
connection with its Smaller Reporting Company Relief and Simplification initiative and the
integration of the requirements of Regulation S-B into Regulation S-K, the Commission adopted
amendments that required smaller reporting companies to comply with the same requirements as
other companies under Item 401. 165

personal bankruptcy petition filed by or against a director or officer of a smaller reporting company given
that, in light of the generally smaller level of operations of smaller reporting companies, it may be material
to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of any director or person to be nominated to become a director or
executive office of the smaller reporting company”).

53

Item 402 – Executive Compensation
General background. Disclosure requirements regarding executive and director
compensation are set forth in Schedule A to the Securities Act. 166 In 1933, the first form of
registration statement, Form A-1, included a requirement similar to the Schedule A provision
calling for tabular disclosure of the total remuneration paid by the issuer, its subsidiaries and
affiliates during the past year and the ensuing year to each director and to any officer or other
person whose aggregate remuneration exceeds $25,000. 167 In 1935, new registration statement
Form A-2 (for seasoned issuers), included a requirement calling for tabular disclosure of the name
and aggregate remuneration of the three highest paid officers, the aggregate remuneration of all
other officers of the registrant and the aggregate remuneration of all employees who received
remuneration in excess of $20,000 during the fiscal year. 168 In 1938, the Commission
promulgated its first executive and director compensation disclosure rules for proxy statements. 169
In 1942, the Commission adopted comprehensive revisions to the proxy requirements,
including disclosure of management salaries and of corporate dealings with officers. 170 At the
same time, the Commission adopted Form S-1 which incorporated the requirements of former

166

See Schedule A, paragraph 14 (calling for “the remuneration, paid or estimated to be paid, by the issuer or
its predecessor, directly or indirectly, during the past year and ensuing year to….its officers and other
persons, naming them wherever such remuneration exceeded $25,000 during any such year”).

In 1935, the Commission adopted its first proxy rules, Regulation LA, which established standards for proxy
solicitations without addressing disclosure requirements applicable to particular subject matters. See
Release No. 34-378 (Sept. 24, 1935). In 1938, the Commission adopted Regulation X-14, the predecessor of
current Schedule 14A, which set forth specific disclosure requirements for proxy statements. Item 7(b) of
these regulations required specified disclosure of compensation received by nominees if action was to be
taken for director elections or other officials. See Amended Proxy Rules, Release No. 34-1823 (Aug. 11,
1938) [3 FR 1991].

Form A-2. 171 In 1947, the Commission amended the requirements of Form S-1 to clarify that
separate compensation disclosure for individual officers, directors and specified other persons is
only required where there is a material relationship to the registrant or to the registrant’s
management. 172 In 1948, the Commission amended Schedule 14A in order to clarify that
information is required for compensation earned by directors or officers in all capacities as well as
for services as directors or officers, to require a breakdown of the various types of compensation
paid to the directors and three most highly paid officers, as well as additional information as to
the indebtedness to the issuer of any director or officer. 173 Later in 1948, the Commission
amended the requirements of Form S-1 to consolidate the requirements into a single item, to
clarify that information is required as to pension and retirement payments for officers and
directors and to change the disclosure requirement for each director and officer whose aggregate
remuneration was in excess of $20,000 to any director whose aggregate remuneration was in
excess of $25,000 and the three highest paid officers whose remuneration exceeded that
amount. 174
In 1952, the Commission amended executive compensation requirements again in
connection with revisions to Schedule 14A, permitting aggregated (rather than itemized)
disclosure of compensation amounts and adding more detailed requirements for disclosure of
deferred compensation. 175 In 1973, the Commission adopted amendments raising the disclosure

threshold for named officers and directors to $40,000. 176 In 1978, the Commission combined
separate disclosure requirements (“Remuneration of Directors and Officers,” “Options to
Purchase Securities,” and “Interest of Management and Others in Certain Transactions”) in the
various forms into a single caption in Regulation S-K (“Management Remuneration and
Transactions”) in order to standardize disclosure requirements relating to compensation and
related party transactions. 177
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In 1978, the Commission
expanded the scope of executive compensation disclosure to reflect changes in the diversity and
complexity of management remuneration packages. 178 In 1980, the Commission adopted
amendments to the tabular remuneration disclosure requirements to streamline the disclosure and
to add a requirement for a separate pension table. 179 In 1983, as part of its Proxy Review
Program, the Commission adopted amendments that were intended to simplify disclosure
requirements, reduce compliance burdens and allow registrants greater flexibility in selecting a
presentation format for disclosure of executive compensation. 180 These amendments limited

“other compensation” of the lesser of $25,000 or 10% of the cash compensation reported in the cash
compensation table).

56

tabular disclosure to cash compensation and adopted a primarily narrative approach to
compensation disclosure.
In 1992, the Commission adopted amendments that expanded disclosure requirements,
mandating formatted tabular disclosure for all forms of compensation covering three years,
requiring a compensation committee report and a stock performance graph, and changing the
named executive officers for whom disclosure was required. 181 In 1993, the Commission
expanded the scope of the covered executive officers to include any individual who served as
chief executive officer during the year and any executive officer who departed during the year
who would have qualified as one of the four highest paid executive officers. 182
In 2006, following a reassessment of the executive compensation disclosure requirements,
the Commission adopted amendments that combined a broader-based tabular disclosure
presentation with expanded narrative disclosure designed to give investors information about how
and why a company arrived at specific executive compensation decisions and policies. 183 In 2009,

181

See Executive Compensation Disclosure, Release No. 33-6962 (Oct. 16, 1992) [57 FR 48126]. The
amendments changed the group of named executive officers – previously requiring the five most highly
compensated executive officers whose compensation exceeded $60,000 – to the CEO (regardless of level of
pay) and the four most highly paid executive officers whose compensation exceeded $100,000. The
amendments also required the compensation committee to report on the corporate performance factors that it
relied on in making specific compensation awards for named executive officers and describe the general
policies of the committee in determining senior executive compensation. The amendments also required the
disclosure of a line graph showing the cumulative total return to shareholders of the registrant over a period
of at least the previous five years, together with the comparable return to shareholders for stocks included in
a recognized industry index or a group of peer companies selected by the registrant. In addition, the
amendments raised the threshold for reporting perquisites to $50,000 in order to reflect the impact of
inflation.

assumptions and adjustments underlying grant-date valuations, and amendments to the timing of weighting
self-constructed indices used in performance graph disclosure).

adopted further amendments to the summary compensation table and director compensation table with
respect to stock awards and option awards to provide disclosure of the compensation cost of awards over the

57

the Commission further amended its rules to require new disclosure regarding compensation and
other corporate governance matters, which were intended to enable investors to better analyze
board performance, decision making processes and compensation practices, including the new
requirement for compensation disclosure and analysis (“CD&A”). 184
In 2011, as directed by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission adopted
requirements relating to tabular and narrative disclosure of golden parachute compensation
arrangements in the context of proxy statements for mergers and similar transactions. 185 In 2013,
the Commission issued proposed rules to implement Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act that
would require pay ratio disclosure. 186 The Commission’s staff is currently working on
recommendations for proposals to implement Sections 953(a), 954 and 955 of the Dodd-Frank
Act regarding pay-for-performance disclosure, stock exchange listing standards relating to
compensation clawback policies, and employee and director hedging disclosure.
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. Item 402(l)
provides scaled disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies, recognizing that
executive compensation arrangements for these companies are typically less complex than those
of larger public companies and, therefore, smaller reporting companies would likely be
disproportionately burdened by disclosure requirements designed to capture more complicated

requisite service period in accordance with FAS 123R, Share-Based Payment, along with disclosure of the
grant date fair value of those awards on a grant-by-grant basis in the grants of plan-based awards table. See

compensation arrangements. 187 Smaller reporting companies are only required to provide
information in the summary compensation table for the last two fiscal years, rather than three. In
addition, they are only required to provide compensation information about the principal
executive officer, the two most highly compensated executive officers and up to two additional
individuals no longer serving as executive officers at year end (rather than the principal executive
officer, the principal financial officer, the three most highly paid executive officers and up to two
additional individuals no longer serving as executive officers). In addition, the scaled
requirements do not call for disclosure in the summary compensation table of the change in
present value of pension benefits, do not call for disclosure of a pension benefits table and do not
require CD&A. In connection with the say-on-pay requirements, smaller reporting companies
were granted a temporary exemption that allows smaller reporting companies and IPO companies
that qualify as smaller reporting companies to delay compliance until the first annual or other
meeting of shareholders occurring on or after January 21, 2013.
In addition, under Section 102(c) of the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies are
permitted to follow the same requirements that are applicable to smaller reporting companies and
are exempt, under Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act, from the requirements of Section 953(b) of the
Dodd-Frank Act relating to CEO pay ratio disclosure. 188

See JOBS Act Section 102(a) and (c). As discussed in Section I.B. of this report, Title I of the JOBS Act
provided emerging growth companies with a variety of scaled disclosure and other accommodations,
including exemptions from or modifications to certain Regulation S-K disclosure requirements.

189

One of the recommendations emerging from the 29th Annual SEC Government-Business Forum on Small
Business Capital Formation in 2010, was that the Commission exempt smaller reporting companies from the
golden parachute vote provisions and, in particular, the chart in Item 402(t). Forum participants also
recommended that the Commission not require smaller reporting companies to comply with the

59

Item 403 – Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
General background. This requirement is derived from the provision in Schedule A of the
Securities Act calling for the amount of securities held by each member of management and
owners of more than 10% of any class of the issuer’s stock and the amount for which each has
indicated an intention to subscribe. 190 In 1933, the Commission’s predecessor included similar
provisions in Form A-1. 191 In 1935, the Commission adopted more streamlined requirements in
Form A-2, but still called for the name and address of both the record holder and the beneficial
owner (if known). 192 In 1947, the Commission adopted revisions to Form S-1, consolidating the
requirements relating to security holdings into one item and amending requirements for individual
reporting of share ownership of management with a requirement for aggregate amounts of equity
securities owned by directors and officers as a group. 193 In 1948, the Commission simplified the
format of the tabular presentation. 194 In 1977, following the passage of the Williams Act in 1968
(which added Section 13(d) to the Exchange Act) 195 and a series of public hearings held in 1974
by the Commission and Congress on beneficial ownership reporting, 196 the Commission adopted

requirements of Section 953 of the Dodd-Frank Act, when adopted.
190

See paragraph (7) of Schedule A. This provision also calls for security ownership of underwriters.

191

See Items 28 and 29 of Form A-1. The requirements called for disclosure of the name and address of both
the holder of record and the beneficial owner. Form A-1 also provided that, if no shareholder owned more
than 10% of the outstanding stock of the issuer, then disclosure was required for the ten largest shareholders
of record or beneficial owners.

192

See Items 33 and 34 of Form A-2. Disclosure for principal shareholders was limited to holders of more than
10% of any class of voting stock, and the alternative requirement for disclosure of the ten largest
shareholders was eliminated. The form also required separate disclosure for holdings as of a recent date and
as of approximately a year prior to the recent date. See also instruction to Item 33.

application of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and, in doing so, integrated the information
concerning beneficial ownership of securities of publicly owned corporations into registration
statement disclosure and periodic reporting requirements. 197 In 1978, the requirement was added
to Regulation S-K, combining the requirements from various forms into a new Item 6. 198
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In 1982, as part of the
expansion and reorganization of Regulation S-K, the requirements of former Item 6 were moved
to Item 403, without substantive changes. Later in 1982, the Commission adopted amendments to
the instructions to Item 403 in order to clarify beneficial ownership disclosure requirements. 199 In
1992, the Commission added a requirement for separate disclosure of the security ownership of
each named executive officer. 200 In 2006, the Commission adopted additional requirements for

Foreign and Domestic Persons, Release Nos. 33-5526 (Sept. 9, 1974) and 33-5538 (Nov. 5, 1974);
Disclosure of Corporate Ownership, S. Doc. 93-62, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. (1974) and Hearings on Corporate
Disclosure Before the Subcommittees on Inter-Governmental Relations and on Budgeting, Management and

notes that, since the adoption of Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act in 1968 there had been
questions raised about the standards to be applied for determination of beneficial ownership for purposes of
the reporting requirements of Sections 13(d) and 14(d), and “the need for improved disclosure in this area
has become more apparent recently because of public interest in the identity and nationality of any person
who has the power to influence or effect changes in the control of companies”).

years) for which involvement of legal proceedings must be reported.

(Dec. 2, 1982) [47 FR 55661] (amending Instruction 5 to clarify that shares should only be counted once
when computing totals under paragraph (b) and amending Instruction 1 to permit companies to omit the
disclosure of ownership percentages that amount to less than 1% of the class of securities).

200

See Executive Compensation Disclosure, Release No. 33-6992 (Oct. 16, 1992) [57 FR 48126]. Before this
requirement, disclosure was only required for directors and officers as a group. In connection with
amendments to executive compensation disclosure, the Commission proposed a new table entitled “Total
Common Equity Based Holdings,” designed to show the nature and scope of each named executive’s equity
stake in the registrant. At the time, the Commission acknowledged that “Many corporate and shareholder

nominees, 201 as well as the disclosure of directors’ qualifying shares.
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. None.
Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. None.
Item 404 – Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
General background. Schedule A contained a requirement for the disclosure of “the full
particulars of the nature and extent of the interest, if any,” of any director, principal executive
officer and principal shareholders “in any property acquired, not in the ordinary course of
business of the issuer, within two years preceding the filing of the registration statement. 202 That
requirement was included in Form A-1 adopted in 1933, but included underwriters in the list of
related parties covered by the rule. In 1935, the Commission included the requirement in Form
A-2 and added a requirement for disclosure of the cost of the property to the related party. In
1948, the Commission revised Form S-1 to expand the requirement from disclosure about
interests in property recently acquired by the registrant to disclosure about interests in any
material transactions, whether or not they involve the acquisition of property. 203 In 1978, the

commenters alike have stated that the most effective means of assessing the alignment of stockholder and
management interests is by examining the nature and the extent of management equity ownership in the
company.” See Executive Compensation Disclosure, Release No. 33-6940 (June 23, 1992) [57 FR 29582].
As noted in the adopting release, this proposed requirement was not adopted in Item 402, and a requirement
for security ownership by the named executive officers was added to Item 403(b), as suggested by a number
of commenters in order to minimize redundant disclosure.
201

See Executive Compensation and Related Person Disclosure, Release No. 33-8732A (Aug. 29, 2006) [71 FR
53158], available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2006/33-8732a.pdf, at 53192. As noted in the adopting
release, the Commission believed that, to the extent that shares beneficially owned by named executive
officers and directors are used as collateral, the shares may be subject to material risks or contingencies that
do not apply to the other shares beneficially owned by these individuals, which could have the potential to
influence management’s performance and decision-making.

Commission added requirements relating to executive officer transactions and relationships to the
executive compensation provisions of Regulation S-K. 204 Item 404 was adopted in 1982 in
connection with the Commission’s comprehensive reexamination of the disclosure requirements
and procedural provisions relating to the solicitation of proxies. 205 This item was based primarily
on two disclosure requirements relating to transactions and relationships involving the registrant
and management or persons connected with management: (1) a requirement in Item 402 of
Regulation S-K that was based on the requirements in Schedule A, Forms A-2 and S-1 that called
for information regarding transactions involving management and (2) a requirement in Schedule
14A that was adopted in 1978 to elicit disclosure regarding relationships between directors or
nominees for director and significant customers, suppliers or creditors of the registrant. 206
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. Item 404 was amended in 2006,
in connection with amendments to executive compensation disclosure. 207 The requirements were
reorganized in an effort to make the requirements clearer and easier to follow, while removing
some of the instructions that served to delineate which transactions were excludable or reportable
based on bright line tests rather than general materiality analysis. 208 The amendments retained the

disclosure threshold, but raised it from $60,000 (the level established in 1983) to $120,000. 209
Certain requirements were moved to a new Item 407 in order to consolidate disclosure
requirements relating to corporate governance matters and other provisions were streamlined to
eliminate duplicative requirements. In addition, a new provision was added to require a
description of the registrant’s policies and procedures for the review, approval or ratification of
transactions with related persons that are reportable under this item. Also at that time, the
requirements for disclosure regarding promoters was changed to require disclosure if the
registrant had a promoter at any time during the last five fiscal years, rather than if the registrant
was organized within the last five fiscal years.
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. Smaller reporting
companies are permitted to follow the scaled requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this item.
Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. One commenter
recommended revising or eliminating the bright-line quantitative disclosure threshold of $120,000
for related party transactions, in order to provide a better scaling based on the size of the issuer
and the nature of the transaction. 210
Item 405 – Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
General background. In response to developments in the trading of derivatives, the
prevalence of complex and diverse employee benefit plans and an increase in Section 16 filing
delinquencies, the Commission undertook a comprehensive review of the rules and forms under

209

At the time, commenters expressed diverse views as to what the appropriate threshold should be. Some
supported the increase to $120,000, while others recommended retaining the $60,000 threshold, using a
minimal dollar threshold, not including any de minimis dollar threshold or increasing the threshold further
using a sliding scale. The Commission concluded that a fixed dollar threshold would provide the most
certainty as to the size of transactions that must be tracked for disclosure purposes and that an increase in the
amount based on inflation was appropriate.

Section 16 of the Exchange Act in 1987. 211 As a result of that review, in 1991 the Commission
adopted a requirement that a registrant identify directors, officers and certain beneficial owners of
its securities who failed to file or to timely file required reports under Section 16(a) and the
number of delinquent filings. 212 This requirement does not apply to filings made under the
Securities Act.
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In order to improve the
visibility of the disclosure, a provision was added in 1996 to require the disclosure to be presented
under a separate caption. 213 Also at that time, the item was amended to clarify the nature of a
registrant’s obligation to review insiders’ filings in order to determine whether any delinquent
reports require disclosure. In 2005, following amendments pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
that required electronic filing of Section 16 reports with the Commission, the item was further

211

In general, Section 16 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78p] was designed to provide the public with
information about securities transaction and holdings of an issuer’s directors, officers and significant
stockholders and to deter these “insiders” from profiting from short-term trading in issuer securities while in
possession of material, non-public information. See Ownership Reports and Trading by Officers, Directors
and Principal Security Holders, Release No. 34-37260 (May 31, 1996) [61 FR 30376], available at
http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/37260a.txt and http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/37260b.txt. Section 16 applies
to every person who is the beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of equity security registered
under Section 12 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78l] and each officer and director, generally referred to as
reporting persons. Upon becoming a reporting person, or upon the Section 12 registration of a class of
equity security, Section 16(a) requires a reporting person to file an initial report with the Commission
disclosing his or her beneficial ownership of all equity securities of the issuer. To keep this information
current, Section 16(a) also requires reporting persons to report changes in such ownership or the purchase or
sale of a security-based swap agreement involving those equity securities.
For purposes of Section 16(a) reporting obligations and Section 16(b) short-swing profit recovery, Rule 16a1(a)(2) uses a different definition of “beneficial owner” than is used under Section 13(d) and the
Commission’s rules thereunder. Rule 16a-1(a)(2) defines beneficial owner based on whether the person has
or shares a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the securities.

Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. Item 405 only
applies to registrants that have a class of equity securities registered under Section 12 of the
Exchange Act.
Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. None.
Item 406 – Code of Ethics
General background. This requirement for disclosure about the registrant’s code of ethics
and waivers granted under that code was adopted as mandated by Section 406 of the SarbanesOxley Act. 215 This requirement permits a registrant to satisfy the requirement to file a copy of the
code of ethics with the Commission by posting it on its website or undertaking in its annual report
to provide a copy upon request. This requirement does not apply to filings made under the
Securities Act.
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. There have been no substantive
amendments since the requirement was added to Regulation S-K.

requirements into a single item. 216 Not all of the requirements of this item apply to filings under
the Securities Act; for example, only disclosure under Item 407(a) (Director independence) is
required by Form S-1.
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In 2009, an additional provision
was adopted to require disclosure of whether (and if so, how) the registrant’s nominating
committee considers diversity in identifying nominees for director. 217 This amendment also
requires (1) disclosure of the implementation and effectiveness of any policy the registrant has
relating to the consideration of diversity in the identification of nominees, (2) a description of the
board’s leadership structure and the board’s role in the oversight of risk and (3) expanded
disclosure about the role of compensation consultants in determining the amount or form of
executive and director compensation. In 2012, as mandated by Section 952 of the Dodd-Frank
Act, the Commission adopted expanded disclosure requirements relating to compensation
consultant conflicts of interest. 218

Items 306, 401(h), (i) and (j), 404(b) of Regulation S-K and Item 7 of Exchange Act Schedule 14A).
Requirements for disclosure of the existence and composition of the audit committee were added to the
Commission’s proxy rules in 1974. See Registrants and Independent Accountants: Amended Rules for
Increased Disclosure of Relationships, Release No. 33-5550 (Dec. 20, 1974) [40 FR 1010]. In 1999, Item
306 was added to Regulation S-K based on the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Committee on
Improving the Effectiveness of Corporate Audit Committees, which called for the inclusion in the proxy
statement of an audit committee report. See Audit Committee Disclosure, Release No. 34-42266 (Dec. 22,
1999), available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-42266.htm. In 2006, as part of the consolidation of
corporate governance disclosure requirements, the requirement for disclosure of an Audit Committee Report
under Item 306 was moved to Item 407. Item 407 reordered some of the requirements of former Item 306
but did not make substantive changes to the requirements. See id., at note 471.
The requirements of former Item 404(b) for disclosure about director relationships that could affect

Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. Pursuant to
paragraph (g), a smaller reporting company is not required to provide disclosure of whether it has
an audit committee financial expert until its second annual report following the effective date of
its initial registration statement under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Smaller reporting
companies are exempt from the requirement to provide disclosure regarding compensation

Item 702 – Indemnification of Directors and Officers
General background. The original disclosure requirements relating to indemnification of
directors and officers were included in Form S-1 in 1947, in order to codify disclosure practice
followed at the time. 219 In 1968, a similar requirement was added to the Guides for Preparation
and Filing of Registration Statements. 220 In 1982, this requirement for disclosure about
indemnification arrangements for officers and directors was adopted in its current form as part of
the expansion and reorganization of Regulation S-K. 221

Requirements Relating to the Registrant’s Securities

Item 201 – Market Price of and Dividends on the Registrant’s Common Equity and Related
Stockholder Matters
General background. In 1933, the Commission’s predecessor included as part of Form A1 a requirement for disclosure of historical dividend rates and method of payment for three years
in connection with each outstanding class of capital stock. 222 In 1964, the Commission published
Guide 10 calling for a statement of dividend policy, 223 later revised as Guide 26 in 1968, 224 and
published Guide 13 calling for information about market quotations or disclosure of the absence
of an established trading market. 225 In 1980, a requirement for disclosure of market price and
dividends on common equity was added to Regulation S-K, 226 aggregating the requirements of
paragraph (8) of Rule 14a-3 (which required market price information to be included in the annual
report to security holders), Guide 26, Guide 13, and Item 9 of the previous Form 10-K (which
required information as to the approximate number of equity security holders).
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In 1982, in connection with the
reorganization and expansion of Regulation S-K, the requirement was re-designated as Item
201, 227 and, later that year, instructions were added relating to disclosure by foreign private issuers

222

See Item 16 of Form A-1. In contrast, Form A-2, adopted in 1935, only required a statement about the
dividend rights of capital stock and any limitations in indentures or other agreements on the payment of
dividends. See Item 17 of Form A-2.

regarding securities issued in bearer form or as American Depositary Receipts. 228 In 2001, the
Commission adopted additional requirements for tabular disclosure regarding securities
authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans, including number of securities,
weighted average exercise price, securities available for future issuance and a description of any
equity compensation plan that was adopted without the approval of security holders. 229 In 2006,
in connection with revisions to executive compensation disclosure requirements, the stock
performance graph was moved from Item 402 to new paragraph (e) of Item 201. 230

exercise price of options, warrants and rights was added to the final rule in response to recommendations
from commenters who asserted that investors need that information to assess the dilutive effect of a
registrant’s equity compensation program.
Later, in 2003, the SEC approved rules for the NASD and Nasdaq that required shareholder approved of
equity compensation plans for companies listed on those exchanges. See Order Approving NYSE and

The requirement for a stock performance graph was originally adopted in 1992 in connection with an
expansion of executive compensation disclosure requirements. See note 181, supra. The graph was
intended to complement the newly required discussion in the compensation committee report of the
relationship between executive compensation and corporate performance. See Executive Compensation
Disclosure, Release No. 33-6940 (June 23, 1992) [57 FR 29582] (briefly noting, in support of the proposed
amendments, academic research on the correlation between executive compensation and corporate
performance).
In connection with the 2006 rulemaking, the performance graph was proposed to be eliminated given the
widespread availability of stock price information and because the disclosure in the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis was intended to elicit a broader discussion than the relationship of compensation to
performance as reflected by stock price alone. The final rule, however, retained the performance graph due
to recommendations by commenters who asserted that the graph provides an easily accessible visual
comparison of a company’s performance relative to its peers and the market.

231

See Instruction 6 to Item 201(e).

performance graph is only required in an annual report to security holders that precedes or
accompanies a proxy or information statement relating to the election of directors. 232
Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. One commenter
recommended the elimination of historical stock price disclosure requirements because “data
manipulation tools and daily stock information on most finance websites have made the historical
stock price disclosures mandated by Item 201 of Regulation S-K largely obsolete.” 233
Two commenters recommended the elimination of requirements under Item 201(d)
relating to the securities issued under compensation plans approved by shareholders and those not
approved by shareholders, on the basis that it provides limited information not otherwise available
to investors and that information is of marginal significance. 234 In contrast, another commenter
strongly opposed that recommendation, noting that such information is meaningful for
institutional investors. 235
Item 202 – Description of Registrant’s Securities
General background. This requirement stems from a requirement in Schedule A calling
for disclosure of the capitalization of the issuer including a description of the classes of capital
stock and funded debt and any securities covered by options. 236 In 1933, the Commission’s
predecessor included in Form A-1 tabular requirements similar to Schedule A requirements. 237 In
1935, the Commission included in Form A-2 requirements calling for detailed tabular and

Commission adopted amendments to Form S-1 that eliminated the description of securities that
are not being registered, except to the extent material to an evaluation of the securities being
registered. 239 In 1955, the Commission adopted amendments to Form S-1 that simplified the
tabular requirements regarding capitalization as part of Form S-1 and streamlined the
requirements for the description of capital stock, long-term debt or other securities being
registered. 240 In 1982, Item 202 was added to Regulation S-K, combining requirements from
registration statement forms into a single item. 241
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In 1982, in connection with the
adoption of the integrated disclosure system for foreign private issuers, the Commission adopted
amendments that added requirements for disclosure regarding American Depositary Receipts and
instructions regarding disclosure about fees and charges in connection with American Depositary
Receipts. 242
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. None.

238

See Form A-2 Items 9 through 20. Tabular disclosure included details about amounts authorized, amounts

Item 701 – Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities
General background. This requirement partially stems from paragraph 19 of Schedule A
of the Securities Act. A requirement for the disclosure of recent sales of securities by a registrant
was included in the first registration statement forms adopted by the Commission.243 Item 701
was adopted in 1982 in order to address abusive practices in connection with the sale of equity
securities, and requires disclosure of information about recent sales of unregistered securities. 244
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In 1996, the Commission added
a requirement to disclose the terms of conversion or exercise for convertible or exchangeable
securities, warrants or options when the disclosure is provided in a periodic or current report. 245
In 1997, based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Disclosure Simplification, the
Commission rescinded Form SR (which required the reporting of the use of proceeds following
an IPO) and moved the requirements to paragraph (f) of Item 701. 246
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. None.
Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. Two commenters
recommended the elimination of Item 701 information, on the basis that it is not meaningful to

Item 701(f) (and Securities Act Rule 463) because the continuing requirement to provide
information in periodic reports regarding the application of proceeds does “not provide investors
with useful information inasmuch as cash is fungible and it is impossible for a company to
determine whether a dollar of revenue was spent versus a dollar from the net proceeds of a
securities offering” and the discussion of cash flow in MD&A should discuss material uses of
cash. 248

Item 703 – Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers
General background. This requirement was adopted in 2003 in order to enhance
transparency of security repurchases by the issuer and its affiliates. 249 As noted in the adopting
release, most commenters agreed that this disclosure would provide investors with useful
information about the level, frequency and purpose of these repurchase activities. 250

General background. The requirement for disclosure of a summary of risk factors relating
to an offering was first set forth in 1968 in Guide 6. 251 Item 503(c) was added to Regulation S-K
in 1982 as part of the adoption of the integrated disclosure system, combining the provisions of
Guide 6 with the provisions of Guide 5 calling for disclosure of risks arising out of a lack of a
trading market. 252
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In 1995, this provision was
amended to add a requirement that the risk factors section of a prospectus be captioned with the
heading “Risk Factors” and that the section be presented following the summary. 253 In 1998, in
connection with the plain English disclosure amendments, this provision was revised to include
guidance on presenting risk factors. 254 In 2005, the Commission added risk factor disclosure
requirements to annual reports and quarterly reports. 255
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. None.
Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. None.
Item 103 – Legal Proceedings

litigation. 256 In 1935, the Commission included in Form A-2 a requirement for a brief description
of material, pending legal proceedings and proceedings by governmental authorities, where such
proceedings depart from the ordinary routine litigation incident to the kind of business conducted
by the registrant or its subsidiaries. 257 The requirement was later expanded in Form S-1 to include
(1) a requirement for identification of the court or agency, the date instituted and the names of the
principal parties, (2) a requirement that material bankruptcy proceedings involving the registrant
or its significant subsidiaries be described and any material proceeding involving a director,
officer, affiliate or principal security holder and (3) an exemption for disclosure of proceedings
involving claims of less than 15% of the registrant’s consolidated current assets. 258 In connection
with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, the legal proceedings disclosure
requirements in Form S-1 and Form 10-K were expanded to require additional disclosure about
environmental matters. 259 At the same time, the item was amended to require disclosure of the
factual basis of proceedings and the nature of relief sought and the disclosure threshold was
reduced from 15% to 10%. The requirement was moved from the forms to Regulation S-K in
1978 as Item 5. 260

76

Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. None.
Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. One commenter
recommended that the current disclosure threshold, 10% of consolidated current assets, should be
reconsidered, because for some companies, the amount of current assets, as opposed to total
company value or liquidity, may not appropriately represent materiality. 261

Item 305 – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
General background. Noting that the use of derivative financial instruments, other
financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments had increased significantly, and that
some companies had suffered significant, and sometimes unexpected, losses, the staff undertook a
review of annual reports in 1994 to assess the quality of disclosure about market risk sensitive
instruments, and, following this review, the Commission adopted Item 305 in 1997. 262 In general,
this requirement was designed to provide additional information about market risk sensitive
instruments, which investors can use to better understand and evaluate the market risk exposures
of a registrant. 263
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. There have been no substantive
amendments since the requirement was added to Regulation S-K.

261

See Letter from Ernst & Young. In recommending a reassessment of quantitative disclosure thresholds, this
commenter also suggested that disclosure rules should be coordinated with accounting standards so that the
concept of materiality is more consistently applied across disclosures and financial statements. For example,
FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20 Loss Contingencies sets forth requirements for the accrual and disclosure of
loss contingencies, including those arising in connection with legal proceedings. The requirements of ASC
Subtopic 450-20 and Item 103 are not identical, and, as noted by this commenter, the applicable standards of
materiality differ.

Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. Although smaller
reporting companies are exempt from this disclosure requirement, 264 the adopting release notes
that “if market risk represents a material known risk or uncertainty, [smaller reporting
companies], like other registrants, will continue to be required to discuss those risks and
uncertainties to the extent required by Management’s Discussion and Analysis.” 265
Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. Two commenters suggest
that emerging growth companies should be exempt from Item 305 disclosure. These commenters
note that companies that have not yet reached the revenue or market capitalization thresholds that
would disqualify them from emerging growth company status are unlikely to face meaningful
market risks. These commenters assert that prior to their IPOs, very few emerging growth
companies have such significant cash balances or outstanding borrowings that they are subject to
interest rate risk that is material to the company and they generally do not engage in hedging
activities or commodity trading. Although growing companies increasingly conduct business
globally and therefore face traditional foreign exchange rate risk, these companies tend to not
trade in foreign currencies and tend to complete offshore sales in U.S. dollars, making exchange
rate risk to not typically be a meaningful risk to emerging growth companies. 266

Items 1201 to 1208 – Disclosure by Registrants Engaged in Oil and Gas Producing Activities
General background. Adopted in 2008, these rules replace former Industry Guide 2 with
updated and codified in Regulation S-K requirements for oil and gas disclosure, particularly
requirements relating to oil and gas reserves. 269 The Commission initially implemented oil and
gas disclosure requirements in 1978 and 1982, pursuant to a directive in the Energy Policy and
Conservation Act of 1975. 270

In August 2012, as mandated by Sections 1502 and 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission adopted
new rules and forms for the disclosure of certain payments by resource extraction issuers and for
information about the use of conflict minerals. See Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers,
Release No. 34-67717 (Aug. 22, 2012) [77 FR 56365], available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/3467717.pdf, and Conflict Minerals, Release No. 34-67716 (Aug. 22, 2012) [77 FR 56273], available at.

Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. There have been no substantive
amendments since the requirement was added to Regulation S-K.
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. None. Note,
however, that Item 104 only applies to entities that are required to file reports under Section 13(a)
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and operate, or have a subsidiary that operates, a coal or other mine.
Accordingly, it does not apply to registrants conducting an IPO or, more generally, to registrants
that do not operate, or have a subsidiary that operates, a mine.

hearings about roll-up transactions, 272 these requirements were intended to enhance the quality of
information provided to investors in connection with transactions involving roll-ups of limited
partnerships and similar entities. 273

271

See Mine Safety Disclosure, Release No. 33-9286 (Dec. 21, 2011) [76 FR 81762], available at
http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2011/33-9286.pdf.

272

A roll-up transaction is a combination or reorganization of one or more public or private limited partnerships
or other similar finite-life entities in which the investors in those finite-life entities receive new equity
interests in the successor entity.

Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. Other than changes adopted in
1994 in connection with amendments to Section 14 of the Exchange Act 274 under the Limited
Partnership Rollup Reform Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-202, Title III, 107 Stat 2344 (1993)), 275 these
items have not been amended.
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. None.
Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. None.
Items 801 and 802 – Industry Guides
General background. From time to time, the Commission has published guides for the
preparation and filing of registration statements and periodic reports, representing the policies and
disclosure standards followed by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance. 276 In
connection with the integrated disclosure system, the guides relating to specific industries were
redesignated as industry guides and were listed (but not codified) in Items 801 and 802 of
Regulation S-K, in order to remind issuers of industry-specific guidance.

277

Since 1982, some of

the Industry Guides have been rescinded or modernized. 278 The following Industry Guides

278

For example, Industry Guide 1 was eliminated in 1996. See Phase One Recommendations of Task Force on
Disclosure Simplification, Release No. 33-7300 (May 31, 1996) [61 FR 30397], available at
http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-7300.txt. Industry Guide 1 was originally published in 1968 as Guide 30
(Disclosure of Principal Sources of Electric and Gas Revenues).
Industry Guide 2 was eliminated in 2008, upon the adoption of Subpart 1200 of Regulation S-K. See
Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Release No. 33-8995 (Dec. 31, 2008) [74 FR 2157], available at
http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2008/33-8995.pdf. In 1982, the disclosure requirements for oil and gas
operations contained in Item 2(b) of Regulation S-K were recast as Industry Guide 2, in order to place all
industry specific information requirements into the Industry Guides.

81

generally have not been updated substantively since they were redesignated as part of Items 801
and 802 in 1982:
•

Securities Act and Exchange Act Industry Guide 3 – Statistical Disclosure by Bank
Holding Companies 279

•

Securities Act Industry Guide 4 – Prospectuses Relating to Interests in Oil and Gas
Programs 280

•

Securities Act Industry Guide 5 – Preparation of Registration Statements Relating to
Interests in Real Estate Limited Partnerships 281

Insurance Underwriters 282

•

Securities Act and Exchange Act Industry Guide 7 – Description of Property by Issuers
Engaged or To Be Engaged in Significant Mining Operations. 283

279

Note, however, that revisions to Industry Guide 3 relating to non-performing loan disclosure requirements
were implemented in 1983, and revisions relating to exposures to borrowers in certain foreign countries
were implemented in 1986. See Revision of Industry Guide Disclosures for Bank Holding Companies,
Release No. 33-6478 (Aug. 11, 1983) [48 FR 37609] and Amendments to Industry Guide Disclosures by
Bank Holding Companies, Release No. 33-6677 (Nov. 25, 1986) [51 FR 43594]. Industry Guide 3 was first
published in 1976 as Securities Act Guide 61 and Exchange Act Guide 3. See Guides for Statistical
Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies, Release No. 33-5735 (Aug. 31, 1976) [41 FR 39007]. In 1982,
these Guides were redesignated as Industry Guide 3, applicable under both the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act. See Rescission of Guides and Redesignation of Industry Guides, Release No. 33-6384
(March 3, 1982) [47 FR 11476].

280

While the substantive disclosures relating to oil and gas producing activities were modernized in 2008 (at
which time Industry Guide 2 was eliminated), the changes did not impact Securities Act Industry Guide 4.
Securities Act Industry Guide 4 is focused on disclosure relating to the offering of interests in oil and gas
programs, such as, among others, the terms of the offering, the participation in costs and revenues,
application of proceeds and risk factors. Securities Act Industry Guide 4 was first published in 1970 as
Guide 55, which was redesignated as Securities Act Industry Guide 4 in 1982. See Definitive Guide for the
Preparation of Prospectuses Relating to Interests in Oil and Gas Programs, Release No. 33-5036 (Jan. 19,
1970) [35 FR 1233].

281

Securities Act Industry Guide 5 was originally published in 1976 as Guide 60 and redesignated as Securities
Act Industry Guide 5 in 1982. See Guide for Preparation of Registration Statements Relating to Interests in
Real Estate Limited Partnerships, Release No. 33-5692 (Mar. 17, 1976) [41 FR 17403].

282

Securities Act Industry Guide 6 and Exchange Act Industry Guide 4 were first published in 1984. See Rules
and Guide for Disclosures Concerning Reserves for Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses of
Property-Casualty Underwriters, Release No. 33-6559 (Nov. 27, 1984) [49 FR 47594].

283

Substantive disclosure requirements relating to mining companies were originally promulgated in 1941 as
part of Form S-3, a registration statement to be used for shares of mining companies in the promotional
stage. See Adoption of Form S-3 for Registration Under the Act of Shares of Mining Corporations in the
Promotional Stage, Release No. 33-2672 (Sept. 29, 1941) [6 FR 4964]. In 1981, the Commission rescinded
Form S-3 and incorporated the industry specific disclosure requirements into Form S-18, the form for small
business issuers. See Availability of Simplified Registration Form to Certain Mining Companies, Release

Requirements Relating to Securities Offerings

Item 504 – Use of Proceeds
General background. This requirement is derived from the provisions in Schedule A of
the Securities Act calling for disclosure of the estimated net proceeds to be derived from the
security to be offered, 284 as well as details about the specific purposes and approximate amounts
of the proceeds to be used and information about the sources of any additional funds to be used. 285
Schedule A also requires detailed disclosure about acquisitions of any property or goodwill
outside of the ordinary course of business using proceeds of the offering, 286 and certified financial
statements for any business to be acquired using the proceeds of the offering. 287 In 1933, the
Commission’s predecessor adopted provisions in registration statement Form A-1 that required
tabular disclosure about the proceeds of the offering, the offering expenses and the use of
proceeds and further details about transactions in which the proceeds are used to acquire property
outside the ordinary course of business. 288 In 1935, the Commission adopted similar provisions in
Form A-2 and included instructions about proceeds used to discharge loans, proceeds used for

No. 33-6299 (March 18, 1981) [46 FR 18947]. In 1992, in connection with the Commission’s small
business initiatives that rescinded Form S-18, Item 17A of Form S-18 was redesignated as Industry Guide 7,
so that the industry specific guidance would be applicable to all issuers engaged in mining operations, not
only to small business issuers. See Small Business Initiatives, Release No. 33-6949 (July 20, 1992) [57 FR
36447]. A rulemaking petition to amend Industry Guide 7 was submitted to the Commission in October
2012. See Letter from The Society For Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration, Inc., dated October 1, 2012,

working capital and proceeds to be used in conjunction with other funds. 289 In 1964, the
Commission published Guide 21 regarding the circumstances under which registrants may
disclose in a registration statement alternative uses of proceeds or a statement that management
may change the use of proceeds. 290 In 1972, the Commission added a provision to Guide 21
calling for a graphic depiction (in the form of pie charts) of the use of proceeds. 291 This item was
added to Regulation S-K as part of the expansion and reorganization of Regulation S-K in 1982,
combining the requirements of Form S-1 and Guide 21, but eliminating the requirement for the
pie chart. 292
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. There have been no substantive
amendments since the requirement was added to Regulation S-K.
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. In connection with
the disclosure simplification for smaller reporting companies, references to Regulation S-X in
Instruction 6 to Item 504 were clarified to specifically include references to the scaled financial
statement requirements in Article 8 of Regulation S-X for smaller reporting companies. 293
Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. None.
Item 505 – Determination of Offering Price
General background. This requirement is partially derived from the provisions in
paragraph 16 of Schedule A of the Securities Act calling for disclosure of the proposed offering

price or the method by which the price is to be computed and any proposed variation in price to
be offered to particular investors or classes of investors. 294 Following the Commission’s
investigation of the hot issues markets in 1971, the guides were revised in 1972 to include
disclosure about how the offering price was determined in the absence of an established trading
market. 295 This item was added to Regulation S-K as part of the expansion and reorganization of
Regulation S-K in 1982, based on the provisions of Guide 5 relating to the determination of the
offering price. 296

amendments since the requirement was added to Regulation S-K.

Item 506 – Dilution
General background. This requirement stems from a similar provision that was first
included in the guides in 1968. 297 Following the Commission’s investigation of the hot issues
markets in 1971, the guides were revised in 1972 to include instructions for registrants to

294

Schedule A paragraph (16).

295

Guide 5 (Voluminous and Verbose Prospectuses) was significantly expanded in 1972 and renamed Guide 5
(Preparation of Prospectuses). This new Guide 5 included two notes, one of which related to disclosure of
the determination of the offering price and the other related to disclosure for offerings that were not
underwritten on a firm commitment basis. See Guide 5, in Guides for the Preparation and Filing of
Registration Statements, Release No. 33-5278 (July 26, 1972) [37 FR 15985]. Guide 5 was rescinded in
1982 as part of the Commission’s program to integrate the disclosure requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act. See Rescission of Guides and Redesignation of Industry Guides, Release No. 33-6384
(March 3, 1982) [47 FR 11476].

illustrate graphically the dilution of shareholders’ equity. 298 In adopting Item 506 as part of
Regulation S-K, the Commission noted that commenters believed in the usefulness of dilution
disclosure generally, but did not support a mandatory requirement for a graphical illustration of
dilution. As adopted, Item 506 did not include a graphical illustration requirement and it
contained changes “to minimize the instances where such disclosure would be required of more
seasoned companies whose securities are selling on the basis of earnings, and where dilution of
book value generally is not material to investors.”
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. There have been no substantive
amendments since the requirement was added to Regulation S-K.
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. None.
Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. Two commenters
recommend that emerging growth companies be exempted from dilution disclosure requirements,
because, according to this commenter, the amount of dilution sustained by investors in an IPO
does not appear to be a matter that is regarded as meaningful by investors. 299 These commenters
also assert that dilution disclosure can be even less meaningful in the context of companies that
have relatively limited operating history because they will rarely have an amount of net tangible
book value per share that approaches the level of the initial public offering price in the IPO. These
commenters suggest that investors interested in dilution are able to review the recent balance
sheet and capitalization information provided in the prospectus to enable them to determine the
level of dilution that would be sustained from purchasing shares in the offering.

86

In contrast, another commenter strongly opposed this recommendation, noting that such
dilution is an important metric for institutional investors. 300
Item 507 – Selling Security Holders
General background. The disclosure of the names of any selling security holders, the
amount of securities owned and the amount to be offered were required in Form S-1. 301 This
requirement was first adopted in Regulation S-K as an instruction (Instruction 8 to Item 6) to the
requirement relating to security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management. 302 In
1982, the Commission revised the requirement and adopted Item 507, based on a provision in
Form S-16 (which was originally adopted as a registration statement form for secondary
offerings). 303
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. There have been no substantive
amendments since the requirement was added to Regulation S-K. Changes to the procedures for
identifying selling security holders in offering documents were adopted in 2005 in connection
with the Commission’s Securities Offering Reform, in order to alleviate timing concerns
associated with resale registration statements. 304
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. None.

87

Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. Two commenters
recommended eliminating the requirement to identify each stockholder selling shares in an
offering and recommended that disclosure about the amount of shares being sold in the offering
by shareholders not identified under Item 403 should be presented in the aggregate. 305
Item 508 – Plan of Distribution
General background. This requirement is derived from requirements in Schedule A
calling for disclosure of the names and addresses of the underwriters and detailed disclosure of
commissions or discounts paid to the underwriters. In 1935, in connection with the adoption of
Form A-2, the Commission adopted expanded disclosure requirements relating to underwriting
arrangements. 306 In 1947, the Commission rescinded Form A-2 and adopted amendments to Form
S-1 that eliminated the requirement for a complete outline of the material provisions of each
underwriting contract with the principal underwriters (formerly Item 23 of Form A-2). 307 In 1955,
the Commission streamlined the plan of distribution and underwriting discounts and commissions
requirements in Form S-1. 308 In 1964, the Commission published Guide 2 (Finders), Guide 7
(Underwriter’s Compensation from Conversion of Funds into Foreign Currency) and Guide 22
(Identification of Members of Board of Directors Selected by Underwriters). 309 In 1968, the

[20 FR 2965]. In 1955, Item 2 of Form S-1 required disclosure of the names of the principal underwriters
and the respective amounts underwritten, any material relationships between the principal underwriters and
the registrant, the nature of the underwriting arrangements and a brief statement of the discounts and
commissions allowed to dealers and sub-underwriters. Item 1 of Form S-1 required tabular information of
the price to the public, underwriting discounts and commissions, including finders’ fees and proceeds to the
registrant or other persons.

Commission published amendments to various guides, expanding information about underwriting
arrangements and adopting new Guide 16 (Disclosure with Respect to Newly Organized
Underwriting Firms), Guide 17 (Disclosure of Underwriting Discounts and Commissions) and
Guide 53 (Information As to Over-the-Counter Market for Securities to be Registered) which
included disclosure regarding known market makers. 310 In 1973, following the Commission’s
investigation of the hot issues markets, the Commission adopted amendments to Form S-1 that
required, in IPO registration statements, disclosure of the principal underwriter’s intentions to
confirm sales to their discretionary accounts. 311 This item was added to Regulation S-K as part of
the expansion and reorganization of Regulation S-K in 1982 and combined the requirements from
Form S-1 and Guides 5, 6, 11, 14, 16, 17, 35 and 53. 312
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. In 1993, in connection with
amendments to Exchange Act Rule 10b-6 to permit passive market making activities under
certain circumstances, the Commission adopted a new requirement for a brief description of
passive market-making to be added to the plan of distribution.313 In 1997, in connection with the
adoption of Regulation M, the Commission adopted a new requirement for the disclosure of

310

See Guides for Preparation and Filing of Registration Statements, Release No. 33-4936 (Dec. 9, 1968) [33
FR 18617]. At this time, former Guide 2 (Finders) was redesignated as Guide 11; former Guide 7
(Underwriter’s Compensation from Conversion of Funds into Foreign Currency) was revised and
redesignated as Guide 14; former Guide 22 (Identification of Members of Board of Directors Selected by
Underwriters) was redesignated as Guide 35; and additional provisions regarding disclosure of underwriting
arrangements were added to Guide 5 (Voluminous and Verbose Prospectuses) and Guide 6 (Introductory
Statements).

Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. None.
Comments submitted to the Commission’s JOBS Act website. None.
Item 511 – Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution
General background. This requirement stems from a requirement in Schedule A calling
for disclosure of amounts of expenses, itemized in reasonable detail, incurred in connection with
the sale of the securities being offered, including legal, engineering, certification, authentication
and other charges. 316 The Commission’s first registration statement forms incorporated a similar
requirement. 317 This requirement was adopted in its current form as part of the expansion and

Item 509 – Interests of Named Experts and Counsel
General background. A requirement for the disclosure of the interests of named experts
has been required since the initial registration statement forms adopted by the Commission.319 In
1970, the Commission authorized the publication of a guide relating to disclosure of the interests
of counsel and experts in the registrant. 320 The release explained that, “where counsel are named
in the prospectus as having passed upon legal matters in connection with the registration or
offering of securities potential investors should be told of any interests which such counsel may
have in the issuer or in the offering in order that they may judge for themselves the independence
and objectivity of such counsel.” 321 Pursuant to this guidance, disclosure was not required for
interests not exceeding $30,000 for firms and $10,000 for individuals. In 1982, this requirement
for disclosure about the interests of named experts and counsel was adopted as part of the
expansion and reorganization of Regulation S-K and the threshold for disclosure was raised to
$50,000 for any expert or counsel, including their firms. 322
Summary of past substantive changes to the requirement. There have been no substantive
amendments since the requirement was added to Regulation S-K.
Scaled requirements or exemptions for specified classes of registrants. None.

Other Comments Received Relating to Disclosure Requirements

One commenter 323 recommended that Regulation S-K should be harmonized with the
Staff’s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations, 324 and other sources of interpretation and
guidance, in order to reduce the complexity facing registrants.
One commenter recommended that, to review Regulation S-K, the Commission develop
and articulate a disclosure framework of guiding principles and objectives consistent with its
missions and statutory responsibilities and also consult with FASB to establish clear boundaries
between financial statement disclosure principles and objectives and those of supplemental
disclosures beyond the financial statements. The commenter suggested that the Commission use
four factors to review the requirements of Regulation S-K and determine whether disclosure
requirements warrant elimination or revision: (1) disclosures created to address a void in GAAP
requirements in the past that may now be redundant with footnote disclosures that were mandated
later, (2) disclosures of information investors can more easily obtain from sources other than SEC
filings, (3) disclosures that have become industry-specific rather than applicable to all entities and
(4) disclosures based on purely quantitative thresholds without regard for materiality. 325

Recommendations

Overview of Possible Next Steps

The staff’s review of the regulatory history of the disclosure items in Regulation S-K
reveals the incremental development of the current requirements, as changes over time have
generally sought to address specific disclosure gaps and, in some cases, mandated policy

objectives. Although comprehensive reviews of the Commission’s disclosure requirements have
been conducted from time to time, the last such review was the 1996 Task Force on Disclosure
Simplification. Since that time, technological advances have continued to significantly change
the ways that businesses operate and communicate with investors, as well as the ways that capital
markets function and market participants receive and use information. Also, several events have
occurred since 1996 that could be further relevant in motivating a review of disclosure rules: the
rise and collapse of the technology sector in 2000, the collapse of Enron, the enactment of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the financial crisis of 2008, the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and the
enactment of the JOBS Act. In light of these changes and events, the staff believes that the
Commission’s disclosure requirements should be reevaluated in order to ensure that existing
security holders, potential investors and the marketplace are provided with meaningful and, to the
extent possible in the Commission’s rules, non-duplicative information upon which to base
investment and voting decisions, that the information required to be disclosed by reporting
companies continues to be material and that the disclosure requirements are flexible enough to
adapt to dynamic circumstances.
While the study conducted in connection with this report serves as an important starting
point, the staff believes that further information gathering and review is warranted in order to
formulate specific recommendations regarding specific disclosure requirements. In particular,
input from market participants is needed to facilitate the identification of ways to update or add
requirements for disclosure that is material to an investment or voting decision, ways to
streamline and simplify disclosure requirements to reduce the costs and burdens on public
companies, including emerging growth companies, ways to enhance the presentation and
communication of information and to understand how technology can play a role in addressing

93

any of these issues. These market participants would include, among others, issuers of all sizes,
investors of all sizes, intermediaries, exchanges and other trading venues, standard setters,
analysts, legal and accounting professionals, industry and professional organizations, economists
and academics, each of which has a unique perspective.
In addition, the staff notes that economic analysis must further inform any reevaluation of
disclosure requirements. In that regard, the following economic principles should be given
consideration when reviewing and considering changes to disclosure requirements:
•

Improving and maintaining the informativeness of disclosure to existing security holders,
potential investors and the marketplace, which is particularly relevant to emerging growth
companies that need capital to invest in their businesses;

•

The historical objectives of a given rule should be considered, including a consideration of
any specific disclosure gaps, mandated policy objectives or other conditions sought to be
addressed by a given requirement’s adoption, whether such conditions are still applicable,
and, if not, whether the potential for a return of those conditions poses risks to potential
scaling or elimination of the requirement;

•

Whether the information provided by a given rule is available to existing security holders,
potential investors and the marketplace on a non-discriminatory basis from reliable
sources and, if so, any costs or benefits to such persons from obtaining such information
from sources other than the issuer, including the ability of investors to seek appropriate
redress;

•

The extent to which a given disclosure requirement entails high administrative and
compliance costs, especially for emerging growth companies;

•

The extent to which disclosure of a company’s proprietary information may have
competitive or other economic costs, which may be particularly relevant to emerging
growth companies;

94

•

Maintenance of the Commission’s ability to conduct an effective enforcement program
and deter fraud, especially regarding disclosures shown to be instrumental in detection and
deterrence; and

•

The importance of maintaining investor confidence in the reliability of public company
information, in order to, among other things, encourage capital formation.
Therefore, after considering the information gathered in connection with the preparation of

this report, the staff recommends the development of a plan to systematically review (on either a
comprehensive or a targeted basis, as discussed below) the disclosure requirements in the
Commission’s rules and forms, including Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X, and the related
rules concerning the presentation and delivery of information to investors and the marketplace.
The review should also include disclosure requirements developed through interpretations in
Commission releases and staff interpretations and guidance. In addition, the review should
consider whether there are factors external to the Commission’s rules that may have contributed
to the length and complexity of company filings and the costs of compliance, such as Commission
enforcement actions and judicial opinions. The plan would set forth the scope of the review by
identifying the broad topics to be covered and, for each topic, would identify preliminary issues to
be considered and the recommended means for gathering information from necessary parties.
After conducting the review and related information gathering, the staff would, as appropriate,
recommend to the Commission proposals for revisions to the disclosure requirements in the
Commission’s rules and forms and the related rules concerning presentation and delivery of
information.
The staff has identified two alternative frameworks for structuring such a review: a
comprehensive approach (reviewing and updating requirements on a wholesale basis, taking into
account the appropriateness of substantive requirements as a whole as well as presentation and

95

delivery issues) and a targeted approach (reviewing and updating requirements on a topic by topic
basis). A comprehensive approach has the benefit of addressing the interplay between all sources
of disclosure requirements in order to be better positioned to modernize and simplify the
requirements, while also addressing issues relating to presentation and delivery of information. In
addition, viewing the disclosure requirements in their entirety would likely help keep the focus on
disclosure that is relevant to the total mix of information and better address repetition in filings.
The staff acknowledges, however, that such an approach would likely be a longer-term project
involving significant staff resources across the Commission.
Alternatively, a targeted approach might allow for a more in-depth analysis of each topic
and allow changes to be made more quickly. In addition, a targeted approach could allow the
staff to identify and prioritize the review of the most challenging aspects of the current rules. On
the other hand, a targeted approach could inhibit efforts to simplify the disclosure regime as a
whole, resulting in less streamlined disclosure overall. For example, some requirements, such as
the executive compensation disclosure rules, have been, over the years, the focus of successive indepth reviews but have not been recently considered in the context of the complete set of
disclosure requirements. For this reason, any targeted approach should still, as much as
practicable, retain an emphasis on the overarching disclosure framework. In a targeted approach,
after an open comment period, the Commission would address each of the topics outlined below
under the heading “Potential Areas for Further Study,” proposing streamlined and principlesbased requirements. This approach could allow for faster movement to adoption of revised rules.
The staff believes that a comprehensive approach would be able to achieve the dual goals
of streamlining requirements for companies, including emerging growth companies, and focusing
on useful and material information for investors. This is due, in part, to the nature of events and

96

changes that have occurred since the last comprehensive review in 1996, and in part to balancing
the economic principles outlined above. Although the staff is mindful of the practical
considerations outlined above with respect to each of the approaches, the staff recommends
undertaking a comprehensive review.
Finally, as noted above, the staff expects that such a review would require significant
information gathering and analysis and would be of great interest to market participants.
Accordingly, in formulating the scope of the review and in conducting the review, the staff
recommends gathering information using a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, the
staff performing its own research and seeking comment from, holding discussions with, and
analyzing information from interested parties, including investors, issuers, auditors, attorneys,
underwriters and investment banking professionals, professional and industry organizations, other
regulators, standard setters, and academics.
B.

Potential Areas for Further Study

This section briefly summarizes the staff’s preliminary suggestions for further study and
information gathering. These suggestions are not intended to be exclusive or to prioritize any
potential areas of further study.
Review of Requirements in Regulation S-K.
Using the information in this report as a starting point for understanding the regulatory
history of the requirements, the staff recommends further review and information gathering to
identify ways to modernize and simplify the requirements in Regulation S-K in a manner that
reduces the costs and burdens on companies while still providing material information.
The staff believes that any such review could be more effective if it addresses the
following four issues:

97

•

First, as a general matter, the staff believes that any recommended revisions
should emphasize a principles-based approach as an overarching component of
the disclosure framework, in order to address the tendency toward
implementation of increasing layers of static requirements, while preserving the
benefits of a rules-based system affording consistency, completeness and
comparability of information across registrants. 326 Similar to the current rules and
guidance for MD&A disclosure, a disclosure model based on broad principles
could be supplemented, as needed, by timely and transparent guidance by the
Commission or staff in order to assist companies in tailoring the broad principles
to their facts and circumstances.

•

Second, the staff believes that any review of the disclosure requirements should
include an evaluation of the appropriateness of current scaled disclosure
requirements and whether further scaling would be appropriate for emerging
growth companies or other categories of issuers.

•

Third, the staff believes that any review of the disclosure requirements should
include an evaluation of methods of information delivery and presentation, both
through the EDGAR system and other means. For example, the review could
explore a possible filing and delivery framework based on the nature and
frequency of the disclosures, including a “core” disclosure or “company profile”
filing with information that changes infrequently, periodic and current disclosure
filings with information that changes from period to period, and transactional
filings that have information relating to specific offerings or shareholder
solicitations.

•

Finally, the staff believes that any review of disclosure requirements should
consider ways to present information that would improve the readability and

326

For example, one of the recommendations emerging from the 31st Annual SEC Government-Business
Forum on Small Business Capital Formation in 2012 was that the Commission add a general instruction to
Regulation S-K that would permit smaller reporting companies to omit disclosure pursuant to a line item in
Regulation S-K in the event such disclosure is not material from the perspective of a reasonable investor,
similar to Rule 502(b) for purposes of disclosure under Regulation D. Forum participants felt that this
would “add an element of principles-based disclosure to Regulation S-K.”

98

navigability of disclosure documents and explore methods for discouraging
repetition and the disclosure of immaterial information. In that regard, the review
could explore whether technology could be used to make disclosure documents
easier to prepare and easier to use. For example, the use of dynamic crossreferencing (such as hyperlinks) could reduce redundancy while ensuring that
investors have access to information where relevant. The review could also
reevaluate the use of quantitative thresholds and other standards of materiality
incorporated into the rules. 327 In addition, this review could identify and reassess
requirements calling for information that is already readily accessible to market
participants, such as historical stock price information.
In addition to these issues, the staff has identified the following specific areas of
Regulation S-K that could benefit from further review:
Risk-related requirements. The requirements for risk-related disclosures should be
reviewed in order to improve the disclosures and to identify whether different risk-related
disclosures should be required. The review could consider, for example, whether to consolidate
requirements relating to risk factors, legal proceedings and other quantitative and qualitative
information about risk and risk management into a single requirement. As part of this review, the
staff could revisit the requirements for quantitative and qualitative market risk in Item 305 and
could review whether alternative approaches to risk disclosures could be more appropriate.
Requirements relating to a registrant’s business and operations. The requirements for
description of business and description of properties disclosure should be reviewed for continuing
relevance in light of changes that have occurred in the way that businesses operate. For example,
327

For example, there are quantitative thresholds in Item 103 (Legal Proceedings), Item 404 (Transactions with
Related Persons, Promoters and Certain Control Persons) and Item 509 (Interests of Named Experts and
Counsel). The staff could revisit the recommendations of the 1996 Disclosure Simplification Task Force to
replace quantitative thresholds with general materiality standards and consider providing guidance as
necessary with respect to factors that could be considered in making materiality determinations in
connection with particular disclosure Items.

99

information about principal properties, mines and plants was relevant when all businesses needed
a physical presence, but is no longer as relevant for businesses that do not require physical
locations to operate or can easily substitute physical locations without any material impact on
their operations. For businesses that do have properties that are material, disclosure requirements
could be refocused on material facts about those properties that would inform investors about the
significance of the property to the business and any trends or uncertainties in connection with that
property, rather than requiring a list of locations, capacity and ownership. Changes in the way
that businesses operate may also make other disclosures relevant that are not expressly addressed
under current requirements. For example, requirements could be more specific as to additional
disclosure that would be necessary where a business relies heavily on intellectual property owned
by a third party or relies on service agreements with third parties to perform necessary business
functions.
Requirements relating to description of the business should be reviewed to confirm that
the information elicited remains relevant, and such a review could consider issues relating to
presentation and delivery of the information, as well as the potential for calibrating the
information for different types of investors. In addition, the requirements could be reevaluated in
light of their particular emphasis on disclosure relating to non-U.S. operations and risks relating
to dependence of any segments on non-U.S. operations.
Corporate governance disclosure requirements. The requirements for corporate
governance disclosure should be reviewed to confirm that the information is material to investors
and develop ways to obtain disclosure that is presented in a manner that provides investors with
effective access to material information and avoids boilerplate. Alternative forms of presentation

100

of the information, such as including the information in a filing that is only updated when changes
occur, should also be evaluated.
Executive compensation requirements. Although the requirements for executive
compensation disclosure have been amended more often than any of the other disclosure
requirements in Regulation S-K, executive compensation disclosure is sometimes pointed to by
companies and practitioners as an area with lengthy, technical disclosure. 328 The executive
compensation disclosure requirements should be evaluated in light of these concerns and
reviewed to confirm that the required information is useful to investors. The review could also
evaluate whether further scaling is appropriate.
Offering-related requirements. The requirements for disclosure relating to offerings have
not been reviewed comprehensively, although offerings have significantly changed over the years.
These requirements, including, among others, requirements for the presentation of information in
prospectuses, required legends and undertakings, should be reviewed in light of the changes in
offerings and the shift from paper-based offering documents to electronically-delivered offering
materials. In addition, requirements pertaining to underwriting arrangements and compensation
could be updated to reflect changes in market practice. Further review could also explore using
principles-based requirements for disclosure that are currently required, such as use of proceeds
and offering expenses, or combining information about dilution, shares eligible for future sale and
securities authorized for issuance under equity plans and under outstanding securities and
agreements. Disclosure requirements relating to the securities of a registrant should also be
reviewed with a focus on whether principles-based requirements would be appropriate.
328

See, e.g., the 2011 survey of Financial Executives International summarized in KPMG & Financial
Executives Research Foundation, Disclosure Overload and Complexity: Hidden in Plain Sight (2011),
available at http://www.kpmg.com/US/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/disclosureoverload-complexity.pdf.

101

Exhibit requirements. Since the last comprehensive review of exhibit requirements was
conducted (in 1980), the number of required exhibits has grown. The staff is also aware that
some exhibit filings can be difficult to locate on the Commission’s EDGAR system, 329 which can
cause frustration to market participants. The staff believes it would be beneficial to review the
manner in which exhibits are made publicly available on the Commission’s website, as well as
comprehensively review the requirements to confirm whether the documents called for remain
relevant and useful and whether other documents should be added.
Other General Requirements Included in Item 10. Since its adoption in 1977, Regulation
S-K has been a catch-all for requirements of general applicability, such as the Commission’s
policy on the use of securities ratings in filings, the conditions for the use of non-GAAP financial
measures and the scaled disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies. A
comprehensive approach to review of the disclosure requirements should also include these
topics.
Regulation M-A. The staff recommends considering whether the requirements of
Regulation M-A should be included in the review, given that it was adopted more recently (in
1999) than other portions of Regulation S-K. It could be beneficial to seek the input of market
participants on whether these requirements should be reviewed.
Emerging Growth Companies.
The staff recommends further consideration of the criteria to be used for purposes of
eligibility for potential further scaling of disclosure requirements and, in particular, whether
companies that meet criteria other than the qualifications for emerging growth company status

329

This issue was raised in the 1996 Report of the Task Force on Disclosure Simplification, but the changes to
filing procedures recommended at the time were not implemented.

102

would be appropriate. Careful consideration also should be given to the difference between small
business requirements and emerging growth company requirements. The five economic
principles discussed above should be considered in determining which companies should be
allowed to scale their disclosures and how companies should migrate to a standard disclosure
regime as they mature and the extent to which disclosure of previously undisclosed information
should later be required. This review should also include consideration of the definitional
thresholds for smaller reporting companies, as well as the definitional thresholds for accelerated
filers and large accelerated filers.
Industry Guides.
The staff recommends reviewing the Industry Guides to evaluate whether they still elicit
useful information and conform to industry practice and trends. For example, this could include
an evaluation of the guidance set forth in Industry Guide 3 in light of the growth and complexity
of financial institutions since it was last amended in 1986, as well as developments in
international regulatory reforms in this area. Likewise, the requirements of Industry Guide 5
could be evaluated in light of the changes to the business and financial practices relating to real
estate companies since it was issued in 1976. In addition, review could be made as to whether
any of the Industry Guide provisions should be codified in Regulation S-K, whether information
is duplicative with accounting standards and whether scaled requirements or transition periods
should be available for certain classes of registrants.
Financial Reporting and Disclosure Requirements.
The financial reporting requirements of Regulation S-X could be comprehensively
reviewed, as the last such review was conducted in connection with the implementation of the
integrated disclosure system. Another area to review is disclosure requirements that may now be

103

redundant with financial statement disclosure requirements mandated at a later time. Part of this
review could also address the Regulation S-K requirements for annual and quarterly selected
financial data disclosure and the ratio of earnings to fixed charges.
Disclosure Requirements Contained in Rules and Forms.
The staff recommends reviewing the disclosure requirements that are contained in rules
and forms, such as Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, as part of a comprehensive review of all disclosure
requirements as well as in connection with issues relating to presentation and delivery of
information to investors (including, as noted above, a possible filing and delivery framework
based on the nature and frequency of the disclosures).
C.

Conclusion

In light of the number and breadth of prior initiatives to review the Commission’s
disclosure requirements summarized in this report, and the detailed inventory of Regulation S-K
illustrating the range of topics covered by the disclosure requirements, the staff has identified two
possible approaches (a comprehensive approach and a targeted approach) for further work to
develop particular recommendations for revised disclosure requirements for all registrants,
including emerging growth companies. Although a comprehensive approach would likely be a
longer-term project involving significant staff resources across the Commission, the staff believes
that a comprehensive approach would be able to achieve the dual goals of streamlining
requirements for companies, including emerging growth companies, and focusing on useful and
material information for investors. Accordingly, the staff recommends that a comprehensive
approach should be used to review and revise the disclosure requirements.
