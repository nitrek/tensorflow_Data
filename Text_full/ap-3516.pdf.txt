POSTPONEMENT ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
on December 30, 2015, and the hearing was scheduled to commence on January 25, 2016. The OIP
alleges that Respondent is a corporation with a class of securities registered with the Commission
pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and has repeatedly failed to file required periodic
reports. The Division of Enforcement is seeking to revoke the registration of Respondent’s
securities.
Respondent was served with the OIP by January 13, 2016.1 The OIP provides that
Respondent’s Answer is due within ten days of service of the OIP on it. See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.220(b). If Respondent fails to file an Answer within the time provided, it will be deemed
to be in default, and the undersigned will enter an order revoking the registration of its securities.
See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). To allow time for an Answer, the hearing will
be postponed sine die, and a prehearing conference will be held by telephone on February 26,
2016, at 11:30 a.m. EST, if the proceeding has not been resolved by then.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
