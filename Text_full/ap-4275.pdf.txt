POSTPONEMENT ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(Exchange Act). The OIP alleges that each Respondent is a corporation with a class of securities
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and has
repeatedly failed to file required periodic reports. The Division of Enforcement is seeking to
revoke the registration of Respondents’ securities. Consistent with 17 C.F.R. § 201.161, the
telephonic prehearing conference scheduled for October 21, 2016, will be postponed until
December 16, 2016, at 10:00 a.m. EST, if the proceeding has not been resolved by then.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
