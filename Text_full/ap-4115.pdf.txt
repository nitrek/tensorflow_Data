In the Matter of
MIDDLEBURY SECURITIES, LLC

ORDER GRANTING
MOTION FOR EXTENSION

GREGORY OSBORN

On June 14, 2016, these proceedings were consolidated in their entirety and I ordered a
briefing schedule that set a July 29 deadline for motions for summary disposition, an August 19
deadline for oppositions, and an August 31 deadline for replies. Middlebury Sec., LLC, Admin.
Proc. Rulings Release No. 3915, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2100. On August 31, 2016, Respondent
Gregory Osborn properly filed a motion seeking “a one week extension to respond,” which I
construe as a request that his opposition filing deadline be extended from August 19 to September 7.
The motion is GRANTED. Osborn’s opposition is now due Wednesday, September 7,
2016. The Division of Enforcement shall not file a reply unless ordered to do so.
Osborn is informed that if he claims an inability to pay a monetary sanction, he must file a
sworn financial disclosure statement, the form for which the Division shall provide to him on his
request. Such statement should provide an explanation for how he is paying for two children to
attend college.
