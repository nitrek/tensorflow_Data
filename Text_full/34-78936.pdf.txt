File No. 3-17577

In the Matter of

ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTION
15(b) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE
ACT OF 1934 AND NOTICE OF HEARING

ROBERT SEIBERT,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to
Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Robert Seibert
(“Respondent” or “Seibert”).
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A.

RESPONDENT

1.
Robert Seibert, a.k.a. “John Grey,” age 62, current employment unknown.
He was the owner and manager of Universal Stock Transfer (“UST”). Seibert has never been
registered with the SEC, although he took and passed the Series 1 exam in 1976. Seibert has a
criminal and regulatory disciplinary record, including a 1993 complaint filed by the SEC which
resulted in the entry of an injunction and monetary relief, SEC v. Mitchell Communications Corp. et
al. (N.D. Ga. Dec. 21, 1993), Lit. Rel. No. 13950; two separate convictions for wire fraud and
conspiracy to commit securities fraud in 2000; a 2005 conviction for grand theft and fraud in the
offer of securities in Orange County, California; and 2008 and 2013 Desist and Refrain Orders
1

entered against him by the California Department of Business Oversight related to fraud in
connection with his sale of securities in California.
B.

ENTRY OF THE INJUNCTION

2.
On July 8, 2016, permanent injunctions were entered against Seibert,
permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws and prohibiting him
from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, in the civil action
entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Robert Seibert a.k.a., John Grey, Civil Action
Number 2:15-cv-09331, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.
3.
The Commission’s complaint alleged that, from at least January 2013 and
February 2015, in connection with the sale of securities, Seibert and sales agents for UST coldcalled vulnerable, elderly investors and encouraged them to purchase a variety of stocks quoted on
the “OTC Link,” an inter-dealer quotation system for over-the-counter securities. Seibert and the
UST sales agents induced investors to invest by falsely guaranteeing varying returns of up to
double their investment and holding himself out as an experienced broker and affiliate of the
issuers. The Complaint further alleged that UST, through Seibert and its sales agents, raised
$513,810 from at least 41 people residing in several states, including California. But instead of
using the investors’ money to purchase securities, Seibert misappropriated the entirety of the funds,
spending it for his personal benefit, including paying for travel, purchasing merchandise and meals,
and making payments on his outstanding child support obligations. Finally, the Complaint alleged
that Seibert used “John Grey” as an alias in carrying out this fraud. In doing so, he concealed his
true name and his civil and criminal disciplinary record.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it
necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be instituted
to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations; and
B.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act.
IV.
