UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
May 6, 2016

In the Matter of
Striper Energy, Inc.

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of current and
accurate information concerning the securities of Striper Energy, Inc. (“Striper”) due to questions
regarding the accuracy and adequacy of publicly disseminated information in the company’s
December 31, 2015 annual report and accompanying financials provided to OTC Markets Group,
Inc. (“OTC Markets”) concerning, among other things, Striper’s operations and financial
obligations. Striper is a Florida corporation based in Addison, Texas. Its securities are quoted
on OTC Link (previously “Pink Sheets”), operated by OTC Markets, under the ticker symbol
“CPCCD.”
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors
require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on May 6, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on May 19, 2016.
By the Commission.
