GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
I.	

Eligibility Requirements for Use of Form F-1

A.	

Form F-1 shall be used for registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) of securities of all foreign private issuers
as defined in Rule 405 (§230.405 of this chapter) for which no other form is authorized or prescribed.
In addition, this form shall not be used for an offering of asset-backed securities, as defined in 17 CFR 229.1101.

B.	

If a registrant is a majority-owned subsidiary, which does not itself meet the conditions of these eligibility requirements, it shall
nevertheless be deemed to have met such conditions if its parent meets the conditions and if the parent fully guarantees the securities
being registered as to principal and interest. Note: In such an instance the parent-guarantor is the issuer of a separate security
consisting of the guarantee which must be concurrently registered but may be registered on the same registration statement as are
the guaranteed securities. Both the parent-guarantor and the subsidiary shall each disclose the information required by this Form
as if each were the only registrant except that if the subsidiary will not be eligible to file annual reports on Form 20-F after the
effective date of the registration statement, then it shall disclose the information specified in Forms S-1 (§239.11 of this chapter).
Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X (§210.3-10 of this chapter) specifies the financial statements required.

II.	 Application of General Rules and Regulations
A.	

Attention is directed to the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act, particularly Regulation C (§230.400 et seq. of
this chapter) thereunder. That Regulation contains general requirements regarding the preparation and filing of registration statements.

B.	

Attention is directed to Regulation S-K (§229.22 of this chapter) and Form 20-F (§249.220f of this chapter) for the requirements
applicable to the content of registration statements under the Securities Act. Where this Form directs the registrant to furnish
information required by Regulation S-K or Form 20-F and the item of Regulation S-K or Form 20-F so provides, information need
only be furnished to the extent appropriate.

C. 	 A registrant must file the Form F-1 registration statement in electronic format via the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering
and Retrieval System (EDGAR) in accordance with the EDGAR rules set forth in Regulation S-T (17 CFR Part 232), except that
a registrant that has obtained a hardship exception under Regulation S-T Rule 201 or 202 (17 CFR 232.201 or 232.202) may file
the registration statement in paper. For assistance with technical questions about EDGAR or to request an access code, call the
EDGAR Filer Support Office at (202) 942-8900. For assistance with questions about the EDGAR rules, call the Office of EDGAR
and Information Analysis at (202) 942-2940.
D. 	 The Form F-1 registration statement must be in the English language, as required by Regulation S-T Rule 306 (17 CFR 232.306) for
electronic filings and Securities Act Rule 403(c) (17 CFR 230.403(c)), generally. If the registration statement requires the inclusion, as
an exhibit or attachment, of a document that is in a foreign language, the registrant must provide instead either an English translation
or an English summary of the foreign language document in accordance with Securities Act Rule 403(c) (17 CFR 230.403(c)) for
both electronic and paper filings. The registrant may submit a copy of the unabridged foreign language document along with the
English translation or English summary as permitted by Regulation S-T Rule 306(b) (17 CFR 232.306(b)) for electronic filings or
by Securities Act Rule 403(c)(4) (17 CFR 230.403(c)(4)) for paper filings.
E. 	 A registration statement filed (or submitted for confidential review) under Section 6 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77f) by an
emerging growth company, defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(19)), prior to an initial public offering
may omit financial information for historical periods otherwise required by Regulation S-X (17 CFR Part 210) and Item 8.A. of
Form 20-F (17 CFR 249.220f) as of the time of filing (or confidential submission) of the registration statement, provided that:
		
1. The omitted financial information relates to a historical period that the registrant reasonably believes will not be required
to be included in this Form at the time of the contemplated offering; and
		
2. Prior to the registrant distributing a preliminary prospectus to investors, the registration statement is amended to include all
financial information required by Regulation S-X at the date of the amendment.
III.	 Exchange Offers
	
If any of the securities being registered are to be offered in exchange for securities of any other issuer the prospectus shall also
include the information which would be required by Item 11 if the securities of such other issuer were registered on this Form. If such
other issuer is not eligible to use this Form F-1, then the prospectus shall include the information which would be required by Item 11 of
Form S-1 (§239.11 of this chapter) if the securities of such other issuer were being registered on Form S-1. There shall also be included the
information concerning such securities of such other issuer which would be called for by Item 9 if such securities were being registered.
In connection with this instruction, reference is made to Rule 409 (§229.501 of this chapter).

IV.	 Roll-up Transactions
	
If the securities to be registered on this Form will be issued in a roll-up transaction as defined in Item 901(c) of Regulation S-K (17

new registration statement. The information contained in such a Rule 462(b) registration statement shall be deemed to be a part of the
earlier registration statement as of the date of effectiveness of the Rule 462(b) registration statement. Any opinion or consent required
in the Rule 462(b) registration statement may be incorporated by reference from the earlier registration statement with respect to the
offering, if: (i) such opinion or consent expressly provides for such incorporation; and (ii) such opinion relates to the securities registered
