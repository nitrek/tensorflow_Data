Note that if you are filing an umbrella registration, you should not check Item 7.A.(2)

Schedule D for your relying advisers. You should complete a Schedule R for each
relying adviser.
For each related person, including foreign affiliates that may not be registered or
required to be registered in the United States, complete Section 7.A. of Schedule D.
19

You do not need to complete Section 7.A. of Schedule D for any related person if: (1) you
have no business dealings with the related person in connection with advisory services
you provide to your clients; (2) you do not conduct shared operations with the related
person; (3) you do not refer clients or business to the related person, and the related
person does not refer prospective clients or business to you; (4) you do not share
supervised persons or premises with the related person; and (5) you have no reason to
believe that your relationship with the related person otherwise creates a conflict of
interest with your clients.
You must complete Section 7.A. of Schedule D for each related person acting as qualified
custodian in connection with advisory services you provide to your clients (other than
any mutual fund transfer agent pursuant to rule 206(4)-2(b)(1)), regardless of whether
you have determined the related person to be operationally independent under rule
206(4)-2 of the Advisers Act.

SEC-registered adviser or SEC exempt reporting adviser reports this information with
respect to any such private fund in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D of its Form ADV (e.g., if
you are a subadviser), do not complete Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D with respect to that
private fund. You must, instead, complete Section 7.B.(2) of Schedule D.
In either case, if you seek to preserve the anonymity of a private fund client by
maintaining its identity in your books and records in numerical or alphabetical code, or
similar designation, pursuant to rule 204-2(d), you may identify the private fund in
Section 7.B.(1) or 7.B.(2) of Schedule D using the same code or designation in place of
the fund’s name.

Item 11 Disclosure Information
In this Item, we ask for information about your disciplinary history and the disciplinary history
of all your advisory affiliates. We use this information to determine whether to grant your
application for registration, to decide whether to revoke your registration or to place limitations
on your activities as an investment adviser, and to identify potential problem areas to focus on
during our on-site examinations. One event may result in “yes” answers to more than one of the
questions below. In accordance with General Instruction 5 to Form ADV, “you” and “your”
include the filing adviser and all relying advisers under an umbrella registration.
Your advisory affiliates are: (1) all of your current employees (other than employees performing
only clerical, administrative, support or similar functions); (2) all of your officers, partners, or

are.
If you are registered or registering with the SEC or if you are an exempt reporting adviser, you
may limit your disclosure of any event listed in Item 11 to ten years following the date of the
event. If you are registered or registering with a state, you must respond to the questions as

in responding to Items 11.A.(1), 11.A.(2), 11.B.(1), 11.B.(2), 11.D.(4), and 11.H.(1)(a). For

B. Indirect Owners
(1) Section 4.B. asks for information about your indirect owners; you must first complete
Section 4.A., which asks for information about your direct owners.
(2) Indirect Owners. With respect to each owner listed in Section 4.A. (except individual
owners), list below:
(a) in the case of an owner that is a corporation, each of its shareholders that beneficially
owns, has the right to vote, or has the power to sell or direct the sale of, 25% or more of a
class of a voting security of that corporation;
For purposes of this Section, a person beneficially owns any securities: (i) owned by
his/her child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, sibling,
mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-inlaw, sharing the same residence; or (ii) that he/she has the right to acquire, within 60
days, through the exercise of any option, warrant, or right to purchase the security.
(b) in the case of an owner that is a partnership, all general partners and those limited and
special partners that have the right to receive upon dissolution, or have contributed, 25%
or more of the partnership’s capital;
(c) in the case of an owner that is a trust, the trust and each trustee; and
(d) in the case of an owner that is a limited liability company (“LLC”), (i) those members
that have the right to receive upon dissolution, or have contributed, 25% or more of the
LLC’s capital, and (ii) if managed by elected managers, all elected managers.
(3) Continue up the chain of ownership listing all 25% owners at each level. Once a public
reporting company (a company subject to Sections 12 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act) is
reached, no further ownership information need be given.

67

(4) In the DE/FE/I column below, enter “DE” if the owner is a domestic entity, “FE” if the
owner is an entity incorporated or domiciled in a foreign country, or “I” if the owner is an
individual.
(5) Complete the Status column by entering the owner’s status as partner, trustee, elected
manager, shareholder, or member; and for shareholders or members, the class of securities
owned (if more than one is issued).
(6) Ownership codes are:

C - 25% but less than 50%
E - 75% or more

D - 50% but less than 75%
F - Other (general partner, trustee, or
elected manager)

(7) (a) In the Control Person column, enter “Yes” if the person has control as defined in the
Glossary of Terms to Form ADV, and enter “No” if the person does not have control.
Note that under this definition, most executive officers and all 25% owners, general
partners, elected managers, and trustees are control persons.
(b) In the PR column, enter “PR” if the owner is a public reporting company under Sections
12 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(c) Complete each column.
Check this box if you are filing this Form ADV through the IARD system and want the
IARD system to pre-fill Schedule B with the same indirect owners you have provided in
Schedule B for your filing adviser. If you check the box, the system will pre-fill these fields
for you, but you will be able to manually edit the information after it is pre-filled and before
