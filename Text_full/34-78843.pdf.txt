SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Release No. 78843 / September 14, 2016
Admin. Proc. File No. 3-17254
In the Matter of the Application of
MEYERS ASSOCIATES, L.P.,
and
BRUCE MEYERS
For Review of Action Taken by
FINRA

ORDER DENYING REQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT
Meyers Associates, L.P. (“the Firm”) and Bruce Meyers (collectively, “Applicants”) have
applied for Commission review of FINRA’s denial of the Firm’s application to permit Meyers to
continue to associate with the Firm. In connection with their application to the Commission,
Applicants have requested oral argument. FINRA opposes that request, asserting that “[t]he
parties are fully capable of presenting their arguments in their briefs.”
Commission Rule of Practice 451(a) provides that oral argument will be allowed in a case
of this type only if the “Commission determines that the presentation of facts and legal
arguments in the briefs and record and the decisional process would be significantly aided by
oral argument.” 1 Because the issues raised in the pending application can be determined based
on the record and the papers filed by the parties, without oral argument, it is ORDERED that
Applicants’ request for oral argument is denied.
For the Commission, by the Office of the General Counsel, pursuant to delegated
authority.
