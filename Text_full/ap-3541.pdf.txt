ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
on December 30, 2015. The OIP alleges that Respondent is a corporation with a class of
securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and has
repeatedly failed to file required periodic reports. The Division of Enforcement is seeking to
revoke the registration of Respondent’s securities.
The OIP provides that Respondent’s Answer is due within ten days of service of the OIP
on it. See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). Respondent was served with the OIP on January 13,
2016.1 To date, Respondent has failed to file an Answer within the time provided.
Accordingly, Respondent IS ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE, by February 10, 2016, why
it should not be deemed to be in default and the registration of its securities revoked. See OIP at
2; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
IT IS SO ORDERED.
