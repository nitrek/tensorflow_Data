ORDER REGARDING
SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEFING

On December 8, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondent Vinay Kumar Nevatia pursuant to Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Section 15(b).
I previously found that Nevatia was served with the OIP on December 11, 2015. Vinay
Kumar Nevatia, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3458, 2016 SEC LEXIS 8 (ALJ Jan. 4,
2016). On January 4, 2016, I ordered Nevatia to show cause why this proceeding should not be
determined against him due to his failure to file an answer or otherwise defend the proceeding.
Id. I further ordered that if Nevatia failed to show cause, the Division of Enforcement should file
a motion for sanctions by January 29, 2016, providing legal authority and evidentiary support
relating to the OIP’s allegations and the Division’s requested sanctions, in accordance with Gary
L. McDuff, Exchange Act Release No. 74803, 2015 SEC LEXIS 1657 (Apr. 23, 2015). Id. On
January 29, 2016, the Division submitted a motion for remedial relief and six exhibits.
On February 1, 2016, I ordered the Division to provide supplemental briefing on the
issues of: (1) whether Nevatia is associated, is seeking to become associated, or, at the time of
the alleged misconduct, was associated or was seeking to become associated with a broker or
dealer, and (2) the six public interest factors laid out in Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140
(5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981). Vinay Kumar Nevatia, Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3565, 2016 SEC LEXIS 347.
It has been four weeks since that order was issued and the Division has not yet submitted
any supplemental briefing.
I ORDER that the supplemental briefing will be due no later than March 11, 2016.
