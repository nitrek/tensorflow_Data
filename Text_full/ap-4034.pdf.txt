In the Matter of
MIDDLEBURY SECURITIES, LLC

ORDER

GREGORY OSBORN

On August 1, 2016, and again on August 2, 2016, Respondent Gregory Osborn emailed the
Division of Enforcement and members of this office. My office has forwarded copies of the two
emails to the Office of the Secretary for inclusion in the record. Because the harm resulting from
the disclosure of the personal, medical, and financial information contained in the emails would
outweigh the benefits, I SEAL the documents. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.322(b). Any party may move to
unseal the documents by filing a written motion.
I note that any Respondent who asserts inability to pay bears the burden of proof and
accordingly should submit new sworn financial disclosure statements, even if they have been
submitted to the Division before. 17 C.F.R. § 201.630(a).
I further ORDER Osborn to stop sending this Office emails, by cc or otherwise, unless they
are courtesy copies of filings.
If the parties wish me to consider any future submissions, they must file hard copies of all
filings with the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street
N.E., Mail Stop 1090, Washington, D.C., 20549. Among other requirements, each filing must
include a signed original and three copies, and a certification that copies have been served on the
other party. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.150, .151, .152, .153. Although electronic courtesy copies of
filings may be emailed to alj@sec.gov in PDF text-searchable format, email is not a substitute for
the required hard copy filing.
