BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision bars John J. Bravata (John Bravata) and Antonio M. Bravata (Antonio
Bravata) (collectively, Respondents) from the securities industry.1 John Bravata was previously
convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aiding and abetting wire fraud, and Antonio
Bravata was convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. They were also enjoined against
violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the securities laws.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Procedural Background
The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) instituted this proceeding with an
Order Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on June 2, 2014, pursuant to Sections 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers
Act). The proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on United States v. Bravata, No. 2:11-cr20314 (E.D. Mich. Dec. 11, 2013), appeal docketed, No. 13-2380 (6th Cir. Oct. 15, 2013),2 in
1

The proceeding has ended as to the third respondent, Richard J. Trabulsy. See John J. Bravata,
Initial Decision Release No. 641, 2014 SEC LEXIS 2666 (A.L.J. July 24, 2014), finality order sub
nom. Richard J. Trabulsy, Exchange Act Release No. 73154, 2014 SEC LEXIS 3479 (Sept. 19,
2014).

Respondents have also filed a motion for a new trial. United States v. Bravata, ECF Nos. 379,
380.

which John Bravata was convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aiding and abetting wire
fraud, and Antonio Bravata was convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud; and SEC v. Bravata,
No. 09-cv-12950 (E.D. Mich. May 29, 2014), in which they were enjoined against violations of the
antifraud and registration provisions of the securities laws. The Division of Enforcement (Division)
filed a motion for summary disposition, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a), in accordance with
leave granted. John J. Bravata, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 1636, 2014 SEC LEXIS 2595
(A.L.J. July 21, 2014). Respondents made filings dated September 10, October 10, October 27, and
November 28, 2014.
This Initial Decision is based on the pleadings and Respondents’ Answers to the OIP. There
is no genuine issue with regard to any fact that is material to this proceeding. All material facts that
concern the activities for which Respondents were convicted were decided against them in the
criminal and civil cases on which this proceeding is based. Any other facts in their pleadings have
been taken as true, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a). All arguments and proposed findings and
conclusions that are inconsistent with this decision were considered and rejected.
B. Allegations and Arguments of the Parties
The OIP alleges that Respondents were convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and
other offenses and enjoined against violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal
securities laws in United States v. Bravata and SEC v. Bravata, respectively. The Division urges that
they be barred from the securities industry. Respondents oppose this.
C. Procedural Issues
1. Official Notice
Official notice pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.323 is taken of the docket report and the courts’
orders in United States v. Bravata and SEC v. Bravata and of Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, Inc. (FINRA), records as well. See Joseph S. Amundsen, Exchange Act Release No.
69406, 2013 SEC LEXIS 1148, at *2 n. 1 (Apr. 18, 2013), pet. for review denied, 575 F. App’x 1
(D.C. Cir. 2014).
2. Collateral Estoppel
It is well established that the Commission does not permit criminal convictions to be
collaterally attacked in its administrative proceedings. See Ira William Scott, Advisers Act Release
No. 1752, 1998 SEC LEXIS 1957, at *8-9 (Sept. 15, 1998); William F. Lincoln, Exchange Act
Release No. 39629, 1998 SEC LEXIS 193, at *7-8 (Feb. 12, 1998). Nor does the Commission
permit a respondent to relitigate issues that were addressed in a previous civil proceeding against
the respondent, whether resolved by consent, by summary judgment, or after a trial. See Jeffrey L.
Gibson, Exchange Act Release No. 57266, 2008 SEC LEXIS 236, at *9-11 (Feb. 4, 2008)
(injunction entered by consent), pet. denied, 561 F.3d 548 (6th Cir. 2009); John Francis
D’Acquisto, Advisers Act Release No. 1696, 1998 SEC LEXIS 91, at *1-2 & n.1, *7 (Jan. 21, 1998)
(injunction entered by summary judgment); James E. Franklin, Exchange Act Release No. 56649,
2007 SEC LEXIS 2420, at *11 & nn. 13-14 (Oct. 12, 2007) (injunction entered after trial), pet.
denied, 285 F. App’x 761 (D.C. Cir. 2008); Demitrios Julius Shiva, 1997 SEC LEXIS 561, at *5-6
& nn.6-7 (Mar. 12, 1997). See also Marshall E. Melton, Exchange Act Release No. 48228, 2003

SEC LEXIS 1767, at *2-10, 22-30 (July 25, 2003). If either Respondent is successful in
overturning his conviction and injunction, he can request the Commission to vacate any sanctions
ordered in this proceeding (or to dismiss the proceeding, if it is still pending).3
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
Respondents were convicted after a jury trial in 2013 of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1349, 1343, and John Bravata was convicted of aiding and abetting wire
fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1349 and 2 in United States v. Bravata. United States v. Bravata,
ECF Nos. 333, 353. John Bravata was sentenced to 240 months of imprisonment followed by three
years of supervised release and ordered to pay $44,533,437.86 in restitution. Id., ECF No. 353.
Antonio Bravata was sentenced to sixty months of imprisonment followed by three years of
supervised release and ordered to pay $7,000,000 in restitution. Id., ECF No. 333.
Respondents were found to have violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act
of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and
permanently enjoined from further violations in 2014 in SEC v. Bravata. SEC v. Bravata, ECF Nos.
648, 649, 670. John Bravata and a relief defendant were ordered, jointly and severally, to pay
disgorgement of $5,201,494.89 plus prejudgment interest of $1,251,074.02, and Antonio Bravata
was ordered to pay disgorgement of $444,384 plus prejudgment interest of $98,474.14. Id., ECF
No. 670 at 4. The court ordered John Bravata to pay a civil penalty of $1,820,000, and Antonio
Bravata, a civil penalty of $130,000. Id., ECF No. 670 at 4-5.
The events underlying United States v. Bravata and SEC v. Bravata involved Bravata
Financial Group, LLC, formed by John Bravata in January 2003, and BBC Equities, LLC (BBC
Equities), started by him in May 2006. SEC v. Bravata, ECF No. 648 at 3-4. John Bravata was
associated with a registered broker-dealer, NYLIFE Securities, Inc., through October 2006.4 The
misconduct for which the Respondents were convicted and enjoined occurred from May 2006 to

July 2009.5 Id. at 3, 5-14. Respondents and others solicited investors in BBC Equities at “free
lunch” seminars, using false representations. Id. at 6-10. Unfortunately, BBC Equities was a Ponzi
scheme. Id. at 10-12, 30. Additionally, Respondents siphoned off investor funds to make luxury
purchases. Id. at 11-12, 16-17. The interests sold to investors in BBC equities were securities, and
Respondents acted as unregistered broker-dealers in selling them. Id. at 30-34. The court said, “In
finding John and Antonio Bravata guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, the jury in the
criminal case necessarily determined that both defendants ‘did participate in a scheme to defraud
investors of BBC, and to obtain money and property by means of false and fraudulent material
pretenses, representations and promises.’ . . . With respect to Antonio Bravata, the jury determined
that he ‘willfully agreed to participate and did participate in the aforementioned scheme beginning
in 2007 and continuing up to and including July 2009.’” Id. at 15-16. The court further stated, “the
jury’s verdicts in the criminal action establish, at a minimum, that each defendant willfully
participated in a scheme to defraud BBC Equities investors, and did so knowingly.” Id. at 27.
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
John Bravata and Antonio Bravata have each been convicted “within 10 years of the
commencement of [this proceeding]” of a felony or misdemeanor that “involves the violation of
section . . . 1343 . . . of title 18, United States Code” within the meaning of Sections 15(b)(4)(B)(iv)
and 15(b)(6)(A)(ii) of the Exchange Act and Sections 203(e)(2)(D) and 203(f) of the Advisers Act
and also “arises out of the conduct of the business of a broker [or] dealer” within the meaning of
Sections 15(b)(4)(B)(ii) and 15(b)(6)(A)(ii) of the Exchange Act and Sections 203(e)(2)(B) and
203(f) of the Advisers Act. Further, Respondents have been permanently enjoined “in connection
with the purchase or sale of any security” within the meaning of Sections 15(b)(4)(C) and
15(b)(6)(A)(iii) of the Exchange Act and Sections 203(e)(4) and 203(f) of the Advisers Act.
Respondents argue that the government dropped a charge of securities fraud in United States
v. Bravata, which they construe as an acquittal. However jeopardy cannot attach to a charge on
which a defendant was not even tried. Even had they been convicted of securities fraud, imposing
administrative sanctions following a conviction is not Double Jeopardy. See Gary M. Kornman,
Exchange Act Release No. 59403, 2009 SEC LEXIS 367, at *50-52 (Feb. 13, 2009) (citing Hudson
v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 98-99 (1997)), pet. denied, 592 F.3d 173 (D.C. Cir. 2010); William F.
Lincoln, 1998 SEC LEXIS 193, at *15-21 (citing Hudson). 6
Respondents also argue that the Commission lacks jurisdiction over them in that neither was
a registrant or associated with a registrant. This argument is unavailing. John Bravata was
associated with a registrant during part of the period of misconduct. Further, the court in SEC v.

The Commission’s complaint in SEC v. Bravata was filed on July 26, 2009. SEC v. Bravata, ECF
No. 1. The Commission obtained a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and asset
freeze on July 27, 2009. Id., ECF No. 22.

The Commission has even brought an administrative proceeding and imposed sanctions on a
respondent who was tried, on the same facts, and acquitted of securities fraud and all other charges.
See Vladlen “Larry” Vindman, Securities Act Release No. 8679, 2006 SEC LEXIS 862, at * 18-19
& n.21 (Apr. 14, 2006). The criminal case was United States v. Vindman, No. 1:04-cr-43
(E.D.N.Y.)

Bravata specifically found that Respondents were unregistered brokers. Their convictions arose
“out of the conduct of the business of a broker” within the meaning of Exchange Act Sections
15(b)(4)(B)(ii) and 15(b)(6)(A)(ii). Although Antonio Bravata was not a registrant or associated
with a registrant, the Commission has authority to bar persons from the securities industry based on
their association with unregistered brokers. See Tzemach David Netzer Korem, Exchange Act
Release No. 70044, 2013 SEC LEXIS 2155, at *32 (July 26, 2013) (“It is well established that we
are authorized to sanction an associated person of an unregistered broker-dealer or investment
adviser in a follow-on administrative proceeding.”); Vladislav Steven Zubkis, Exchange Act Release
No. 52876, 2005 SEC LEXIS 3125 (Dec. 2, 2005), recons. denied, Exchange Act Release No.
53651, 2006 SEC LEXIS 861 (Apr. 13, 2006) (unregistered associated person of an unregistered
broker-dealer barred from association with a broker or dealer).
Respondents argue that they have not been found to have violated any security related
provision. This is patently not so in view of SEC v. Bravata. Further, the Commission has the
authority to bar individuals based on convictions involving dishonesty that are not even securitiesrelated. See Kornman v. SEC, 592 F.3d 173, 180 (citing with approval the Commission’s policy
that “the importance of honesty for a securities professional is so paramount that [the Commission
has] barred individuals even when [a respondent’s] conviction was based on dishonest conduct
unrelated to securities transactions or securities business”) (quoting Gary M. Kornman, 2009 SEC
LEXIS 367, at *23); Don Warner Reinhard, Exchange Act Release No. 63720, 2011 SEC LEXIS
158, at *20-21 & n.27 (Jan. 14, 2011) (holding conviction for tax violation relevant to determine
whether an individual is fit to work in an industry where honesty and rectitude concerning financial
matters is critical); Ahmed Mohamed Soliman, Exchange Act Release No. 35609, 1995 SEC LEXIS
968, at *78 (Apr. 17, 1995) (revoking registration and imposing broker-dealer and investment
adviser bars based on a misdemeanor conviction for submitting false documents to the Internal
Revenue Service); Bruce Paul, Exchange Act Release No. 21789, 1985 SEC LEXIS 2094, at *4-5
(Feb. 26, 1985) (imposing broker-dealer bar with right to reapply for conviction of making false
statements on income tax returns); Benjamin Levy Sec., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 14368,
1978 SEC LEXIS 2430, at *4-5 (Jan. 12, 1978) (imposing broker-dealer and investment adviser
bars and other sanctions based on conviction for making false statements in a loan application). The
securities business is “a field where opportunities for dishonesty recur constantly.” Soliman, 1995
SEC LEXIS 968, at *10.
IV. SANCTION
As the Division requests, a collateral bar will be ordered.7
7

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act),
which became effective on July 22, 2010, provided collateral bars in each of the several statutes
regulating different aspects of the securities industry. Respondents’ convictions occurred after July
22, 2010. Additionally, even considering that their underlying wrongdoing occurred before that
date, the Commission has determined that sanctioning a respondent with a collateral bar for preDodd-Frank Act wrongdoing is not impermissibly retroactive, but rather provides prospective relief
from harm to investors and the markets. John W. Lawton, Advisers Act Release No. 3513, 2012
SEC LEXIS 3855 (Dec. 13, 2012); see also Tzemach David Netzer Korem, 2013 SEC LEXIS 2155;
Johnny Clifton, Securities Act Release No. 9417, 2013 SEC LEXIS 2022 (July 12, 2013); Alfred
Clay Ludlum, III, Advisers Act Release No. 3628, 2013 SEC LEXIS 2024 (July 11, 2013).

A. Sanction Considerations
The Commission determines sanctions pursuant to a public interest standard. See 15 U.S.C.
§§ 78o(b)(6), 80b-3(c). The Commission considers factors including:
the egregiousness of the defendant’s actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of the
infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the defendant’s assurances
against future violations, the defendant’s recognition of the wrongful nature of his
conduct, and the likelihood that the defendant’s occupation will present opportunities
for future violations.
Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979) (quoting SEC v. Blatt, 583 F.2d 1325, 1334
n.29 (5th Cir. 1978)). The Commission also considers the age of the violation and the degree of
harm to investors and the marketplace resulting from the violation. Marshall E. Melton, 2003 SEC
LEXIS 1767, at *4-5. Additionally, the Commission considers the extent to which the sanction will
have a deterrent effect. Schield Mgmt. Co., Exchange Act Release No. 53201, 2006 SEC LEXIS
195, at *35 & n.46. The public interest requires a severe sanction when a respondent’s past
misconduct involves fraud because opportunities for dishonesty recur constantly in the securities
business. See Vladimir Boris Bugarski, Exchange Act Release No. 66842, 2012 SEC LEXIS 1267,
at *18 n.26 (Apr. 20, 2012); Richard C. Spangler, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 12104, 1976
SEC LEXIS 2418, at *34 (Feb. 12, 1976).
B. Sanction
As described in detail in the Findings of Fact, each Respondent’s conduct was egregious and
recurrent, over a period of three years, and involved a high degree of scienter. Each willfully
participated in a scheme to defraud BBC Equities investors, and did so knowingly. Their previous
occupation, if they were allowed to continue it in the future, would present opportunities for future
violations. Absent a bar, each could re-enter the securities industry. The violations are not only
recent but continued until stopped by enforcement action: the complaint, temporary restraining
order, preliminary injunction, and asset freeze in SEC v. Bravata. There is a complete absence of
recognition by either Respondent of the wrongful nature of his conduct. The degree of direct
financial harm to investors is quantified in the millions of dollars in restitution each was ordered to
pay, and, as the Commission has often emphasized, the public interest determination extends
beyond consideration of the particular investors affected by a respondent’s conduct to the public-atlarge, the welfare of investors as a class, and standards of conduct in the securities business
generally. See Christopher A. Lowry, Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 2052, 2002 SEC
LEXIS 2346, at *20 (Aug. 30, 2002), aff’d, 340 F.3d 501 (8th Cir. 2003); Arthur Lipper Corp.,
Exchange Act Release No. 11773, 1975 SEC LEXIS 527, at *52 (Oct. 24, 1975). A conviction
involving dishonesty requires a bar, and because of the Commission’s obligation to ensure honest
securities markets, an industry-wide bar is appropriate.
V. ORDER
IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
JOHN J. BRAVATA and ANTONIO M. BRAVATA ARE EACH BARRED from associating with
any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer
6

agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization and from participating in an offering
of penny stock.8
This Initial Decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Rule 360 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, a
party may file a petition for review of this Initial Decision within twenty-one days after service of
the Initial Decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten
days of the Initial Decision, pursuant to Rule 111 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.111. If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then that party shall
have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the undersigned’s order resolving
such motion to correct a manifest error of fact. The Initial Decision will not become final until the
Commission enters an order of finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a
party files a petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission
determines on its own initiative to review the Initial Decision as to a party. If any of these events
occur, the Initial Decision shall not become final as to that party.
