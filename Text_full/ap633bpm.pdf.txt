ORDER DENYING MOTION TO
CORRECT MANIFEST ERRORS
OF FACT

On March 16, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) denied
Respondent David Henry Disraeli’s (Disraeli) request, made on behalf of himself and
Respondent Lifeplan Associates, Inc., for a thirty-day extension to file a motion to correct
manifest errors in the Initial Decision issued March 5, 2007.
On March 19, 2007, Respondent Disraeli sent to me by facsimile Respondent’s Motion to
Correct Manifest Errors (Motion), which was due on March 15, 2007.
Ruling
I DENY the Motion because it does not meet the requirements of Rule 111(h) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice. 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). Rule 111(h) specifies that a motion to
correct a manifest error of fact in the Initial Decision must be filed within ten days of the Initial
Decision and is properly filed only if the basis for the motion is a patent misstatement of fact.1
