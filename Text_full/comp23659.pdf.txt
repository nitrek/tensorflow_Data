CO~t~P~.AINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission ("the Commission") alleges the following
against Defendants Peter R Kohli, DMS Advisors, Inc.("DMS Advisors"), and Marshad Capital
Gz~oup, Inc.("Marshal"):
SUMMARY
1,

From 2012 tluough 201.5, Defendants Kohli, DMS Advisors, and Marshal, lied in

four distinct ways to induce over_ 120 investors to invest at least $3.2 million in entities owned or•
controlled by Kohli.
2.

In 2012, Kohli, a registered representative of abroker-dealer, launched Relief

Defendant The DMS Funds, which ultimately consisted of four• emerging markets mutual fund
se~•ies (collectively, the "DMS Funds"). Kohli solicited his own customers and clients to invest
in the funds using prospectuses and accompanying doclunen~s containing misrepresentations that
overstated DMS Funds' sophistication and ignored the key risk associated with these
investments.

3.

This key risk was that DMS Advisors, and Kolili, its principal, would be unable to

pay the lion's share of the funds' expenses as promised, due to the absence of assets or income
sufficient to meet such expenses.
4.

As the fiends floundered due to Kohli's extreme recklessness, Kohli engaged in

three additional frauds in an effort to keep the funds afloat. ~ixst, Kohli made material
misrepresentations in connection with tl~e sale of warrants 10 purchase Mat~shad stock, another
entity Kohli controlled. Second, Kohli misappropriated investor money that he solicited for the
purported purpose of znaki~~g investments into one of the finds, and instead used the money to
pay fund expenses. ~4nd third, as ttz~ funds neared collapse, Kohli lied to investozs in connection
with the sale of Marsl~ad promissory notes in a desperate attempt to raise money to cover fund
expenses a~~d to delay the inevitable.
5.

As a result of the conduct described in this Complaint, Kohli, DMS Advisoxs, and

Marshac~ violated, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to violate, Section 17(a) of
the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act")[15 U.S.C. § 7'7q(a)]; and Section 10(b} of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934("Txchange Act")[15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Rule lOb-5
thereunder [17 C.T'.R. § 240.1Ob-5].
6.

As a result of the conduct described in this Complaint, Kohli and DMS Advisors

violated, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to violate, Sect~zons 206(1), 206(2), and
206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940("Advisers Act")[15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-6(1), 80b6(2), 80b-6(4}] and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 275206(4)-8].
7.

As a result of the conduct described in this Coznplainf, Kohli violated, and unless

restrained and enjoizied will continue to violate, Section 34(b) of tl~e Investment Company Act of
1940 ("Investment Company Act")[15 U.S.C. § 80a-33(b)].
.TURISllICTION AND VENUE

FACTS
I.

KOHLI FRAUDULENTLY INDUCED INVESTORS TO INVEST IN D1~IS
FUNDS AND OTHER ENTITIES HE CONT1tO~.,LED
19.

In 2004, Kohli began working as a registered representative, selling ~o individuals

variable and fixed annuities, mutual fiends, and life insurance under a trade name,DMS
Financial.
20.

Kohli solicited prospective customers by mailing them invitations to his free

dinner investment seminars. Kol~li targeted individuals SO years oId and up, with ~ minimurr~
income of $25,000 per year.
21.

Kohli offered aid sold financial products to individuals who attended such

seminars, many of whom were elderly or retired, earning commissions on these sales.
22.

Tn 2012, Kohli began acting as are investment adviser to many of tl~e sai~ie people

to whom he had previously sold financial products.
23.

Koh1i maintained relationships with his brokerage customers and advisory clients

by, for example, periodically holding in-person meetings to review their investments and hosting
a holiday party for his customers and clients on an annul basis. Over file years, many of his
clients developed a deep trust of Kohli and relied heavily on hin7 for investment advice.
A.

Kohli L~unchecl DMS Funds and UsEcl Fa•anduu~en# St~teme~its t~ Overstate
DMS Funcds' Crec~i~ility at~c~ Spp~isticat~on and 11~i~irr~ize t~ze Risk
Associated Fvi~h These IYivest€nents

24.

By 2010, Koh1i bean the process offounding a mutual fund business. Though

Kohli had no experience in this field, Kohli plaruled to launch a series of mutual fiends, each of
which was designed to mirror a stock excha~lge index in an emergizig market.
25.

To accomplish this plan, Kol~li foi7ned DMS ~1.dvisors, Marshal, and DMS

Funds. Ma~•shad was the holding company for DMS Advisors aa~d DMS Financial, and Kohli
formed DMS Advisors to provide investment advisory seavices to DMS Funds.

5

26.

DMS fldvisors azid Kohli served as investment advisers to DMS Funds, agreeing

to provide investment advice to the DMS funds for compensation (which DMA Advisors and
Kohli agreed to waive until each mutual fund attained a specified amount of assets).
27.

DMS Advisors also agz•ecd to pay the expenses associated with each of the mutual

fund's expensesfhat exceeded appz•oaiinately 1% of its net assets.
28.

Prior to lauziching DMS Funds, Kohli determined that each fiend's net assets

needed to reach $12 million in order for the funds to keep their total expenses less than
approximately 1%,such that DMS Advisors would no longer have airy obligation to pay the
expenses.
29.

Kohli significantly underestimated the time it would take for each fua~d to reach

$12 million in assets, and tl~ex~efore drastically underestimated the expenses tha# DMS Advisors
would have to pay. Kohli launched the funds with no realistic plan for how DMS Advisors
would pay these expenses. As a result ofthese failures, and contrary to the registration
statiements, DMS Funds frequently had to day its own substa~~tial expenses that exceeded l% of
net assets.
30.

Kohli solicited the vast majority of his preexisting brokerage customers and

advisory clients to invest in DMS Funds, and many ofthese individuals uivested in one or more
ofthe DMS Funds.
31.

For each of the four DMS Funds, Kohli and DMS Funds £sled with the

Commission a registration statement. Each registration statement contained a correspozlding
prospectus, statement off'additional infoi7nation, and financial statements. Much ofthe factual
information acid claims about the funds in these ~~egistratior~ statements came from Kohli.
32.

On October 19, 2012, Kohli and DMS Funds filed with the Commission

z•egistration statements for the India Midcap Fund and India Bank Fuizd. Kohli reviewed and
revised each of these October 19, 2012 registration statements, and signed these and each ofthe
other 2•egistration statements filed by DMS Funds in his capacity as DMS Funds' principal
executive officer, trustee, cla~irrtzan, and C~,O.
6

33.

The registratiozisfatemenfs fos the DMS Funds all contained material

misrepresentations and omissions designed to portray investment in the mutual funds as
substantially less risky than it was, and to depict DMS Funds at~d llMS Advisors as far more
sophisticated than they actually were.
34.

With respect to risk, the registration statements omifted the key fact that until the

funds each reached a minimum threshold of roughly $12 million under management, DMS
Advisors would be responsible for paying the funds expenses over• a specified amount and ~DMS
Advisors had virtually no capital and no souz•ce ofincome other than direct investors.
3S.

The registz•ation statements each contain several statements that the funds would

uivest "all" or "substantially all" of their assets into the securities of the applicable index, but this
was false because the funds regularly were using a large portion oftheir assets to pay for
expenses rather than to invest in secuz~ities.
36.

With respect to the sophistication and operation of DMS Funds, the registxation

statements contained the following material misrepresentations:
a.

The registratiozi statements falsely stated t31at DMS Funds' Board of
Trustees received,con~pliance reports from DMS Funds' and DMS
Advisoxs' chief compliance officers addressing certain areas o~risk.
Neither DMS Advisors' nor llMS Fuzlds' chief compliance officer
generated such zeports for Board review. In fact, DMS Advisors and
DMS Funds had no functioning compliance pz•ogz•an~s foi~ most of their•
existence. DMS Funds did not implement compliance polices or
procedures until 2015.

b.

Tl~e registration statements falsely stated that DMS Advisors reviewed
brokex-dealer performance, seeking best execution.; adopted broker
allocation procedures; adopted policies and procedures with respect to
7

disclosure of infoi7nation about find portfolio secuzities; adopted frequent
trading policies; and adopted a code of ethics. Each ofthese statements
was false.
c.

The xegistxation statements falsely stated that the DMS Fends Board of
Trustees had three committees—the contracts committee, the governance
committee, and the audit committee—and described the tasks undertaken
by each. These statements were false. DMS I'L~nds did not have a
contracts committee or a govez~zzaa~ce comz~ittee at any tune, and there was
no audit committee until 2013.

d.

The registration statements falsely stated that tl~e DMS Funds Board of
Trustees received reports regarding the operation of DMS Ponds' service
providers, adopted proxy voting pz~oceduz~es, and delegated fair valuation
docision to its investment adviser's v~lu~tion committee. The DMA
Ijunds Board of Trustees took none ofthese actions.

37

Each ofthese misrepresentations and omissions appeared in the regisit•a~ion

statements filed by Kohli on behalf of DMS Funds for each of the four• funds.
~3.

DMS Funds Was an X~merliate Failure and Ko~li Resorted to Adc~itionaI
Fr~iuds to Keep the Sus.iness Afloat

38.

From the very start of operations, DMS T'unds was a financial failure.

39.

Predictably, the insurmountable issues caused by the cost and fee structure Kohli

created, and DMS Advisors' lack ofinitial capztal restrlCed i~~ immediate cash shortages at the
funds caused by the need to pay expenses.
40.

On at Ieast tl-iree separate occasions, Kohli reso~-~ed to additional frauds to obtain

the money needed to pay these expenses and keep DMS Funds in operation, and to pay Kohli's
8

salary.
i.
41.

Kohli Frauclulenily Sold ME3t'3~tat~ ~Vs~2'1'~I1tS ~O Rc'liSC ~ZSS,000

By November 2013, DMS Advisors owed DMS Funds tens ofthousands of

dollars in expenses it could not reimbuzse. Neithez• Kolili nor DMS Advisox•s had tl~e money to
pay these expenses.
42.

In an effort to raise the money, on or around November 22, 2013, Kol~li solicited

his preexisting brokerage customers and investment advisory clients to buy "warrants" to
purchase stock in Marshad, DMS Advisors' bolding company. In a letter he sent to his
customers acid clients dated November 22, 2013, Kohli explained that warrazrt purchasers could
make money by selling the company's shares after Marshal had an IPO. Kohli purposefully
misidentified Marshal as "DMS Advisors" in the letter because he knew the recipients weae
unfamiliar with the name Marslaacl.
43.

Koh~li wrote that the company way "preparing to file for an initial public offering

to be launched in January 2017," the stack would be traded on the "NASDAQ," and "[t]1~e
current launch price has been initially determined to be $12 per share." None of these statements
was true.
~#4.

At the tine thaf Kohli made these representations about Marshal's IPO, Kohli

had taken no steps toward a public offering of Marshal's stock, no one had made any
determination of the likely value of Marshal shares in the event o~ a public offezialg, and Kohli
had no reason to believe that that such an offering might take place in January 2017.
45.

Within six weeks of sending the November 22,2013 letter•, Kolili sold 17

Marshal warrants fox a total amount of $258,000. The warrants stated that Marshal would pay
back the purchase price if it did not conduct a public offering by January 2017. Kohli then used

9

the mc~zxey to pay DMS Funds and other expenses;
46.

There was never any public offering of Ma~•shad securities.
ii.

47.

Kotili Stole Mare tli.~tx $340,Q00 from DMS Fuuc~s Investors

By summer 2014,DMS Advisors again owed DMS Tur~ds tens ofthousands of

dollars in unreimbursed expenses.
4$.

Begim~izlg i1~ August 2014 at~d continuing through February 2015, Kotili solicited

$342,907 in investments in the India Midcap Fund from at least eleven people, many of whom
were preexisting brokerage customers and/or advisory clients.
49.

However, Kohli never used this money to purchase shares o~the India Midcap

Fund. Instead, Kohli stole thzs money and used it to pay an7ounts that DMS Advisors owed
DMS Funds, azid to pay other business expenses.
50.

In order to conceal his theft, Kohli created :Fake monthly statements that he had

sent to these investors purporting to show the status of their investment in the India Midcap
Fund.
51.

Because of these unusual fake statements, one ofthe ~l~v~n investors becamE

suspicious and contacted the Tndia 1Vlidcap Fund's thud-party administrator for an account. o~his
Fund holdings. The third-party adzr~inistrator told this victim that it had no record of his
investment in the India Midcap Fund. When the adininistratoz• subsequently questioned Kohli
about the investor's money, Kohli lied and claiz~led that the money was actually a loan, and that
the investor misr~membered the nature of his investment because lie was suffering ~i~om menloi•y
loss. All of these statements were false.
52.

When the investor then confronted Kohli about the suspicious fake account

sta#ements, Kohli told the investor that the investor had actually agreed to loan DMS Advisors
the money and that the individual was mistaken in thinking that he had invested in the India
Midcap Fund. However, this investor, as well as others who received fake statements, never
agreed to loan DMS Advisors rzioney, and instead were told by Kohli that they were investing in
10

mutual fund.shares, as the fake account statements purported to con~irzn.
iii.
53.

Kohli Fr:~udulez~tly Sola M~rshac~ Notes to Raise $140,000

In the summer of 2015, DMS Advisors again owed DMS Funds tens of'tl~ousaz~ds

of dollars in unreimbursed expenses, and additional business expenses also began to accumulate.
54.

Kohli again resorted to fraud to raise funds in attempt to cover these expenses.

55.

On June 22, 2015, Kohli emailed many of his customers, clients, and investors,

offering to sell Marshad notes at an interest rate of 5%redeemable at the end of ninety days.
Kohli wrote that lle had a "short term lic~Llidity problem here at DMS," and that "there will be a
gap of about 60-90 days which we feel we will need to plug with loans."
56.

These stiatemez~.ts were false. Kohli knew that DMS Advisors had struggled to

pay the mutual funds' expenses from the very first year of operations, and that he already had
used fraud schemes to pay these expenses.
57.

Kohli also knew that the mutual funds held such lavv assets that DMS 1ldvisnrs

could not realistically expect to earn the advisory fees needed to repay the notes. For example,
for DMS Advisors to earn any advisory fees from the largest DMS Tund,the India Midcap Fund,
the Fund would have had to grow to over 45 times the net assets it held on June 22, 2015.
58.

Kohli did not tell these ia~vestors that there was no reasonable possibility that

Marshal would be able to repay investors. Kohli nevertheless sold Marshal promissory notes,
for a total of $140,000,from June 24,2015 through t~ctober 19, 2015.
C.

D1VIS Panels Shut Down and Koh~i's Investors Lost lVIon~y

59.

In December 201,DMS Advisors shut down the Poland Fund. DMS Funds

returned a fraction of the money invested to the investors in this fiend.
60.

In November 2015, DMS Fluids ran out of money and the DMS Funds Board of

11

Tz~ustees voted to close the three remaining mutual funds. The funds wez•e liquidated and the
proceeds ofthose securities sales, approximately $540,000, are currently being held in bank
accounts controlled Uy Kohli.
61.

DMS F~ulds' third-party ad~ninisti~ator has Halted redemptions because DMS

Advisors continues to owe the funds money fox fund expenses. DMS Advisors has not zr~ade a
payment fir expenses since October 2015.
62.

Many investors in the DMS Funds have not xeceived their money back. None of

the Marshal warrant or note purchasers has received any of his or her money back.
~I,

DEFENDANTS VIOLATED TIDE SECUNITI~S LAWS T~IROUGH T~-~E
MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS THEY MADE T4
DEFRAUD INVESTORS
63.

During the relevant period, Kohl~~i op~z~ated and controlled DMS Advisors and

Marshal.
64.

Allof tl~e misrepresentations and omissions set forth herein, individually and in

the aggregate, are material, az~d were made iz~ colinection with the offer, purchase, or sale of
securities. Them s a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the
misrepresented facts and omitted nfoi~nation important, and/or that disclosure ofthe omitted
facts or accurate information would alter the "total mix"ofinformation available to investors.
6S.

In connection with the cornduct described herein, Defendaaits acted knowingly

and/or extremely recklessly. Among other things, Aefendants knew or were reckless in not
knowing that they were making material misrepresentations and omitting to state material facts
necessary to make cextain statements not misleading under the circumstances in cox~~ection with
selling or offering to sell DMS Funds investments and Marshal war~•ants and notes.
b6.

Through their material misrepresentations and omissions, Defendants knowingly,

recklessly, or negligently obtained money or• property from investors. Defendazlts took at least
12

$32 million frond. investors, over $1.? million of which has not been returned, including tkie
approximately $540,000 in cash Kohlz is holding in bank accounts he controls.
Through this scheme, Defendants knowingly, recklessly, or negligently engaged

b7.

in acts, transactions or courses of business that operated as a fraud or deceit upon offerees,
purchasers, azid prospective purchasers.
The Marshad warrants and notes Defendants sold to investors are securities

68.

within tl~e meaning of Section 2(a)(1), of the Securities Act[15 U.S.C. ~ 77b(a)(1)] and Section
3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act[15 U.S.C..§ 78c(a)(10)J. Kohli sold the 1Vlarshad warraiats and
notes for the purpose ofraising money for a business enterprise, and tl~.e purchasers ofthe
warrants and notes ingested with the expectation of profit. Kohli sold the Marshal warrants and
notes to individual members of the general public, not to coznmereial investors, avid the warrants
and notes are not subj~cf to a xegtlatary schemie that significantly reduced the risks inherent in
their purchase.
69.

Kohli and DMS Advisors acted as investment advisers duritlg the relevant period,

by providing investment advisory services to a pooled investment vehicle, and Kol~li also acted
as an investment adviser by providing investment advsazy services to individual clients.
