In the Matter of

ORDER DENYING MOTION
TO EXCLUDE TESTIMONY

CHRISTOPHER M. GIBSON

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding on March 29, 2016.
The hearing in this matter will begin on September 12, 2016, at Commission headquarters in
Washington, D.C.
On August 31, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a motion in limine to exclude the
entire proposed expert testimony of attorneys Thomas S. Harman and Myron T. Steele,
consisting of their written reports pre-marked as Respondent’s exhibits 148 and 150. The
Division argues that this expert testimony should be excluded because it is “inadmissible” legal
argument and, thus, unnecessary, irrelevant, and/or cumulative. Specifically, the Division asserts
that: (1) Harman’s proposed expert testimony is a “legal brief” offering his interpretation of
provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and (2) Steele’s proposed expert testimony
relates “solely to Delaware law, and expressly [does] not address any aspect of federal securities
law,” the basis for the allegations. Motion at 3-6.
On September 6, 2016, Respondent opposed the motion, contending that Harman and
Steele should be allowed to rebut assertions by the Division’s expert, Dr. Gary Gibbons, a nonlawyer who Respondent asserts will offer legal conclusions as to Respondent’s conduct, such as
whether Respondent had certain fiduciary obligations. Opp. at 1, 4-6. Respondent further argues
that the Division is wrong and Respondent’s fiduciary obligations are not solely a matter of
federal law and they can be altered or governed by private agreement or state law. Id. at 7-9. I
will rule on the motion now because the hearing begins in one business day and the parties need
to schedule witnesses. 17 C.F.R. § 201.111 (c), (d).
Ruling
The Commission’s admissibility standard bars evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial, or
unduly repetitious; all other evidence is presumptively admissible. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.320. My
regular practice is to rule on admissibility at the hearing when evidence is offered because facts
and context are important to assess admissibility. Christopher M. Gibson, Admin. Proc. Rulings

Release No. 4079, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2867, at *3 (ALJ Aug. 22, 2016). I depart from that
practice in this situation to assist the scheduling of witnesses.
A significant consideration is that motions in limine are usually intended to prevent a jury
from hearing testimony that one side considers prejudicial to its position. Where, as here, there
is no jury, such pretrial motions are usually unnecessary. See United States v. Heller, 551 F.3d
1108, 1111-12 (9th Cir. 2009). Even in federal district court where, unlike here, the Federal
Rules of Evidence apply, concerns about expert legal testimony are significantly less in the
context of a bench trial. See, e.g., KnightBrook Ins. Co. v. Payless Car Rental Sys., Inc., 43 F.
Supp. 3d 965, 985 (D. Ariz. 2014); Crowley v. Chait, 322 F. Supp. 2d 530, 550 (D.N.J. 2004);
Martin v. Ind. Mich. Power Co., 292 F. Supp. 2d 947, 959 (W.D. Mich. 2002); see also In re
Salem, 465 F.3d 767, 777 (7th Cir. 2006) (“[W]here the factfinder and the gatekeeper are the
same, the court does not err in admitting the evidence subject to the ability later to exclude it or
disregard it.”); Gibbs v. Gibbs, 210 F.3d 491, 500 (5th Cir. 2000) (“Most of the safeguards
provided for in Daubert are not as essential in a case such as this where a district judge sits as the
trier of fact in place of a jury.”).
As a former administrative law judge has explained, a party filing a motion in limine
faces an uphill battle because the Commission has not been enthusiastic about orders by
administrative law judges granting motions in limine. Pub. Fin. Consultants, Inc., Admin. Proc.
File No. 3-11465 (ALJ May 27, 2004), https://www.sec.gov/alj/aljorders/2004/3-11465-3.pdf.
The Commission’s long standing position is that its “law judges should be inclusive in making
evidentiary determinations,” quoting the proposition “if in doubt, let it in.” City of Anaheim,
Exchange Act Release No. 42140, 1999 SEC LEXIS 2421, at *4 & n.7 (Nov. 16, 1999); accord
Herbert Moskowitz, Exchange Act Release No. 45609, 2002 SEC LEXIS 693, at *46 n.68 (Mar.
21, 2002); Alessandrini & Co., Exchange Act Release No. 10466, 1973 SEC LEXIS 386, at *24
(Oct. 31, 1973); Charles P. Lawrence, Exchange Act Release No. 8213, 1967 SEC LEXIS 568,
at *13 (Dec. 19, 1967).
For these reasons, I DENY the Division’s motion. Nonetheless, the parties should be
mindful that the Commission does not defer to expert testimony on the meaning of the law. See,
e.g., Mohammed Riad, Exchange Act Release No. 78049A, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2396, at *87 &
n.70 (July 7, 2016).
Lastly, the parties have filed numerous objections to exhibits, which I will address at the
hearing. Given the liberal standard for admissibility in Commission administrative proceedings
and my rulings in this proceeding, the parties could perhaps consider withdrawing some of their
objections. As one court has observed on allowing even marginally relevant evidence in an
administrative hearing, “the only conceivable interest that can suffer by admitting any evidence
is the time lost, which is seldom as much as that inevitably lost by idle bickering about
irrelevancy or incompetence.” Samuel H. Moss, Inc. v. FTC, 148 F.2d 378, 380 (2d Cir. 1945).
