The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer and are not binding on any other

Summary
1.
This matter arises from misstatements made by registered investment adviser
Shamrock to certain of its advisory clients, including clients with separately managed accounts
invested in F-Squared Investments, Inc.’s (“F-Squared”) strategy. Shamrock advertised the
strategy by negligently relying on F-Squared’s materially inflated, and hypothetical and backtested, performance track record that F-Squared misrepresented.
2.
AlphaSector is a sector rotation strategy based on an algorithm that yields a signal
indicating whether to buy or sell nine industry exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) that together
made up the industries in the S&P 500 Index. Between July 2011 and September 2014,
Shamrock offered the AlphaSector strategy to its clients.
3.
From July 2011 through October 1, 2013, in reliance on F-Squared’s false
statements, Shamrock’s AlphaSector advertisements falsely stated that: (a) assets had been
invested in the AlphaSector strategy from April 2001 to September 2008; and (b) the track
record had significantly outperformed the S&P 500 Index from April 2001 to September 2008.
In fact, no client assets had tracked the strategy from April 2001 through September 2008. In
addition, F-Squared miscalculated the historical performance of AlphaSector from April 2001 to
September 2008 by incorrectly implementing signals in advance of when such signals actually
could have occurred. Shamrock took insufficient steps to confirm the accuracy of F-Squared’s
historical data and other information contained in the materials. In addition, Shamrock did not
obtain sufficient documentation that substantiated F-Squared’s advertising claims in the
materials. As a result of this inaccurate compilation of historical data by F-Squared, Shamrock
advertised the AlphaSector strategy by using hypothetical and back-tested historical
performance that was inflated substantially over what performance would have been if FSquared had applied the signals accurately.
4.
As a result, Shamrock violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule
206(4)-1(a)(5) thereunder by publishing, circulating, and distributing advertisements that
contained untrue statements of material fact. Shamrock likewise did not make and keep true,
accurate and current records or documents necessary to form the basis for or demonstrate the
calculation of the performance or rate of returns that it circulated and distributed, as required by
Section 204(a) of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2(a)(16) thereunder.

6.
F-Squared Investments, Inc. (“F-Squared”) (SEC File No. 801-69937) is an
investment adviser that was registered with the Commission from March 2009 until
January 2016, and is headquartered in Wellesley, Massachusetts. In October 2008, F-Squared
launched its first AlphaSector index. F-Squared sub-licensed its approximately 75 AlphaSector
indexes to unaffiliated third parties who managed assets pursuant to these indexes. On
December 22, 2014, the Commission instituted a settled fraud action against F-Squared in which
F-Squared admitted, among other things, to making the materially false claims that (a) the
signals that formed the basis of the AlphaSector index returns had been used to manage client
assets from April 2001 to September 2008; and (b) the signals resulted in a track record that
significantly outperformed the S&P 500 Index from April 2001 to September 2008. See In the
Matter of F-Squared Investments, Inc., Admin. Proceeding No. 3-16325 (Dec. 22, 2014).

Howard Brian Present (“Present”), age 55, resides in Wellesley, Massachusetts.
In 2006, Present co-founded F-Squared and was the President and CEO until his separation in
2014. On December 22, 2014, the Commission filed a civil complaint alleging fraud charges
against Present in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which is
pending. See SEC v. Present, No. 1:14-cv-14692 (D. Mass. filed Dec. 22, 2014).
Facts
Shamrock’s Relationship With F-Squared
8.
In June 2011, F-Squared introduced Shamrock to its AlphaSector strategies.
Shamrock began considering whether it would enter into a model manager agreement with FSquared whereby Shamrock would establish an investment product based on F-Squared’s
AlphaSector sector rotation strategy. F-Squared marketed AlphaSector to Shamrock as an ETF
sector rotation strategy that was based on an algorithm that yields a “signal” indicating whether
to buy or sell nine industry ETFs. 3 If the algorithm produced buy signals for three or fewer
sector ETFs, the AlphaSector strategy provided for some or all of the assets to be invested in
cash equivalents.

continuous and regular supervisory or management services.
3

F-Squared created several AlphaSector strategies and sub-licensed approximately 75 AlphaSector
indexes. The AlphaSector indexes that are the subject of this matter, including the AlphaSector Premium
Index and the AlphaSector Rotation Index, are based on investments in U.S. equity ETFs. As with all
indexes, the performance of the AlphaSector Premium Index and AlphaSector Rotation Index is
inherently hypothetical in the sense that the indexes do not purport to reflect the performance of any
particular client or account. However, the AlphaSector Premium Index and AlphaSector Rotation Index
were advertised as being based on a strategy that had been in place since 2001 and therefore the
performance of these indexes was advertised as “not backtested” when in fact the performance was backtested.

3

9.
F-Squared described the strategy falsely to Shamrock by, among other things,
representing that: (a) the AlphaSector strategy had been used to manage client assets from April
2001 to September 2008, often calling it a “live” track record; and (b) the track record had
significantly outperformed the S&P 500 Index from April 2001 to September 2008. In reality,
no assets tracked the strategy until 2008 and the back-tested track record was substantially
overstated. F-Squared’s AlphaSector sales and marketing materials shared with Shamrock
claimed that clients actually achieved these performance returns for the April 2001 to September
2008 time period. In turn, Shamrock took portions of F-Squared’s advertisements, including
claims concerning the live nature of the track record and the significant outperformance claim,
and disseminated its own advertisements to its clients and prospective clients without having a
reasonable basis to conclude that F-Squared’s exceptional performance claims were true.
Shamrock’s Advertisements Contained Misstatements
10.
From July 2011 through October 1, 2013, Shamrock, in advertising its own
advisory services, disseminated AlphaSector performance advertisements for its own separately
managed account strategies that failed to disclose the AlphaSector track record for the period
April 2001 to September 2008 was hypothetical and back-tested. Shamrock typically distributed
these advertisements through electronic mail to its clients and prospective clients. As described
above, Shamrock’s AlphaSector advertisements also substantially overstated the performance of
the back-tested track record during this period based on the false information provided by FSquared.
Shamrock Failed to Have A Reasonable Basis to Believe the Accuracy of the Performance
and Performance-Related Claims in the Advertisements
11.
Shamrock knew or should have known that it did not have a reasonable basis to
believe that AlphaSector’s advertising claims were accurate. Shamrock knew or should have
known that F-Squared’s AlphaSector strategy purported performance contained in Shamrock’s
advertising materials was exceptional over the 2001-2008 period in that it significantly
outperformed the S&P 500 Index and purported to involve actual results notwithstanding that the
AlphaSector strategy was not launched until 2008. With regard to the performance claims,
Shamrock included in its AlphaSector advertisements a general statement indicating that third
parties were the source of the performance data and that Shamrock did not guarantee the
accuracy. Shamrock relied solely on documents making performance claims that were prepared
and provided by F-Squared without any other substantiation. One of the documents Shamrock
relied on was a Morningstar report provided by F-Squared that stated the information in the
report was obtained from third-party sources and had not been independently verified by
Morningstar. Having taken insufficient steps to confirm the accuracy of the AlphaSector
performance data and not having obtained sufficient documentation that would have
substantiated F-Squared’s advertised performance and performance-related claims in Shamrock’s
advertising materials, Shamrock failed to have a reasonable basis to believe that AlphaSector’s
performance was accurate when included in its own advertisements for clients considering the
strategy.

Shamrock Failed to Maintain Adequate Books and Records
12.
Shamrock was required to make and keep true, accurate and current records or
documents necessary to form the basis for or demonstrate the calculation of the performance or
rate of return that it circulated or distributed to ten or more persons. In marketing its own
advisory services, Shamrock circulated and distributed the 2001-2008 historical performance of
the AlphaSector strategy in client presentations and marketing materials and other
communications to numerous clients, investors, and potential investors. However, Shamrock
never made or kept sufficient records or documents to form the basis for or demonstrate the
calculation of the historical performance or rate of return of the AlphaSector strategy.
Violations
13.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent violated Section 206(4) of
the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5) thereunder, which make it a fraudulent, deceptive, or
manipulative act, practice, or course of business within the meaning of Section 206(4) of the
Advisers Act to, among other things, directly or indirectly publish, circulate, or distribute an
advertisement which contains any untrue statement of material fact, or which is otherwise false
or misleading. A violation of Section 206(4) and the rules thereunder does not require scienter.
SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d 636, 647 (D.C. Cir. 1992).
14.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent violated Section 204(a) of
the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2(a)(16) thereunder. Section 204(a) of the Advisers Act requires
investment advisers to make and keep certain records as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe
as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Rule 204-2
under the Advisers Act requires investment advisers registered or required to be registered to
make and keep true, accurate and current various books and records relating to their investment
advisory business, including all accounts, books, internal working papers, and any other records
or documents that are necessary to form the basis for or demonstrate the calculation of the
performance or rate of return of any or all managed accounts or securities recommendations in
any notice, circular, advertisement, newspaper article, investment letter, bulletin or other
communication that the investment adviser circulates or distributes, directly or indirectly, to 10
or more persons.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
A.
Pursuant to Section 203(k) of the Advisers Act, Respondent shall cease and desist
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 204(a) and
206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rules 204-2(a)(16), and 206(4)-1(a)(5) thereunder.
B.

Respondent shall pay a civil money penalty of two hundred thousand dollars
5

($200,000) to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the general fund of the

the following installments: Respondent shall pay $50,000 within 90 days of the issuance this
order, Respondent shall pay $50,000 within 180 days of the issuance this order, Respondent shall
pay $50,000 within 270 days of the issuance of this order, and Respondent shall pay $50,000
within 365 days of the issuance of this order. If any payment is not made by the date the
payment is required by this Order, the entire outstanding balance of civil penalties, plus any
additional interest accrued pursuant to pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, shall be due and payable
immediately, without further application. Payment must be made in one of the following ways:
(1)

Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which will
provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2)

Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov through

Asset Management LLC as the Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these
proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Jeffrey B.
Finnell, Assistant Director, Asset Management Unit, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100
F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549-5010.
C.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall
be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor
Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall it benefit by, offset or reduction of any
award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil
penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such
a Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order
granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission’s counsel in this action and pay the amount

6

of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be
deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil
penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action”
means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more
investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.

By the Commission.
