UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
September 30, 2016

In the Matter of
Rainbow International, Corp., a/k/a Raintree
Brands Incorporated
File No. 500-1

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) that there
is a lack of current and accurate information concerning the securities of Rainbow
International, Corp. (CIK No. 0001522538) (“Rainbow”) because Rainbow has
confirmed for the Commission staff that the company is no longer operating. In addition,
there is a lack of accurate information concerning the securities of Rainbow because in
Form 8-Ks filed with the Commission on May 5, 2014, May 12, 2014, and Sept. 4, 2014
by Rainbow, the company appears to have made false and misleading statements
concerning, among other things, a purported acquisition, company business relationships,
its purported development of products, purported rental revenues, and a purported
purchase of company shares by a company officer. The company appears not to have
made any information publicly available about itself for approximately two years.
Rainbow, also known as Raintree Brands Incorporated, is a Nevada corporation in default

whose principal place of business is listed as Centennial, Colorado. Rainbow shares are
quoted on OTC Link, operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc., under the ticker symbol
“RNBI.”
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of
investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of Rainbow.
Therefore, it is ordered, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Exchange Act, that
trading in the securities of Rainbow International, Corp. is suspended for the period from
9:30 a.m. EDT on September 30, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on October 13, 2016.
By the Commission.
