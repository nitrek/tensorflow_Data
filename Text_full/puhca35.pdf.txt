PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935
(References in brackets ø ¿ are to title 15, United States Code)
AN ACT To provide for control and regulation of public-utility holding companies,
and for other purposes

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled, That this Act may
be cited as the ‘‘Public Utility Act of 1935.’’
TITLE I—CONTROL OF PUBLIC-UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANIES
NECESSITY FOR CONTROL OF HOLDING COMPANIES

SECTION 1. ø79a¿ (a) Public-utility holding companies and
their subsidiary companies are affected with a national public interest in that, among other things, (1) their securities are widely
marketed and distributed by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce and are sold to a large number of investors in different States; (2) their service, sales, construction, and
other contracts and arrangements are often made and performed
by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; (3) their subsidiary public-utility companies often sell and
transport gas and electric energy by the use of means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; (4) their practices in respect of
and control over subsidiary companies often materially affect the
interstate commerce in which those companies engage; (5) their activities extending over many States are not susceptible of effective
control by any State and make difficult, if not impossible, effective
State regulation of public-utility companies.
(b) Upon the basis of facts disclosed by the reports of the Federal Trade Commission made pursuant to S. Res. 83 (Seventieth
Congress, first session), the reports of the Committee on Interstate
and Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives, made pursuant
to H. Res. 59 (Seventy-second Congress, first session) and H.J. Res.
572 (Seventy-second Congress, second session) and otherwise disclosed and ascertained, it is hereby declared that the national public interest, the interest of investors in the securities of holding
companies and their subsidiary companies and affiliates, and the
interest of consumers of electric energy and natural and manufactured gas, are or may be adversely affected—
(1) when such investors cannot obtain the information necessary to appraise the financial position or earning power of
the issuers, because of the absence of uniform standard accounts; when such securities are issued without the approval
or consent of the States having jurisdiction over subsidiary
public-utility companies; when such securities are issued upon
the basis of fictitious or unsound asset values having no fair

Sec. 2

relation to the sums invested in or the earning capacity of the
properties and upon the basis of paper profits from intercompany transactions, or in anticipation of excessive revenues
from subsidiary public-utility companies; when such securities
are issued by a subsidiary public-utility company under circumstances which subject such company to the burden of supporting an overcapitalized structure and tend to prevent voluntary rate reductions;
(2) when subsidiary public-utility companies are subjected
to excessive charges for services, construction work, equipment,
and materials, or enter into transactions in which evils result
from an absence of arm’s-length bargaining or from restraint
of free and independent competition; when service, management, construction, and other contracts involve the allocation
of charges among subsidiary public-utility companies in different States so as to present problems of regulation which
cannot be dealt with effectively by the States;
(3) when control of subsidiary public-utility companies affects the accounting practices and rate, dividend, and other
policies of such companies so as to complicate and obstruct
State regulation of such companies, or when control of such
companies is exerted through disproportionately small investment;
(4) when the growth and extension of holding companies
bears no relation to economy of management and operation or
the integration and coordination of related operating properties; or
(5) when in any other respect there is lack of economy of
management and operation of public-utility companies or lack
of efficiency and adequacy of service rendered by such companies, or lack of effective public regulation, or lack of economies
in the raising of capital.
(c) When abuses of the character above enumerated become
persistent and wide-spread the holding company becomes an agency which, unless regulated, is injurious to investors, consumers,
and the general public; and it is hereby declared to be the policy
of this title, in accordance with which policy all the provisions of
this title shall be interpreted, to meet the problems and eliminate
the evils as enumerated in this section, connected with public-utility holding companies which are engaged in interstate commerce or
in activities which directly affect or burden interstate commerce;
and for the purpose of effectuating such policy to compel the simplification of public-utility holding-company systems and the elimination therefrom of properties detrimental to the proper functioning of such systems, and to provide as soon as practicable for
the elimination of public-utility holding companies except as otherwise expressly provided in this title.
DEFINITIONS

SEC. 2. ø79b¿ (a) When used in this title, unless the context
otherwise requires—
(1) ‘‘Person’’ means an individual or company.
(2) ‘‘Company’’ means a corporation, a partnership, an
association, a joint-stock company, a business trust, or an orga-

nized group of persons, whether incorporated or not; or any receiver, trustee, or other liquidating agent of any of the foregoing in his capacity as such.
(3) ‘‘Electric utility company’’ means any company which
owns or operates facilities used for the generation, transmission, or distribution of electric energy for sale, other than
sale to tenants or employees of the company operating such
facilities for their own use and not for resale. The Commission,
upon application, shall by order declare a company operating
any such facilities not to be an electric utility company if the
Commission finds that (A) such company is primarily engaged
in one or more businesses other than the business of an electric utility company, and by reason of the small amount of electric energy sold by such company it is not necessary in the
public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers
that such company be considered an electric utility company
for the purposes of this title, or (B) such company is one operating within a single State, and substantially all of its outstanding securities are owned directly or indirectly by another
company to which such operating company sells or furnishes
electric energy which it generates; such other company uses
and does not resell such electric energy, is engaged primarily
in manufacturing (other than the manufacturing of electric energy or gas) and is not controlled by any other company; and
by reason of the small amount of electric energy sold or furnished by such operating company to other persons it is not
necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that it be considered an electric utility company for the purposes of this title. The filing of an application
hereunder in good faith shall exempt such company (and the
owner of the facilities operated by such company) from the application of this paragraph until the Commission has acted
upon such application. As a condition to the entry of any such
order, and as a part thereof, the Commission may require application to be made periodically for a renewal of such order,
and may require the filing of such periodic or special reports
regarding the business of the company as the Commission may
find necessary or appropriate to insure that such company continues to be entitled to such exemption during the period for
which such order is effective. The Commission, upon its own
motion or upon application, shall revoke such order whenever
it finds that the conditions specified in clause (A) or (B) are not
satisfied in the case of such company. Any action of the Commission under the preceding sentence shall be by order. Application under this paragraph may be made by the company in
respect of which the order is to be issued or by the owner of
the facilities operated by such company. Any order issued
under this paragraph shall apply equally to such company and
such owner. The Commission may by rules or regulations conditionally or unconditionally provide that any specified class or
classes of companies which it determines to satisfy the conditions specified in clause (A) or (B), and the owners of the facilities operated by such companies, shall not be deemed electric
utility companies within the meaning of this paragraph.

(4) ‘‘Gas utility company’’ means any company which owns
or operates facilities used for the distribution at retail (other
than distribution only in enclosed portable containers, or distribution to tenants or employees of the company operating
such facilities for their own use and not for resale) of natural
or manufactured gas for heat, light, or power. The Commission,
upon application, shall by order declare a company operating
any such facilities not to be a gas utility company if the Commission finds that (A) such company is primarily engaged in
one or more businesses other than the business of a gas utility
company, and (B) by reason of the small amount of natural or
manufactured gas distributed at retail by such company it is
not necessary in the public interest or for the protection of
investors or consumers that such company be considered a gas
utility company for the purposes of this title. The filing of an
application hereunder in good faith shall exempt such company
(and the owner of the facilities operated by such company)
from the application of this paragraph until the Commission
has acted upon such application. As a condition to the entry of
any such order, and as a part thereof, the Commission may require application to be made periodically for a renewal of such
order, and may require the filing of such periodic or special reports regarding the business of the company as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate to insure that such
company continues to be entitled to such exemption during the
period for which such order is effective. The Commission, upon
its own motion or upon application, shall revoke such order
whenever it finds that the conditions specified in clauses (A)
and (B) are not satisfied in the case of such company. Any action of the Commission under the preceding sentence shall be
by order. Application under this paragraph may be made by
the company in respect of which the order is to be issued or
by the owner of the facilities operated by such company. Any
order issued under this paragraph shall apply equally to such
company and such owner. The Commission may by rules or
regulations conditionally or unconditionally provide that any
specified class or classes of companies which it determines to
satisfy the conditions specified in clauses (A) and (B), and the
owners of the facilities operated by such companies, shall not
be deemed gas utility companies within the meaning of this
paragraph.
(5) ‘‘Public-utility company’’ means an electric utility company or a gas utility company.
(6) ‘‘Commission’’ means the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
(7) ‘‘Holding company’’ means—
(A) any company which directly or indirectly owns,
controls, or holds with power to vote, 10 per centum or
more of the outstanding voting securities of a public-utility
company or of a company which is a holding company by
virtue of this clause or clause (B), unless the Commission,
as hereinafter provided, by order declares such company
not to be a holding company; and

Sec. 2

(B) any person which the Commission determines,
after notice and opportunity for hearing, directly or indirectly to exercise (either alone or pursuant to an arrangement or understanding with one or more other persons)
such a controlling influence over the management or policies of any public-utility or holding company as to make it
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors or consumers that such person be
subject to the obligations, duties, and liabilities imposed in
this title upon holding companies.
The Commission, upon application, shall by order declare that
a company is not a holding company under clause (A) if the
Commission finds that the applicant (i) does not, either alone
or pursuant to an arrangement or understanding with one or
more other persons, directly or indirectly control a public-utility or holding company either through one or more intermediary persons or by any means or device whatsoever, (ii) is
not an intermediary company through which such control is
exercised, and (iii) does not, directly or indirectly, exercise
(either alone or pursuant to an arrangement or understanding
with one or more other persons) such a controlling influence
over the management or policies of any public-utility or holding company as to make it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that
the applicant be subject to the obligations, duties, and liabilities imposed in this title upon holding companies. The filing
of an application hereunder in good faith by a company other
than a registered holding company shall exempt the applicant
from any obligation, duty, or liability imposed in this title upon
the applicant as a holding company, until the Commission has
acted upon such application. Within a reasonable time after
the receipt of any application hereunder, the Commission shall
enter an order granting, or, after notice and opportunity for
hearing, denying or otherwise disposing of, such application.
As a condition to the entry of any order granting such application and as a part of any such order, the Commission may require the applicant to apply periodically for a renewal of such
order and to do or refrain from doing such acts or things, in
respect of exercise of voting rights, control over proxies, designation of officers and directors, existence of interlocking officers, directors and other relationships, and submission of periodic or special reports regarding affiliations or intercorporate
relationships of the applicant, as the Commission may find
necessary or appropriate to ensure that in the case of the applicant the conditions specified in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) are
satisfied during the period for which such order is effective.
The Commission, upon its own motion or upon application of
the company affected, shall revoke the order declaring such
company not to be a holding company whenever in its judgment any condition specified in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) is not satisfied in the case of such company, or modify the terms of such
order whenever in its judgment such modification is necessary
to ensure that in the case of such company the conditions
specified in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) are satisfied during the pe-

clause or clause (B)), unless the Commission, as hereinafter provided, by order declares such company not to be
a subsidiary company of such holding company; and
(B) any person the management or policies of which
the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing,
determines to be subject to a controlling influence, directly
or indirectly, by such holding company (either alone or
pursuant to an arrangement or understanding with one or
more other persons) so as to make it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that such person be subject to the obligations, duties, and liabilities imposed in this title upon
subsidiary companies of holding companies.
The Commission, upon application, shall by order declare that
a company is not a subsidiary company of a specified holding
company under clause (A) if the Commission finds that (i) the
applicant is not controlled, directly or indirectly, by such holding company (either alone or pursuant to an arrangement or
understanding with one or more other persons) either through
one or more intermediary persons or by any means or device
whatsoever, (ii) the applicant is not an intermediary company
through which such control of another company is exercised,
and (iii) the management or policies of the applicant are not
subject to a controlling influence, directly or indirectly, by such
holding company (either alone or pursuant to an arrangement
or understanding with one or more other persons) so as to
make it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors or consumers that the applicant be
subject to the obligations, duties, and liabilities imposed in this
title upon subsidiary companies of holding companies. The filing of an application hereunder in good faith shall exempt the
applicant from any obligation, duty, or liability imposed in this
title upon the applicant as a subsidiary company of such specified holding company until the Commission has acted upon
such application. Within a reasonable time after the receipt of
any application hereunder, the Commission shall enter an
order granting, or, after notice and opportunity for hearing, denying or otherwise disposing of, such application. As a condition to the entry of, and as a part of, any order granting such
application, the Commission may require the applicant to
apply periodically for a renewal of such order and to file such
periodic or special reports regarding the affiliations or intercorporate relationships of the applicant as the Commission may
find necessary or appropriate to enable it to determine whether
in the case of the applicant the conditions specified in clauses

(i), (ii), and (iii) are satisfied during the period for which such
order is effective. The Commission, upon its own motion or
upon application, shall revoke the order declaring such company not to be a subsidiary company whenever in its judgment
any condition specified in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) is not satisfied
in the case of such company, or modify the terms of such order
whenever in its judgment such modification is necessary to ensure that in the case of such company the conditions specified
in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) are satisfied during the period for
which such order is effective. Any action of the Commission
under the preceding sentence shall be by order. Any application under this paragraph may be made by the holding company or the company in respect of which the order is to be entered, but as used in this paragraph the term ‘‘applicant’’

POWER TO MAKE PARTICULAR EXEMPTIONS REGARDING HOLDING
COMPANIES, SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES, AND AFFILIATES

SEC. 3. ø79c¿ (a) 1 The Commission, by rules and regulations
upon its own motion, or by order upon application, shall exempt
any holding company, and every subsidiary company thereof as
such, from any provision or provisions of this title, unless and except insofar as it finds the exemption detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers, if—
(1) such holding company, and every subsidiary company
thereof which is a public-utility company from which such
holding company derives, directly or indirectly, any material
part of its income, are predominantly intrastate in character
and carry on their business substantially in a single State in
which such holding company and every such subsidiary company thereof are organized;
(2) such holding company is predominantly a public-utility
company whose operations as such do not extend beyond the
State in which it is organized and States contiguous thereto;
(3) such holding company is only incidentally a holding
company, being primarily engaged or interested in one or more
businesses other than the business of a public-utility company
and (A) not deriving, directly or indirectly, any material part
of its income from any one or more subsidiary companies, the
principal business of which is that of a public-utility company,
or (B) deriving a material part of its income from any one or
more such subsidiary companies, if substantially all the outstanding securities of such companies are owned, directly or indirectly, by such holding company;
1 Public Law 99–648 (100 Stat. 3632), entitled ‘‘An Act to clarify the exemptive authority of
the Securities and Exchange Commission,’’ provides as follows:
‘‘Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That notwithstanding section 3(a) of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79c(a)), a holding company which has only one subsidiary company that
is solely a gas utility company, as defined in said Act, shall be exempt from all provisions, except section 9(a)(2), of said Act if neither the holding company nor any other subsidiary company
is a public utility company, the operations of such subsidiary gas utility company do not exceed
beyond the State in which it is organized, the subsidiary company was incorporated on June
16, 1986, for the express purpose of operating as a gas utility company, and all of whose voting
securities are owned by the holding company, and neither the holding company, nor any of its
subsidiary companies are engaged in residential or commercial plumbing, heating, refrigeration,
air-conditioning, or in the sale, installation or servicing of such or related equipment.’’

(4) such holding company is temporarily a holding company solely by reason of the acquisition of securities for purposes of liquidation or distribution in connection with a bona
fide debt previously contracted or in connection with a bona
fide arrangement for the underwriting or distribution of securities; or
(5) such holding company is not, and derives no material
part of its income, directly or indirectly, from any one or more
subsidiary companies which are, a company or companies the
principal business of which within the United States is that of
a public-utility company.
(b) The Commission, by rules and regulations upon its own motion, or by order upon application, shall exempt any subsidiary
company, as such, of a holding company from any provision or provisions of this title, the application of which to such subsidiary
company the Commission finds is not necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors, if such subsidiary company
derives no material part of its income, directly or indirectly, from
sources within the United States, and neither it nor any of its subsidiary companies is a public-utility company operating in the
United States.
(c) Within a reasonable time after the receipt of an application
for exemption under subsection (a) or (b), the Commission shall
enter an order granting, or, after notice and opportunity for hearing, denying or otherwise disposing of such application. The filing
of an application in good faith under subsection (a) by a person
other than a registered holding company shall exempt the applicant from any obligation, duty, or liability imposed in this title
upon the applicant as a holding company until the Commission has
acted upon such application. The filing of an application in good
faith under subsection (b) shall exempt the applicant from any obligation, duty, or liability imposed in this title upon the applicant as
a subsidiary company until the Commission has acted upon such
application. Whenever the Commission, on its own motion, or upon
application by the holding company or any subsidiary company
thereof exempted by any order issued under subsection (a), or by
the subsidiary company exempted by any order issued under subsection (b), finds that the circumstances which gave rise to the
issuance of such order no longer exist, the Commission shall by
order revoke such order.
(d) The Commission may, by rules and regulations, conditionally or unconditionally exempt any specified class or classes of
persons from the obligations, duties, or liabilities imposed upon
such persons as subsidiary companies or affiliates under any provision or provisions of this title, and may provide within the extent
of any such exemption that such specified class or classes of persons shall not be deemed subsidiary companies or affiliates within
the meaning of any such provision or provisions, if and to the extent that it deems the exemption necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers and
not contrary to the purposes of this title.

for the protection of investors or consumers.
(c) The Commission by such rules and regulations or order as
it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the

(d) Whenever the Commission, upon application, finds that a
registered holding company has ceased to be a holding company, it
shall so declare by order and upon the taking effect of such order

UNLAWFUL SECURITY TRANSACTIONS BY REGISTERED HOLDING AND
SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES

SEC. 6. ø79f¿ (a) Except in accordance with a declaration effective under section 7 and with the order under such section permitting such declaration to become effective, it shall be unlawful for
any registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof, by
use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise, directly or indirectly (1) to issue or sell any
security of such company; or (2) to exercise any privilege or right
to alter the priorities, preferences, voting power, or other rights of
the holders of an outstanding security of such company.
(b) The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to the issue,
renewal, or guaranty by a registered holding company or subsidiary
company thereof of a note or draft (including the pledge of any
security as collateral therefor) if such note or draft (1) is not part
of a public offering, (2) matures or is renewed for not more than
nine months, exclusive of days of grace, after the date of such
issue, renewal, or guaranty thereof, and (3) aggregates (together
with all other then outstanding notes and drafts of a maturity of
nine months or less, exclusive of days of grace, as to which such
company is primarily or secondarily liable) not more than 5 per
centum of the principal amount and par value of the other securities of such company then outstanding, or such greater per centum
thereof as the Commission upon application may by order authorize as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers. In the case of securities having
no principal amount or no par value, the value for the purposes of
this subsection shall be the fairmarket value as of the date of issue.
The Commission by rules and regulations or order, subject to such
terms and conditions as it deems appropriate in the public interest
or for the protection of investors or consumers, shall exempt from
the provisions of subsection (a) the issue or sale of any security by
any subsidiary company of a registered holding company, if the
issue and sale of such security are solely for the purpose of financ-

ing the business of such subsidiary company and have been expressly authorized by the State commission of the State in which
such subsidiary company is organized and doing business, or if the
issue and sale of such security are solely for the purpose of financing the business of such subsidiary company when such subsidiary
company is not a holding company, a public-utility company, an
investment company, or a fiscal or financing agency of a holding
company, a public-utility company, or an investment company. The
provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to the issue, by a registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof, of a security issued pursuant to the terms of any security outstanding on
January 1, 1935, giving the holder of such outstanding security the
right to convert such outstanding security into another security of
the same issuer or of another person, or giving the right to subscribe to another security of the same issuer or another issuer.
Within ten days after any issue, sale, renewal, or guaranty
exempted from the application of subsection (a) by or under authority of this subsection, such holding company or subsidiary company
thereof shall file with the Commission a certificate of notification
in such form and setting forth such of the information required in
a declaration under section 7 as the Commission may by rules and
regulations or order prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.

instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise, for any registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof, directly or indirectly,—
(1) to sell or offer for sale or to cause to be sold or offered
for sale, from house to house, any security of such holding company; or
(2) to cause any officer or employee of any subsidiary company of such holding company to sell or cause to be sold any
security of such holding company.
As used in this subsection the term ‘‘house’’ shall not include an
office used for business purposes.
DECLARATIONS BY REGISTERED HOLDING AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
IN RESPECT OF SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

SEC. 7. ø79g¿ (a) A registered holding company or subsidiary
company thereof may file a declaration with the Commission, regarding any of the acts enumerated in subsection (a) of section 6,

include—
(1) such of the information and documents which are required to be filed in order to register a security under section
7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the Commission
may by rules and regulations or order prescribe as necessary
or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
investors or consumers; and
(2) such additional information, in such form and detail,
and such documents regarding the declarant or any associate
company thereof, the particular security and compliance with

17

P.U.H.C.A. of 1935

Sec. 7

such State laws as may apply to the act in question as the
Commission may by rules and regulations or order prescribe as
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.
(b) A declaration filed under this section shall become effective
within such reasonable period of time after the filing thereof as the
Commission shall fix by rules and regulations or order, unless the
Commission prior to the expiration of such period shall have issued
an order to the declarant to show cause why such declaration
should become effective. Within a reasonable time after an opportunity for hearing upon an order to show cause under this subsection, unless the declarant shall withdraw its declaration, the
Commission shall enter an order either permitting such declaration
to become effective as filed or amended, or refusing to permit such
declaration to become effective. Amendments to a declaration may
be made upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may
prescribe.
(c) The Commission shall not permit a declaration regarding
the issue or sale of a security to become effective unless it finds
that—
(1) such security is (A) a common stock having a par value
and being without preference as to dividends or distribution
over, and having at least equal voting rights with, any outstanding security of the declarant; (B) a bond (i) secured by a
first lien on physical property of the declarant, or (ii) secured
by an obligation of a subsidiary company of the declarant secured by a first lien on physical property of such subsidiary
company, or (iii) secured by any other assets of the type and
character which the Commission by rules and regulations or
order may prescribe as appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors; (C) a guaranty of, or assumption of
liability on, a security of another company; or (D) a receiver’s
or trustee’s certificate duly authorized by the appropriate court
or courts; or
(2) such security is to be issued or sold solely (A) for the
purpose of refunding, extending, exchanging, or discharging an
outstanding security of the declarant and/or a predecessor company thereof or for the purpose of effecting a merger, consolidation, or other reorganization; (B) for the purpose of financing
the business of the declarant as a public-utility company; (C)
for the purpose of financing the business of the declarant,
when the declarant is neither a holding company nor a publicutility company; and/or (D) for necessary and urgent corporate
purposes of the declarant where the requirements of the provisions of paragraph (1) would impose an unreasonable financial
burden upon the declarant and are not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors
or consumers; or
(3) such security is one the issuance of which was authorized by the company prior to January 1, 1935, and which the
Commission by rules and regulations or order authorizes as
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.

(d) If the requirements of subsections (c) and (g) are satisfied,
the Commission shall permit a declaration regarding the issue or
sale of a security to become effective unless the Commission finds
that—
(1) the security is not reasonably adapted to the security
structure of the declarant and other companies in the same
holding-company system;
(2) the security is not reasonably adapted to the earning
power of the declarant;
(3) financing by the issue and sale of the particular security is not necessary or appropriate to the economical and efficient operation of a business in which the applicant lawfully is
engaged or has an interest;
(4) the fees, commissions, or other remuneration, to whomsoever paid, directly or indirectly, in connection with the issue,
sale, or distribution of the security are not reasonable;
(5) in the case of a security that is a guaranty of, or
assumption of liability on, a security of another company, the
circumstances are such as to constitute the making of such
guaranty or the assumption of such liability an improper risk
for the declarant; or
(6) the terms and conditions of the issue or sale of the
security are detrimental to the public interest or the interest
of investors or consumers.
(e) If the requirements of subsection (g) are satisfied, the Commission shall permit a declaration to become effective regarding the
exercise of a privilege or right to alter the priorities, preferences,
voting power, or other rights of the holders of an outstanding security unless the Commission finds that such exercise of such privilege or right will result in an unfair or inequitable distribution of
voting power among holders of the securities of the declarant or is
otherwise detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers.
(f) Any order permitting a declaration to become effective may
contain such terms and conditions as the Commission finds necessary to assure compliance with the conditions specified in this
section.
(g) If a State commission or State securities commission, having jurisdiction over any of the acts enumerated in subsection (a)
of section 6, shall inform the Commission, upon request by the
Commission for an opinion or otherwise, that State laws applicable
to the act in question have not been complied with, the Commission
shall not permit a declaration regarding the act in question to become effective until and unless the Commission is satisfied that
such compliance has been effected.

SERVING SAME TERRITORY

SEC. 8. ø79h¿ Whenever a State law prohibits, or requires approval or authorization of, the ownership or operation by a single

State commission of such State, which results in its having a
direct or indirect interest in an electric utility company and a
gas utility company serving substantially the same territory; or
(2) if it already has any such interest, to acquire, without
the express approval of the State commission, any direct or indirect interest in an electric utility company or gas utility company serving substantially the same territory as that served by
such companies in which it already has an interest.

INTERESTS

SEC. 9. ø79i¿ (a) Unless the acquisition has been approved by
the Commission under section 10, it shall be unlawful—

public utility or holding company, or will by virtue of such acquisition become such an affiliate.
(b) Subsection (a) shall not apply to—
(1) the acquisition by a public-utility company of utility assets the acquisition of which has been expressly authorized by
a State commission; or
(2) the acquisition by a public-utility company of securities
of a subsidiary public-utility company thereof, provided that
both such public-utility companies and all other public-utility
companies in the same holding-company system are organized
in the same State, that the business of each such company in
such system is substantially confined to such State, and that
the acquisition of such securities has been expressly authorized
by the State commission of such State.
(c) Subsection (a) shall not apply to the acquisition by a registered holding company, or a subsidiary company thereof, of—
(1) securities of, or securities the principal or interest of
which is guaranteed by, the United States, a State, or political
subdivision of a State, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation
which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or
more of the foregoing;

such limitations, as the Commission may by rules and regulations or order prescribe as appropriate in the ordinary course
of business of a registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof and as not detrimental to the public interest or
the interest of investors or consumers.

OTHER INTERESTS

SEC. 10. ø79j¿ (a) A person may apply for approval of the acquisition of securities or utility assets, or of any other interest in

paid therefor, and compliance with such State laws as may
apply in respect of the issue, sale, or acquisition thereof,
(B) the outstanding securities of the company whose
security is to be acquired, the terms, position, rights, and

the interest of investors, or consumers;
(2) in case of the acquisition of securities or utility assets,
the consideration, including all fees, commissions, and other

earning capacity of the utility assets to be acquired or the utility assets underlying the securities to be acquired; or
(3) such acquisition will unduly complicate the capital
structure of the holding-company system of the applicant or
will be detrimental to the public interest or the interest of
investors or consumers or the proper functioning of such holding-company system.

securities of another company upon such a fair offer to purchase
such of the other securities of the company whose security is to be
acquired as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate in
the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b), the Commission shall not approve—

(2) the acquisition of securities or utility assets of a publicutility or holding company unless the Commission finds that
such acquisition will serve the public interest by tending towards the economical and efficient development of an integrated public-utility system. This paragraph shall not apply to
the acquisition of securities or utility assets of a public-utility
company operating exclusively outside the United States.

SIMPLIFICATION OF HOLDING-COMPANY SYSTEMS

SEC. 11. ø79k¿ (a) It shall be the duty of the Commission to
examine the corporate structure of every registered holding company and subsidiary company thereof, the relationships among the
companies in the holding-company system of every such company
and the character of the interests thereof and the properties owned
or controlled thereby to determine the extent to which the corporate structure of such holding-company system and the companies therein may be simplified, unnecessary complexities therein
eliminated, voting power fairly and equitably distributed among
the holders of securities thereof, and the properties and business
thereof confined to those necessary or appropriate to the operations
of an integrated public-utility system.
(b) It shall be the duty of the Commission, as soon as practicable after January 1, 1938:
(1)1 To require by order, after notice and opportunity for
hearing, that each registered holding company, and each sub1 Public Law 99–186 (99 Stat. 1180; 15 U.S.C. 79k note), entitled ‘‘An Act to clarify the application of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 to encourage cogeneration activities

‘‘SECTION 1. Notwithstanding section 11(b)(1) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, a company registered under said Act, or a subsidiary company of such registered company,
may acquire or retain, in any geographic area, an interest in any qualifying cogeneration facilities and qualifying small power production facilities as defined pursuant to the Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, and shall qualify for any exemption relating to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 prescribed pursuant to section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.

integrated public-utility system, and to such other businesses
as are reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations of such integrated public-utility system: Provided, however, That the Commission shall permit a
registered holding company to continue to control one or more
additional integrated public-utility systems, if, after notice and
opportunity for hearing, it finds that—
(A) Each of such additional systems cannot be operated as an independent system without the loss of substantial economies which can be secured by the retention
of control by such holding company of such system;
(B) All of such additional systems are located in one
State, or in adjoining States, or in a contiguous foreign
country; and
(C) The continued combination of such systems under
the control of such holding company is not so large (considering the state of the art and the area or region affected)
as to impair the advantages of localized management, efficient operation, or the effectiveness of regulation.
The Commission may permit as reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations of one or
more integrated public-utility systems the retention of an interest in any business (other than the business of a public-utility company as such) which the Commission shall find necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protecSEC. 2. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.
(a) TREATMENT OF CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS INVOLVING GAS COMPANIES OR GAS TRANSPORTATION OR STORAGE.—The acquisition by a registered company of any interest in any natural
gas company or of any interest in any company organized to participate in activities involving
the transportation or storage of natural gas, shall be deemed, for the purposes of section 11(b)(1)
of the Act, to be reasonably incidental or economically necessary or appropriate to the operation
of such gas utility companies.
(b) TREATMENT OF ACQUISITIONS RELATED TO SUPPLY OF NATURAL GAS; COMMISSION DETERMINATION OF CUSTOMER INTEREST.—The acquisition by a registered company of any interest in
any company organized to participate in activities (other than those of a natural gas company
or involving the transportation or storage of natural gas) related to the supply of natural gas,
including exploration, development, production, marketing, manufacture, or other similar activities related to the supply of natural or manufactured gas, shall be deemed, for purposes of section 11(b)(1) of the Act, to be reasonably incidental or economically necessary or appropriate to
the operation of such gas utility companies, if—
(1) the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing in which the
company proposing the acquisition shall have the burden of proving, that such acquisition
is in the interest of consumers of each gas utility company of such registered company or
consumers of any other subsidiary of such registered company; and
(2) the Commission determines that such acquisition will not be detrimental to the interest of consumers of any such gas utility company or other subsidiary or to the proper functioning of the registered holding company system.
(c) CASE-BY-CASE DECISIONS REQUIRED.—Each such determination under this section shall be
made on a case-by-case basis, and not be based on any preset criteria.

other provisions of the Act to the acquisition or retention of any such interest by any such company.
(e) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this section—
(1) the term ‘‘registered company’’ means a company registered under the Act solely by
reason of direct or indirect ownership of voting securities of one or more gas utility companies, or any subsidiary company of such registered company;
(2) the term ‘‘natural gas company’’ has the meaning given such term under the Natural
Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717(a) et seq.); and

proper functioning of such system or systems.
(2) To require by order, after notice and opportunity for
hearing, that each registered holding company, and each subsidiary company thereof, shall take such steps as the Commission shall find necessary to ensure that the corporate structure
or continued existence of any company in the holding-company
system does not unduly or unnecessarily complicate the structure, or unfairly or inequitably distribute voting power among
security holders, of such holding-company system. In carrying
out the provisions of this paragraph the Commission shall require each registered holding company (and any company in
the same holding-company system with such holding company)
to take such action as the Commission shall find necessary in
order that such holding company shall cease to be a holding
company with respect to each of its subsidiary companies
which itself has a subsidiary company which is a holding company. Except for the purpose of fairly and equitably distributing voting power among the security holders of such company, nothing in this paragraph shall authorize the Commission to require any change in the corporate structure or existence of any company which is not a holding company, or of any
company whose principal business is that of a public-utility
company.
The Commission may by order revoke or modify any order previously made under this subsection, if, after notice and opportunity
for hearing, it finds that the conditions upon which the order was
predicated do not exist. Any order made under this subsection shall
be subject to judicial review as provided in section 24.
(c) Any order under subsection (b) shall be complied with
within one year from the date of such order; but the Commission
shall, upon a showing (made before or after the entry of such order)
that the applicant has been or will be unable in the exercise of due
diligence to comply with such order within such time, extend such
time for an additional period not exceeding one year if it finds such
extension necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors or consumers.
(d) The Commission may apply to a court, in accordance with
the provisions of subsection (f) of section 18, to enforce compliance
with any order issued under subsection (b). In any such proceeding,
the court as a court of equity may, to such extent as it deems necessary for purposes of enforcement of such order, take exclusive
jurisdiction and possession of the company or companies and the
assets thereof, wherever located; and the court shall have jurisdiction, in any such proceeding, to appoint a trustee, and the court
may constitute and appoint the Commission as sole trustee, to hold
or administer under the direction of the court the assets so possessed. In any proceeding for the enforcement of an order of the
Commission issued under subsection (b), the trustee with the approval of the court shall have power to dispose of any or all of such
assets and, subject to such terms and conditions as the court may
prescribe, may make such disposition in accordance with a fair and
equitable reorganization plan which shall have been approved by
the Commission after opportunity for hearing. Such reorganization

plan may be proposed in the first instance by the Commission, or,
subject to such rules and regulations as the Commission may deem
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection
of investors, by any person having a bona fide interest (as defined
by the rules and regulations of the Commission) in the reorganization.
(e) In accordance with such rules and regulations or order as
the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors or consumers, any registered holding company or any subsidiary company of a registered
holding company may, at any time after January 1, 1936, submit
a plan to the Commission for the divestment of control, securities,
or other assets, or for other action by such company or any subsidiary company thereof for the purpose of enabling such company
or any subsidiary company thereof to comply with the provisions of
subsection (b). If, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the
Commission shall find such plan, as submitted or as modified, necessary to effectuate the provisions of subsection (b) and fair and
equitable to the persons affected by such plan, the Commission
shall make an order approving such plan; and the Commission, at
the request of the company, may apply to a court, in accordance
with the provisions of subsection (f) of section 18, to enforce and
carry out the terms and provisions of such plan. If, upon any such
application, the court, after notice and opportunity for hearing,
shall approve such plan as fair and equitable and as appropriate
to effectuate the provisions of section 11, the court as a court of equity may, to such extent as it deems necessary for the purpose of
carrying out the terms and provisions of such plan, take exclusive
jurisdiction and possession of the company or companies and the
assets thereof, wherever located; and the court shall have jurisdiction to appoint a trustee, and the court may constitute and appoint
the Commission as sole trustee, to hold or administer, under the
direction of the court and in accordance with the plan theretofore
approved by the court and the Commission, the assets so possessed.
(f) In any proceeding in a court of the United States, whether
under this section or otherwise, in which a receiver or trustee is
appointed for any registered holding company, or any subsidiary
company thereof, the court may constitute and appoint the Commission as sole trustee or receiver, subject to the directions and orders of the court, whether or not a trustee or receiver shall theretofore have been appointed, and in any such proceeding the court
shall not appoint any person other than the Commission trustee or
receiver without notifying the Commission and giving it an opportunity to be heard before making any such appointment. In no proceeding under this section or otherwise shall the Commission be
appointed as trustee or receiver without its express consent. In any
such proceeding a reorganization plan for a registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof shall not become effective
unless such plan shall have been approved by the Commission
after opportunity for hearing prior to its submission to the court.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such reorganization plan may be proposed in the first instance by the Commission
or, subject to such rules and regulations as the Commission may
deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the pro-

defined by the rules and regulations of the Commission) in the reorganization. The Commission may, by such rules and regulations
or order as it may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers, require that
any or all fees, expenses, and remuneration, to whomsoever paid,
in connection with any reorganization, dissolution, liquidation,
bankruptcy, or receivership of a registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof, in any such proceeding, shall be subject
to approval by the Commission.
(g) It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit or permit the
use of his or its name to solicit, by use of the mails or any means
or instrumentality of interestate commerce, or otherwise, any
proxy, consent, authorization, power of attorney, deposit, or dissent
in respect of any reorganization plan of a registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof under this section, or otherwise, or in respect of any plan under this section for the divestment of control, securities, or other assets, or for the dissolution of
any registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof,

plan and such information regarding it and its sponsors as the
Commission may deem necessary or appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors or consumers has
been submitted to the Commission by a person having a bona
fide interest (as defined by the rules and regulations of the
Commission) in such reorganization;
(2) each such solicitation is accompanied or preceded by a
copy of a report on the plan which shall be made by the Commission after an opportunity for a hearing on the plan and
other plans submitted to it, or by an abstract of such report
made or approved by the Commission; and
(3) each such solicitation is made not in contravention of
such rules and regulations or orders as the Commission may
deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors or consumers.
Nothing in this subsection or the rules and regulations thereunder
shall prevent any person from appearing before the Commission or
any court through an attorney or proxy.

SERVICE, SALES, AND CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS

SEC. 13. ø79m¿ (a) After April 1, 1936, it shall be unlawful for
any registered holding company, by use of the mails or any means
or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise, to enter
into or take any step in the performance of any service, sales, or
construction contract by which such company undertakes to perform services or construction work for, or sell goods to, any associate company thereof which is a public-utility or mutual service
company. This provision shall not apply to such transactions, involving special or unusual circumstances or not in the ordinary
course of business, as the Commission by rules and regulations or
order may conditionally or unconditionally exempt as being necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
investors or consumers.
(b) After April 1, 1936, it shall be unlawful for any subsidiary
company of any registered holding company or for any mutual service company, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality
of interstate commerce, or otherwise, to enter into or take any step
in the performance of any service, sales, or construction contract by
which such company undertakes to perform services or construction
work for, or sell goods to, any associate company thereof except in
accordance with such terms and conditions and subject to such limitations and prohibitions as the Commission by rules and regulations or order shall prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers and
to insure that such contracts are performed economically and efficiently for the benefit of such associate companies at cost, fairly
and equitably allocated among such companies. This provision shall
not apply to such transactions as the Commission by rules and regulations or order may conditionally or unconditionally exempt as
being necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers, if such transactions (1) are with
any associate company which does not derive, directly or indirectly,
any material part of its income from sources within the United
States and which is not a public-utility company operating within
the United States, or (2) involve special or unusual circumstances
or are not in the ordinary course of business.
(c) The rules and regulations and orders of the Commission
under this section may prescribe, among other things, such terms
and conditions regarding the determination of costs and the allocation thereof among specified classes of companies and for specified
classes of service, sales, and construction contracts, the duration of
such contracts, the making and keeping of accounts and cost-accounting procedures, the filing of annual and other periodic and
special reports, the maintenance of competitive conditions, the disclosure of interests, and similar matters, as the Commission deems
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection
of investors or consumers.
(d) The rules and regulations and orders of the Commission
under this section shall prescribe, among other things, such terms
and conditions regarding the manner in which application may be
made for approval as a mutual service company and the granting
and continuance of such approval, the nature and enforcement of

Sec. 13

P.U.H.C.A. of 1935

30

agreements for the sharing of expenses and distributing of revenues among member companies, and matters relating to such
agreements, the nature and types of businesses and transactions in
which mutual service companies may engage, and the manner of
engaging therein, and the relations and transactions with member
companies and affiliates, as the Commission deems necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors
or consumers. The Commission shall not approve, or continue the
approval of, any company as a mutual service company unless the
Commission finds such company is so organized as to ownership,
costs, revenues, and the sharing thereof as reasonably to insure the
efficient and economical performance of service, sales, or construction contracts by such company for member companies, at cost
fairly and equitably allocated among such member companies, at a
reasonable saving to member companies over the cost to such companies of comparable contracts performed by independent persons.
The Commission, upon its own motion or at the request of a member company or a State commission, may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, by order require a reallocation or reapportionment of costs among member companies of a mutual service company if it finds the existing allocation inequitable and may require
the elimination of a service or services to a member company which
does not bear its fair proportion of costs or which, by reason of its
size or other circumstances, does not require such service or services. The Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, by
order shall revoke, suspend, or modify the approval given any mutual service company if it finds that such company has persistently
violated any provision of this section or any rule, regulation, or
order thereunder.
(e) It shall be unlawful for any affiliate of any public-utility
company engaged in interstate commerce, or of any registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof, by use of the mails or
any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise,
to enter into or take any step in the performance of any service,
sales, or construction contract, by which such affiliate undertakes
to perform services or construction work for, or sell goods to, any
such company of which it is an affiliate, in contravention of such
rules and regulations or orders regarding reports, accounts, costs,
maintenance of competitive conditions, disclosure of interest, duration of contracts, and similar matters, as the Commission deems
necessary or appropriate to prevent the circumvention of the provisions of this title or the rules, regulations, or orders thereunder.
(f) It shall be unlawful for any person whose principal business
is the performance of service, sales, or construction contracts for
public-utility or holding companies, by use of the mails or any
means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, to enter into or
take any step in the performance of any service, sales, or construction contract with any public-utility company, or for any such person, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or otherwise, to enter into or take any step in the
performance of any service, sales, or construction contract with any
public-utility company engaged in interstate commerce, or with any
registered holding company or any subsidiary company of a registered holding company, in contravention of such rules and regula-

tions or orders regarding reports, accounts, costs, maintenance of
competitive conditions, disclosure of interest, duration of contracts,
and similar matters as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or
consumers or to prevent the circumvention of the provisions of this
title or the rules, regulations, or orders thereunder.
(g) The Commission, in order to obtain information to serve as
a basis for recommending further legislation, shall from time to
time conduct investigations regarding the making, performance,
and costs of service, sales, and construction contracts with holding
companies and subsidiary companies thereof and with public-utility
companies, the economies resulting therefrom, and the desirability
thereof. The Commission shall report to Congress, from time to
time, the results of such investigations, together with such recommendations for legislation as it deems advisable. On the basis
of such investigations the Commission shall classify the different
types of such contracts and the work done thereunder, and shall
make recommendations from time to time regarding the standards
and scope of such contracts in relation to public-utility companies
of different kinds and sizes and the costs incurred thereunder and
economies resulting therefrom. Such recommendations shall be
made available to State commissions, public-utility companies, and
to the public in such form and at such reasonable charge as the
Commission may prescribe.

regulations or order prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers. Such
reports, if required by the rules and regulations of the Commission,
shall be certified by an independent public accountant, and shall be
made and filed at such time and in such form and detail as the
Commission shall prescribe. The Commission may require that
there be included in reports filed with it such information and documents as it finds necessary or appropriate to keep reasonably current the information filed under section 5 or 13, and such further
information concerning the financial condition, security structure,

so as properly to show the cost of any asset or any other cost.

suit for damages under the provisions of this title shall recover,
through satisfaction of judgment in one or more actions, a total
amount in excess of his actual damages on account of the act complained of.
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND OTHER AFFILIATES

SEC. 17. ø79q¿ (a) Every person who is an officer or director
of a registered holding company shall file with the Commission in
such form as the Commission shall prescribe (1) at the time of the

person becomes an officer or director, a statement of the securities
of such registered holding company or any subsidiary company
thereof of which he is, directly or indirectly, the beneficial owner,
and (2) within ten days after the close of each calendar month
thereafter, if there has been any change in such ownership during
such month, a statement of such ownership as of the close of such
calendar month and of the changes in such ownership that have occurred during such calendar month.
(b) For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information
which may have been obtained by any such officer or director by

to recover such profit may be instituted at law or in equity in any

by the owner of any security of such company in the name and in
the behalf of such company if such company shall fail or refuse to
bring such suit within sixty days after request or shall fail diligently to prosecute the same thereafter; but no such suit shall be
brought more than two years after the date such profit was realized. This subsection shall not cover any transaction where such

transaction or transactions which the Commission by rules and
regulations may, as necessary or appropriate in the public interest
or for the protection of investors or consumers, exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this subsection. Nothing in this

company, investment banker, or banking association or firm, or any

any corporation a majority of whose stock, having the unrestricted
right to vote for the election of directors, is owned by any bank,
trust company, investment banker, or banking association or firm,

Commission may permit as not adversely affecting the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers.

rule or regulation thereunder, or to aid in the enforcement of the
provisions of this title, in the prescribing of rules and regulations

a State commission may investigate, or obtain any information regarding the business, financial condition, or practices of any registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof or facts,
conditions, practices, or matters affecting the relations between any
such company and any other company or companies in the same
holding-company system.
(c) For the purpose of any investigation or any other proceeding under this title, any member of the Commission, or any officer thereof designated by it, is empowered to administer oaths
and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance,

which the Commission deems relevant or material to the inquiry.
Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such
records may be required from any place in any State or in any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States
at any designated place of hearing.
(d) In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena
issued to, any person, the Commission may invoke the aid of any
court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such
investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements, and other records. And
such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Commission or member or officer designated by the Commission, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question; and
any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by

such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may
be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found. Any person who, without just
cause, shall fail or refuse to attend and testify or to answer any
lawful inquiry or to produce books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements, or other records, if in his or its power
so to do, in obedience to the subpoena of the Commission, shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be subject to
a fine of not more than $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term of
not more than one year, or both.
(e) Whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person is engaged or about to engage in any acts or practices which
constitute or will constitute a violation of the provisions of this
title, or of any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, it may in its
discretion bring an action in the proper district court of the United
States or the United States courts of any Territory or other place
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to enjoin such acts
or practices and to enforce compliance with this title or any rule,
regulation, or order thereunder, and upon a proper showing a permanent or temporary injunction or degree or restraining order
shall be granted without bond. The Commission may transmit such
evidence as may be available concerning such acts or practices to
the Attorney General, who, in his discretion, may institute the
appropriate criminal proceedings under this title.
(f) Upon application of the Commission, the district courts of
the United States, and the United States courts of any Territory
or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States shall
have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus commanding any person to comply with the provisions of this title or any rule, regulation, or order of the Commission thereunder.

State. But this provision shall not prevent the Commission from
imposing such additional requirements regarding reports or accounts as it may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.

INFORMATION FILED WITH THE COMMISSION

SEC. 22. ø79v¿ (a) When in the judgment of the Commission
the disclosure of such information would be in the public interest
or the interest of investors or consumers, the information contained

business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia, by filing in such court, within sixty days after the
entry of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the

Commission shall file in the court the record upon which the order
complained of was entered, as provided in section 2112 of title 28,
United States Code. Upon the filing of such petition such court
shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall be
exclusive, to affirm, modify, or set aside such order, in whole or in
part. No objection to the order of the Commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Commission or unless there were reasonable grounds for
failure so to do. The findings of the Commissions as to the facts,
if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. If application is made to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence,
and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that such additional
evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for
failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the Commission, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken
before the Commission and to be adduced upon the hearing in such
manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may
seem proper. The Commission may modify its findings as to the
facts by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file
with the court such modified or new findings, which, if supported
by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, and its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original
order. The judgment and decree of the court affirming, modifying,

United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section
1254 of title 28, United States Code.

determine the sizes, types, and locations of public-utility companies
which do or can operate most economically and efficiently in the
public interest, in the interest of investors and consumers, and in
furtherance of a wider and more economical use of gas and electric
energy; upon the basis of such investigations and studies the Commission shall make public from time to time its recommendations
as to the type and size of geographically and economically integrated public-utility systems which, having regard for the nature

SEC. 32. ø79z–5a¿ EXEMPT WHOLESALE GENERATORS.
(a) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this section—
(1) EXEMPT WHOLESALE GENERATOR.—The

term ‘‘exempt
wholesale generator’’ means any person determined by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be engaged directly,
or indirectly through one or more affiliates as defined in section 2(a)(11)(B), and exclusively in the business of owning or
operating, or both owning and operating, all or part of one or
more eligible facilities and selling electric energy at wholesale.
No person shall be deemed to be an exempt wholesale generator under this section unless such person has applied to the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a determination
under this paragraph. A person applying in good faith for such
a determination shall be deemed an exempt wholesale generator under this section, with all of the exemptions provided by
this section, until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
makes such determination. The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission shall make such determination within 60 days of
its receipt of such application and shall notify the Commission
whenever a determination is made under this paragraph that
any person is an exempt wholesale generator. Not later than
12 months after the date of enactment of this section, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall promulgate rules implementing the provisions of this paragraph. Applications for
determination filed after the effective date of such rules shall
be subject thereto.
(2) ELIGIBLE FACILITY.—The term ‘‘eligible facility’’ means
a facility, wherever located, which is either—
(A) used for the generation of electric energy exclusively for sale at wholesale, or
(B) used for the generation of electric energy and
leased to one or more public utility companies; Provided,
That any such lease shall be treated as a sale of electric
energy at wholesale for purposes of sections 205 and 206
of the Federal Power Act.
Such term shall not include any facility for which consent is
required under subsection (c) if such consent has not been obtained. Such term includes interconnecting transmission facilities necessary to effect a sale of electric energy at wholesale.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘‘facility’’ may include
a portion of a facility subject to the limitations of subsection
(d) and shall include a facility the construction of which has
not been commenced or completed.
(3) SALE OF ELECTRIC ENERGY AT WHOLESALE.—The term
‘‘sale of electric energy at wholesale’’ shall have the same
meaning as provided in section 201(d) of the Federal Power Act
(16 U.S.C. 824(d)).
(4) RETAIL RATES AND CHARGES.—The term ‘‘retail rates
and charges’’ means rates and charges for the sale of electric
energy directly to consumers.

43

P.U.H.C.A. of 1935

Sec. 32

(b) FOREIGN RETAIL SALES.—Notwithstanding paragraphs (1)
and (2) of subsection (a), retail sales of electric energy produced by
a facility located in a foreign country shall not prevent such facility
from being an eligible facility, or prevent a person owning or operating, or both owning and operating, such facility from being an
exempt wholesale generator if none of the electric energy generated
by such facility is sold to consumers in the United States.
(c) STATE CONSENT FOR EXISTING RATE-BASED FACILITIES.—If
a rate or charge for, or in connection with, the construction of a facility, or for electric energy produced by a facility (other than any
portion of a rate or charge which represents recovery of the cost of
a wholesale rate or charge) was in effect under the laws of any
State as of the date of enactment of this section, in order for the
facility to be considered an eligible facility, every State commission
having jurisdiction over any such rate or charge must make a specific determination that allowing such facility to be an eligible facility (1) will benefit consumers, (2) is in the public interest, and (3)
does not violate State law; Provided, That in the case of such a rate
or charge which is a rate or charge of an affiliate of a registered
holding company:
(A) such determination with respect to the facility in question shall be required from every State commission having
jurisdiction over the retail rates and charges of the affiliates of
such registered holding company; and
(B) the approval of the Commission under this Act shall
not be required for the transfer of the facility to an exempt
wholesale generator.
(d) HYBRIDS.—(1) No exempt wholesale generator may own or
operate a portion of any facility if any other portion of the facility
is owned or operated by an electric utility company that is an affiliate or associate company of such exempt wholesale generator.
(2) ELIGIBLE FACILITY.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an
exempt wholesale generator may own or operate a portion of a facility identified in paragraph (1) if such portion has become an eligible facility as a result of the operation of subsection (c).
(e) EXEMPTION OF EWGS.—An exempt wholesale generator
shall not be considered an electric utility company under section
2(a)(3) of this Act and, whether or not a subsidiary company, an
affiliate, or an associate company of a holding company, an exempt
wholesale generator shall be exempt from all provisions of this Act.
(f) OWNERSHIP OF EWGS BY EXEMPT HOLDING COMPANIES.—
Notwithstanding any provision of this Act, a holding company that
is exempt under section 3 of this Act shall be permitted, without
condition or limitation under this Act, to acquire and maintain an
interest in the business of one or more exempt wholesale generators.
(g) OWNERSHIP OF EWGS BY REGISTERED HOLDING COMPANIES.—Notwithstanding any provision of this Act and the Commission’s jurisdiction as provided under subsection (h) of this section,
a registered holding company shall be permitted (without the need
to apply for, or receive, approval from the Commission, and otherwise without condition under this Act) to acquire and hold the
securities, or an interest in the business, of one or more exempt
wholesale generators.

(h) FINANCING AND OTHER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EWGS
REGISTERED HOLDING COMPANIES.—The issuance of securities
by a registered holding company for purposes of financing the acquisition of an exempt wholesale generator, the guarantee of securities of an exempt wholesale generator by a registered holding
company, the entering into service, sales or construction contracts,
and the creation or maintenance of any other relationship in addition to that described in subsection (g) between an exempt wholesale generator and a registered holding company, its affiliates and
associate companies, shall remain subject to the jurisdiction of the
Commission under this Act: Provided, That—
(1) section 11 of this Act shall not prohibit the ownership
of an interest in the business of one or more exempt wholesale
generators by a registered holding company (regardless of
where facilities owned or operated by such exempt wholesale
generators are located), and such ownership by a registered
holding company shall be deemed consistent with the operation
of an integrated public utility system;
(2) the ownership of an interest in the business of one or
more exempt wholesale generators by a registered holding company (regardless of where facilities owned or operated by such
exempt wholesale generators are located) shall be considered
as reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate, to the operations of an integrated public utility system;
(3) in determining whether to approve (A) the issue or sale
of a security by a registered holding company for purposes of
financing the acquisition of an exempt wholesale generator, or
(B) the guarantee of a security of an exempt wholesale generator by a registered holding company, the Commission shall
not make a finding that such security is not reasonably
adapted to the earning power of such company or to the security structure of such company and other companies in the
same holding company system, or that the circumstances are
such as to constitute the making of such guarantee an improper risk for such company, unless the Commission first
finds that the issue or sale of such security, or the making of
the guarantee, would have a substantial adverse impact on the
financial integrity of the registered holding company system;
(4) in determining whether to approve (A) the issue or sale
of a security by a registered holding company for purposes
other than the acquisition of an exempt wholesale generator,
or (B) other transactions by such registered holding company
or by its subsidiaries other than with respect to exempt wholesale generators, the Commission shall not consider the effect of
the capitalization or earnings of any subsidiary which is an
exempt wholesale generator upon the registered holding company system, unless the approval of the issue or sale or other
transaction, together with the effect of such capitalization and
earnings, would have a substantial adverse impact on the
financial integrity of the registered holding company system;
(5) the Commission shall make its decision under paragraph (3) to approve or disapprove the issue or sale of a security or the guarantee of a security within 120 days of the filing
of a declaration concerning such issue, sale or guarantee; and

AND

45

P.U.H.C.A. of 1935

Sec. 32

(6) the Commission shall promulgate regulations with respect to the actions which would be considered, for purposes of
this subsection, to have a substantial adverse impact on the
financial integrity of the registered holding company system;
such regulations shall ensure that the action has no adverse
impact on any utility subsidiary or its customers, or on the
ability of State commissions to protect such subsidiary or customers, and shall take into account the amount and type of
capital invested in exempt wholesale generators, the ratio of
such capital to the total capital invested in utility operations,
the availability of books and records, and the financial and
operating experience of the registered holding company and the
exempt wholesale generator; the Commission shall promulgate
such regulations within 6 months after the enactment of this
section; after such 6-month period the Commission shall not
approve any actions under paragraph (3), (4) or (5) except in
accordance with such issued regulations.
(i) APPLICATION OF ACT TO OTHER ELIGIBLE FACILITIES.—In
the case of any person engaged directly and exclusively in the business of owning or operating (or both owning and operating) all or
part of one or more eligible facilities, an advisory letter issued by
the Commission staff under this Act after the date of enactment of
this section, or an order issued by the Commission under this Act
after the date of enactment of this section, shall not be required for
the purpose, or have the effect, of exempting such person from
treatment as an electric utility company under section 2(a)(3) or exempting such person from any provision of this Act.
(j) OWNERSHIP OF EXEMPT WHOLESALE GENERATORS AND
QUALIFYING FACILITIES.—The ownership by a person of one or more
exempt wholesale generators shall not result in such person being
considered as being primarily engaged in the generation or sale of
electric power within the meaning of sections 3(17)(C)(ii) and
3(18)(B)(ii) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796(17)(C)(ii) and
796(18)(B)(ii)).
(k) PROTECTION AGAINST ABUSIVE AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS.—
(1) PROHIBITION.—After the date of enactment of this section, an electric utility company may not enter into a contract
to purchase electric energy at wholesale from an exempt wholesale generator if the exempt wholesale generator is an affiliate
or associate company of the electric utility company.
(2) STATE AUTHORITY TO EXEMPT FROM PROHIBITION.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an electric utility company may
enter into a contract to purchase electric energy at wholesale
from an exempt wholesale generator that is an affiliate or associate company of the electric utility company—
(A) if every State commission having jurisdiction over
the retail rates of such electric utility company makes each
of the following specific determinations in advance of the
electric utility company entering into such contract:
(i) A determination that such commission has sufficient regulatory authority, resources and access to
books and records of the electric utility company and
any relevant associate, affiliate or subsidiary company
to exercise its duties under this subparagraph.

Sec. 33

P.U.H.C.A. of 1935

46

(ii) A determination that the transaction—
(I) will benefit consumers,
(II) does not violate any State law (including
where applicable, least cost planning),
(III) would not provide the exempt wholesale
generator any unfair competitive advantage by
virtue of its affiliation or association with the electric utility company, and
(IV) is in the public interest; or
(B) if such electric utility company is not subject to
State commission retail rate regulation and the purchased
electric energy:
(i) would not be resold to any affiliate or associate
company, or
(ii) the purchased electric energy would be resold
to an affiliate or associate company and every State
commission having jurisdiction over the retail rates of
such affiliate or associate company makes each of the
determinations provided under subparagraph (A), including the determination concerning a State commission’s duties.
(l) RECIPROCAL ARRANGEMENTS PROHIBITED.—Reciprocal
arrangements among companies that are not affiliates or associate
companies of each other that are entered into in order to avoid the
provisions of this section are prohibited.

company may be a subsidiary company, an affiliate, or an associate company of a holding company or of a public utility company.
(2) STATE COMMISSION CERTIFICATION.—Section (a)(1) shall
not apply or be effective unless every State commission having
jurisdiction over the retail electric or gas rates of a public utility company that is an associate company or an affiliate of a
company otherwise exempted under section (a)(1) (other than
a public utility company that is an associate company or an
affiliate of a registered holding company) has certified to the
Commission that it has the authority and resources to protect
ratepayers subject to its jurisdiction and that it intends to
exercise its authority. Such certification, upon the filing of a
notice by such State commission, may be revised or withdrawn
by the State commission prospectively as to any future acquisition. The requirement of State certification shall be deemed
satisfied if the relevant State commission had, prior to the date
of enactment of this section, on the basis of prescribed conditions of general applicability, determined that ratepayers of a
public utility company are adequately insulated from the effects of diversification and the diversification would not impair
