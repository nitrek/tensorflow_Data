File No. 3-17199
Commission Imposes Industry Bar on Investment Adviser for Running a Ponzi Scheme
April 5, 2016 – The Securities and Exchange Commission today imposed an industry bar on
Daniel Rivera, a New York resident and former investment adviser, for running a six-year Ponzi
scheme.
The SEC imposed the bar based on a final judgment, entered on March 28, 2016, against Rivera
that permanently enjoined him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In the SEC’s
complaint against Rivera and his brother, the SEC alleged that the two engaged in a fraudulent
Ponzi scheme, where Rivera falsely promised investors they would share in the profits of a real
estate venture that bought, redeveloped, and sold properties. In fact, the real estate venture was a
sham, and Rivera and his brother misappropriated investor funds for their personal benefit.
Rivera submitted an offer of settlement in which he consented, without admitting or denying the
SEC’s findings, to the issuance of an order pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, which deemed it appropriate and in the public interest to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Rivera’s offer, namely that he be barred from association with any investment
adviser, broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or
nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Ian Dattner, Gosia Spangenberg, and Donato
Furlano, under the supervision of Lisa Deitch, and assisted by Trial Attorney Alfred Day.
The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
