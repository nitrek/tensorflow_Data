ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17304

In the Matter of
ORDER OF FORTHWITH SUSPENSION
PURSUANT TO RULE 102(e)(2) OF THE
COMMISSION’S RULES OF PRACTICE

GREGORY G. JONES,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate to issue
an order of forthwith suspension of Gregory G. Jones pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice (17 C.F.R. § 200.102(e)(2)).1
II.
The Commission finds that:
1.
Gregory G. Jones, 59, at all relevant times was an attorney whose office was
located in Southlake, Texas. In Securities and Exchange Commission v. Gregory G. Jones, Civil
Action No. 4-15-CV-438-A (N.D. Tex.), the district court found that Jones violated Sections
5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The district
court also permanently enjoined Jones from violating those provisions. The district court did not
find that Jones’ conduct in committing these violations was not willful.

1 Rule 102(e)(2) provides, in pertinent part, that “[a]ny attorney who has been suspended or disbarred by a court of
the United States or any State . . . shall be forthwith suspended from appearing or practicing before the
Commission.”

2.
Separately, the Office of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel for the Commission for
Lawyer Discipline of the State Bar of Texas agreed that Jones could give up his bar license in
lieu of punishment for his dealings with two former clients, which included failing to return their
fees.
3.
On September 8, 2015, the Supreme Court of Texas issued an Order, Misc.
Docket No. 15-9180, accepting Jones’s Motion for Acceptance of Resignation as Attorney and
Counselor at Law in Lieu of Disciplinary Action, and prohibited Jones from practicing law in the
state of Texas.
III.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that Jones has been disbarred from the
practice of law by the Supreme Court of Texas, within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED, that Gregory G. Jones is forthwith suspended from
appearing or practicing before the Commission pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s
Rules of Practice.

By the Commission.

Secretary
