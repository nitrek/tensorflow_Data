COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) files this Complaint
against Charles Couch (“Couch”) and Couch Oil & Gas, Inc. (“COG”) (collectively,
“Defendants”), respectfully alleging the following:
I.
SUMMARY
1.

From at least September 2010 through January 2012, Couch, directly and through

his company COG, carried on a fraudulent scheme and made materially false and misleading
statements and omissions to potential and actual investors in order to make unregistered offers
and sales of securities in two of Defendants’ oil and gas investment programs: the Permian-Black
Shale-Fifty Nine Well Program (the “59 Well Program”) and the Radial Nine Well Program (the
“Radial Nine Program”) (collectively, “Programs”).
2.

Through these fraudulent offerings, Defendants raised approximately

$9,800,000 million from more than 200 investors located in at least 21 states. In offering
documents, private placement memoranda, and other communications with investors,
Defendants, among other things:

Case 3:14-cv-01747-D Document 1 Filed 05/12/14



Page 2 of 16 PageID 2

falsely represented that investors would receive working interests in oil and gas wells
through their participation in the Programs;



falsely represented that all investor funds would be used to drill and complete wells in
the Programs;



failed to tell investors that approximately 30% of their funds would be paid as sales
commissions;



failed to tell investors that COG was using unregistered brokers to sell interests;



made unsubstantiated and highly inflated projections concerning potential oil and gas
production from wells in the Programs;



falsely represented that COG was experienced and successful in using radial jet
drilling technology;



misled investors regarding a decision to wind down the Radial Nine Program early;
and



failed to amend offering materials for the Radial Nine Program to reflect the impact
the early closure of the offering would have on COG’s ability to raise the full offering
amount and the resulting adjustments to the program’s projections and expected
performance.

3.

In light of this conduct, alleged in further detail below, the Commission requests a

judgment against Defendants permanently enjoining them from violating the registration and
antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), permanently enjoining them from directly or
indirectly soliciting or accepting funds from any person or entity for any unregistered offering of
securities; and ordering them to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil penalties.

II.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
4.

Defendants offered and purported to sell units of fractional undivided working

interests in the Programs’ wells, which investments constitute securities, and/or did offer and sell
investment contracts, under Section 2(1) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1)] and
Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(10)].
5.

Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b) and 77v(a)] and Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa] because Defendants directly or indirectly made use of the means or
instrumentalities of commerce and/or the mails in connection with the transactions described
herein. Venue is proper under Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and
Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa], because certain of Defendants’ acts,

PARTIES
7.

Charles O. Couch, age 64, resides in Irving, Texas. Couch is COG’s owner,

principal, and control person and serves as a director and as President and Chief Executive
Officer of the company. Couch, as well as COG, solicited investments in the 59 Well Program
and the Radial Nine Program. Couch, as well as COG, served as the operator of oil and gas

wells identified in the Programs’ offering materials. None of the offerings was registered with
the Commission or any state. In March 2005, the State of Wisconsin’s Department of Financial
Institutions, Division of Securities, issued an order prohibiting Couch, along with COG, from
offering and selling unregistered securities in that state in an action styled In the Matter of Couch
Oil & Gas and Charles Couch, File No. S-04061(EX), March 18, 2005. In July 2009, the
Pennsylvania Securities Commission issued a cease-and-desist order against Couch, along with
COG, requiring them to halt the offer and sale of unregistered securities in that state in an action
styled In the Matter of Couch Energy, LLC, et al., Penn. Sec. Comm’n, Dkt. No. 9901-21 (July
20, 2009).
8.

Couch Oil & Gas, Inc. is a Texas corporation headquartered in Irving, Texas.

From at least 2010 through 2012, COG raised money from investors in connection with the
Programs, and also served as the Programs’ operator.
IV.
FACTS
A.

DEFENDANTS OFFERED AND SOLD SECURITIES IN CONNECTION WITH TWO OIL AND
GAS INVESTMENT PROGRAMS.
9.

From at least September 2010 through January 2012, Defendants offered and

sold, or purported to sell – to more than 200 investors across at least 21 states – fractional,
undivided working interests in oil and gas wells comprising two investment offerings: (1) the 59
Well Program; and (2) the Radial Nine Program.
1.

The 59 Well Program

10.

Investment in the 59 Well Program was first offered to investors in or around the

fall of 2010. Defendants represented to prospective investors that the program would include 59
turnkey oil and gas wells located within “proven undeveloped productive oil zones” within
SEC v. Charles Couch, et al.
Complaint

Page 4 of 16

Case 3:14-cv-01747-D Document 1 Filed 05/12/14

Page 5 of 16 PageID 5

existing oil fields in West Texas. Defendants claimed that a total sum of approximately
$10,000,000 would be needed to fully fund the program.
11.

Defendants represented that they planned to raise $4,995,000 from investors who

purchased interests in the 59 Well Program and claimed that, for an investment of $99,900,
investors would receive a 1% working interest in each of the program’s 59 wells. Defendants
further represented that they would provide the remaining $4,995,000 needed for the program
through funding and/or labor.
12.

Defendants stopped offering investments in the 59 Well Program in the spring of

2011, after raising approximately $7,000,000 from 139 investors, overselling the program by
more than $2 million.
2.

The Radial Nine Program

13.

Defendants began offering and selling interests in the Radial Nine Program in or

around the summer of 2011. Defendants claimed that a total sum of approximately $10,000,000
would be needed to fully fund the program, and stated a plan to raise up to $7,500,000 from
investors, with the remaining sum to be provided by Defendants through funding and/or labor.
14.

Defendants represented to prospective investors that this program would include

nine new, turnkey, horizontal wells located within “proven undeveloped productive oil zones” in
existing oil fields in West Texas. Defendants further represented that the wells would be drilled
utilizing so-called “radial jet drilling technology.” Defendants told investors in the Radial Nine
Program that, for a $100,000 investment, they would receive a 1% working interest in each of
the nine wells to be drilled.
15.

In October 2011, Couch met with Commission staff regarding the staff’s

underlying investigation of Defendants. After that meeting, Couch claims, he decided to stop
SEC v. Charles Couch, et al.
Complaint

Page 5 of 16

Case 3:14-cv-01747-D Document 1 Filed 05/12/14

Page 6 of 16 PageID 6

selling the Radial Nine Program offering. At that time, Defendants had sold approximately
$460,000 in interests in the Radial Nine Program. In fact, however, Defendants continued to
enroll Radial Nine investors until late January 2012, encouraging them to invest soon because
the interests were no longer going to be offered to individual investors. Defendants sold another
$2.35 million in interests in the Radial Nine Program, or 84% of the total money raised in the
program, after Couch decided to stop selling program.
16.

Potential investors who purchased interests in the Radial Nine Program after

October 2011 were misled regarding the basis for Defendants’ decision to close the offering
early. While Defendants intended to close the offering early based on the Commission’s
investigation, they instead represented that the offering would no longer be available to
individual investors. Furthermore, Defendants did not revise offering materials and projections to
reflect the early closing of the offering. When Defendants finally did close the program in late
January 2012, they had raised approximately $2,800,000 from 65 investors in 21 states.
B.

DEFENDANTS DID NOT REGISTER THEIR SECURITIES OFFERINGS WITH THE
COMMISSION.
17.

The interests Defendants offered and sold or purportedly sold in the Programs are

securities.
18.

Defendants never filed a registration statement for the 59 Well Program

securities offering, the Radial Nine Program securities offering, or for the working interests
purportedly sold through the Programs.

Complaint

Case 3:14-cv-01747-D Document 1 Filed 05/12/14

C.

Page 7 of 16 PageID 7

DEFENDANTS MADE MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS IN
CONNECTION WITH THE OFFER, PURCHASE, AND SALE OF SECURITIES IN THE
PROGRAMS.
19.

Defendants created brochures and subscription agreements describing the

Programs which were distributed to prospective investors (the “Offering Documents”).
20.

Defendants also created private placement memoranda (“PPMs”) for the

Programs, though not all investors – and perhaps none of them – ever received the PPMs.
Defendants’ Offering Documents and PPMs contained materially false and misleading
statements and omissions.
1.

Failure to Provide Investors Title to Working Interests

21.

Defendants’ Offering Documents and PPMs each promised investors that, in

exchange for their investment, they would acquire working interests in the Programs’ oil and gas
wells.
22.

In reality, Defendants never transferred any working interests to any investors.

Rather, COG retained all ownership interest in the Programs’ wells. Thus, Defendants
misrepresented the fundamental nature of the investment investors believed they were making.
2.

Misrepresentations Regarding Use of Investor Proceeds

23.

The Offering Documents and PPMs for both Programs claimed that investor

funds would be used to pay the turnkey costs to drill, complete, and produce oil and gas wells.
24.

Neither the Offering Documents nor the PPMs disclosed that Defendants engaged

a California-based brokerage firm to offer and sell investments in the Programs (“California
Brokerage Firm”), or that the firm was not registered as required by Section 15 of the Exchange
Act. In fact, the PPMs falsely stated that COG did not use the services of any broker-dealer or

SEC v. Charles Couch, et al.
Complaint

Page 7 of 16

Case 3:14-cv-01747-D Document 1 Filed 05/12/14

Page 8 of 16 PageID 8

placement agent to offer or sell the interests in the Programs but that, if it did, it would use a
FINRA-licensed broker-dealer or placement agent.
25.

Importantly, Defendants never informed investors that approximately 30% of

their investment funds would be – and were – paid as sales commissions to the California
Brokerage Firm and its unregistered sales staff, rather than used to pay the costs of drilling and
operating oil-and-gas wells as Defendants had represented.
26.

Defendants’ PPMs also misstated how investor monies would be allocated and

assigned, as percentages, to pay for costs associated with leasing, drilling, well completion,
geologic matters, marketing, and more. Despite Defendants’ intentional enumeration of how
they would – and therefore by extension would not – use investor funds, Defendants’
misappropriated funds by comingling them with funds from other offerings and using them to
pay for undisclosed and often unrelated expenses.
27.

Defendants raised approximately $9,800,000 through the Programs. Defendants

raised approximately $7,000,000 from 139 investors in the 59 Well Program and approximately
$2,800,000 from 65 investors in the Radial Nine Program.
28.

Of the $9,800,000 they raised, Defendants diverted approximately $2.8 million of

investor funds to the California Brokerage Firm as undisclosed commissions.
29.

Defendants spent approximately $3.3 million of additional investor proceeds from

the Programs to pay COG payroll and tax liabilities, credit card and other debt obligations,
private litigation expenses, and overhead, none of which was disclosed in the Offering Materials
and some of which were completely unrelated to the Programs.
30.

Defendants spent approximately $3.5 million, or only about 35% of investor

funds, on actual costs associated with drilling, completing, and producing the wells in the
SEC v. Charles Couch, et al.
Complaint

Page 8 of 16

Case 3:14-cv-01747-D Document 1 Filed 05/12/14

Page 9 of 16 PageID 9

Programs. Additionally, at least $448,000 of Radial Nine Program investor funds were used to
buy a workover drilling rig for COG, which COG used for its unrelated oil-and-gas services
business.
31.

Furthermore, Defendants improperly commingled in a single bank account (a) all

investor funds received in connection with both Programs; as well as (b) funds raised from
investors in separate, unrelated securities offerings; (c) proceeds from sales of oil and gas; (d)
proceeds from Defendants’ separate and unrelated oil-and-gas services business; and (e)
proceeds from unrelated litigation. Defendants used these commingled funds to pay, among
other things: (a) minimal investment returns to investors in the Programs; (b) commissions to the
California Brokerage Firm; and (c) a variety of expenses unrelated to the Programs.
3.

Misrepresentations Regarding Experience and Success With Radial Jet
Technology

32.

In connection with their efforts to secure investments in the Radial Nine Program,

Defendants’ Offering Documents misrepresented and grossly overstated their experience and
success utilizing radial jet technology to extract oil and gas.
33.

To lure investors to the Radial Nine Well Program, Defendants touted their

experience with radial jet drilling to enhance oil and gas production and claimed they would
employ the method in drilling the program wells. Contrary to their representations, Defendants
actually had little experience even utilizing – much less successfully utilizing – radial jet
technology.

Complaint

Page 9 of 16

Case 3:14-cv-01747-D Document 1 Filed 05/12/14

Page 10 of 16 PageID 10

4.

Misrepresentations Regarding Estimated Production and Investment
Returns

34.

In addition, the Offering Documents for the 59 Well Program and the Radial Nine

Program, upon which investors relied when investing, represented that the wells in both
Programs were located – or would be drilled – in “proven undeveloped productive oil zones.” In
these documents, Defendants provided investors in both Programs with anticipated minimum and
maximum barrels of oil per day that would be produced across the wells.
35.

However, when Defendants’ made these projections they knew or had every

reason to know they were false and that investors relied on, among other things, (a) the false
representation that Defendants would use all investor funds for drilling purposes; (b) highly
unreasonable estimates of the costs and timing associated with drilling and completing wells;
(c) a highly unreasonable presumption that all wells would be successful producers; and (d) the
false claim that radial jet drilling would increase production in the Radial Nine Program.
36.

As a result, Defendants materially misrepresented the investment returns investors

could reasonably expect to receive from participation in the Programs.
37.

Defendants misrepresentations and omissions were compounded by the absence

of meaningful disclosures about the risks associated with drilling and producing oil and gas
wells.
5.

Misrepresentations Regarding Early Wind Down of the Radial Nine
Program

38.

As discussed above, after learning about the Commission’s investigation of

Defendants, and following an October 2011 meeting with Commission staff, Defendants decided
to stop raising new investments in the Radial Nine Program and instead wind the offering down
early before raising the funds needed to drill all nine wells promised to program investors.

Complaint

Case 3:14-cv-01747-D Document 1 Filed 05/12/14

39.

Page 11 of 16 PageID 11

Nevertheless, Defendants allowed the California Brokerage Firm to continue

selling investments in the offering. Defendants also continued distributing, or authorized
continued distribution of, Offering Materials stating they planned to raise $7,500,000 for the
Radial Nine Program. Defendants did not modify these documents to reflect the fact that the
offering would be terminated shortly, and that the full $7,500,000 would probably not be raised
with the corresponding impact on the drilling program.
40.

Approximately 84% of the interests in the Radial Nine Program were sold

between October 29, 2011 and January 27, 2012, when the selling finally ceased.
D.

DEFENDANTS CARRIED OUT A SCHEME TO DEFRAUD INVESTORS.
41.

To persuade investors, Defendants engaged in a practice and course of business

that consisted of making the untrue statements and omissions of material facts alleged above,
concerning the nature of COG’s business, its historical experience and success, anticipated well
production, and the amount of investment returns investors could expect to realize through the
Programs. These misrepresentations and omissions were not the only acts Defendants took in
furtherance of their scheme.
42.

In addition, Defendants engaged in a practice and course of business of misusing

investor proceeds for their own purposes and benefits including paying commissions, covering
non-well-related expenses, and purchasing equipment for COG to be used – and which was in
fact used – outside of the Programs.
43.

In furtherance of their scheme, Defendants repeatedly made lulling statements to

investors to mollify them when wells were not being drilled, completed, or produced and when
returns were not being paid. Among such statements, Defendants claimed for more than two
years that COG was actively negotiating the sale of certain producing fields to a third party.

Complaint

Page 11 of 16

Case 3:14-cv-01747-D Document 1 Filed 05/12/14

44.

Page 12 of 16 PageID 12

Moreover, Defendants failed to act as promised in their Offering Documents and

PPMs because they did not complete the drilling, well-completion, or production they
represented they would and, instead, substituted or added different wells to the programs in an
effort to provide investors with a false sense that actual progress was being made toward
production in their respective investment Programs. In fact, after raising approximately
$9,800,000 from the Programs’ investors, COG went from doing business as the oil-and-gas
development company investors invested with, to an oil-and-gas services company that, at a
minimum, substantially reduced the amount of time and resources Defendants devoted to drilling
and completing the wells investors were promised.
