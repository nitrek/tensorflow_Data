FY 2015 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT AND FY 2017 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN

A Reader’s Guide to the SEC’s Performance Information
The following chapters comprise the agency’s FY 2015
Annual Performance Report (APR) and FY 2017 Annual
Performance Plan (APP), which explains how the SEC uses
resources to achieve each of its four strategic goals. These
Strategic Goals, Strategic Objectives, and Performance Goals
and Indicators were developed as part of the Strategic Plan
process for FY 2014-2018. The process followed by SEC
in verifying and validating the accuracy of all performance
data is described in Appendix B.
The following outlines a brief description of each of the major
components of the performance section:
Strategic Goal Summary: Each strategic goal section
opens by reviewing the purpose of the goal, followed by
information identifying the resources allocated toward
achieving the goal.

Strategic Objective: This section provides a description of
the SEC’s strategic objectives that gauge the agency’s
performance within each strategic goal.
FY 2015 Performance Achievements: A brief summary that
spotlights the year’s performance achievements, including
resource data and an overall discussion of performance.
Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017): A brief discussion of how
the SEC plans to use resources requested in FY 2017 to
achieve the strategic goal.
Performance Goals and Indicators: Each strategic goal
section includes a presentation of performance goals and
performance indicators by objective, comparing planned and
actual performance levels for FY 2015. Four years of historical
data is provided for performance goals and performance
indicators where available.

FY 2015 APR and FY 2017 APP
The SEC focuses its resources on (1) establishing and
maintaining an effective regulatory environment, (2) fostering
and enforcing compliance with the Federal securities laws,
(3) facilitating access to the information investors need to
make informed investment decisions, and (4) enhancing
the agency’s performance through effective alignment and
management of human, information, and financial capital.
In FY 2015, total SEC obligations were $1.479 billion1 in
support of 4,301 total full-time equivalents (FTE). Of 53 total
performance targets, the agency met or exceeded 46 and
did not meet seven.
The budget request for FY 2017 totals $1.781 billion, an
increase of about $98 million (six percent) over the agency’s
FY 2016 funding level of $1.683 billion. The FY 2017
budget funds 4,870 FTE, an increase of about 249 FTE
(five percent) over the FY 2016 level, and increases the
number of positions by 250 to a total of 5,196.

PAGE

The additional resources requested for FY 2017 would
bolster the SEC’s efforts to achieve each of its four strategic
goals, and improve the agency’s ability to oversee the new
markets and market participants that have been added to
the SEC’s jurisdiction. The agency is aware that increasing
staffing in the program areas requires a commensurate
increase in staff and funding for support offices. The
requested funding will provide necessary resources for
attracting and retaining a diverse and talented workforce,
administering programs to enhance employee engagement
and leadership development, and leveraging information
technology that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of agency programs.
To complement the FY 2015 APR, the agency also presents
its FY 2015 budget by program. Each program chapter
provides detailed information on program priorities, initiatives,
and workload figures for the relevant divisions and offices.

This figure excludes use of budget authority to liquidate prior obligations for deficient leases.

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

Performance Summary by Strategic Goal and Strategic Objective
Strategic Goal 1: Establish and Maintain an Effective Regulatory Environment
The Commission’s responsibility is to put the Federal
securities laws into action by establishing and maintaining
a regulatory environment that fulfills and sustains the
agency’s mission. In general, rulemaking and policies
are designed to improve disclosure, facilitate the flow of
important information to investors and the public, promote
capital formation, improve governance, promote high-quality
accounting standards, enhance the accountability of financial
intermediaries and other market participants, and strengthen
the structure of the trading markets, among other goals.
The Commission aims to promulgate rules that are clearly
written, easily understood, and tailored toward specific
ends. In addition, the agency recognizes that regular reviews
of Commission regulations and rulemaking processes
are necessary to confirm that intended results are being
achieved. When properly crafted, these rules serve to further
the agency’s mission and allow for accurate and reliable
information to be made available to investors.
In FY 2015, approximately $151.7 million and 463 fulltime equivalents (FTEs) were directed at achieving results
in Goal 1. Of 10 performance targets, the agency met or
exceeded eight and did not meet two. During FY 2017,
the SEC plans to pursue a vigorous investor-focused
rulemaking agenda that will help protect investors and
ensure that markets operate fairly. Under the Dodd-Frank
Act the agency will continue to implement a more effective
regulatory structure. In FY 2017, the agency is requesting
a total of $167.6 million and 488 FTEs toward achieving
results in establishing an effective regulatory environment.

Strategic Objective 1.1: The SEC establishes and
maintains a regulatory environment that promotes highquality disclosure, financial reporting, and governance,
and prevents abusive practices by registrants, financial
intermediaries, and other market participants.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Division of Trading and Markets;
Director, Division of Corporation Finance; Director, Division
of Investment Management

Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
The SEC has proposed or adopted nearly all of the
mandatory rulemakings required by the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank
Act) and the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS
Act), in addition to advancing other key rules in mission
critical areas that protect investors and our markets. These
efforts have included final rules addressing over-the-counter
derivatives; new means for small businesses to access capital
(including rules to update Regulation A and permit securitiesbased crowdfunding offerings); executive compensation
disclosures; and the removal of references to credit ratings
from our rules. In addition to implementing congressionally
mandated rules, the SEC has also advanced other important
policy objectives, including rules to enhance oversight of
high-frequency traders and the supervision of investment
advisers and mutual funds, including reforms to money
market mutual funds; as well as adopting requirements for
comprehensive new controls at critical market participants
to strengthen key technological systems.

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
The Division of Trading and Markets (TM) is responsible
for more than 30 separate rulemaking initiatives under the
Dodd-Frank Act. Many of these rulemakings are the first
step in new ongoing supervisory and regulatory functions for
the Division that will extend into FY 2017. These initiatives
and functions include:
•	 Registration and regulation of security-based swap
data repositories (SDRs), security-based swap dealers
(SBSDs), major security-based swap participant
(MSBSPs), and swap execution facilities;
•	 Regulatory reporting and public dissemination of
security-based swap data;
•	 Mandatory clearing of security-based swaps;
•	 Application of security-based swap rules to cross-border
activities and persons engaged in those activities;

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

•

FY 2015 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT AND FY 2017 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN

•	 Expanded regulation and supervision of clearing
agencies; and
•	 Ongoing implementation of final rules restricting certain
proprietary trading activities of broker-dealers under
the Volcker Rule, including interagency coordination
of interpretations, examinations, and enforcement of
the rules.

In FY 2017, the Division of Investment Management (IM)
expects to continue to focus considerable attention on a set
of initiatives to enhance investment management industry
resilience to portfolio composition risk and operational risk.
The initiatives are designed to:
•	 Improve the data and other information used by the
Commission to understand the risks of the asset
management industry and develop appropriate
regulatory responses.

In FY 2017, the Division of Corporation Finance (CF) will assist
the Commission in finalizing the study of the Commission’s
disclosure rules required by the Fixing America’s Surface
Transportation (FAST) Act and in developing recommendations
arising out of that study for new or revised rules. In FY 2017,
CF will also provide assistance and interpretive guidance to
small businesses and other market participants related to
the Commission’s 2015 rules that allow for expanded access
to capital through crowdfunding and under Regulation A.

•	 Ensure that registered funds enhance their fund-level
controls so they are able to identify and address risks
related to their liquidity and use of derivatives.
•	 Ensure that firms have a plan for transitioning their
clients’ assets when circumstances warrant.
•	 Implement new requirements for annual stress testing
by large investment advisers and large funds.

Strategic Objective 1.2: The SEC promotes capital
markets that operate in a fair, efficient, transparent,
and competitive manner, fostering capital formation
and innovation.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Division of Trading and Markets
Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
SEC’s rulemaking agenda prioritizes investor protection,
market stability, and capital formation. Through rulemaking
and other initiatives, the agency works to assure that
investors have fair access to securities markets and that
their orders are handled in an efficient and transparent
manner from order to settlement.

PAGE

  24

Additionally, the SEC oversees self-regulatory organizations
(SRO) to ensure that securities markets operate in a fair,
efficient and orderly manner; that they are competitive; and
that they promote capital formation. The SEC has authority
over the rulemaking and other activities of SROs, which
include national securities exchanges, the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and clearing agencies. The
SEC, in approving SRO rules, must determine that these
rules are constructed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
practices, promote just and equitable principles of trade, and
foster cooperation in the clearing and settling of trades, and
that they do not impose an unnecessary or inappropriate
burden on competition (Performance Goal 1.2.1).

FY 2015 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT AND FY 2017 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
In FY 2017, the SEC must sustain and enhance its
existing supervision of securities markets, securities
market infrastructure, securities intermediaries, and other
market participants. In FY 2017, the Division of Trading and
Markets (TM) will face growing demands in its supervision
of critical securities market infrastructure, with respect to
both the implementation of new Dodd-Frank Act-related
responsibilities and the expansion of its existing oversight
program. The Division will expand its oversight of existing

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

clearing agencies, particularly those that are designated as
systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight
Council (FSOC), and will continue to review their rule filings
on an ongoing basis. As with exchanges, many clearing
agency rule changes filed with the SEC must be handled on
a significantly expedited basis under the Dodd-Frank Act.
Additionally, TM will need to focus on significant industry
initiatives to reform clearing agency practices with respect
to disclosure of risk management information, tri-party
securities lending activities, and the duration of the standard
securities settlement cycle, among other matters.

PERFORMANCE GOAL 1.2.1
Time to complete SEC review of SRO rules that are subject to SEC approval
Description: The SEC reviews SRO rule proposals for consistency with the Exchange Act standards of investor protection, fair and orderly
operation of the markets and market structure, as well as other statutory requirements. This metric gauges the timeliness of those reviews.

Target: Not Met
Analysis: During FY 2015, the SEC approved or disapproved 211 SRO rule changes filed pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act.
Of the 211 filings, 63 percent were approved or disapproved within the 45 day standard for publication, which falls below the 70 percent
target established. The remaining SRO rule changes all met other statutory deadlines past the 45th day.
Plan for Improving Program Performance: The adoption of Dodd-Frank in July 2010 required the SEC to approve or disapprove within certain
statutory time frames from the date of publication of a rule change. The staff must publish within 15 days from when the filing is received,
otherwise the publication date reverts to the day the SRO publishes the filing on their website, (i.e., within two days of filing with the SEC).
Once a rule filing is published for comment, the SEC must complete a review within 45 days, or within longer periods of time as noted in the
statute. Of the 211 SRO rule changes subject to the Dodd-Frank standards, 132 filings were subsequently approved or disapproved within
45 days of publication. The remaining 79 filings were approved or disapproved within the other statutory benchmarks, (i.e., within 90 days,
within 180 days, within 240 days). The SEC met the statutory standards set by Dodd-Frank 100 percent of the time. The SEC will evaluate
in FY 2016 whether to adjust this target to the Dodd-Frank standards, which represent a better measure of program performance.

Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
In FY 2015, the SEC continued to pursue an investorfocused rulemaking agenda. The Commission’s rulemaking
has been supported by detailed economic analysis provided
by the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA).
DERA has provided guidance that outlines a road map for
the rulemaking divisions and offices, listing concepts that
the analysis should cover and helping ensure that economic
analysis is integrated throughout the entire rule development
and rule writing process.

The SEC devotes resources to responding to no-action
letters, and interpretive and other requests from regulated
entities, public companies, and other outside parties.
In FY 2015, the Divisions of Corporation Finance (CF)
and Investment Management (IM) met or exceeded their
response rate targets for Performance Goal 1.3.1.

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
In FY 2017, the SEC plans to continue to devote staff
resources to rulemaking and interpretive guidance, including
preparing remaining rules to implement the Dodd-Frank
Act and JOBS Act, considering the impact of SEC rules
and regulations on small business capital formation, and
continuing efforts to modernize and simplify disclosure
requirements. TM, IM and CF remain committed to
exceeding timeliness goals in responding to written requests
for no-action letters, exemptive applications, and written
interpretive requests (Performance Goal 1.3.1).

Description: The SEC staff responds to requests for guidance from individuals and market participants about specific provisions of the Federal
securities laws. These queries may seek interpretations of the securities laws or regulations, or assurances that no enforcement action will be
taken if the individual or market participant engages in a specified activity. The staff also reviews applications for exemptions from the securities
laws. Written responses to such requests for guidance, when provided, generally are publicly available, as are applications and related notices
and orders, when issued. This metric gauges the timeliness of initial comments issued by the Divisions of Trading and Markets, Investment
Management, and Corporation Finance.

means the request is not closed within the targeted timeframe. The SEC decided to lower its target percentage for 2016 and 2017 to reflect
the time involved in responding to these complex requests.

Target: No-action letters – Exceeded; Exemptive applications – Exceeded
Analysis: For the seventh year in a row, IM exceeded its target for initial comments on exemptive applications within 120 days. The division
considered but decided against raising its target percentage because the ability to meet the target is dependent on factors that could change
materially during any fiscal year such as the total number of applications filed, concentration of filings at any particular time period (surges),
and the types and complexity of the applications filed. For the sixth year in a row, IM processed 100 percent of initial comments on no-action
letters within three weeks, surpassing its target of “80 percent within three weeks.” IM has been able to achieve this level of success because
of its continued emphasis on providing initial comments within the targeted timeframe as a key priority.

Strategic Objective 1.4: The SEC engages with a
multitude of stakeholders to inform and enhance
regulatory activities domestically and internationally.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Office of International Affairs
Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
In today’s markets, capital can cross jurisdictional boundaries
with the tap of a screen. It is more important than ever to
coordinate with other U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities
and stakeholders on the best regulatory responses to the
changing market landscape. Failure to effectively coordinate
can significantly hamper the SEC’s ability to achieve its policy
objectives or avoid significant unintended consequences.
The Office of International Affairs (OIA) handled an increased
volume of requests in cross-border supervisory cooperation
matters, cross-border examinations, asset verifications and
registrations. During FY 2015, OIA continued to streamline
its processes to provide assistance in an efficient and
timely way. The Office also continued to provide technical
assistance programs for regulators around the world
(Performance Goal 1.4.1 and Performance Goal 1.4.2).

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
The SEC will continue to actively participate in international
multilateral organizations, including the International
Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the
Financial Stability Board, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, and the Financial Action
Task Force. These efforts will be complemented by direct
bilateral consultations with foreign regulatory counterparts
on enforcement and regulatory matters. In addition, the
SEC continues to promote international coordination and
cooperation through its technical assistance programs
for foreign regulators (Performance Goal 1.4.1 and
Performance Goal 1.4.2).
In FY 2017, the SEC Chair will continue to participate actively
in the Financial Stability Oversight Committee (FSOC) with
other FSOC members, such as the Chairman of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Secretary of the
Treasury, and the Chairman of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC).

in cross-border supervisory cooperation matters, including cross-border examinations, asset verifications and registrations during FY 2015.
OIA worked to streamline its processes to provide assistance in an efficient and timely way. Note the FY 2013 figures have been corrected
from previous publications.

Strategic Goal 2: Foster and Enforce Compliance with the Federal Securities Laws
Fostering compliance with Federal securities laws is
interwoven through all of the SEC’s programs and is
central to fulfilling the critical mission of the agency. Through
disclosure reviews and examinations of broker-dealers,
investment advisers, self-regulatory organizations (SROs)
and other market participants, the SEC seeks both to detect
violations of the securities laws and rules and to foster
strong compliance and risk management practices within
these firms and organizations. The SEC’s Enforcement
program also investigates and prosecutes violations of the
law, with the aims of holding wrongdoers accountable,
returning funds to harmed investors whenever possible, and
building deterrence against future violations. In FY 2015,
approximately $839.1 million and 2,474 full-time equivalents
(FTEs) were directed at achieving results in Goal 2. Of 12
performance targets, the agency met or exceeded 10 and
did not meet two.
In FY 2017, the agency is requesting a total of $964.6 million
and 2,823 FTE for Goal 2. The additional resources will
allow the SEC to continue addressing the disparity between
the reach of the exam staff and the growing number and
complexity of registered firms and building out the agency’s
new responsibility areas. Additionally, the Commission
will be able to take prompt action to halt misconduct,
sanction wrongdoers effectively, and return funds to harmed
investors. In all, the agency plans to devote approximately
$964.6 million to enforcing compliance with the Federal
securities laws.

Strategic Objective 2.1: The SEC fosters compliance with
the Federal securities laws.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Office of Compliance Inspections
and Examinations

Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
The SEC seeks to encourage within firms that participate in
the securities markets a strong culture of compliance that

fosters ethical behavior and decision-making. As part of
its efforts to promote compliance within the industry, OCIE
conducted 129 outreach and educational programs events
during the year, including Compliance Outreach seminars,
targeted sessions with never before examined advisers,
and various other outreach initiatives with registrants and
other regulators (Performance Goal 2.1.1).
OCIE also works to enforce and foster compliance with
Federal securities laws through its examination and
inspection program. During examinations in FY 2015, the
staff identified a number of areas where firms appeared not
to be in compliance with Federal securities laws. In response
to deficiency letters that were sent to firms by the staff,
90 percent of registrants have continued to assert that
they are taking corrective action in response to all staff
findings. In order to achieve this level of performance, the
staff continued to make concerted efforts during the year to
improve dialogue and communication with firms, including
at the most senior levels (Performance Goal 2.1.2).

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
In FY 2017, the National Examination Program (NEP) will
continue its focus on high-risk entities and activities. The
additional resources requested will serve to: (1) address the
disparity between the number of exam staff and the growing
number and complexity of registered firms, particularly
in the investment management industry; (2) continue
implementation of certain legislative changes, including
provisions of the Dodd-Frank and JOBS Acts; (3) enhance
and expand quantitative and data analytic efforts; and
(4) more effectively risk target, monitor, and examine
market participants. OCIE will also enhance training and
expertise of examiners in data analysis, fraud detection
and prevention, technology, new products and trading
strategies, and other critical areas. Also, in FY 2017, OCIE
will continue its efforts to promote industry compliance
efforts through initiatives such as the Compliance Outreach
program (Performance Goal 2.1.1).

Description: At the conclusion of examinations, the staff communicates identified deficiencies to registrants in the form of a deficiency letter.
Registrants are then given a chance to respond to staff findings and often take action to remedy any problems and potential risks, including
monetary compensation to clients and enhancements to disclosures, policies and procedures. Most often, registrants respond that they
have corrected the deficiencies and implemented measures to prevent recurrence.

action in response to the staff’s findings. In order to achieve this level of performance, the staff made concerted efforts during the year to
improve dialogue and communication with firms, including at the most senior levels. These efforts have helped to ensure that there is a clear
understanding of issues and concerns between the staff and registrants. Overall, this measure continues to show that registrants are using
examination results to improve operations and compliance with Federal securities laws.

Strategic Objective 2.2: The SEC promptly detects and
deters violations of the Federal securities laws.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Office of Compliance Inspections
and Examinations

Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
In FY 2015, the National Examination Program continued
to improve its risk assessment and surveillance capabilities,
to ensure that the program is spending its limited resources
on those firms presenting the highest risk. Examinations of
high risk firms often take significant time to complete and
are frequently of large and complex entities. Overall, the staff
examined 10 percent of investment advisers in FY 2015;
these firms manage more than 30 percent of the assets under
management of currently registered advisers. Examination
resources were also allocated during the past year to other
efforts intended to improve the long-term performance of
the program, including industry outreach initiatives, rulemaking efforts and other program improvement efforts
(Performance Goal 2.2.1).

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
The National Examination Program is requesting to hire
127 additional staff in FY 2017. These new positions would

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

directly affect the proportion of registered entities that would
be examined each year. Since these staff would be hired
during the course of FY 2017, the coverage rates would
not reach their new steady-state levels until the staff are all
on board, trained, and conducting examinations for a full
fiscal year. Once that occurs, the percentage of investment
advisers and investment companies examined is expected to
reach approximately 13 percent and 15 percent, respectively
(Performance Goal 2.2.1).
The National Exam Program will continue to identify and
communicate potential issues to firms to ensure that
compliance problems and issues are corrected quickly. In
FY 2017, the SEC will continue to complete all examinations
within the statutory deadline. Overall, this helps the SEC to
ensure that deficiencies are promptly detected and resolved
by firms (Performance Goal 2.2.2).
In FY 2017, the SEC will continue to focus on improving
coordination with other regulators on areas of mutual
interest, both to share expertise and to address key areas
of risk. In that regard, the exam program continued to
conduct coordinated exams and meetings with other
regulators and also maintained a number of agreements
with these regulators to help ensure that information
could be shared in an appropriate and timely manner
(Performance Goal 2.2.3).

PERFORMANCE GOAL 2.2.1
Percentage of investment advisers, investment companies, and broker-dealers examined during the year
Description: This metric indicates the number of registrants examined by the SEC or an SRO as a percentage of the total number of registrants. This
metric includes all types of examinations: risk priority examinations, cause inspections to follow up on tips and complaints, limited-scope special
inspections to probe emerging risk areas, and oversight examinations of broker-dealers to test compliance and the quality of examinations by FINRA.

Strategic Objective 2.3: The SEC prosecutes violations of
Federal securities laws and holds violators accountable
through appropriate sanctions and remedies.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Division of Enforcement
Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
A key part of investor protection is to quickly and
appropriately sanction those who prey on investors. The
Division of Enforcement strives to obtain swift and strong
judgments and orders, while remaining fair. The Division has
continued to implement controls and strategies to resolve
actions quickly and on a favorable basis, while at the same
time, it does not hesitate to file matters on a contested basis
where a favorable settlement was unavailable before filing
(Performance Goal 2.3.1).
Filing enforcement actions in a timely manner is an important
measure of the Division’s effectiveness. In FY 2015, the
average time between opening a matter under inquiry (MUI)
or Investigation and commencing an enforcement action was
24 months. This exceeded the similar figure in the prior fiscal
year. However, many of the Division’s cases are complex and
can take extended periods of time to develop successfully,
which will negatively impact the timeliness of actions. Indeed,
many of the cases filed by the Division in FY 2015 involved
complex financial products, market transactions, and other

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

types of conduct that are difficult to investigate. The Division
continued to focus on complex areas of the marketplace,
including emerging threats involving new trading technologies
such as high-frequency and algorithmic trading, large volume
trading, systemic insider trading and manipulation schemes,
and financial disclosure, among other areas (Performance
Goal 2.3.3).

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
For FY 2017, the Division of Enforcement is requesting 52
new positions. These new staff, along with new methods,
initiatives, and organizational reforms, will help the program
bring successful cases on a timely basis. To improve the
quality and efficiency of its investigations, the SEC has
placed new emphasis on data analytics, put seasoned
investigators on the front lines, created specialized units
focused on specific programmatic priorities, enhanced
case management systems, and increased coordination
efforts with other offices and divisions in the SEC and
other regulators. In FY 2016, the SEC plans to obtain relief
on one or more claims from approximately 92 percent
of enforcement actions (Performance Goal 2.3.1). The
agency also plans to reduce in FY 2017 the average number
months between the opening of an investigation and the
commencement of an enforcement action arising out of
that investigation (Performance Goal 2.3.3).

PERFORMANCE GOAL 2.3.1
Percentage of enforcement actions in which the Commission obtained relief on one or more claims
Description: This metric identifies, as to all parties to enforcement actions that were resolved in the fiscal year, the percentage against whom
the Commission obtained a judgment or order entered on consent, a default judgment, a judgment of liability on one or more charges, and/
or the imposition of monetary or other relief.

PERFORMANCE GOAL 2.3.4
Percentage of debts where either a payment has been made or a collection activity
has been initiated within 180 days of the due date of the debt
Description: The SEC can seek a wide range of remedies for failure to comply with the securities laws. These remedies include civil monetary
penalties and disgorgement. When the remedies are imposed by the SEC or the Federal district court, payments must be made by a certain
date. This metric identifies the percentage of debts where debtors have made payments or the SEC has initiated a collection activity within
180 days of the due date. Such collection activities include, among other things, demand letters, negotiation of payment plans, enforcing
the payment of the debt through the courts, or other judicial remedies.

PERFORMANCE GOAL 2.3.5
Percentage of Fair Fund and disgorgement fund plans that have distributed 80 percent of the available
funds for distribution within twenty four (24) months of the approval of the distribution plan
Description: In addition to other types of relief, the SEC may seek orders requiring parties to disgorge any money obtained through wrongdoing.
The SEC also is empowered to seek civil penalties for violations of the securities laws. Where appropriate, the SEC has sought to return
disgorged funds to harmed investors and, as a result of the Fair Funds provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, to
combine amounts paid as penalties with disgorged funds, or to create a Fair Fund from penalties only, to reduce losses to injured parties
and to maximize funds available for distribution. This metric identifies the percentage of distribution plans that reached a critical mass during
the fiscal year and within twenty four (24) months of the approval of the distribution plan. The distribution plan includes the timeline and
procedures required to return the funds to injured investors. This reflects Commission-wide efforts to implement plans to return money to
investors quickly. Any funds not returned to investors are sent to the U.S. Treasury or the Investor Protection Fund established pursuant to
Section 21F(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Neither disgorgement nor penalties are used for the SEC’s own expenses.

PERFORMANCE INDICATOR (CONTEXTUAL) 2.3.1
Percentage of filed enforcement actions reflecting characteristics that present enhanced risk to investors
and markets, as measured by the nature of the investigation, conduct, parties and impact
Description: This indicator assesses the quality of the cases filed by the Division of Enforcement. The indicator focuses on cases filed by the
SEC that involve factors reflecting enhanced risk to investors and markets. Such cases may involve: (i) those identified through risk analytics
and cross-disciplinary initiatives to reveal difficult-to-detect or early stage misconduct, thus minimizing investor loss and preventing the spread
of unlawful conduct and practices; (ii) particularly egregious or widespread misconduct and investor harm; (iii) vulnerable victims; (iv) a high
degree of scienter; (v) involvement of individuals occupying substantial positions of authority, or having fiduciary obligations or other special
responsibilities to investors; (vi) involvement of recidivists; (vii) high amount of investor loss prevented; (viii) misconduct that is difficult to
detect due to the complexity of products, transactions, and practices; (ix) use of innovative investigative or analytical techniques; (x) effective
coordination with other law enforcement partners; and/or (xi) whether the matter involves markets, transactions or practices identified as an
enforcement priority, or that advances the programmatic priorities of other SEC Divisions or Offices.

PERFORMANCE INDICATOR (CONTEXTUAL) 2.3.2
Total amount distributed within the fiscal year, and the number of Fair Funds from which those distributions came
Description: In its enforcement actions, the SEC may seek to return funds to harmed investors through disgorgement of ill-gotten gains or
through the Fair Funds provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This provision permits the SEC to combine amounts paid as penalties with
disgorged funds, or to create a Fair Fund from penalties only, to reduce losses to injured parties. This reflects the SEC’s efforts to return
funds to injured investors. This indicator identifies the total amount distributed within the fiscal year, and the number of Fair Funds from
which those distributions came. This indicator may increase or decrease in dollar amount and number of distribution funds based on the
number of SEC enforcement actions brought involving distributions, amounts ordered and paid in those actions, and other factors. Due to
the variation in reporting timelines established for each individual distribution, reported amounts are based on the agency’s best available
information. Reported amounts do not include those funds distributed through receiverships. Any funds not returned to investors are sent
to the U.S. Treasury or the Investor Protection Fund established pursuant to Section 21F(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Neither
disgorgement nor penalties are used for the Commission’s own expenses.

PERFORMANCE INDICATOR (OUTPUT) 2.3.3
Percent of enforcement actions filed that arose out of national priority investigations
Description: The Division of Enforcement conducts many enforcement actions each year that can be characterized as high impact and of
national priority. High impact or national priority investigations include those investigations which are significant for one or more of the following
reasons – the matter: (i) presents an opportunity to send a particularly strong and effective message of deterrence, including with respect
to markets, products and transactions that are newly developing, or that are long established but which by their nature present limited
opportunities to detect wrongdoing and thus to deter misconduct; (ii) involves particularly egregious or extensive misconduct; (iii) involves
potentially widespread and extensive harm to investors; (iv) involves misconduct by persons occupying positions of substantial authority or
responsibility, or who owe fiduciary or other enhanced duties and obligations to a broad group of investors or others; (v) involves potential
wrongdoing as prohibited under newly-enacted legislation or regulatory rules; (vi) concerns potential misconduct that occurred in connection
with products, markets, transactions or practices that pose particularly significant risks for investors or a systemically important sector of
the market; (vii) involves a substantial number of potential victims and/or particularly vulnerable victims; (viii) involves products, markets,
transactions or practices that the Enforcement Division has identified as priority areas; and/or (ix) provides an opportunity to pursue priority
interests shared by other law enforcement agencies on a coordinated basis.

PERFORMANCE INDICATOR (OUTPUT) 2.3.5
Disgorgement and penalties ordered and the amounts collected
Description: In addition to other types of relief, the SEC may seek orders requiring parties to disgorge any money obtained through wrongdoing.
The SEC is also empowered to seek civil penalties for violations of the securities laws. In some cases, the SEC will seek to obtain large
monetary sanctions even in instances where the prospects of collecting on a judgment are slight. The rationale for seeking monetary relief
in these circumstances is that such relief, even when likely uncollectible, might become collectible in the future based on the defendant’s
changed circumstances, and also because such relief can serve to deter others from violating the securities laws. Where appropriate, the SEC
has sought to return disgorged funds to harmed investors. Funds not returned to investors are sent to the Treasury or the Investor Protection
Fund established pursuant to Section 21F(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This indicator lists disgorgement and penalties ordered
as a result of SEC cases in each fiscal year and the amounts collected in those actions as of the end of FY 2015. The indicator for collected
amounts could change over time based on various factors.

Strategic Goal 3: Facilitate Access to the Information Investors
Need to Make Informed Investment Decisions
A strong economy and a vibrant securities market rely
on investor confidence and the widespread availability
of relevant information about those securities. The SEC
promotes informed investment decisions through two
main approaches. The first is to require that investors have
accurate, adequate, and timely public access to disclosure
materials that are easily understood and analyzed. The
second is to implement a variety of investor education
initiatives aimed at giving investors a better understanding
of the operations of the nation’s securities markets.
In FY 2015, the agency dedicated approximately
$187.0 million and 609 FTEs toward achieving results in
Goal 3. Of 12 performance targets, the agency met or
exceeded eleven and did not meet one. For FY 2017, the
SEC is requesting a total of $216.8 million and 674 FTEs
towards achieving results in Strategic Goal 3.

Strategic Objective 3.1: The SEC works to ensure
that investors have access to high-quality disclosure
materials that facilitate informed investment decisionmaking.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Division of Trading and Markets;
Director, Division of Corporation Finance; Director, Division
of Investment Management
Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
An educated investing public ultimately provides the best
defense against fraud and costly mistakes. The Federal
securities laws place great emphasis on requiring that
corporations, investments companies, and other entities
provide investors with timely, clear, complete and accurate
financial and non-financial information, allowing investors to
make wise investment decisions. Consistent with Section 408

PAGE

  42

of the Sarbanes Oxley-Act of 2002, the SEC completed its
review of disclosures made by certain public issuers, including
issuers’ financial statements, no less frequently than once
every three years (Performance Goal 3.1.1).
The SEC strives to review all significant disclosures made
by registrants in Commission filings under the Investment
Company Act, including initial registration statements and
post-effective amendments with material changes. The SEC
does not set a target for the number of filings that are reviewed
in a fiscal year because the SEC does not dictate the number
of filings that registrants make.

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
Investors who have access to information and know what
questions to ask are more likely to invest wisely, and to
choose professional intermediaries that will best meet their
objectives. The SEC understands that not all investors need
the same information and that those needs are affected
by their backgrounds, resources and goals. In FY 2017,
the SEC will continue to conduct the requisite number
of disclosure reviews so that investors are armed with
timely and useful information they need to make informed
investment decisions (Performance Goal 3.1.1).
As technology and the complexity of financial instruments
change, so too do the needs of modern day investors.
Providing investors with information in concise, easy-to-use
formats that are tailored to their needs helps investors to
help themselves. In FY 2017, the Commission will continue
to examine its filing review program to explore whether
its disclosure requirements, review criteria, approach to
comments, and professional and technology resources
provide maximum impact to benefit investors.

PERFORMANCE GOAL 3.1.1
Percentage of public companies and investment companies with disclosures reviewed each year
Description: The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that the SEC review, at least once every three years, the disclosures of all companies and
investment company portfolios reporting under the Exchange Act. These reviews help improve the information available to investors and may
identify possible violations of the Federal securities laws. This metric gauges the number of public companies and investment companies
reviewed each year.

Target: Initial registration statements – Exceeded; Post-effective amendments – Exceeded; Preliminary proxy statements – Not Met
Analysis: For FY 2015, the Division of Investment Management continued its goal of providing comments on proxy statements within 10 days
of filing at least 99 percent of the time. In FY 2015, the Division missed its 10-day goal for only five of 268 filings – due largely to staff turnover.
Plan for Improving Program Performance: We note that with respect to performance goal 3.1.3 (preliminary proxy statements) in FY 2015 the
Division missed its 10-day target for initial comments for five of 268 filings (1.87 percent). Because the performance goal is high (initial comments
given within the 10-day target period 99 percent of the time) it takes only a handful of individual instances of missing the target to result in
the performance goal being missed for the entire year. Because the target period for initial comments is short (10 days from date of filing), it
can be challenging to meet the target in rare cases where we are faced with a combination of difficult conditions, such as when we receive a
complicated filing during a period of heavy workload. This risk is exacerbated if the responsible office is experiencing substantial staff changes.
Nevertheless, the Division has met the 99 percent goal during most fiscal years.

Strategic Objective 3.2: The SEC works to understand
investor needs and educate investors so they are better
prepared to make informed investment decisions.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Office of Investor Education and
Advocacy

Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
Understanding the interests and concerns of investors
is critical to carrying out the Commission’s investor
protection mission. The SEC advances this mission by
regularly communicating with investors, responding to
their complaints and inquiries, and providing educational
programs and materials. The SEC serves thousands of
investors each year who contact the SEC with investmentrelated complaints and questions. During FY 2015, the SEC
closed out 65 percent of new investor assistance matters
within seven days and 93 percent of new investor assistance
matters within 30 days. The Office of Investor Education
and Advocacy (OIEA) was able to achieve these levels in
part by identifying and referring key investor assistance
matters to the agency’s Tips, Complaints and Referrals
(TCR) system (Performance Goal 3.2.2). During FY 2015,
the SEC had 23.6 million page views of online investor
education content and OIEA participated in 71 in-person
events (Performance Goal 3.2.1).

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
In FY 2017, the SEC will continue to seek more comprehensive data about investors and build upon the Commission’s
investor education efforts. Working in partnership with other
Federal and state agencies, financial industry associations,
consumer groups and educational organizations, the SEC
will develop investor education initiatives that are targeted
to specific audiences that will prevent future victims of fraud
(Performance Goad 3.2.4).
The SEC also works to provide individual investors with
useful and helpful investor education materials, including
clear explanations of Commission rules, and other activities
through a variety of communication channels, including
social media (Performance Goal 3.2.3). Through the
Investor Advisory Committee and other avenues, the SEC
will continue to gather information about the views and
experience of a broad spectrum of investors, which will
serve as an additional source of information concerning
investors’ priorities and perspectives on the Commission’s
regulatory agenda.

PERFORMANCE GOAL 3.2.1
Number of page views of online investor education content, and number of in-person events,
including those with specifically targeted communities and organizations
Description: The Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) initiates investor education campaigns on key strategies for making informed
investment decisions, including publicizing online resources for researching investment professionals and investments, understanding fees,
and identifying fraud. OIEA staff also participates in in-person events for investors generally and those targeted to specific investors, such
as seniors, service members, and other affinity groups. This metric tracks page views of SEC online investor education materials and the
number of investor events in which OIEA staff participated.

FY 2015 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT AND FY 2017 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN

Strategic Goal 4: Enhance the Commission’s Performance through Effective Alignment
and Management of Human, Information, and Financial Capital
The investing public and the securities markets are best
served by an efficient, well-managed, and agile SEC. In
FY 2017, the Office of the Chief Operating Officer (OCOO)
along with its six operational offices – the Office of Support
Operations (OSO), the Office of Financial Management (OFM),
the Office of Human Resources (OHR), the Office of Strategic
Initiatives (OSI), the Office of Acquisitions (OA), and the Office
of Information Technology (OIT) – will focus on providing
organizational and infrastructure improvements necessary
to effectively support the increase in the SEC’s workforce
detailed in this request and advance the Commission’s
mission. Given the immense size of the securities markets the
SEC regulates, the agency’s success in fulfilling its mission
is highly dependent upon its ability to continually direct its
resources towards the most productive uses for investors
and the public. The SEC also is extremely mindful of its
responsibility to maximize the impact of public funds.

maintain the agency’s turnover rate at well below eight
percent (Performance Goal 4.1.1). In order to improve the
SEC’s ranking in the survey of best places to work in the
Federal government (Performance Goal 4.1.4) the agency
has continued to focus on improving communications,
working constructively on key issues with the National
Treasury Employees Union, and other initiatives.

In FY 2015, approximately $300.7 million and 755 full-time
equivalents (FTEs) were directed at achieving results in Goal
4. Of 19 performance targets, the agency met or exceeded
17 and did not meet two. During FY 2017, the agency will
continue to focus on recruiting and retaining high-performing
staff, and updating the expertise of SEC employees so they
are abreast of the latest developments in the industry. Furthermore, the SEC will continue to strengthen internal controls.
The agency is requesting a total of $358.1 million and
885 FTEs in FY 2017 to achieve results in Strategic Goal 4.

In FY 2017, the SEC will continue to implement an
effective training program to deepen the expertise of
its employees in the rapidly evolving markets and the
areas of new responsibility for the agency. The training
supports employees directly involved in examinations,
investigations, fraud detection, litigation, and other core
mission responsibilities of the SEC. Such training can focus
on new trends in the securities industry and changing market
conditions, as well as analytics and forensics. It also allows
staff to obtain certain specialized financial certifications and
regulatory credentials, as well as the advanced continuing
education credits required for maintaining legal and financial
credentials (Performance Goal 4.1.2).

Strategic Objective 4.1: The SEC promotes a resultsoriented work environment that attracts, engages, and
retains a technically proficient and diverse workforce,
including leaders who provide motivation and strategic
direction.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Office of Human Resources;
Director, Office of Minority and Women Inclusion

Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
The SEC’s employees are its most vital strategic resource. In
FY 2015, the SEC continued to refine a series of programs

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
The SEC is committed to being an employer of choice by
consistently attracting, hiring, developing, and retaining
a high-quality, diverse, and results-oriented workforce.
In FY 2017, the SEC will continue to refine its programs
to enhance human capital, such as rewarding high
performance, promoting high employee satisfaction and
updating staff skills.

The SEC’s success at meeting its mission depends upon
effective leadership at all levels. From branch chiefs to
the agency’s senior leadership, the SEC’s leaders must
motivate, manage employees effectively, and play a critical
role in identifying the key areas on which staff should focus
their attention to generate the greatest benefit for investors.
Through leadership and employee development programs,
the SEC will continue to maintain a diverse group of technically
proficient leaders that can conduct their supervisory
responsibilities effectively and meet the dynamic challenges
of market oversight (Performance Goal 4.1.5).

PERFORMANCE GOAL 4.1.2
Expanding staff expertise
Description: Internal training and hiring programs are designed to help the agency recruit and develop a diverse and qualified staff with the key
skills, industry knowledge, and expertise to support the SEC mission. In particular, there is a need to train examiners, attorneys, economists,
and other experts for subject matter expertise relevant to the marketplace and investment and trading practices. This metric tracks whether
certain areas requiring significant training are being addressed. The agency will track the number of SEC staff participants in mission-focused
training and development programs and will report on specific items through the use of post-course evaluations to assess the impact and
results of this training on a five-point scale.

knowledge to perform more effectively. This improved quality will be reflected in increased post-course evaluations. At the same time, SEC
University will diversify its methods of delivery to a more blended learning approach. This will result in more learning items, at times delivered
in smaller, more focused portions, aimed at specific knowledge or skill areas.
Plan for Improving Program Performance: SEC University will work closely with internal stakeholders to identify specific learning needs, and will
revise the content of training materials and programs to better address these needs.

Strategic Objective 4.2: The SEC encourages a collaborative environment across divisions and offices and
leverages technology and data to fulfill its mission more
effectively and efficiently.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Office of Information Technology
Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
The SEC’s divisions and offices collaborate in a variety
of ways to advance the Commission’s mission. Such
coordination is critical for any organization as large and
complex as the SEC to bring together different perspectives,
decide on the best course of action, and implement that
course in the most effective way. Given the importance and
complexity of the SEC’s mission, it is imperative that the
Commission continuously improve its ability to break down
silos, share information and work jointly towards a common
purpose through enhanced information technology.
In FY 2015, the SEC continued to consolidate and centralize
its collaborative technologies to a commonly used enterprise
set and met its target of 40 percent of the SEC’s offices
and divisions utilizing enterprise collaboration solutions
(Performance Goal 4.2.2).

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
In FY 2017, information technology will continue to play
a crucial role in the mission of the SEC and its ability to
share information and data both internally and externally.
The SEC will continue to gather a wide variety of data from
corporate disclosures, equity exchange feeds, investigations
and examinations, tips, complaints, and referrals, and
commercial vendors. The SEC will continue to work to
develop systems that will allow more of this information
to be quickly shared, analyzed, and combined with other
information about the same entity or individual. These efforts
should save staff time, provide better information about the
firms the SEC regulates, and enhance the ability to uncover
hidden risks to investors (Performance Goal 4.2.2 and
Performance Goal 4.2.3).
The increasing size and complexity of the U.S. markets
require that the SEC continue to leverage technology to
improve its productivity, as well as identify and address the
most significant threats to investors and eliminate downtime
to SEC systems (Performance Goal 4.2.1).

own operations. In FY 2015 the SEC successfully received
an unqualified audit opinion with no material weaknesses
or significant deficiencies (Performance Goal 4.3.1 and
Performance Goal 4.3.2).

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
In FY 2017, the SEC will continue to maintain strong
financial management practices and robust internal
controls (Performance Goal 4.3.1). The SEC will continue
to focus on enhancing its processes and systems in its
budgeting, accounting, and internal controls over operations
(Performance Goal 4.3.2). In addition, the SEC will continue
delivering complete, concise, and meaningful information
about the financial and operating performance of the agency
that supports management decision-making.
As an agency of the Federal government entrusted with public
funds, the SEC must always strive to enhance the value for
investors it creates from every budget dollar. In FY 2017, the
SEC will continue to strive to allocate the resources approved
by Congress and the President towards the highest and best
uses for the agency’s mission (Performance Goal 4.3.3).
The SEC also constantly reevaluates its operations to identify
cost savings and maximize their benefit.
