ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS RULINGS
Release No. 3966/July 6, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-16228
In the Matter of
NAVAGATE, INC., and
GREGORY RORKE

ORDER DENYING REQUEST
FOR EXTENSION OF TIME

On October 31, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings against Respondents. This proceeding was stayed from December 4, 2014, to June 7,
2016. Navagate, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3897, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2019 (ALJ June
7, 2016).
Presently, Respondents’ answer is due July 8, 2016, and motions for summary disposition
are due July 29, 2016. Navagate Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3916, 2016 SEC LEXIS
2101 (ALJ June 14, 2016). On July 6, 2016, Respondents submitted a letter to this office
requesting an extension of thirty days on the deadline for filing an answer, and representing that the
Division of Enforcement does not object to such an extension.
Respondents’ request is DENIED. I have considered the factors recited in Rule 161
regarding extensions of time. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.161(b)(1). Although some factors weigh in
favor of granting an extension, there are two overriding concerns. First, with the requested
extension, Respondents’ answer will be due after motions for summary disposition are filed. But
Respondents must formally file an answer before the parties may properly file motions for summary
disposition. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a). Although Respondents state that they have discussed
modification of the briefing schedule with the Division, any modification to the briefing schedule
would adversely affect my ability to issue the initial decision on time. Second, requests for
extensions of time are “strongly disfavor[ed],” except where the requesting party makes a “strong
showing” that denial “would substantially prejudice their case.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.161(b)(1).
Although the outcome of Rorke’s sentencing will likely influence whatever relief the Division
requests in this proceeding, it is not clear how filing an answer in two days (rather than in one
month) will substantially prejudice Respondents.
SO ORDERED.
