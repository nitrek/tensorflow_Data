Gentlemen:

In Fiscal 1985 the Commission increased investor protections and reduced unnecessary paperwork and other expenses. ultimately borne by investors.
Fiscal 1985 highlights include:

Results: Through automation, paperwork reduction and other staff initiatives,
record results were achieved in the number of investment company, adviser
and self.regulatory organization inspections, corporate filings reviewed and
broker-dealer oversight examinations.
Since fiscal 1981, the annual volume of:
Appellate and other cases has been increased by over 35%;
Enforcement actions by over 40%;
Corporate filings reviewed by over 50%;
Broker-dealer oversight examinations by over 60%;
Self-regulatory organization inspections by over 70%; and
Investment company and adviser inspections by over 100%.

Budget: Since 1981, the Commission's budget has been increased by 33%.
which is more than for most independent agencies. Many have been reduced. In
any case, in each of the last three fiscal years, registration, transfer and other
fees have exceeded the Commission's budget. This has happened only once
before in the past 51 years. The 35 % fiscal 1985 excess amounted to over $35

million. The Commission's budget, personnel and fees are set by Congress. The
fees are remitted to the Treasury as received.
Enforcement: The 269 enforcement actions brought was less than the prior
year, due to an increase in resource intensive financial reporting cases and a
decline in delinquent filings cases against individuals. Of the enforcement actions, 20% were financial disclosure cases. A number were products of the
1982 recession and 1983 "hot new issue" market. It is during such periods that
some companies and executives are tempted to "cook the books". Actions
against brokers and other regulated entities amounted to 42 % of the cases and
insider trading 7%. The balance of the cases involved stock manipulation,
failure to file or delinquent filings of periodic reports, and internal accounting
controls and books and records deficiencies. The Commission has begun to
seek fines up to three times illegal profits under the Insider Trading Sanctions
Act, proposed by the Commission and passed last year.
Edgar: This pilot electronic disclosure system has been designed by the SEC
staff, Arthur Anderson & Co., IBM and Dow Jones. Inc. to increase the efficiency and fairness of the securities markets by accelerating dramatically the filing,
processing, dissemination and analysis of corporate information. The Edgar
system commenced on schedule in September 1984. Over 1,900 electronic filings have since been received from over 170 issuers. Participants include
AT&T, Exxon, General Motors. IBM and other major corporations, as well as
small companies, limited partnerships, mutual funds and the California,
Georgia and Wisconsin securities commissions.
Shareholder Communications: To facilitate shareholder communications,
Commission rules, approved in August 1984, required brokers to begin providing corporations with the identity of their non-objecting shareholders on
January 1, 1986. The Commission also proposed the Shareholder Comrnunication Act, requiring banks and saving and loan associations to provide such information, which was signed into law on December 28, 1985.
Certificate Immobilization: The voluntary immobilization of securities certificates through the greater use of central depositories and electronic bookentry systems will save hundreds of millions of dollars per annum of expenses
ultimately borne by investors. Even in the absence of such potential savings,
the paperwork and other problems avoided more than justify simplifying the
process. Significant progress was made by industry. In addition, the Division of
Market Regulation has conducted a series of workshops to encourage corporations, municipalities and other issuers to do their future public offerings of debt
securities in the form of single "Global Certificates"-against which investors'
interests are recorded by depositories on an electronic book-entry basis.
Government Securities: Government securities dealer failures during the
past year resulted in a number of enforcement actions, and in consultation with
the Federal Reserve Board and the Department of the Treasury, the Commission prepared and delivered to Congress in June, an in-depth study of the
government securities market. The report detailed actions taken by investors,
government dealers, Federal and state regulators to prevent future problems,
and a legislative approach, if deemed necessary by Congress.

ii

Options and Futures Study: In December 1984, the Federal Reserve, the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the SEC submitted to Congress a joint study which concluded that options and futures serve useful hedging and arbitrage purposes and do not adversely impact capital formation. New
options and futures are permitting investors to hedge stock market, foreign
currency and other risks at a fraction of the prior costs of hedging or reducing
such risks.
Marketplace Efficiency: Efforts to increase the breadth and efficiency of the
securities markets for the benefit of investors include Commission decisions to
permit each stock exchange to grant unlisted trading privileges in up to 25
over-the-counter stocks; to permit the exchanges and over-the-counter dealers
to make competitive markets in OTC options; to test competitive side-by-side
marketmaking in OTC options and stocks, through a one-year pilot; and to permit the NYSE to make markets in certain options. Effective surveillance of
these markets is an integral part of these programs. The Commission has also
required last-sale reporting for additional OTC securities and disclosure of
dealer mark-ups.
Intermarket Surveillance: At the Commission's initiative, fully functional
transaction audit trails have been implemented by the American and New York
stock exchanges. The Chicago Board Options Exchange and National Association of Securities Dealers are also making substantial progress toward such
systems, which increase investor protections and reduce transaction reconciliation costs, ultimately borne by investors.
Internationalization: The Commission approved linkage of the Boston and
Montreal stock exchanges and the American and Toronto stock exchanges.
Other major exchanges and market systems are also discussing international
linkages. Approximately 10% of the transactions on the New York Stock Exchange are now originated abroad. With a view to facilitating the international
mobility of capital and the proper surveillance of these markets, the Commission issued two concept releases, which suggested approaches and solicited
comments on ways to coordinate and improve international disclosure,
distribution, surveillance and enforcement practices. The extensive responses
and alternatives are being analyzed.
Bush Task Group: The staff drafted legislation to implement the Bush Task
Group's securities recommendations for the benefit of investors, This legislation would provide functional regulation of securities activities and consolidate
duplicative and overlapping regulatory activities.
Banks Securities Activities: Also, to facilitate functional regulation, the
Commission adopted a rule which will require banks to conduct certain
securities activities through broker-dealers registered under the Exchange Act.
The validity of the rule has been upheld in litigation, which is on appeal.
Paperwork Reduction: In order to eliminate duplicative paperwork and increase the effectiveness of regulations, the Commission developed in cooperation with the North American Association of Securities Administrators and ap-

iii

proved new broker-dealer and investment adviser "plain English" registration
forms, and simplified investment company forms.
Integrated Disclosure Program: This program is saving corporations for the
benefit of their shareholders over a billion dollars per annum of paperwork,
underwriting and interest costs-without
reducing full disclosures to the investing public. In fiscal 1985, the Commission adopted forms which cover the
registration of securities issued in business combinations and exchange offers.
Tender Offer Regulation: The Commission proposed for comment an "all
shareholder, best price" rule which would require tender offers to be made to all
shareholders and that they be paid the best price offered to any holders. The extensive comments and alternatives are being analyzed.
Agency Coordination: In order to increase investor protections, the Divisions
of Enforcement, Investment Management and Market Regulation increased the
coordination of their efforts with those of other Federal agencies, state
authorities and self-regulatory organizations through greater referrals and
follow-up efforts.
Congressional Hearings: The staff and Commissioners testified at 23 hearings on government securities, accounting, tender offers, internationalization
of the securities markets, RICO and other matters upon which legislation is
pending.
The past year's improvements in investor protections and the efficiency of the
securities markets are a tribute to the ability, dedication and enthusiasm of the
SEC staff and Commissioners, and the cooperation and support of the self.
regulatory organizations, and the business and financial communities.
Sincerely yours,

The Commission obtained court orders requiring defendants to return illicit
profits amounting to more than $17 million, either as disgorgement or restitution
to defrauded investors. The Commission also obtained freeze orders to protect
over $89 million in assets until courts could make appropriate dispositions.
The Commission referred or granted access to its files to the Department of
Justice or state prosecutorial authorities for investigation or prosecution in 145
cases during fiscal 1985. During fiscal 1985, 59 criminal indictments or informations were obtained in Commission related cases, compared with 75 in
1984. There were 93 criminal convictions in Commission related cases during
fiscal 1985, compared to 85 in 1984.

Introduction
The Commission's enforcement program seeks to preserve the integrity, efficiency and fairness of the securities markets by enforcing the Federal
securities laws. These laws provide civil and administrative remedies designed
to rectify past, and prevent future, violations.

1

Most Commission enforcement actions are preceded by a private investigation to determine whether a violation of the securities laws has occurred or is
about to. Where necessary, the Commission may order a formal investigation,
thereby authorizing the staff to issue subpoenas compelling testimony and production of documents.
Depending on results of an investigation, the Commission may authorize the
staff to commence a civil action in a United States District Court, institute an
administrative proceeding, or refer the matter to the Department of Justice for
criminal prosecution. Matters also may be referred to state or local authorities
or self-regulatory organizations for appropriate action.
The Commission's primary civil remedy is a Federal court injunction which
directs the subject to comply with the law in the future. If it is violated, contempt of court proceedings may result in imprisonment or imposition of fines.
Courts also may issue orders providing other equitable relief such as restitution, disgorgement of illicit profits, and other appropriate remedies.
The Commission is authorized to bring administrative proceedings against
regulated entities such as broker-dealers, investment companies, or investment
advisers, as well as persons associated with such entities. Where the Commission finds that a regulated entity has willfully violated the securities laws, it may
impose remedial sanctions ranging from a censure to a revocation of the
registration required for the entity to conduct business. The Commission also
may censure or limit the activities of associated persons, or suspend or bar
such persons from association.
Issuers of securities are subject to administrative proceedings if they fail to
comply with the disclosure and certain other provisions of the Exchange Act
under legislation enacted on August 10, 1984. The Commission's authority was
extended to proxy and tender offer violations under Section 14 and to individuals causing the violations. Respondents may be ordered to comply with
applicable provisions upon specified terms and conditions, or to take steps to
effect compliance. Issuers may also be named as respondents in certain proceedings authorized by the Securities Act. In addition, the Commission may
publish reports of investigation under Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act.
Criminal sanctions for Federal securities law violations include fines and imprisonment for up to five years for each violation. The Commission has
developed close working relationships with the Department of Justice and U.S.
Attorneys' offices to assist the investigation and prosecution of such cases. The
Commission also cooperates closely with state securities regulators and self.
regulatory organizations, including the National Association of Securities
Dealers (NASD) and the various national securities exchanges.

Program Areas
The Commission investigates and brings enforcement actions to remedy a
broad range of violations. Enforcement activity during fiscal 1985 included
cases concerning corporate reporting and accountlnq;' insider tradinq:" violations by regulated entities and associated persons:" market rnenlpulations:"
securities offerings:" changes in corporate control:" related party transactions:"
and delinquent filing cases against issuers."

Corporate Reporting and Accounting-Financial
disclosure cases continued
to be a high priority in fiscal 1985. During fiscal 1985, the Commission brought
42 cases containing significant allegations of financial disclosure violations
against issuers or their employees, compared with 33 such cases in 1984 and
25 in 1983. The Commission also brought 14 cases alleging misconduct on the
part of accounting firms or their partners or employees in fiscal 1985, including
two of the issuer disclosure cases set forth above." There were 18 enforcement
actions against accountants or accounting firms in 1984 and 11 in 1983.
Typical financial disclosure cases involve improper valuation of assets or
liabilities; improper recognition of revenue or income; failure to establish sufficient provisions for bad debts or other contingencies, or failure to provide adequate disclosure concerning the issuer's true financial position. Many of these
cases also involve violations of accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act. Financial disclosure cases are often complex, requiring more
resources than other types of cases, but effective prosecution of them is essential to preserving the integrity of the disclosure system.
In one administrative proceeding, the Commission found that an issuer had
engaged in "opinion shopping" to find an accounting firm that would allow it to
recognize immediately the revenue associated with a real estate transaction. 10
In another case, the Commission alleged that an issuer had "managed" its earnings by creating unnecessary reserves during periods when earnings exceeded
projections, and then releasing those reserves in later periods when the issuer's
actual earnings were lower than projected. 1 1
Financial disclosure cases may also involve misconduct on the part of independent accountants who examine and issue an opinion on the issuer's financial statements. In one case, the Commission alleged that an accounting firm
had failed to follow generally accepted auditing standards in its examination
and report on financial statements which allegedly overstated the issuer's pretax results of operations by at least $22 million. 12 In another case, the Commission alleged that a partner of an accounting firm lacked independence because
he had accepted at least $125,000 from the principals of a government
securities firm in connection with the issuance of an unqualified opinion on that
firm's financial statements.'?
In addition to financial disclosure cases, the Commission brought two cases
involving misrepresentation or failure to disclose information concerning
related-party transactions, the compensation of officers, or other matters during fiscal 1985. The Commission also brought 19 delinquent filing actions
against issuers during the fiscal year, compared with 15 in fiscal 1984.
Insider Trading-Individuals who purchase or sell securities while in possession of material, nonpublic information relating to such securities, in violation
of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence, undermine the
expectation of fairness and honesty that is the basis of investor confidence in
the nation's securities markets. Trading of standardized options contracts,
coupled with tender offers and other acquisitions, has increased opportunities
for those with material non-public information to reap large profits. The Commission brought 20 insider trading cases in fiscal 1985, compared with 13 in
fiscal 1984.

3

The Commission obtained $2 million in disgorgement in insider trading
cases brought or settled during fiscal 1985. The Commission also began to use
its authority, provided by enactment of the Insider Trading Sanctions Act in
August 1984, to seek imposition of a civil penalty of up to three times the profit
gained or loss avoided by any person who buys or sells securities while in
possession of material, nonpublic information. The Commission filed two injunctive actions seeking the imposition of civil penalties during fiscal 1985.
The defendants in those actions consented to the imposition of penalties
amounting to $158,492, in addition to disgorging their profits."
An increasing number of Commission insider trading cases have resulted in
criminal prosecutions. During fiscal 1985, for example, 17 individuals who
were defendants in Commission actions received criminal sentences. In one
case, the manager of office services at a law firm was sentenced to three and a
half years imprisonment plus five years probation after pleading guilty to an in.
dictment charging him with having tipped other defendents about prospective
mergers or tender offers involving clients of the law firm.P ln another case, two
individuals were sentenced to four years imprisonment after pleading guilty to
an information charging them with obstruction of justice during the Commission's insider trading investlqation.!"
Regulated Entities and Associated Persons- The enforcement program area
that accounts for the largest number of cases involves regulated entities such
as broker-dealers, investment companies, investment advisers and transfer
agents. As the securities markets grow and more individuals come into contact
with the financial services industry, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that regulated entities conduct their business with integrity and fairness.
The Commission commenced 120 enforcement proceedings involving
regulated entities during fiscal 1985. Twelve cases involved securities offering
violations by regulated entities. Of the other cases, 79 primarily involved
broker-dealers or persons associated with broker-dealers, 19 investment advisers, 2 investment companies and 2 concerned transfer agents. The total includes 6 actions in which customers or employees were alleged to have
defrauded a regulated entity.
The broker-dealer cases involved, among other things, fraudulent sales practices, violations of net capital and customer reserve provisions, and books and
records violations. Among the cases brought by the Commission in this area
was an administrative proceeding in which the Commission found that a
broker-dealer firm had wrongfully used customers' fully-paid securities in its
stock loan business. The Commission censured the firm, and ordered it to comply with its undertakings to establish procedures governing its stock loan
business and to make a contribution to Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) of an amount equal to ten days' profit from its stock loan
operations." The Commission also brought two administrative proceedings in
which it alleged that national broker-dealer firms had failed to exercise
reasonable supervision over one or more employees subject to their supervision who had engaged in sales practice violations. The firms in those cases
were censured and ordered to comply with undertakings designed to deter a
recurrence of the violations. 18

4

During fiscal 1985, the Commission revoked the registration of 3 firms,
suspended 7 and censured 16. This compares with 12 revocations. 10 suspensions, and 14 censures in fiscal 1984.
Also during the year, 47 individuals were barred, 49 suspended, and 4 censured, as compared to 43 bars, 40 suspensions, and 8 censures during fiscal
1984.
On five occasions during fiscal 1985, the Commission brought emergency
actions to freeze assets and prohibit further violations by firms which con.
ducted transactions in the government securities markets. In four of those actions, the Commission alleged that the firms had violated the antifraud provisions in connection with purchase and repurchase agreements involving
government securities." In the other action, the Commission alleged that the
firm had violated the net capital provisions as a result of losses from transactions in the government securities markets."
Securities Offering Violations-Some issuers fail to register public offerings
of their securities, although required to do so by the Securities Act. Some
purport to rely on exemptions to registration requirements which are not
available. Some violate anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities laws by
making material misrepresentations or omissions in connection with a
securities offering.
There were 49 cases principally involving offering violations by issuers and
other persons brought during 1985, 48 in 1984 and 41 in 1983. (These figures
do not include 12 cases principally involving offering violations on the part of
regulated entities; see "Regulated Entities and Associated Persons.")
In one securities offering case, the Commission alleged that the defendants
had raised more than $55 million by selling unregistered securities in the
form of investment contracts in a commodities arbitrage trading program
which promised annual returns of up to 41.5%. The Commission obtained a
temporary restraining order against further violations of the registration and
antifraud provisions, the appointment of a receiver, and an order freezing approximately $25 million of investors' funds pending an appropriate judicial

dlsposltion."
In another case (filed during fiscal 1984), the Commission obtained an
order requiring the operator of an alleged Ponzi scheme to disgorge $8.2
million to investors.P The defendant in that action was also sentenced to 99
years imprisonment in a related criminal proceeding.
Market Manipulation-The
Commission is charged with ensuring the integrity of trading on the national securities exchanges and in the over-the.
counter markets. The Commission's staff, the exchanges and the National
Association of Securities Dealers engage in surveillance of these markets.
The Commission brought seven cases involving market manipulation during
fiscal 1985, 12 in fiscal 1984 and 11 in 1983.
Among the cases brought by the Commission in this area was one in which
it alleged that the defendants had manipulated the price of an issuer's common stock by generating apparent trading activity, by dominating the
market, and by issuing false statements about the issuer's oil and gas pro.
spects. Allegedly as a result of these activities, the price of the issuer's stock
increased from $1.10 to $27 per share, after a two. for-one stock split, during

5

an eleven-month

period in which the issuer had almost

no reported

earninqs."
Changes

in Corporate Control-Sections
13 and 14 of the Exchange Act
govern proxy solicitations and the filing of reports by persons or groups who
make a tender offer or acquire beneficial ownership of more than 5% of a class
of equity securities registered with the Commission. These requirements are intended to ensure that investors have the material information needed to make
informed investment or voting decisions concerning potential changes in the
control of a corporation. During fiscal 1985, five enforcement actions were
brought in this area while 11 were brought in 1984 and 5 were commenced in
1983.
In one case, the Commission found that a corporation, after disclosing the
acquisition of 11.1 % of another corporation's common stock and stating that
the purchases had been made to acquire "a significant investment position" in
the issuer, violated the disclosure provisions by failing to disclose promptly that
it had started selling its holdings in the issuer. As part of settlement, the corporation undertook to maintain a liquidating trust of at least $2.2 million in
profits to provide for potential claims by investors who are able to prove that
they would be harmed by the corporation's sales of the issuer's stock."
In another case, the Commission issued a report of investigation in which it
expressed the view that an issuer may have violated the antifraud provisions by
stating that there were no corporate developments to account for unusual
market activity in the issuer's securities, when in fact merger discussions with
another company were taking place at the time the statement was made. The
report emphasized that, where an issuer makes a public statement regarding
rumors, unusual market activity, or corporate developments, that statement
"must be materially accurate and complete." The report also stated that, in appropriate circumstances, an issuer may decline to comment in response to inquiries regarding unusual market activity or rumors."

Other Developments
Transnational Securities Issues-In July 1984, the Commission issued a concept release requesting comments on a concept to address problems in investigations and enforcement actions involving persons who purchase or sell
securities in the U.S. markets from foreign countries, particularly when such
transactions are effected through institutions in nations with secrecy laws.26
Under the "waiver by conduct" concept, the purchase or sale of securities in the
U.S. would constitute an implied consent to disclosure of information and
evidence relevant to the transaction for purposes of any Commission investigation, administrative proceeding or action for injunctive relief authorized by the
federal securities laws that may arise out of the transaction.
The Commission received 65 letters of comment in response. Approximately half were submitted by foreign governments, business associations or banks.
Virtually all commentators agreed that the importance of enforcing transnational securities law violations calls for a prompt resolution of existing problems. However, only six endorsed a legislative enactment of the "waiver by conduct" concept. The great majority urged the Commission to pursue bilateral
and multilateral negotiations with other governments.
The Commission continued to discuss issues relating to transnational
securities violations with officials of other governments. The Division of En.

6

forcement also created an Office of International Legal Assistance to serve as a
liaison on enforcement matters with officials of other governments.
Sourcesfor Further Inquiry- The Commission publishes in the SEC Docket
litigation releases which describe its civil injunctive actions and criminal proceedings involving securities-related violations. Among other things, these
releases report the violative conduct that is either alleged by the Commission
or the Department of Justice or found by the court, and the disposition or
status of the case. The Commission also publishes orders that institute administrative proceedings or provide remedial relief in the SEC Docket.
Enforcement actions brought during fiscal 1985 are listed in the Appendix to
this report with appropriate references to the releases and orders published in
the SEC Docket.

Full Disclosure System
Key 1985 Results
The full disclosure system is administered by the Division of Corporation
Finance. The disclosure system is designed to provide investors with full and
accurate material information, foster investor confidence, contribute to the
maintenance of fair and orderly markets, facilitate capital formation and inhibite fraud in the public trading, voting, purchase and sale of securities.

In fiscal year 1985, about 11,000 publicly-held concerns made 71,663 full
disclosure filings with the Commission, an increase of 8.4 % over fiscal 1984.
Of these 1,619, or 1.4%, were made through the Edgar system. Filings given a
full review continued to reach record levels. The staff reviewed 1,111 first-time
registration statements and 1,214 major repeat registration statements filed
under the Securities Act of 1933. During the year 2,135 or 21.7% of the Form
10-K annual reports filed were fully reviewed, representing a 66% increase over
1984. Approximately 1,683 annual meeting proxy statements were fully
reviewed. an increase of 38.3 % over 1984. All proxy statements with antitakeover provisions (369 this year) are fully reviewed. Proxy contest filings increased 43.3% over 1984 (60 vs. 86), all of which were fully reviewed.
In fiscal 1985, 148 tender offer schedules were filed (22.3 % more than in 1984),
of which 100% were fully reviewed.

Operations
Edgar and Computer-Assisted Review-Since 1980, the staff has increasingly
used computers to screen filings to identify those which present significant
disclosure issues, to facilitate review and as a managerial tool.
The first Edgar electronic filings were received on September 24, 1984. During FY 1985, over 1,619 live electronic filings were received and processed by
the Edgar pilot branch in the Division of Corporation Finance. The filings were
submitted by registrants who volunteered for the pilot and are taking advantage of the more efficient processing for electronic submissions.
For a more in-depth discussion of the pilot and the operational Edgar
system, see page 19.

Rulemaking
The Proxy Review Program-On April 23, 1985, the Commission adopted a
new form to be used to register securities under the Securities Act in connection with certain business combination transactions." The new form, Form S-4,
replaces Forms S.15 and S-14 (Form S.14 remains in effect, however, for use
by certain registered investment companies until the adoption of Form N-14).
Form S-4 addresses disclosure needs in mergers and exchange offers byapplying the principles of integrated disclosure, including the three-tiered registration system and incorporation by reference. A comparable form, F-4, was also
adopted for business combination transactions involving foreign private companies." These new forms improve the effectiveness of the prospectus for
business combinations by requiring the information to be presented in a more
meaningful and accessible format. The forms provide both transactional and
voting information so that they function as both registration and proxy
statements.
On July 1, 1985, the Commission issued three releases requesting comments on proposals emanating from the comprehensive proxy review pro.
gram. The first release proposes to update proxy rules to reflect current
practice, administrative policy, new laws and changes in other Commission rules as well as to enhance investor protection, particularly regarding
disclosure about accountants.P They would clarify and simplify proxy
disclosure by applying the principles underlying the integrated disclosure
system to proxy statements. The second release proposes for comment a
rule specifying filing fees for certain Exchange Act business comb inations.:'? This proposal is based upon the Commission's experience with the
new fee structure established by the 1983 amendments to the Exchange
Act, and would codify and provide guidance concerning those fees. The
third release is related to specific rule proposals in the comprehensive
proxy review project dealing with disclosure concerning changes in and
disagreements with accountants." It is a concept release responsive to
general concerns about independent public auditors and the practice of
"opinion shopping."
Also, on July 23, 1985 the House passed H.R. 1603, the Shareholder Communications Act of 1985, legislation proposed by the Commission to amend
Section 14(b) of the Exchange Act. This legislation, based on the report issued

10

by the Commission's Advisory Committee on Shareholder Communications in
1982, would authorize the Commission to regulate the proxy processing activities of banks, associations and other entities that exercise fiduciary powers,
in much the same manner that the Commission currently regulates the activities of broker-dealers.
Tender Offers-On July 1, 1985 the Commission published two releases,one
addressing third-party tender offers" and the other addressing issuer tender of-

fers."
The proposals would codify the Commission's position concerning equal
treatment of security holders in tender offers. Specifically, they would require
that certain tender offers be open to all security holders of the class of securities
subject to the offer and that all security holders in such tender offers be paid the
highest consideration offered to any security holder at any time during the offer. The comment period on the proposals closed on September 9, 1985.
Public comments on the Commission's concept release published on June
21, 1984 concerning two-tier tender offer pricing and non-tender offer purchase
programs>' were reviewed by the Commission, and copies of the Summary of
Comments were submitted to members of the House Subcommittee on
Telecommunications, Consumer Protection and Finance and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce in November, 1984.
lntemationalization- To provide a context for public comment on internationalization, the Commission published, on February 28, 1985, a release containing two conceptual approaches to facilitate multinational securities offerings: the reciprocal approach and the common prospectus approach." The
reciprocal approach would require participating countries to adopt a system
providing that an offering document used by the issuer in its own country
would be accepted for offerings in each of the other participating countries,
assuming certain minimum standards are met. The common prospectus approach would require all participating countries to agree on disclosure standards for an offering document which then could be used in any of the countries. Under either approach, the same liability provisions of the Federal
securities laws would apply to foreign issuers as apply to domestic issuers.

Interpretations
The Division provides views on exemptions and disclosure requirements to
assist filers and other parties. Advice is provided through no-action and inter.
pretive letters that apply securities laws to specific situations, through interpretive releasesthat furnish guidance on general interest matters, and through
exemptive orders. In fiscal year 1985, 1,200 requests for no-action letters and
written interpretive advice were fulfilled.

Conferences
SEC Govemment-Business
Forum On Small Business Capital Formation- The fourth annual SEC Government-Business
Forum on Small
Business Capital Formation was conducted in Washington, D.C. on
September 12-14, 1985. Approximately 150 small business executives, ac-

11

countants, attorneys, financial analysts, broker-dealers, venture capital investors, financial advisors, bankers and government officials met to discuss
issue papers containing recommendations on taxes and securities.
Background on these issues was provided to participants by means of two
panels featuring leading members of the tax and securities communities.
The Forum is conducted under the Small Business Investment Incentive Act
of 1980 in which Congress directed the Commission to conduct an annual
Government-Business
Forum "to review the current status of problems
and programs relating to small business capital formation" and to include
as participants other Federal agencies and leading small business and professional organizations concerned with capital formation.
SECINASAA Cooperation-In
February, 1985, approximately 35 senior
Commission staff members met with representatives of the North American
Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) in Williamsburg, Virginia
to discuss methods of cooperating in securities matters in order to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of both Federal and state securities regulation. Further coordination of the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption
(ULOE) with Regulation D under the Securities Act was a primary matter of
discussion.

Accounting

and AUditing Matters

The Federal securities laws provide for the audit of financial statements
of publicly held corporations by independent accountants. Thus, those
laws have placed upon the accountant important responsibilities in
facilitating the capital formation processes, and as a result, the economy
as a whole.
Today, the accounting profession is subject to a unique combination of
public and private sector initiatives that is designed to ensure that the profession meets its public responsibilities. These initiatives include peer
review and other membership requirements of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) Division for CPA Firms, private sector standards-setting, the Commission's programs (including active oversight), state licensing activities and private civil litigation against accounting firms. This framework has been built over time and is subject to continued refinements and improvements.
The primary Commission programs for ensuring compliance with the
accounting and financial disclosure aspects of Federal securities laws are:

â€¢ RuLemaking initiatives which supplement accounting standards, implement financial disclosures and establish independence criteria for
accountants;
â€¢ The review and comment process which results in improvement of filings, identification of emerging accounting issues (which can result
in rulemaking or private sector standards-setting), and identification
of problems warranting enforcement actions;
â€¢ The enforcement program, which imposes legal sanctions and serves
to deter irregularities by enhancing the care with which registrants
and their accountants analyze accounting issues; and

12

of private sector efforts to establish accounting and
auditing standards, and to improve the quality of audit practice.

â€¢ Oversight

The Commission's direct efforts are multiplied by the efforts of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the AICPA and the other
activities of the profession under Commission oversight. In addition to
Commission enforcement
actions, significant numbers of actions are
brought by private litigants, many of which are a direct result of Commission actions.
The cumulative effect of the Commission's programs, private sector initiatives and civil litigation comprises a comprehensive system under
which the integrity of financial reporting for public companies is constantly being challenged, modified and improved.
The Commission's review and comment process and enforcement programs are discussed elsewhere in this report. The remainder of this section
summarizes the Commission's accounting-related
rules and interpretations and the oversight function."

Accounting-Related

Rules and Interpretations

Regulation SoX provides guidance as to the form and content of financial statements filed with the Commission. The Commission has also
adopted various rules that specify disclosure of financial information outside of the financial statements.
For example, certain supplementary
financial information, selected financial data and a management's discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition and results of
operations are required by Regulation S-K.
To address significant accounting issues, the Commission may issue interpretive releases and, when announcing rule changes, provide guidance
for compliance with new or amended rules. In addition, the Commission
staff periodically issues Staff Accounting Bulletins (SABs) to inform the
financial community of its views on accounting and disclosure issues. For
example, in March 1985, a SAB was issued on appropriate accounting
practices under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory method."
In
September 1985, a SAB was issued to clarify the staffs position on situations where investments in noncurrent marketable equity securities may
have to be written down."
Recent rulemaking initiatives have shown the Commission's desire to
upgrade financial and accounting disclosures and, at the same time,
simplify that disclosure. During the past year the Commission adopted
final rules and a related guide calling for increased disclosures about loss
reserves by property-casualty
lnsurers.P? The Commission also adopted
amendments to correct and clarify its accounting-related
rules,"? and proposed other amendments to rescind obsolete or duplicative rules." Additionally, the Commission recently proposed an amendment to its rules
dealing with the presentation of consolidated financial statements in Commission filings.42
13

In June 1985, the Commission proposed to require disclosure in certain
circumstances of the nature and extent of a registrant's repurchase and
reverse repurchase transactions and the degree of risk involved in such
transactlons.P This action was in response to recent developments in the
government securities market and occurred in connection with several
private sector initiatives. For example, a special task force of the Auditing
Standards Board (ASB) recently published a comprehensive report containing guidance on repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions and
several recommendations, including increased disclosure in this area.v'
The AICPA's Accounting Standards Executive Committee (AcSEC) and
the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) also have initiatives dealing with "repos."
In the release proposing the above amendments, the Commission noted
that it has monitored the growing array of complex financial instruments
that have been introduced in the marketplace. Some of these instruments
raise accounting and disclosure issues. The Commission believes that it is
essential to address the broad areas of disclosure and accounting for financial assets and transactions on a comprehensive basis as expeditiously as
possible. Consequently, it has initiated a project to consider the need for
additional rulemaking or other guidance in this area to ensure that investors are provided with full and fair disclosure about financial assets and
transactions. The Commission, therefore, requested comments (particularly from users of financial statements) as to the adequacy of accounting and financial reporting in this area. Specific comment was requested
on which types of financial transactions and instruments may need to be
addressed (e.g., interest rate swaps, securitized assets and sale of assets
with "put" arrangements) and suggestions were invited as to how they
should best be addressed. Comment was also requested on the need for,
and nature of, market value disclosure for certain financial assets.
Finally, the Commission believes that there are broad-based accounting
measurement and recognition issues involved in repurchase and reverse
repurchase and other financial instrument transactions that may best be
addressed by the private-sector standards setters. Therefore, recognizing
that these issues affect SEC registrants as well as other entities (including
publicly held banks and savings and loans that report to other government
agencies), the Commission authorized the Chief Accountant to send a letter to the FASB recommending that the FASB add a project to its agenda
to deal with the accounting issues involved in the broad area of financial
assets and transactions.
In addition to requiring financial disclosure about a particular
registrant, the Commission's rules address the qualifications of accountants, including their independence and accountants' reports on financial
statements, and require disclosure about a registrant's independent accountants. In July 1985. the Commission proposed to require additional
disclosure related to independent public accountants in proxy statments
and certain other filings.45 The proposed changes would improve investor
protection by enhancing disclosure in two areas.
The first change would require registrants to disclose whether their independent auditors are members of a voluntary professional organization
which has both a peer review program and an independent oversight function, both of which are subject to review by the Commission. If the auditor
is a member of such an organization, a statement would be made as to

14

whether the auditor has had such a review and, if so, the date of the most
recent peer review report.
Disclosure of membership in a professional organization (such as the
SEC Practice Section [SECPS) of the AICPA's Division for CPA firms) and
whether or not the firm has had such a review would be relevant to an investor's understanding of the auditor's commitment to quality of practice.
The Commission recognizes that, since peer reviews examine only a sample of the firm's engagments, they are not a guarantee that a firm will perform all future engagements in accordance with professional standards.
Nonetheless, the Commission believes that a peer review function is an
important element of a voluntary program to maintain and improve quality controls.
The second proposed change relates to the requirement to disclose
whether a disagreement with the prior accountant over accounting principles has occurred in connection with a change of accountants. This
change would not affect registrants who were reporting under the Exchange Act at the time the change in accountants occurred. However, it
would enhance investor protection by requiring disclosure in initial public
offering documents, and in filings under the Exchange Act by registrants
who were not subject to Form 8-K46 filing requirements at the time the
change occurred, to include the same disclosure that is presently required
only if there is a Form 8-K obligation at the time of the change.
In addition to the proposed changes discussed above, the Commission's
concerns about the manner and circumstances
in which companies
change accountants, the impact of such changes on the integrity of the
financial statements, and the adequacy of disclosure about "opinion shopping" were reflected in the issuance of a separate concept release." That
release requested comments on the practice of registrants who seek an
auditor willing to support a proposed accounting treatment which is intended to accomplish the registrant's reporting objective, but which is not
necessarily in accordance with GAAP. The Commission also requested
comments on the most practical, cost-effective manner of obtaining better
public disclosure about "opinion shopping."

Oversight of Private Sector Standards-Setting
In addition to its direct action through rulemaking and other programs,
the Commission monitors the structure, activity, and decisions of the
private sector standards-setting
organizations.
FASB-Although
the Commission has adopted Regulation SoX, promulgated other rules and disclosure requirements in the financial reporting area, and has published interpretations
and guidance where
necessary, it has generally refrained from prescribing the accounting
methods to be followed in the preparation of financial statements.
In lieu of specifying accounting principles, the Commission has presumed financial statements to be misleading or inaccurate unless prepared in
accordance
with accounting
principles
which have substantial
authoritative support. Under this concept, the Commission looks to the
FASB to provide the initiative in establishing and improving accounting
principles. Oversight of the process involves not only Commission review
of the standards set, but also the direct participation of staff members and,

15

in some instances, the Commission itself in the initial setting of standards.
Staff members monitor developments closely and are in frequent contact
with the FASB, participate in meetings, public hearings, and task forces.
The Commission monitors progress of FASB projects and meets
periodically with the FASB to discuss topical issues.
When the staff identifies and resolves specific registrant accounting problems in the review process, such problems are often referred to the FASB
for consideration if they appear to be emerging accounting problems. In
the past year these referrals have resulted in the FASB issuing a standard
to clarify the accounting for induced conversions of convertible debt and
proposing a technical bulletin on accounting for certain aspects of
business comblnations.:" Both of these issues surfaced in the Commission's review process. As discussed previously, the Commission has
recently referred to the FASB a project on the broad area of financial
assets and transactions. Other significant developments during the past
year and current agenda items are discussed below.
Timely Financial Reporting Guidance-The
Commission has encouraged
the FASB to provide more timely guidance on emerging issues and is supportive of recent initiatives in this area: (a) broadening the scope of FASB
technical bulletins (issued by the FASB staff without formal deliberations
by FASB members and without the entire due process procedures required
of FASB statements or interpretations), and (b) establishing an Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF) to assist the FASB in identifying and often resolving emerging accounting and reporting issues.
During the past year the FASB has used these new procedures to provide timely guidance on a number of occasions. For example, accounting
guidance for a special dividend of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation preferred stock to financial institutions who are members of the
Federal Home Loan Bank system was issued in an unprecedented time of
three weeks."
The Commission's Chief Accountant is a participant in the EITF which is
composed of accounting practitioners and representatives of major
associations of preparers, such as the Financial Executives Institute and
the National Association of Accountants.
The Emerging Issues Task Force now has over one year of experience.
The results of the EITF so far are encouraging. The Task Force has
discussed over 75 issues since its inaugural meeting in July 1984. Predictably, the types of issues discussed have been relatively narrow in focus
and have involved issues such as Government National Mortgage Association "dollar rolls," instantaneous in-substance defeasance, unique financing transactions such as debt payable in common stock, and a host of
issues relating to financial instruments and financial institutions. On many
issues, the group reached a consensus that either (i) a single method of accounting is preferable based on existing literature, (ii) existing guidance is
adequate, or (iii) the issue does not present a pervasive problem. Other
issues have been referred to the FASB or the AICPA for action or further
consideration. The Commission expects the positions agreed upon at
those meetings to be followed by registrants; those that do not follow
them will be asked to justify departure from consensuses reached.
Accounting for Pensions-The
FASB's current project on pensions may
result in significant changes ir.. the way companies account for, and
disclose information relating to, employee pension obligations. The FASB

16

has issued two related exposure drafts and held public hearings in July and
August on this project. The exposure drafts have generated interest and
controversy in the business community. The FASB is making every effort
to complete this project in calendar 1985.
Consolidations-The
FASB project on consolidations is dealing with a
fundamental question-in
what circumstances should the financial
statements of investee entities be combined with those of the reporting entity. During 1985 the FASB staff has been meeting with an advisory task
force and expects to expose for comment, a discussion document with tentative conclusions this year. The Commission believes that determinations
to be made in the project are important ones and should help resolve many
of the important accounting issues encountered by registrants and their
accountants.
Other Projects-Last year the FASB issued standards on accounting for
induced conversions of convertible debt, disclosure of employee
postretirement benefits, and computer software development costs,
among others. Other important items on the FASB's technical agenda include cash flow reporting, accounting for income taxes, employee stock
compensation plans, as well as important accounting issues for the insurance and utility industries.

Oversight of The Accounting
Profession' s Initiatives
In addition to oversight of the private sector process for setting accounting standards, the Commission also oversees various activities of the accounting profession conducted primarily through the AICPA. These include the Auditing Standards Board, which establishes generally accepted
auditing standards; the Accounting Standards Executive Committee,
which provides guidance on specific industry practices and prepares
issues papers on accounting topics for consideration by the FASB; and the
Division for CPA Firms, which seeks to improve the quality of accounting
firms through various membership requirements including peer review.
During the past year, the accounting profession has undertaken a
number of initiatives designed to improve the quality of independent
audits. These initiatives include: (1) reconsideration of existing auditing
guidance in areas such as the auditor's responsibility for the detection and
reporting of fraud, auditing repurchase transactions, loan loss reserves,
related party transactions, and uncertainties and contingencies; (2) consideration of a revised code of ethics; and (3) sponsorship, along with other
organizations. of the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial
Reporting, an independent commission to study the detection and prevention of fraud in the context of financial reporting. The Commission strongly supports these and other initiatives to maintain and enhance the integrity of financial reporting.
SEC Practice Section (SECPS)- The Commission oversees the activities
of the SECPS through frequent contact with the Public Oversight Board
(POB) and members of the executive and peer review committees of the
SECPS. In addition, the staff reviews POB files and selected working
papers of the peer reviewers. The Commission believes the peer review
process contributes significantly
to Ifmproving quality controls of
members and thus should enhance the consistency and quality of practice

17

before the Commission. According to the POB's Annual Report as of June

30, 1985, 403 firms have voluntarily become members of the SECPS, including all firms with 30 or more SEC-reporting clients."?
The peer review process continues to evolve. During the current year the
following initiatives (some of which were suggested by the Commission,
by the POB or in the report of a Special Committee on the review and
structure of the SECPS)51were effected or underway: (1) membership requirements have been revised so that concurring partner review, audit
partner rotation, etc. will be required for certain banks and other lending
institutions and sponsors or managements of investment funds even
though they may not be SEC registrants; (2) additional guidance to improve the uniformity in reporting peer review results is being considered;
(3) the scope of the review by the second partner has been clarified; and (4)
consideration is being given to a requirement for member firms to adopt a
code of conduct, compliance with which should be tested during peer
reviews. The Commission strongly encourages continuing refinements in
the program and its staff will continue to suggest modifications where appropriate.
Special Investigations Committee-Activities
of the Special Investigations Committee (SIC) supplement peer review. They determine whether
allegations of failure in the conduct of an audit indicate need for improvements in, or compliance with, quality control systems of the reporting firms or whether changes in professional standards are required. If
specific members of the firm's professional staff may have failed to follow
established policies and procedures, the SIC considers whether corrective
action taken by the firm is appropriate.
The POB monitors the activities of the SIC and has complete access to
the process and to SIC files. In its 1984-85 Annual Report, the POB concludes that the SIC has effective operational procedures and that the Committee's decisions are well-reasoned and in the interest of the public and
the profession."
During the past year, the SECPS has: (1) expanded the requirement for
reporting cases to the SIC to include entities that are not SEC registrants
but where there is, nonetheless, a "significant public interest;" (2) issued a
public report on the activities of the SIC;53and (3) initiated discussions
with the SEC staff concerning arrangments for SEC access to the SIC's
process to enable the SEC to effectively oversee this aspect of the profession's program.
The Commission is encouraged by these initiatives. The ultimate test,
however, is the extent to which the SECPS is able to achieve sufficient
public credibility in this area.

The Edgar Project
Introduction
The Commission began the Edgar pilot electronic disclosure system in 1983.
(Edgar stood for Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval.) Edgar is intended to increase the efficiency and fairness of the nation's securities markets
by accelerating dramatically the filing, processing, dissemination and analysis
of corporate information. As such information is filed with the Commission,
Edgar will afford investors, securities analysts and others instant access on
home and office computer screens.
Telecommunication technology has enabled the securities industry to move
from 20 million to 100 million share trading days without incident and to accommodate global trading in so-called "world class" securities. However, the
filing and dissemination of corporate information has not changed significantly
in 50 years. Edgar is the next step in the application of telecommunications
technology to dissemination of information vital to the securities markets.
Benefits anticipated from Edgar are:
â€¢ Increasing the efficiency and fairness of the securities markets by affording investors, securities analysts and others equal access to corporate in.
formation;
â€¢ Accelerating corporations' access to the capital markets;
â€¢ Accelerating the dissemination of corporations' information to investors;
â€¢ Enhancing the state securities commissions' regulatory activities and the
self. regulatory organizations' marketplace surveillance capabilities;
â€¢ Accelerating the Commission's ability to process and analyze corporate
filings more efficiently at computer work stations; and
â€¢ Reducing errors and other costs by eliminating the frequent need to
transfer data manually from one format to another.
Work on the Edgar project has been under way at the Commission for almost
three years. In February 1983, Chairman Shad formed a task force of key Com.
mission personnel to study means of increasing Commission productivity and
the feasibility of an electronic filing system. In April 1983, the Commission
published a release for an experimental "paperless" electronic filing, storage
and retrieval system. Over twenty written responses were received. Meetings
were held with interested vendors, It was concluded that a number of significant
questions needed to be explored, but that a paperless filing system was
technically feasible.
In September 1983, the Commission engaged the MITRE Corporation, a
private not-for-profit organization. MITRE was assisting the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office on a several hundred million dollar computerized patent
library. The knowledge gained from that project was readily transferable to
Edgar.
Once satisfied that an electronic disclosure system was feasible, using ex.
isting technology and hardware, a pilot operation was initiated to test various

19

approaches and technology. By November 1983, the staff had developed the
configuration of the pilot Edgar system. In January 1984, bids were solicited.
Onsite inspections and interviews were conducted by the Commission staff
with four bidders. In May 1984, a contract for development and operation of a
two-year pilot was awarded to Arthur Andersen and Company. The pilot accepted its first electronic filing on September 24, 1984, on schedule.

The Edgar Pilot
In developing the pilot Edgar system, it was determined to begin with the filings of a small number of volunteer companies. Additional volunteers would be
added over the two-year life of the pilot.
To obtain indications of interest in participating in the pilot, the Commission
published a release in March 1984, discussing the system. It requested that interested companies complete a questionnaire regarding their computer
capabilities and invited comments from securities analysts, other potential
users, registrants, and others regarding estimated benefits and costs of the
system, including how the information would be used. Over 300 responses
were received. The staff contacted interested companies in August 1984, and
discussed the mechanics of participating in the pilot.
Over 170 companies are now participating in the pilot. They represent a
broad cross-section of registrants, ranging from AT&T, Exxon, General Motors,
IBM and other major industrial, utility and financial corporations to small com.
panies and limited partnerships. (Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, investment companies began test filings on the Edgar project, with a goal of
becoming full participants during the coming year.)
The Commission's experience with the pilot and that of the volunteer com.
panies has been highly successful. The Commission has received over 1,700 filings (1,619 from issuers, the remainder from public utility holding companies).
Filings are accepted in three different electronic media: (1) direct transmissions over telephone lines or two public networks using a number of different
communication protocols (47 percent); (2) diskettes prepared on over eightyfive different types of word processors or personal computers (49 percent); and
(3) magnetic tapes (4 percent). Accepting this wide variety of media keeps the
participation costs low for registrants by permitting them to use their existing
equipment. Although this was one of the most technically difficult aspects of
developing the system, it has worked very well in practice.
Under the pilot, as will be the case in the operational system, the contractor
manages the receipt function under the supervision and direction of Commission staff. The contractor does not decide whether to accept or reject filings.
These decisions are made by Commission personnel, as is the case with paper
filings.
Electronic dissemination to the public under the pilot is through computer
terminals in the Commission's Public Reference Rooms in Washington,
Chicago and New York, and its press room in Washington. In addition,
computer-generated microfiche is produced overnight. Microfiche of electronic
filings is thereby produced 14 to 20 days faster than for paper filings.

20

Electronic filings are processed by a new pilot branch in the Division of Corporation Finance, staffed by experienced Commission personnel who
volunteered to work on Edgar and are actively involved in its development.
These staff members process the filings at computer work stations that permit
instant access to external data bases.
The same criteria for review are applied to both electronic and paper filings,
but it is easier and faster to review Edgar filings. The instant availability of filings and external data bases at the work stations expedites review. Edgar also
facilitates the management of resources by automating workload statistics and
other management information.
The benefits to participating companies are that their filings are received,
reviewed and commented upon faster than paper. One of the most frequent
Edgar filers has also indicated that Edgar has enabled them to respond more
rapidly to changing market conditions, and get to the market faster.
The pilot is being enhanced continuously in a phased approach. Most recently, internal and external electronic mail capabilities were added, along with the
ability to do full-text searches of information filed with the Commission.
In early 1986, a number of significant enhancements will be tested: (1) indexing and analysis of financial statements, (2) automated registrant notification of
SEC acceptance or rejection of filings, (3) addition of a pilot program to receive
and process investment company filings, such as registration statements, posteffective amendments, and proxies from a selected group of registrants, and (4)
inclusion of Williams Act filings. The major objectives of 1986 activities are to
improve the utility of the intelligent workstations, increase filer support, and
test data tagging experiments. Also, through the Commission's dissemination
contract with Bechtel Group Inc., Edgar pilot data will become available to the
public electronically in addition to the standard microfiche and paper.
Steps are also being taken to include the state securities administrators,
securities exchanges, and National Association of Securities Dealers in the
Edgar system. The North American Securities Administrators Association.
adopted a resolution in support of Edgar in September 1984, and chose three
states, California, Georgia and Wisconsin, to participate in the pilot. These
states' access to pilot filings in their respective offices began on February 15,
1985. Discussions also have been held with the exchanges and the NASD
regarding their access to the data to ensure that Edgar meets their needs. In the
operational system, a single filing with the Commission will suffice for all the
states, the exchanges and the NASD. This will reduce the cost of financings, accelerate the dissemination of information, and enhance investor protections.
Operational

Edgar

Based on its positive experience with the pilot, the Commission is moving
forward with plans for a fully operational Edgar system that will encompass all
required filings. In addition to expanding electronic receipt and internal processing capabilities, the operational system will offer widespread, instantaneous electronic dissemination to the investing public.
In mid 1986, the Commission will select a contractor for the Edgar operational system. The process of contractor selection began when the SEC releas-

21

ed for public comment a pre-solicitation procurement document on July 1,
1985. Based on the comments, experience with the Edgar pilot, and numerous
discussions with filers, potential bidders, and users, revisions are being made to
the functional and financing requirements.

Conclusion
Data processing technology has already had a dramatic impact on the
domestic and international securities markets. It has permitted global trading
in world class securities, high-speed electronic execution and confirmation of
the record volumes of securities transactions and financings; and hundred
million dollar savings, through the use of electronic book-entry delivery
systems. Edgar is the next step. It has the potential to improve the manner in
which investment decisions are made and executed, and the efficiency and
fairness of the securities markets. Moreover, it has the potential to revolutionize
the manner in which investment decisions are made and executed.

* NASAA is an association of securities administrators from each of the 50
states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Canadian provinces and territories, and Mexico.

Regulation of the Securities Markets
Key 1985 Results
The Division of Market Regulation, with the assistance of the Regional Offices, is charged with the responsibility of overseeing the operations of the nation's securities markets and market professionals. In fiscal year 1985, over
11,000 broker-dealers, and 10 exchanges were subject to the Commission's
oversight.

The number of broker-dealers registered with the Commission increased approximately 10% in fiscal year 1985. Expansion of products offered in the
securities markets and of institutions offering securities to the public con.
tributed to this increase.
Fiscal year 1985 saw major structural changes in the options markets. The
Commission approved a proposal by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to
trade options on listed stocks, proposals by several exchanges to trade options
on over-the-counter (OTe) stocks, and approved in general a proposal by the
National Association of Securities Dealers to trade options on OTC stocks. The
SEC also approved a proposal to allow NYSE specialists to buy and sell options
for hedging purposes.

23

In fiscal year 1985, the Commission completed two major studies of the
trading markets. Following a two-year joint effort with the Federal Reserve
Board and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Commission submitted The Special Study of the Futures and Options Markets to
Congress in December, 1984. As requested, the Commission submitted its
report, Regulation of the Government Securities Market, to Congress in June,
1985. These reports provide data and insights that will facilitate the legislative
and rulemaking processes.
In response to the increased role of banks in the securities business, the
Commission undertook rulemaking to require registration with the Commission for those banks engaging in certain kinds of securities activities. These
regulations increase investor protections and implement the "functional regulation" approach to financial institution regulation, as espoused by The Task
Group on Regulation of Financial Services, chaired by Vice President Bush.
The Commission's efforts to enhance investor protection were furthered in
FY '85 through the broker-dealer oversight examination program. Capital and
reserve additions of $60.6 million were secured from broker-dealers in financial
difficulty, increasing protection of customer assets in those firms' custody.
Finally, in fiscal year 1985, the Commission made progress in its efforts to
increase the immobilization of securities certificates in securities depositories.
As a result of a three day workshop, issuers, transfer agents, broker-dealers and
clearing agencies are cooperating to identify ways to increase the immobilization of securities certificates and to experiment with uncertificated book-entry
systems.

Securities Markets, Facilities and Trading
The National Market System-Rule 11Aa2.1 under the Exchange Act requires
transactions in national market system (NMS) securities to be reported in a real.
time system, increasing market efficiency and improving execution of
customers' orders. In response to a petition by the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), the Commission approved amendments to
Rule l1Aa2.1 to increase substantially the number of securities eligible for
designation as NMS securities." Currently over 2000 over-the-counter (OTC)
securities are designed as NMS securities, twice the number of last year. Noting
that last-sale reporting has become an established part of the OTC market, the
Commission issued a release soliciting comment on the manner in which cur.
rent NMS securities should be integrated into additional NMS facilities and in.
itiatives, and whether Rule l1Aa2.1 should be amended to focus on additional
groups of securities or to achieve different purposes."
The Commission adopted several other important NMS initiatives. First, it
amended its confirmation rule to require the disclosure of the mark-up or
mark-down in customer principal transactions in reported securities.P" Second,
the Commission indicated its willingness to grant exchanges unlisted trading
privileges in a pilot group of OTC securities under certain conditions." Third,
the Commission determined to permit, in certain circumstances, a security to
be traded on an exchange and concurrently designated as an NMS security. 58
Fourth, the Commission solicited comment concerning an amendment to Rule

24

11Aa2-1 that will allow the NASD to add corporate governance standards for
NMS securities.".
The Commission also continued to further the goal of an NMS to assure
economically efficient execution of transactions in securities. The Commission
issued a release discussing the issues raised by the trading of securities through
home brokerage systems, in which investors are linked through personal computers (or similar systems) to broker-dealers." The Commission also studied
automation in the OTC market, and issued no-action positions on regulation of
these systems which may technically fall within the statutory definition of "ex.
change." In a related matter, the Commission approved on a temporary basis
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.'s Small Order Execution

System."
National System for the Clearance and Settlement of Securities Transactions-In fiscal year 1984, the Commission adopted Rule 17Ad.14 under the
Exchange Act which requires registered transfer agents acting as tender agents
for bidders during tender and exchange offers to establish accounts with
registered securities depositories to permit book-entry delivery of tendered
securitles.P With Commission approval of two securities depositories' bookentry tender agent service programs during fiscal year 1985,63those services
now are available throughout the National Clearance and Settlement System.
The Commission approved a proposed rule chanqe'" that enhances the National Municipal Securities Comparison System, approved in fiscal year 1984
to implement amendments to MSRB Rules G-12 and G.15.65The proposal ex.
tends automated comparison services to when-issued municipal securities
trades and to municipal securities trades that settle beyond the five-business.
day industry standard.
Securities Immobilization-In February and March 1985, the Division of
Market Regulation hosted three days of Workshops on depository immobilization of securities and the use of book-entry systems. At the Workshops,
representatives from the securities issuance and processing communities
discussed ways to expand the use of central depositories to immobilize
securities certificates and reviewed recent developments involving book-entry
systems. On June 24, 1985, the Division made available for public comment its
draft report on the Workshops, "Progress and Prospects: Depository Immobilization of Securities and Use of Book-Entry Systems.'?" (For statistics on
immobilization, see Table 23 on page 120.)
Global Trading- The Commission issued a release requesting comment on
issues concerning the increasing internationalization of the world's securities
markets." Noting the accelerating movement towards global trading markets
for certain securities and the increasing flow of investments across national
borders, the Commission solicited comment on what conditions and structures
should characterize international trading markets and the comparison,
clearance and settlement of resulting international trades.
Govemment Securities-In the wake of several government securities dealer
failures, the Commission reviewed the operations of the government securities
market to determine whether additional regulation was needed. To this end, the
Commission (1) issued a release seeking public comment on the need for additional regulation of government securities market." (2) conducted extensive in-

25

terviews with government securities investors and dealers, (3) held an Open
Forum to obtain directly the views of representatives of investors, dealers, industry groups, and regulators, and (4) consulted extensively with the Federal
Reserve Soard ("FRS") and the Department of the Treasury. Based on these
studies and discussions, the Commission submitted its report to Congress on
the operations of the government securities markets." The Commission
recommended that, if Congress determined legislation was required, it should
be drafted narrowly to address areas in which there have been demonstrated
abuses and to fill gaps in existing regulations. Since all bank and many nonbank dealers are already subject to a broad regulatory scheme, new regulation,
if deemed necessary, should, wherever possible, neither conflict with existing
regulation nor add new burdens on those dealers. The Commission's approach
included registration, statutory disqualifications, and rulemaking by the
Treasury, in consultation with the FRS, over capital adequacy and independent
audit and recordkeeping standards.
Options-During fiscal year 1985 the Commission received 136 SRO rule filings concerning the options markets. Among the significant rule filings approved by the Commission was a proposal by the NYSE to permit stock specialists
to trade options on their specialty stocks for limited hedging purposes."?
In addition, the Commission approved proposals submitted by the NYSE to:
(1) establish an options trading program for standardized options on individual
listed stocks and (2) become a participant in the options allocation plan which
provides procedures for the selection and replacement of stocks underlying individual equity options for the existing equity options exchanges."!
Further, the Commission approved proposals by the NASD and several options exchanges to trade standardized options on over-the-counter ("OTC")
securities as well as an OTC stock index."
As of September 30, 1985, the Commission also approved 93 other rule filings submitted by the options exchanges and, pursuant to provisions of the
Commodity Exchange Act, sent six letters to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission commenting on applications by boards of trade for designation as
contract markets to trade futures contracts on indices or groups of securities.
Finally, in December 1984, the Commission, along with the Federal Reserve
Soard and the CFTC, submitted to Congress the Special Study of the Futures

and Options Markets.
Short Tendering-On

February 28, 1985, the Commission adopted an
amendment to Exchange Act Rule 10b-4, the short tendering rule." The
amendment requires tendering persons to exclude from their "net long position" those shares underlying certain standardized call options that they have
written after the announcement of a tender offer. The amendment is intended
to prohibit hedged tendering through the use of call options.
Issuer Tender Offers-On July I, 1985, the Commission published for comment amendments to Exchange Act Rules 13e-4 and 14e-J.74 Rule 13e-4
regulates tender offers and exchange offers by issuers for their own securities.
Rule 14e-1 defines unlawful tender offer practices. The proposed amendments
would codify that an issuer tender offer must be extended to all holders of the
subject securities and that all security holders must be paid the highest consideration offered. The amendments would also conform the minimum offering
withdrawal and proration periods required of issuer tender offers to those required of third party offers, and require the offer to remain open for ten
business days from an increase in the number of shares sought.

26

Regulation of Brokers, Dealers, Municipal Securities Dealers,
and Transfer Agents
Broker-Dealer and Transfer Agent Examinations-The
number of brokerdealer registrations has continued to rise at a significant rate. In fiscal year
1985 such registrations increased 10%. The Commission has continued to
respond to its increasing regulatory role by, among other things, fostering
greater partnership roles with the self-regulatory organizations ("SROs"). In
this regard, the Commission has expressed to the SROs, and they in turn are
responding to, the need for expanding their examination staffs since the initial
"watchdog" responsibility for assuring their member firms' compliance with the
Federal securities laws rests with them. The Commission also has encouraged
the SROs to enhance investigative and enforcement commitments in the sales
practices area. In addition, the Commission has continued the referral of
"cause" matters to the SROs (where appropriate) to investigate and take
disciplinary action. The number of such referrals increased 84% from 186 in
FY 1984 to 343 in FY 1985. Nevertheless, the Commission will continue to
handle those matters where it appears that SROs lack jurisdiction, have inadequate remedies or are unable to investigate fully or prosecute aggressively.
During 1985, the Commission developed guidelines for the broker-dealer
oversight examination program designed to coordinate and strengthen the
regional offices' oversight program. The Commission also began a pilot test to
determine the feasibility of using portable computers in conducting various
aspects of a broker-dealer examination and has gained on-line access to the
NASD's Central Registration Depository, a computer file with regulatory information on securities industry employees registered with the NASD.
The staff completed 447 oversight examinations of SRO members, the
highest level of oversight examinations ever reached and more than 10%
above the previous record level set last fiscal year. The staff also completed 145
cause examinations, down from 228 last fiscal year. The decreased number of
cause examinations is attributable to increased referrals to SROs of matters
more appropriate for SRO review and sanction. The staff also examined 79
transfer agents. These examinations were conducted following guidance from
the staff designed to improve examination selection and thoroughness.
Examination programs were augmented by coordinated SECISROefforts in
the government securities and money laundering areas.
Transactions by Distribution Participants-During
the year, the staff
developed proposed amendments to Exchange Act Rule 10b.6, which proscribes certain conduct by participants in a distribution of securities. The proposed amendments would permit broker-dealer distribution participants to
engage in solicited brokerage until specified cooling-off periods; define the
rule's applicability to affiliates of distribution participants; reduce the restrictions on the exercise of standardized call options by distribution participants;
and revise the rule's preamble to more fully reflect authority for the rule and to
codify that the rule's exceptions may be relied upon only if the contemplated
transactions are not made for manipulative purposes. The proposed amendments were issued for public comment by the Commission on October 10,
1985.75
Financial Responsibility Rules-On January 11, 1985, the Commission issued
a release soliciting comments on a broad range of questions regarding the
Commission's financial responsibility rules for brokers and dealers that would

27

assist the Commission's reexamination of the scope, adequacy and necessity of
those rules.?" The Commission received a number of comments which are being analyzed by the Commission staff.
Customer Protection Rule- The staff proposed that the Commission adopt
amendments to Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act affecting a
broker-dealer's computation of the Formula for Determination of Reserve Requirement for Brokers and Dealers." The Commission approved the amend.
ments on October 3, 1985. The amendments were designed to provide greater
protection of customer funds held by broker-dealer against misuse or insolvency and to ensure that customer funds are used only to service bona fide
customer accounts. In effect, the amendments prohibit broker-dealers from using free credit balances to finance either the transactions of certain household
members of principals of the firm or certain concentrated accounts.
Interpretations of the Net Capital Rule-On December 3, 1984 the Division
issued a no-action letter to the NYSE, CBOE and AMEX in which it
acknowledged the risk reducing features of maintaining cross-hedged and
spread positions between security options on stock market indices against
futures contracts and commodity options on futures contract on such indices.
On January 15, 1985, the Division issued a letter to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX) expanding that no-action position to include cross hedged and
spread transactions involving foreign currency options offset by futures con.
tracts and commodity options on the same foreign currency.
On September 25, 1985, the Division proposed to issue a no-action letter to
the Securities Industry Association implementing a premium-based haircut
methodology for all proprietary options positions, which was approved by the
Commission on October 22, 1985.
Revised Form BD-On September 26, 1985, the Commission adopted revisions to Form BD which, among other things, reduce the regulatory burden on
broker-dealers by rewriting the disciplinary question in "plain English" and
limiting the scope of that question to the broker-dealer itself and its control affiliates. The new form becomes effective on January 1, 1986. At the same time,
the Commission simplified its broker-dealer successor rules."
Customer Coniirmetion Disclosure-On September 11, 1985, the Commission amended Rule 1Ob-I governing customer confirmation disclosure to require more complete disclosure for principal transactions in reported
securities. The amendments require broker-dealers to report on confirmations
the trade prices and mark-ups in principal (e.g., O'TC) transactions with
customers, thus providing customers with additional information regarding the
quality and costs of broker-dealer services."
Publication of Quotations by Broker-Deeiers-s-Cm
November 15, 1984, the
Commission adopted amendments to Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11.80 The rule
generally requires that a broker-dealer have certain information concerning an
issuer before initiating quotations for the issuer's securities. The amendments
make the rule applicable to the publication of quotations without a specified
price and to the publication of quotations for certain foreign securities. Exceptions to the rule provide for the publication of quotations for NASDAQ
securities.The amendments also revise the scope of the rule's "piggyback" exception.

a

28

On April 10, 1985, the Commission issued a release identifying questions
and soliciting comments and data on the costs and benefits believed to be
associated with Rule 15c2.11 as amended." Comments were also requested on
any alternative regulatory approaches that, in light of cost/benefit data, would
better achieve the rule's objectives.
Bank Securities Activities-On July 1, 1985, the Commission adopted Rule
3b.9 under the Exchange Act. The rule requires a bank to conduct certain
securities activities through a broker-dealer registered under the Exchange Act.
These activities are 1) public solicitation of brokerage for transaction-related
compensation, 2) receipt of transaction. related compensation for providing
brokerage services for trust, managing agency or other accounts to which the
bank provides advice or 3) dealing in or underwriting securities. The rule also
contains several exceptions for banks that conduct only limited securities activities.B2

Extension of Credit by Broker-Dealers on Shares of Direct Participation Pro.
grams-On November 16, 1984, the Commission published for public comment proposed Rule 3a 12.9 under the Exchange Act. The proposed rule would
exempt the securities of certain direct participation programs from those provisions of the Exchange Act which currently prohibit broker-dealers from arranging extensions of credit to investors to purchase securities. This would allow
broker-dealers, subject to certain conditions, to participate in public offerings
of securities of direct participation programs that provide for mandatory install.
ment payments by purchasers."

Extension of Credit by Broker-Dealers on Investment Company Shares-On
December 18, 1984, the Commission adopted Rule l l d l-Z under the Exchange Act. The rule exempts any security issued by an open-end management
investment company or unit investment trust registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 from certain credit restrictions of the Exchange Act, provided that the security has been owned for more than thirty days by the security

holder."
Persons Deemed Not to be Brokers-On

June 27, 1985, the Commission
adopted Exchange Act Rule 3a4-1 specifying a non-exclusive safe harbor under
which persons associated with an issuer of securities who participate in sales of
that issuer's securities will not be considered to be acting as "brokers" as that
term is defined in the Exchange Act. Accordingly, these persons would not be
required to register with the Commission pursuant to the Act. The Commission
adopted the rule in order to provide guidance concerning the applicability of
the broker-dealer registration requirement in situations where an issuer
chooses to sell its securities through its associated persons."
Lost and Stolen Securities-The Lost and Stolen Securities Program, which
includes as participants nearly 19,200 securities organizations, Federallyinsured banks, and nonbank transfer agents, uses a data bank to monitor miss.
ing securities. Participants use the system to validate the authenticity and
ownership of the certificates coming into their possession. On September 19,
1985, the Commission issued a press release containing comprehensive
general statistical information regarding the operation of the Program for
calendar year 1984. As stated in that release, the Securities Information Center,
the Commission's designee to operate and maintain the computerized data

29

base of missing, lost, counterfeit and stolen securities through September 30,
1990, received loss reports for 491,944 certificates totaling $1,636,541,701.
The dollar value of lost, missing or stolen securities located through the Program increased by 31.4% during calendar year 1984, representing an aggregate dollar value increase from $12,135,068 in 1983 to $15,947,001 in
1984. As of December 31, 1984, the aggregate net value of the data base since
the inception of the program was approximately $8 billion.
Transfer Agent Regulation- The Commission approved rule changes proposed by the New York and American Stock Exchanges that generally eliminated
the requirement that certain issuers appoint both transfer agents and independent registrars. B6
Transfer Agent Registration Forms-On April 23, 1985 the Commission
published for comment several new forms for the registration of transfer
agents: a simplified Form TA-l designed to conform the Commission's
registration form to that used by the bank regulatory agencies; (2) a new SEC
Supplement to Form TA-I providing information about persons associated
with non-bank, non-issuer transfer agents; and (3) an annual report providing
essential information about each transfer agent's activltles.'" The new forms
are designed to enhance the Commission's oversight of transfer agents.

Oversight of Self-Regulatory

Organizations

National Securities Exchanges-As
of September 30, 1985, ten exchanges
were registered with the Commisison as national securities exchanges. During
the fiscal year, the Commission granted applications by exchanges to delist 68
equity and debt, and 8 options issues, and granted applications by issuers requesting withdrawal from listing and registration for 39 issues. In addition, during the fiscal year the Commission granted 816 applications by exchanges for
unlisted trading privileges.
The exchanges reported to the Commission 530 final disciplinary actions imposing a variety of sanctions upon member firms and their employees. This
compares with 394 final disciplinary actions in fiscal 1984.
During the fiscal year, the Commission received 243 proposed rule changes
from exchanges. Among the significant rule filings approved by the Commission were: (1) international trading linkages between the Boston Stock Exchange and the Montreal Exchange, and between the American Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchanqe," (2) a New York Stock Exchange
minor disciplinary fine systern.'" (3) amendments to Amex listing standards
relating to unit investment trustsr" and (4) Pacific Stock Exchange procedures
for appointing and evaluating specialists in connection with PSE's specialists
post expansion program."
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.- The NASD, with over 5700
members, is the only national securities association registered with the Com.
mission. In fiscal 1985, the NASD reported the disposition of 348 formal and
summary disciplinary actions and 93 formal and summary actions by the
Association's NASDAQ Trading Committee.
In addition, the Commission received 36 filings of proposed rule changes
from the NASD. During 1985, the Commission approved major revisions of the

30

NASD's By-Laws" and Code of Procedure." In addition, the Commission approved an NASD proposal creating a Market Surveillance Committee, which
hears all cases throughout the United States in which the NASD alleges that a
member violated a market-related rule.P' Formerly, these cases were heard by
local District Business Conduct Committees.
The Commission also denied a petition from four broker-dealers that sell
securities issued by their affiliates ("self-underwriting"), to amend the NASD's
rules regulating those offerinqs." The petitioners, former SECO broker.
dealers, requested that the Commission amend the NASD's rules to be consistent with the Commission's self-underwriting rules under the obsolete SECO
program. Subsequent to this action, one petitioner requested the Commission
to review its decision; that request is still pending."
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board-In
fiscal 1985, the Commission
received 24 filings of proposed rule changes from the MSRB. The Commission
approved one MSRB rule change of particular note:" the rule change
underscores the responsibilities of dealers that sell new issue municipal
securities as well as strengthens and facilitates enforcement of MSRB Rule
G-32. Rule G.32 is designed to ensure that a purchaser of new issue securities is
provided with all available information relevant to his investment decision. The
Commission also proposed amendments to Rule 15Bc7-1 under the Exchange
Act that would provide the Commission and the MSRB more efficient access to
relevant and useful information contained in inspection reports of municipal
securities brokers and dealers while reducing the administrative burdens of the
examining authoritles."

Clearing Agencies
During the year, the Commission approved 87 proposed rule changes
generally reducing clearing costs and enhancing clearing agency systems for
controlling their financial exposure. Other approved proposed rule changes
enabled clearing agencies to admit foreign broker-dealers to clearing agency
rnembership," to establish a wholly-owned commodities clearinghouse sub.
sidiary, 100 and to offer a clearing fund letters of credit program. 101 The Commission also approved a proposed rule change of the Boston Stock Exchange
Clearing Corporation 102 that completely revised its rules in response to the
Commission's order granting the Clearing Corporation full registration as a
clearing agency under the Exchange Act. 103

SRO Surveillance

and Regulatory

Compliance

Inspections

During the fiscal year, the staff conducted 21 inspections of SRO market
surveillance, disciplinary, compliance, and operational programs.
The 1985 inspection program continued to emphasize improving automated
surveillance through transaction audit trails. The staff inspected the NYSE,
Arnex, CBOE, and NASD to monitor the progress in their respective audit
trails. An NYSE equity audit trail was operational during the year; however,
monitoring visits revealed that problems due to summarization of clearing data
and failure by exchange members to supply all of the necessary trade informa-

31

tion hampered the audit trail's accuracy. To correct those problems, the NYSE
is contacting members to improve compliance and has begun to collect audit
trail data independently of the trade comparison system. The Amex's equity
audit trail has experienced problems similar to those faced by the NYSE, and
the Amex is taking similar corrective action. The CBOE has developed an audit
trail transaction journal over the past year, and is working on improving the accuracy of the journal for market reconstruction and automated surveillance
purposes. In July 1985, the initial phases of the NASD's audit trail became
operational, with firms required to submit routinely, to clearance, the time of
each trade and whether the firm acted as principal or agent.
The staff also completed an oversight inspection of the NYSE's specialist
surveillance program. It revealed that while surveillance and investigations had
generally improved since the last inspection, the NYSE needed to be more aggressive in its discipline of specialists' violations. The staff also recommended
several refinements to the NYSE's surveillance procedures and that a study be
conducted of problems resulting from stop order executions.
A comprehensive inspection of the PHLX equity options surveillance program conducted during the year disclosed that some significant weaknesses
continue to exist while others have arisen due to increased volume. The staff
found the surveillance procedures to be manually intensive and in need of
automation, and noted weaknesses in the investigatory and disciplinary programs of the exchange. The PHLX was requested to advise the Commission
within 90 days of its plans to address these problems.
The staff also conducted a comprehensive inspection of the CBOE equity option surveillance program. The inspection revealed that, although the CBOE's
surveillance procedures continue to be manually intensive, the exchange has
begun a substantial program to automate its surveillance capability. The staff
noted several minor problems in the CBOE surveillance capability and made
recommendations to improve the program. In addition, the staff requested the
exchange to strengthen its discipline of trading violations. Late in the year the
Division began inspections of the Amex and Pacific Stock Exchange (PSE) options surveillance programs.
A series of inspections of various programs at the NASD was conducted during the year. These inspections noted weaknesses in the NASD programs for
enforcement of its free-riding and with-holding restrictions, and for detection of
abuses in pink sheet stocks. The NASD agreed to take corrective action recommended by the Commission. These inspections also found the programs administered by NASD's Corporate Finance Department and its Market
Surveillance Committee to be well designed and effectively administered.
A series of compliance inspections of the NYSE's Enforcement Department
was conducted on matters identified by the NYSE's broker-dealer examination
program which were referred for enforcement follow-up. These inspections
revealed a need for improvement by the NYSE's Enforcement Department in
review of supervision by member firms, in timely investigation and prosecution
of violations of Exchange rules and in documentation.
The inspections,
however, did conclude that the Exchange takes appropriate disciplinary action
in most cases originating from its broker-dealer examination program. The
staff also reviewed the NYSE's written procedures for investigating customer

32

complaints and found that those procedures, even if consistently implemented,
fail to assure thorough and adequately documented investigations. Changes
were recommended to the NYSE.
Also during fiscal year 1985, the staff completed an inspection of the NYSE's
and CBOE's handling of numerous customer complaints against a registered
representative. This inspection disclosed weaknesses in the procedures for
communicating between these SROs, in the investigation of the customer complaints, the disposition of the complaints, and in the procedures used by these
SROs to communicate with each other.
A full oversight inspection at the CBOE to review investigations of customer
complaints, terminations of registered representatives for cause, routine examinations and formal disciplinary actions was in progress at the end of the
fiscal year.
The staff also conducted compliance inspections of six of the fourteen NASD
district offices, as well as a review of the NASD's Anti-Fraud Program. During
fiscal year 1985, guidelines for the inspection of NASD district offices were
developed to permit implementation of a new management program under
which regional offices assume primary responsibility for field inspections of
NASD district office broker-dealer examinations, investigations of customer
complaints and terminations for cause, financial surveillance of member firms
and formal disciplinary actions. Inspections of NASD districts in Seattle, San
Francisco, New Orleans, Dallas, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C. were conducted
by the regional offices and revealed various deficiencies in each district office,
including delays in conducting and processing examinations, miscellaneous
deficiencies in examinations and financial surveillance of member firms, instances of delays and inadequate investigations of customer complaints and
terminations for cause and instances of inadequate sanctions in formal
disciplinary actions. In addition, the staff reviewed the operation of the NASD's
Anti-Fraud Unit and recommended that additional staff be added to permit
completion of complex investigations in a more timely manner. Finally, the
staff met with the NYSE and NASD on a quarterly basis to discuss current
regulatory issues.
During the summer of 1985, the staff conducted a review of the member
monitoring and risk assessment programs of Depository Trust Company,
Midwest Securities Trust Company, Pacific Securities Depository Trust
Company, and Philadelphia Depository Trust Company. These inspections
identified some weakness in their risk assessment programs. The staff is
recommending that these depositories conduct formal risk assessments and
report the results to their Boards of Directors, and that they establish a task
force to develop consistent programs to address common risk.
In response to increasing concerns over the number of investor complaints
concerning delays in the transfer of their accounts at major brokerage firms,
the Division held a meeting with senior staff from the NYSE, NASD, NSCC and
OCC to discuss what steps were being taken to alleviate the existing backlog of
delayed account transfer requests and to indentify long term solutions for the
industry. The NYSE and NASD agreed (1) to propose modifications in their
rules to require more timely response by the securities industry, (2) to outline
procedures for transferring those categories of securities which are non-D'TC

33

eligible such as limited partnerships and foreign securities, and (3) to develop
standardized customer account forms for industrywide use. By the end of the
fiscal year, both the NYSE and NASD had proposed amendments to their rules
governing transfer of accounts. Implementation of a pilot automated transfer
system is now being tested. Because of the Division's concern over the extent
of account transfer delays, the NYSE met regularly with representatives from
the eleven largest firms between May 1984 and the early part of fiscal year
1985. As a result, the number of accounts delayed over six months was reduced
from 30,000 to 1,000.
Also during fiscal year 1985, the Commission concluded its Market Oversight and Surveillance System (MOSS), an automated surveillance system for
stock and options trading, due to the joint development by the SROs of a viable
intermarket surveillance program. The Commission has incorporated the
MOSS pilot into its market information data base which supports numerous
Commission activities.
Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SIPC'')- The SIPC Fund amounted
to $308 million on September 30, 1985, an increase of $82 million from
September 30, 1984. In the fall of 1983, the SIPC Board of Directors ("SIPC
Board") determined to continue assessments on SIPC member broker-dealers
at the annual rate of one-fourth of one percent of aggregate gross revenues
from the securities business until the SIPC Fund total reaches $300 million. 104
At the direction of SIPe's Board, SIPC has formed a broad-based task force to
make recommendations to the SIPC Board on (1) the appropriate size of the
SIPC Fund and (2) the nature of the assessments on members both before and
after the appropriate size of the SIPC Fund is reached. Preliminarily, the Commission has expressed its view to SIPC that the SIPC Fund should be increased
above $300 million.
During the fiscal year, the Commission staff completed a review of SIPC liquidation proceedings. Based on that review, the Commission believes that SIPC
(1) is doing a good job in selecting trustees to handle liquidations, overseeing
their activities and monitoring the progress of liquidations, and (2) is properly
exercising its responsibilities and authority under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970. Nevertheless, the Commission encouraged the expanded
use of automation by SIPC, the development of an operations manual for liquidation proceedings, and the possible commitment of more resources in
overseeing liquidation proceedings. The Commission also supported SIPe's
development of a program for efficient liquidation of large firms should such a
liquidation ever be necessary. SIPC has taken steps that indicate that it is
responsive to these issues.
Applications for Re-entry-During the fiscal year, the Division of Market
Regulation received 75 SRO applications to permit persons subject to statutory
disqualifications, as defined in Section 3(aX39) of the Exchange Act, to become
associated with broker-dealers. This represented a 19% decrease in applications from fiscal 1984. The distribution of filings among the SROs was the
following: NASD (55), NYSE (16) and Amex (4). Of the total filings made, 4 applications were subsequently withdrawn, 65 were processed and 6 were pending at year end. Two applications were denied by the Commission.

Investment Companies and Advisers
Key 1985 Results
The Division of Investment Management oversees the regulation of investment companies and investment advisers under two companion statutes, the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act and Investment Advisers Act, respectively). During
1985, the Division also assumed responsibility for administration of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (Holding Company Act).
The number of registered investment companies and investment advisers as
well as the amount of assets under management increased rapidly in 1985,
continuing the trend of the past several years. At the end of fiscal 1985, there
were 2,458 registered investment companies and 11,146 registered investment
advisers, increases of 11.2% and 22.7% respectively. From 1981 to 1985, the
number of investment companies and investment advisers grew by 56.1 %and
77.9%, respectively. Combined assets under management reached $1,695
billion in 1985, a 121% increase from 1981.

In response to this growth, the Division increased staff productivity through
technological and procedural improvements. Use of personal computers on an

35

experimental basis provided excellent results in the planning, examination and
report-writing stages of the inspection process. Continued emphasis on
streamlining examinations permitted the staff to complete 1,606 investment
company and investment adviser inspections in 1985, significantly exceeding
the record performance of 1,334 examinations in 1984. These inspections
resulted in the recovery of an estimated $2.4 million for investment company
shareholders and advisory clients.
The Division and the Regional Offices also conducted a joint investment ad.
viser training program with interested states throughout the year as part of an
effort to improve communication and encourage the sharing of workload between state and Federal authorities with jurisdiction over investment advisers.
This program will be continued in the upcoming fiscal year.

Disclosure Requirements
During fiscal 1985, the Commission proposed a new simplified registration
form under the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Investment Company Act for all unit investment trusts, other than insurance company separate
accounts.P" Like Form N-1A for mutual fund prospectuses, Form N.7 would
establish a two-part disclosure format consisting of a simplified prospectus and
a Statement of Additional Information available to prospective investors upon
request. The Commission also proposed Form N-14, a simplified form for
registering securities issued by management investment companies and
business development companies in business combination transactlons.v"
The Commission proposed and adopted an amendment to Form N-lA, the
registration form used by open-end management investment companies other
than insurance company separate accounts to revise the method of computing
portfolio turnover'?" and proposed another amendment to the form to consolidate all expense-related information in the prospectus and add a tabular
presentation of major expense data.'?" The Commission also proposed to
amend Rule 6-07 of Regulation SoX to require registered investment companies
to account for net costs incurred as a result of a Rule 12b-1 distribution plan as

expenses.':"
The Commission proposed and adopted a rule amendment and new rule
relating to the pricing of redeemable securities by investment companies. III
The revisions simplify and clarify pricing and redemption requirements for
mutual funds, especially those with portfolio securities trading in foreign
markets.

Regulatory Policy
In October 1984, the Commission adopted a revised version of Rule 2a-5
under the Investment Company Act (redesignated as Rule 2a19-1) to provide
broader exemptive relief from the definition of "interested person" for brokers,
dealers and their affiliates. At the same time, the Commission adopted Rule
10b.1 to define the term "regular broker or dealer."1\2 On December 14,1984,
the Commission adopted Rule 3a-5 to exempt the finance subsidiaries of U.S.

36

and foreign private issuers from the definition of "investment company" under
certain circumstances. I 13
A new streamlined semi-annual reporting form for registered investment
companies, N-SAR, was adopted in January 1985, replacing five annual report
forms. In July, the Commission eliminated the quarterly reporting obligations
of investment companies and incorporated the contents of Form N-IQ, the
quarterly report form for management investment companies, into the new
semi-annual form.'!" The Commission also conformed the calculation of portfolio turnover rate prescribed in Forms N-IA and N-2, the registration statement forms for open-end and closed-end investment companies, respectively,
to the method set forth in the new form. lIS
A revised version of Rule 22d-l was adopted in February 1985, to permit investment companies to sell their redeemable securities with scheduled variations in sales loads. The Commission simultaneously amended the sales load
items in the registration forms for open-end investment companies and unit investment trusts to require adequate disclosure of scheduled variations in their

prospectuses.i"
On May 31, 1985, the Commission extended the date by which investment
companies must conform their foreign custodial arrangements with Rule 17f.5
until September 1, 1985.117 The Commission simultaneously proposed amendments to clarify certain aspects of Rule 17f-5.116 [These should be adopted in
September.]
Amendments to Investment Company Act Rule 2a.7 were proposed on July
1, to permit investment companies to acquire put options to enhance portfolio
liquidity, subject to certain conditions. The Commission simultaneously proposed amendments to Rule 12d3-1 and proposed for public comment Rule
2a41-1 to permit investment companies to acquire standby commitment put
options from persons engaged in securities-related activities and to assign a fair
value of zero to those options.':"

Investment

Advisers

The Commission proposed and adopted revisions to Form ADV, the investment adviser registration form 120 to permit uniform registration with the Commission and the states. The revised form was developed by the Commission
and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASM) to
remove unnecessary administrative burdens and provide cost savings to invest.
ment advisers registering with more than one governmental entity. The Commission and NASAA intend to develop an electronic system for processing adviser registrations so that one registration form can be filed with a central
depository for transmission to all the jurisdictions in which the adviser is
registering.
The Commission adopted a rule amendment to permit advisers to preserve
required records on microfilm and in computer systems under prescribed
conditions!" and proposed Rule 205-3 to permit registered investment ad.
vlsers,
under certain
conditions,
to receive
performance-based
cornpensatlon.v" If adopted, proposed Rule 205.3 would allow registered in.

37

vestment advisers and their clients considerably more flexibility in structuring
compensation arrangements.
The Commission also proposed and adopted a safe harbor rule, Rule
203(bX3).I, which specifies certain circumstances in which a limited partner.
ship, rather than each of its limited partners, will be counted as a "client" of a
general partner acting as investment adviser to the partnership for purposes of
an exemption from registration provided by the Investment Advisers Act. 123
The rule provides guidance on a longstanding interpretive question concerning
the ~ailability of a registration exemption to a general partner acting as an investment adviser to a limited partnership.
The Commission adopted amendments to Form 13F under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 which prescribes the reporting requirements for institutional investment managers exercising investment discretion over accounts
having, in the aggregate, more than $100,000,000 in exchange-traded or
NASDAQ-quoted securities. 124 The amendments simplify the procedures for requesting confidential treatment of certain risk arbitrage positions reported on
the form and limit the time for which confidential treatment of commercial information may be requested.

Insurance Requirements
In November, 1984, the Commission temporarily adopted and solicited
public comment on a rule that permits a new type of life insurance product call.
ed flexible premium variable life insurance. 125 The temporary rule provides extensive exemptions from the Investment Company Act and rules thereunder to
insurance company separate accounts offering this product.
As part of a continuing effort to simplify compliance with the Investment
Company Act, the Commission proposed a new rule to permit insurance company separate accounts offering variable annuity contracts to deduct charges
for an insurer's assumption of mortality and expense risks. 126 The Commission
also adopted new integrated registration forms, Forms N.3 and N.4, specifically
designed for variable annuity contracts offered by insurance company separate
accounts.!" The new forms feature a shorter and simpler prospectus.
To clarify the status of certain annuity contracts that generally include
guaranteed investment contracts and single premium deferred annuities, the
Commission proposed Rule 151 under the Securities Act.l28 The rule would
create a "safe harbor" under which annuity contracts having certain
characteristics would be exempt securities.

Public Utility Holding Companies
There are presently 13 registered holding companies with aggregate assets,
as of June 30, 1985, of $78.2 billion, an increase of $5.5 billion, or 7.6% over
the previous year. Total operating revenues, as of June 30, 1985 were $34.4
billion, a $.2 million decrease from the previous year. There are 65 electric or
gas utility subsidiaries, 72 non utility subsidiaries, and 22 inactive companies in

38

the 13 registered systems, a total of 172 companies operating in 24 states (excluding seven power supply subsidiary companies).
During the year, a number of measures were adopted to increase staff productivity, permitting significant reductions in staff devoted full-time to Holding
Company Act matters. Improved review procedures allowed the staff to process
approximately the same number of applications, on an annualized basis since
January 1985, as in fiscal 1984, with 45% fewer personnel.
In January 1985, the Commission initiated a review of its rules under the
Holding Company Act to eliminate restrictions unnecessary for consumer and
investor protection. In May 1985, the Commission published for public comment a revision of Rule 70 which would permit a limited number of persons affiliated with investment bankers or commercial banking institutions to serve as
directors
or officers of public utility
holding companies and their
subsidiaries. 129 The purpose of the proposed rule change is to simplify, clarify,
and expand the existing rule to give holding companies and their subsidiaries
more flexibility in the selection of their officers and directors.
In June 1985, the Commission published for comment an amendment to
Rule 22 which would require registered holding companies to provide a draft
notice with any application or declaration filed with the Cornmission.P?
The
Commission also adopted temporary rules and forms under the Holding Company Act to facilitate participation of public utility holding companies in the
Commission's pilot electronic disclosure system, Edqar.!"
On July I, 1985,
the Commission began accepting electronic filings of documents under the
Holding Company Act.
Holding Company Fmancings-During fiscal 1985, the Commission authorized approximately $4.2 billion of senior securities and common stock financing
for the 13 registered systems: approximately $3.6 billion in long-term debt
financing; $600 million in common and preferred stock. Over $2.2 billion of
pollution control financing and $5.7 billion of short-term debt financing was approved. The pollution control financing represented a 57% increase over
amounts authorized in fiscal year 1984. Short-term debt increased by 32 percent over the previous year. Total financings in fiscal 1985 of $12.1 billion exceeded financings authorized in fiscal 1984 by $3.6 billion, an increase of over
42%
The Commission authorized $656.9 million for fuel exploration and development activities during 1985.
Subsidiary Service Companies-At
the end of calendar year 1984, 12 subsidiary service companies provided managerial, accounting, administrative and
engineering service to 11 of the 13 registered holding companies. Billings for
services rendered to the holding company systems amounted to $1.4 billion or
4.1 percent of the total revenues generated by the electric and gas operating
utilities. Subsidiary service companies are heavily labor-intensive, employing
17,603 people, and have assets of over $739.6 million.
During fiscal 1985, the Commission completed the audit and examination of
two subsidiary service companies. The Commission's examination of holding
company fuel procurement activities and approval of fuel service contracts between associate companies resulted in savings to consumers during the fiscal
year of approximately $32.3 million.

Significant Applications and Interpretations
Government Securities-During
the fiscal year, Division reminded investment companies of the conditions under which they may enter into repurchase agreements with brokers, dealers or other entities engaged in securities
related businesses. In three letters to the Investment Company Institute, the
Division reiterated and elaborated upon a staff no-action position which permits such transactions, provided that the repurchase agreement is fully collateralized and the investment company's board of directors has evaluated the
credit-worthiness of the other party to the transaction. The letters state that
in order to ensure that a repurchase agreement is fully collateralized, an investment company should perfect and maintain an adequate security interest in the
securities underlying the agreement, i.e. take actual or constructive possession
of the securities, and mark them to market.
Guidelines for Exemptive Applications- The Commission, on April 30, 1985,
issued a release explaining guidelines and procedures to be followed by applicants seeking exemptive relief under the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The new guidelines will help streamline the review of
such applicants.
The Commission issued an order permitting members of an association of
closed-end internally managed investment companies to offer their employees
deferred equity compensation in the form of stock options and stock appreciation rights. The conditions of the order included all protections previously irnposed by the Commission on issuance of stock options by small business in.
vestment companies as well as the requirements of the Investment Company
Act that apply to stock options issued by business development companies.
The order will allow members of the association to compete more effectively
with external managers of mutual funds, banks, broker-dealers and certain
other investment advisory organizations.
On February 7, 1985, the Commission issued an order permitting the
Vanguard STAR Fund ("Fund") to acquire shares of other mutual funds in the
Vanguard Group of investment companies in excess of the limitations imposed
on "funds of funds" in Section 12(dX1) of the Investment Company Act. The
Fund was created to provide a diversified program of mutual fund investments
to investors seeking retirement income.
The terms of a previous Commission order were amended to permit several
registered investment companies to lend their portfolio securities to their affiliated sub-advisers and principal broker, Neuberger & Berman. The amended
order: (1) establishes a new, more competitive formula for calculating the transaction price for securities loans and (2) allows Neuberger & Berman to lend
securities it borrows from its affiliated investment companies provided, among
other things, that Neuberger & Berman repays the investment companies for
excess earnings as determined under a formula specified in the order.
The Commission authorized Central and South West Financial, Inc. (CSWF), a
nonutility subsidiary company of Central and South West Corporation, a
registered holding company, to enter into leveraged leases for the purpose of
reducing forecasted consolidated income tax llablllty.P" CSWF entered into a
joint venture arrangement with Manufacturers Hanover Leasing Corporation to

40

create a new company that could finance up to $1 billion of leased property. The
venture is structured so that CSWF can claim all the tax credits and deductions
arising from ownership of the leased property and thereby reduce its consolidated tax liability by serveral hundred million dollars over the next five years.
The Commission authorized the Southern Company to acquire an interest in
Integrated Communication Systems, Inc. (ICS), a new corporation organized by
a group of companies to perfect a new two-way communications system over
local telephone lines.':" ICS intends to develop a wide range of energy-related
services in the residential and small commercial markets; in addition, other services could include home security, education, and electronic banking.
Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Transmission), the wholly owned
transmission subsidiary of The Columbia Gas System, Inc., a registered holding
company, has been burdened with marketing problems due to contract obligations to purchase quantities of gas at prices which exceed those the market can
accept. Pursuant to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission settlements arising out of various lawsuits, Transmission has agreed to pay certain pipeline
suppliers their fixed costs for purchases below minimum bill levels and to advance to the suppliers Transmission's allocable share of take or pay payments
made by the pipeline suppliers in connection with Transmission's reduced purchases, with such advances to be repaid to Transmission as the pipeline suppliers work their way out of their take or pay situation. In order to finance
Transmission's needs during this critical period, the Commission authorized an
extensive financing package totalling in excess of $1.2 billion including up to
$450 million in inventory financing notes, up to $400 million from the sale of
interests in the proceeds of production from certain proved reserves, and $350
million in first mortgage bonds. 134
Institutional Disclosure Program-Section
13(f)(5) of the Securities Exchange
Act requires certain "institutional investment managers" to file reports on
Form 13F on a calendar quarterly basis. Managers required to file 13F reports
disclose certain equity holdings of the accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. As of June 30, 1985, Form 13F reports had been filed on
behalf of approximately 1,464 managers for holdings totaling $788 billion.
Form 13F reports are available to the public at the Commission's Public
Reference Room promptly after filing. Two tabulations of the information contained in the Form 13F reports are available for inspection: (1) a listing, arranged according to the individual security, showing the number of shares held and
the name of the money manager reporting the holding; and (2) a summary
listing showing the number of shares of a security reported by all institutional
investment managers filing reports. Both tabulations normally are available approximately two weeks after the date on which Form 13F is required to be filed.
The tabulations are produced by an independent contractor selected through
the competitive bidding process. The contractor provides its services to the
Commission without charge, and is required to make a variety of specified
tabulations available to the public at reasonable prices within ten days after
receipt of the reports.

â€¢â€¢ State Courts and Administrative Tribunals

The General Counsel represents the Commission in all litigation in the
United States Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals, defends the Comrnission and its employees when sued, prosecutes administrative disciplinary pro.
ceedings against professional persons under Rule 2(e) of the Commission's
Rules of Practice, and appears amicus curiae on behalf of the Commission in
significant private litigation involving the Federal securities laws. In addition,
under the supervision and direction of the General Counsel, the Regional Of.
fices represent the Commission in corporate reorganization cases which have a
substantial public investor interest under the Bankruptcy Code. The General
Counsel also seeks to ensure that objectives of the Commission's enforcement
and regulatory programs are accomplished, that judicial interpretations of the
Federal securities laws afford adequate protection to investors, and that the
Commission is able to discharge its statutory responsibilities, unimpeded by
lawsuits against the agency or its staff.
The General Counsel represented the Commission in 289 litigation matters
during the past fiscal year, less than half of which are still pending. During the
fiscal year, 47 Court of Appeals and Supreme Court cases were concluded, all
but four favorably to the Commission. There were 37 appeals before the
Supreme Court and Federal courts of appeals of cases in which a party subject
to a Commission injunctive action challenged the lower court's resolution of
the case in a manner favorable to the Commission or, much less frequently, the
Commission challenged an adverse decision. Of these appeals, 18 were con.
eluded, with only 2 outcomes unfavorable to the Commission. The foregoing
compares with the following cases in fiscal 1984: a total of 276 matters, of
which 42 were appeals of injunctive action cases, Of those appellate cases, 19
were concluded, with only two outcomes unfavorable to the Commission.
There also were 20 appellate and district court actions seeking to overturn
Commission orders, primarily those issued in administrative proceedings or affirming self. regulatory organization disciplinary proceedings against regulated
entities such as broker-dealers. Of these appeals 13 were concluded, with one
adverse result. In fiscal 1984, there were 16 actions, seven of which were con.
c1uded. In each of these cases, the outcome was favorable to the Commission.
The Commission filed amicus curiae briefs in 44 cases during the year (com.
pared to 52 such instances in fiscal year 1984). The Commission participated in

43

16 private cases which were decided; only three of these resulted in a decision
adverse to views advocated by the Commission.
The General Counsel also handled more than 185 other proceedings before
the Commission or in the Federal district courts, compared to 180 in fiscal year
1984. These included 63 suits brought against the Commission or its staff, and
78 suits, including actions under various public information statutes, seeking
access to Commission documents. Of the latter, 54 involved discovery subpoenas in private actions in which the Commission is not a party. In fiscal year
1984, there were 31 suits brought against the Commissioners or the Commission's staff, and 81 suits (including 59 third-party subpoenas) under the various
public information statutes.
In addition to litigation, the General Counsel is involved in significant
legislative and regulatory work. For example, the Office assisted the Chairman
in his participation as a member of the Task Group on Regulation of Financial
Services. This year, the Group released a report, "Blueprint for Reform," and
the Chairman testified in support of its securities law proposals. The Office also
assisted the Commission in considering changes in tender offer regulation, and
in supporting adoption of the Shareholder Communications Act.
During the fiscal year, 138 debtors with securities registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) in the hands of the public
commenced Chapter 11 reorganizations. The Commission entered its appearance in 49 of these cases involving aggregate assets of $6.3 billion and
about 160,000 public investors. In addition, the Commission entered an appearance in five cases to pursue a specific law enforcement interest. A list of
these cases is set forth in Table 34 in the Appendix to this Report.

Litigation
Appeals in Commission Enforcement Actions- This litigation consists
primarily of attempts by defendants in Commission injunctive actions to obtain
reversal by a Court of Appeals of district court decisions finding that they have
violated the law, enjoining them, and/or ordering other ancillary relief such as
disgorgement. In addition, there are occasionally cases where the Commission
is denied relief and takes an appeal.
In SEC u. Blaum, 135 the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
upheld a district court order requiring an investment adviser found to have
engaged in scalping-i.e., buying securities, then recommending them for pur.
chase by customers without disclosing his interest in the stock, and seIling
them after the expected price increase-and other misconduct, to disgorge
$581,000 in illegally obtained profits. The appellate court also approved a plan
that permitted victims of the defendant's fraud to make claims to the disgorge.
ment fund. The court rejected the defendant's argument that he had a constitutional right to challenge claims to the fund and to receive any unclaimed
money, agreeing with the Commission that the purpose of disgorgement is to
force the defendant to give up the amount by which he was unjustly enriched.
In SEC u. Drysdale Securities COrp.,136 the Commission has appealed the
district court's dismissal of the Commission's complaint for injunctive relief
against an audit partner at a major accounting firm for his participation in a
fraud which resulted in the collapse of a government securities dealer, causing

44

losses to institutional investors of almost $300 million. The Commission's
complaint alleged that the accountant engaged in securities fraud by preparing
false financial statements which concealed the dealer's insolvency and induced
institutional investors to trade with it. The district court dismissed the complaint, holding that since the alleged misrepresentations did not pertain to the
government securities traded or to their issuer, they did not occur "in" or "in
connection with" the offers, purchases or sales of securities, and therefore were
not a violation of the Federal securities laws.P? The Commission argues in its
appeal that the district court's construction of the "in" and "in connection with"
requirements is unduly restrictive and contrary to established precedent.
In SEC v. Carter Hawley Hale Stores, 138the Commission sought to enjoin an
issuer's offer to purchase over half of its own common stock in the open
market, made in response to a hostile tender offer by another corporation. The
Commission argued that the issuer's offer was subject to the requirements of
the Commission's tender offer rules, with which the issuer had not complied.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district
court's finding that the issuer was not conducting a tender offer. The Commission argued on appeal that Carter Hawley's offer was a tender offer under Rule
13e-4,139because the offer was designed to inflict on shareholders the same
harmful economic effects that Congress sought to eliminate in enacting the
Williams Act. The Commission urged that any offer designed to pressure
shareholders into selling precipitously constitutes a tender offer. The Commission also argued that the eight-factor test proposed by the Commission in 1979
and adopted in the case of Wellman v. Dickinson, 140applied flexibly and with a
view toward the purposes of the Williams Act, also established that the Carter
Hawley offer was a tender offer. The Court of Appeals held that the appropriate
standard is the eight-factor test, but that Carter Hawley's offer was not a tender
offer under that standard.
Petitions to Review Commission Orders-Petitions to review Commission
orders arise from Commission administrative proceedings conducted under
various provisions of the Federal securities laws, including orders on review of
disciplinary action by national securities exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), and orders issued under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (Holding Company Act). These administrative
appeals may involve, among other things, issues central to the Commission's
enforcement program and thus to the integrity of the securities markets, or
questions of interpretation of the securities statutes.
For example, in Mister Discount Stockbrokers v. SEC,141 the United States
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that it would not entertain
arguments concerning alleged constitutional defects in the NASD's disciplinary
process that petitioner had not raised before the Commission in its review of
the NASD's decision. The court also addressed and rejected petitioner's contention that the NASD's failure to provide for discovery violated his due process
rights. The court held that petitioner had failed to show any prejudice resulting
from a lack of discovery, let alone prejudice so significant as to result in a
denial of due process.
In Eichler v. SEC, 142the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
affirmed a Commission decision which upheld NASD sanctions against two of-

45

ficers of a brokerage firm that took customer orders for stock, and then failed
to fill the orders promptly and completely, in violation of just and equitable
principles of trade.
And in Arkansas Public Service Commission v. SEC, 143 the United States
Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was asked to review Commission orders
under the Holding Company Act, approving $560 million in continued financing for a nearly operational nuclear powered generating plant being constructed by a utility holding company system. The Commission determined
that the assignment of an indemnity obligation, as part of the collateral for
bonds to be issued, was not the issuance or sale of a security for purposes of the
Holding Company Act. The petition for review was later voluntarily dismissed.
Commission Participation in Private Utigation- The Commission also participates as a friend of the court in selected private litigation that involves
significant securities law issues. This is an important supplement to the enforcement program. Because the Federal securities laws provide for private
remedies as well as governmental enforcement actions, decisions in private
cases may have precedential effect on the Commission's own regulatory activities.
In Austin Municipal Securities v. National Association of Securities Dealers, 144
the Court of Appeals, as urged by the Commission, held (1) that the NASD, a
securities association registered with the Commission, and its officials are absolutely immune from damage suits alleging torts committed during the NASD
disciplinary process; and (2) that, in view of the pervasive regulatory structure
created by the Exchange Act, the Federal antitrust laws are impliedly repealed
with respect to the NASD's disciplinary process.
In Moran v. Household International, 145 the Commission filed an amicus brief
in the Supreme Court of Delaware urging that a "poison pill" defense to tender
offers adopted by Household International's board without submission to its
shareholders is not in the interests of the corporation's shareholders. The Commission argued that the poison pill plan would have the effects of entrenching
management and preventing any tender offer for the corporation that is not approved by management, and would also deter proxy contests against management. Such results, the Commission argued, based on its experience in enforcing and administering
the Williams Act, is contrary to the interests of
Household's shareholders in that it is in the shareholders' interests to be able to
consider tender offers on their merits.
In Austin v. Lottsqearden, 146 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit, sitting en bane, reaffirmed its earlier decision that in calculating rescissionary damages in a private action under Section 12(2) of the Securities Act of
1933 (Securities Act) for fraud in the sale of a tax shelter investment, the plaintiffs losses should be offset by the amount of the plaintiffs tax savings. The
Commission had urged, in an amicus brief, that the plaintiffs losses should not
be offset by tax savings; the Commission would, however, permit prejudgment
interest to be adjusted to account for net tax savings. This issue has divided the
Courts of Appeals, with the Second Circuit agreeing with the Eighth Circuit,
and the Ninth Circuit disagreeing. A petition for a writ of certiorari is pending.
In Angelastro v. Prudential-Bache Securities, 147 the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, agreeing with the views expressed by the Commis-

46

sion as amicus curiae, held that misrepresentations and omissions concerning
the margin interest rates charged by a brokerage firm on a customer's margin
account are "in connection with" the customer's purchase and sale of securities
through that account. This establishes a violation of the antifraud provisions of
Section 1O(b)of the Exchange Act and Rule lOb-5 thereunder. The court of appeals also held, as urged by the Commission, that a private right of action exists
under Commission Rule lOb.16, which requires brokerage firms to disclose
margin account credit terms to their customers.
In Busch v. Cerpenier.r'" the Commission filed an amicus brief in the United
States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. The brief reiterated the Cornrnission's longstanding view that the intrastate offering exemption from securities
registration under the Securities Act is only available where the distribution of
the issuer's stock (including any distribution made by persons buying from the
issuer with a view to resale) occurs exclusively in its state of residence, and
where the issuer does the predominant part of its business, and uses the
predominant part of the offering proceeds, in that state. The district court had
held the exemption available to an issuer which had not proven it satisfied
those criteria.
In Michaels v. Michaels, 149 the Commission submitted for filing an amicus
memorandum, in connection with a rehearing petition, in which the Commission urged the Seventh Circuit to delete dictum in its decision stating that
merger negotiations by publicly held companies do not become material, and
need not be disclosed, until there is agreement on price and structure. The
Commission reiterated its view, traditionally accepted by the courts, that the
materiality of merger negotiations must be judged on the facts of each case,
looking to the significance of the merger to the company and the probability of
its occurrence, and may become material well before there is agreement on
price and structure. Following submission of the Commission's memorandom,
the Seventh Circuit amended its decision to delete that dictum. 150
Trading on Material Non-Pudic Information-The
issue of when trading on
material non-public information violates the Federal securities laws continues
to be actively litigated. This year the Commission submitted amicus briefs in
support of the prosecution in two criminal cases in which it was charged, and in
which the courts agreed, that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions
of the Federal securities laws when they traded, or tipped others who traded, on
the basis of misappropriated information. In United States v. Reed,151 the court
refused to dismiss a count of an indictment charging securities fraud, finding
that if, as alleged, the defendant traded in securities on the basis of information
he misappropriated from his father, a corporate director, in breach of their confidential relationship, it would constitute a violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule lOb-5 thereunder. Similarly, in United States v. Winans, 152
the court held, in finding the defendants guilty of violating Section 10(b) and
Rule lOb-5, that they had traded on material non-public information that one
defendant, a newspaper columnist, misappropriated from his employer and tipped to the others, and that such trading violated those provisions.
In Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. v. Berner, 153 the Supreme Court held, as
urged by the Commission as amicus curiae, that a securities salesman and a
corporate insider could not use the in pari delicto, or "equal fault," defense to

47

bar a private Rule lOb-5 action by investors to whom they allegedly gave
fraudulent "tips" of purported inside information. Because of the important role
played by private Rule 1Ob-5 actions in the effective enforcement of the Federal
securities laws, the Court held that the in pari delicto defense should be narrowly limited to bar such actions only when the plaintiffs truly bear at least substantially equal responsibility for their injuries and where precluding them from suing would not significantly interfere with the effective enforcement of the
securities laws. The Court found neither condition met.
And in Bianco v. Texas tnstruments,'?' the Commission submitted a
memorandum amicus curiae urging that prior to the 1984 amendments to the
Exchange Act, corporate insiders who traded in options rather than stock of
their corporation while in possession of material, nonpublic information
violated Section 10(b) and Rule lOb-5 thereunder. The 1984 amendments expressly provided that such trading is illegal. The Commission argued that these
amendments did not change prior law, but clarified it. Given the interrelation
between the options market and the stock market, and the fact that trading in
options can generate far greater profits than trading in the underlying stock, the
Commission urged the court to reject the defendants' contention that, prior to
1984, there was a loophole in the law permitting insider options trading. The
case is pending.
Definition of a Security- The question of what constitutes a security continues to be litigated. This year, the Supreme Court resolved one issue that had
sharply divided the Courts of Appeals.
In Landreth Timber v. Landreth, 155 and Gould v. Reuienecht, 156 the Supreme
Court agreed with the Commission, which participated in the cases as amicus
curiae, that the sale of a controlling stock interest in a business is a securities
transaction subject to the antifraud provisions of the Federal securities laws. In
Landreth, the Court held that the sale of 100 percent of the stock of a business
was subject to the antifraud provisions. In Gould, the Court held that the sale of
a controlling, but less than 100 percent interest, was subject to those provisions. In so ruling, the Court resolved a split in the Courts of Appeals over
whether stock sold in such transactions constitutes securities under the Federal
securities laws.
In another case, SEC v. Goldfield Deep Mines,157the Court of Appeals, in affirming a permanent injunction obtained against the defendants by the Commission, held that sales of gold ore coupled with refining contracts constituted investment contracts, and thus were securities subject to the Federal securities
laws. The court held that because the investment was in a common enterprise
in which both the promoter's and investors' profits were dependent on the success of the promoter's efforts, and because the investors expected profits from
those efforts, an investment contract, which is defined as a security under the
Federal securities laws, existed.
Challenges to the Commission
Authority Under the Investment Advisers
Act-In two challenges to the Commission's authority under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (Investment Advisers Act) to protect the investing public
from abusive practices by publishers of investment advisory services, the
courts dealt with important issues.

s

48

In Lowe v. SEC, 158 the Supreme Court held, construing the statutory exclusion from the definition of "investment adviser" in the Act, that impersonal investment advisory publishers are exempt from the coverage of the Act so long
as their advice is disinterested and they publish on a regular basis. On the other
hand, covered by the Act are "touts" and "tipsters," that is, publishers whose
advice is not disinterested or whose publications are timed to take advantage of
market events. The decision overturns a ruling by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit that Lowe's advisory publications were subject
to the Act and could be enjoined consistent with the First Amendment for
failure to comply with the Act's registration requirements. The Court did not
find it necessary to reach Lowe's First Amendment challenges, although three
members of the Court indicated in a concurring opinion that, if applied to
Lowe, the Act's registration provisions would violate the First Amendment as
an improper prior restraint on speech.
In Suter v. SEC, 159 a case decided shortly after the Supreme Court decided
Lowe, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the
Commission's order revoking the Investment Advisers Act registration of a
newsletter publisher because he had engaged in fraud in connection with the
publication of his newsletter. The court held that Lowe did not prevent the
Commission from revoking the registration of the publisher since revocation
did not forbid him from publishing, within the limitations set forth in Lowe. The
court also held that the publisher's First Amendment challenges to the Act
were not properly raised in a proceeding to revoke his registration. The court
reasoned that any constitutional infirmity, even if present, would not entitle the
publisher to be reinstated, and that the publisher could raise his constitutional
challenges if the Commission sought to enjoin the actual publication of his
newsletters.
Commission Action Under Rule 2(e)-Under Rule 2(e) of its Rules of Practice,
the Commission may suspend or bar from practicing before it professionals
who have willfully violated the Federal securities laws or engaged in improper
professional conduct. Accountants and lawyers play a critical role in the
disclosure of full and accurate information to the investing public, and the ability to discipline those who have engaged in violative conduct is necessary to
protect the Commission's processes.
In the last year, the Commission instituted five Rule 2(e) proceedings against
six individual accountants. Respondents in four proceedings resigned or have
been suspended from practice before the Commission. Under the
Commission's orders in these proceedings, before these professionals may be
readmitted to practice, they must demonstrate that they will be subject to adequate supervision and that they have undertaken further professional education. The one remaining proceeding is pending.
In re Coopers & Lybrand and M. Bruce Cohen, c.P.A. 160 centered on whether
consolidated financial statements are necessary to accurately depict the operations of nominally separate corporations which in fact comprise a single
economic entity. The Commission charged that Coopers & Lybrand and one of
its partners violated generally accepted accounting principles in failing to require that the financial statements of Digilog, Inc. and Digilog Business
Systems, Inc. be consolidated. Although Digilog Business Systems had been

49

set up as an "independent" corporation, the Commission alleged the contractual and operating relationships between the two companies were such that
they should have been viewed as constituting a single enterprise for reporting
purposes. Had the accounting treatment reflected the underlying economic
reality, shareholders would have seen that it was actually Digilog which was at
risk for the heavy losses incurred by Digilog Business Systems in establishing a
new marketing program for Digilog products. Coopers and Cohen consented to
a settlement which included an opinion by the Commission concluding that
consolidation would have provided the user of the financial statements with the
most meaningful presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
In another Rule 2(e) proceeding, In the Matter of Russell G. Davy, \6\ also involving an accountant, the Commission, following an evidentiary hearing,
issued an order under Rule 2(e) permanently barring a certified public accountant from appearing or practicing before the Commission. The Commission
found that the accountant had violated the Federal securities laws and had
engaged in improper professional conduct in auditing the financial statements
of a publicly held corporation. The accountant recklessly failed to discover that
the corporation had included in the audited financial statements, assets that it
did not own and operations that did not exist. The accountant's appeal of the
Commission's decision is pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit.162

:\.

Litigation Involving Requests for Access to Commission Records-Although
the Commission received numerous Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and
confidential treatment requests in fiscal 1985, only two of those requests
resulted in the filing of court actions against the Commission; both of these actions are pending. The Commission received 1,710 requests under the FOIA for
access to Commission records, a decrease of 2.5% over fiscal 1984. Approximately half of the 1985 results were for investigatory files. The Commission
also received 2,282 requests for confidential treatment from persons who submitted information, an increase of 13% over fiscal 1984. In fiscal 1985,77 requestors appealed the denial or partial denial of FOIA requests to the Commission's General Counsel, who has delegated authority to decide such appeals.
Additionally, 12 confidential treatment requesters appealed the denial of their
requests.
The Commission was served with 34 discovery subpoenas in fiscal 1985 in
private actions in which the Commission is not a party. These private parties
seek information from Commission investigatory files or testimony from present or former Commission employees related to their pending litigation.
Litigation Against the Commission and Its Staff-During 1985, the Commission and its staff were defendants in 18 district court actions in which persons
sought to enjoin Commission law enforcement efforts or to obtain damages
awards. The Commission prevailed in 10 decided cases; eight cases are still
pending, one of which includes 318 individual Federal tort claims.
In Kendrick v. Zenides, 163 the plaintiffs had filed suit against a number of
Federal employees, including three members of the Commission's staff, alleging violations of their constitutional and common law rights in connection with
a Commission investigation that led to plaintiffs 1983 conviction for securities

50

fraud and perjury. The district court granted the defendants' motion for sum.
mary judgment, holding that there was no basis in law or fact for plaintiffs'
frivolous claims. In addition, the court directed plaintiffs and their counsel to
pay the defendants' reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees. The Court
also ruled, sua sponte, that plaintiffs' attorneys' conduct in bringing the action
raised questions concerning their fitness to practice law and ordered them to
show cause why they should not be suspended from practice before the Federal
court.
The Commission was awarded attorney's fees in another action against the
Commission and its staff. In Sprecher v. von Stein, 164 the plaintiff sued the Commission, the Commissioners and three staff members, alleging that the staff
had commenced an informal, preliminary investigation for the sole purpose of
harassing him. The plaintiff alleged violations of his constitutional rights as well
as various common law torts. The court dismissed the suit for failure to state a
claim. Alternatively, it granted summary judgment for the defendants, holding
that the law suit had been a bad faith attempt to thwart a lawful and legitimate
investigation by wrongly accusing the Commission employees conducting the
inquiry of engaging in improper conduct. The court ordered the plaintiff to pay
the defendants' reasonable costs and attorney's fees.
In Chicago Board of Trade v. CFTC and SEC, 165 the CBT challenged the joint
action of the Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC) in publishing an interpretation relating to applications for designation
as contract markets for futures contracts on nondiversified stock indexes composed of securities of domestic issuers (or options on such futures contracts)
under the standards of Section 2(aX1XB) of the Commodity Exchange Act
(CEA). The CBT argued that the guidelines are contrary to the expressstatutory
provisions of the CEA and were promulgated in violation of the Administrative
Procedure Act. As urged by the Commission and the CFTC, the district court
dismissed the case under the doctrines of failure to exhaust administrative
remedies and lack of ripeness.
In addition, five actions were filed under the Right to Financial Privacy Act
seeking to block the Commission from obtaining accessto customer records at
banks and other financial institutions. In fiscal 1984, 15 such actions had been
filed. In all of these cases, the district court found that the Commission was pro.
perly seeking the subpoenaed records for a legitimate law enforcement inquiry
and enforced the Commission's subpoenas.
Finally, four motions were handled in the district courts and the Courts of
Appeals under the Equal Access to Justice Act seeking attorneys fees and expenses. Of those motions, all were decided in the Commission's favor.

Significant Legislation
Financial Services Industry-Vice Presidential Task Group-The Task Group
on Regulation of Financial Services, chaired by Vice President Bush, resulted in
part from the Chairman's proposal that a one-year task force be formed to
review the regulatory structure for the securities, banking, thrift, and insurance
industries; that financial services be regulated by functional activities rather
than by outmoded industry classification; that overlapping, duplicative, and

51

conflicting regulatory activities be consolidated; and that excessive regulations
within and between agencies be eliminated.
The Chairman participated as a member of the Task Group, and, on
November 16, 1984, the Group released its report, "Blueprint For Reform." The
report contained proposals to substantially reorganize the Federal regulatory
system for depository institutions. The securities law proposals include repeal
of the exemptions in the Securities Act for registration of securities issued by
banks and savings and loan associations and the transfer to the SEC of administration of the periodic reporting, proxy solicitation, and short-swing profits provisions of the Exchange Act as they relate to such institutions. These initiatives would consolidate administration of securities disclosure requirements
for banks and savings and loan associations, resulting in more uniform financial disclosure to public shareholders and securities analysts and facilitating
evaluation of comparative investment risks. Delays in conforming regulations
governing banks and savings and loan association filings with those applicable
to other issuers would be eliminated and duplication of agency staff requirements would be reduced. The Commission would become the repository
for filings of all publicly held banks, savings and loan associations, and holding
companies, as it is for all publicly-owned companies.
On March 25, 1985, the Chairman testified in support of the Task Group's
securities law proposals, before the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Con.
sumer and Monetary Affairs of the Committee on Government Operations.
During fiscal 1985, the Office of the General Counsel assisted the Task Group's
staff in drafting legislation to implement its proposals.
Tender Offer Reform-On May 20, 1985, the Commission voted to continue
to support its 1984 proposal to amend the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act. This proposal would allow
the Commission to (a) require immediate public announcement of the acquisition of more than five percent of a class of equity securities; (b) shorten the current time period for filing of the Schedule 13D; and (c) restrict the acquisition of
additional shares for a period not to extend beyond the second business day
after the Schedule 13D filing. This proposal was developed by the Office of the
General Counsel with the Division of Corporation Finance.
The Office of the General Counsel also prepared extensive testimony on
tender offer regulation. Chairman Shad testified on tender offer regulation
before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on October 2, 1984, before the Senate Subcommittee on Securities on April 4, 1985,
and before the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Consumer Protection and Finance on May 23, 1985.
Regulation of the Government Securities Markels- The Chairman and other
Commission officials testified before several Congressional committees concerning the failures of ESM Government Securities, Inc., Bevill Bresler
Schulman Asset Management Corp., and other government securities dealers.
At the request of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Consumer Pro.
tection and Finance of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the
Commission, in consultation with the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and the
Department of Treasury, prepared a report on the government securities
markets and the issue of additional regulation of that market.

52

The agencies differed on the necessity for legislation, but jointly reported
that, if Congress concluded legislation was necessary, the following approach
would be acceptable: (1) all currently unregulated government securities
dealers should be required to be registered (the Commission and the Treasury
differed as to which should be the registrar); (2) the Commission and the bank
regulators be given the authority to sanction those who violate either the
securities or the banking laws; and (3) the Treasury, in consultation with the
FRB, be given the authority to adopt rules concerning capital, independent
audits and recordkeeping, and collateralization and when-issued trading practices. Under this approach, inspection and rule enforcement for non-bank
dealers would be vested in existing self-regulatory organizations, under Com.
mission oversight, and for bank dealers in the banking agencies.
While the Commission did not conduct a formal cost-benefit analysis, it
recommended that if legislation was to be enacted, the joint agency approach
be followed, with two changes. First, registration of currently unregulated
dealers would be with the Commission. Second, rulemaking authority would
consist of capital, independent audit and recordkeeping requirements.
SharehoLder Communications Act-In fiscal 1985 the Commission continued
to support the adoption of the Shareholder Communications Act, introduced in
the 99th Congress and developed by the Office of the General Counsel and the
Division of Corporation Finance. The legislation would amend Section 14(b) of
the Exchange Act to authorize the Commission to regulate the dissemination
of proxy materials by banks, associations and other entities in the same fashion
as the Commission now regulates the dissemination of proxy materials by
broker-dealers. This proposal contains a one-year delayed effective date. It was
introduced in both houses of Congress in 1985, passed by the House of
Representatives on July 22, 1985, and referred to the Senate.

Corporate

Reorganizations

The Commission acts in a statutory advisor's role in reorganization cases
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to ensure that interests of public investors are adequately represented. In these cases, administered in Federal
court, a debtor generally is allowed to continue operations under court protection while it negotiates a plan to rehabilitate its business and to pay its debts.
Reorganization plans often provide for the issuance to creditors and
shareholders of new securities in exchange for part or all of their claims or interests in the debtor under an exemption from registration under the Securities
Act provided by the Bankruptcy Code.
In its capacity as special advisor, the Commission may raise or present its
views on any issue in a Chapter 11 case, but it may not initiate an appeal.
Although Chapter 11 relief is available to businesses of all sizes, the Commission generally limits its participation to cases involving debtors that have
publicly-traded securities registered under the Exchange Act. In fiscal 1985, the
Commission presented its views on a variety of issues.
Committees-During
the fiscal year, the Commission moved or supported
motions for the appointment of committees to represent investors in 12
Chapter 11 cases.166 For example, in a case having significance for the

53

representation of equity security holders, In re WheeLing-Pittsburgh SteeL
Corp., 167 the Commission moved for the appointment of a single equity security holder's committee to represent common stockholders and two classes of
preferred stockholders. The Commission recognized that the three classes of
equity interests have different legal rights, but practical considerations, in.
c1uding the substantial additional costs of administration and problems of
locating holders of each class willing to serve, made a single committee to
represent all interests appropriate at an early stage of the case. The Commission urged the court, however, to appoint a committee composed of representatives of each class proportionate to their interest in the estate, and pointed
out that if a conflict of interest later developed between the classesof equity interests, the court could at that time appoint additional committees or
reconstitute the committee. The Commission's motion is pending.
In another case appealed to the district court, In re The Charter Co., 168 the
Commission filed a brief supporting the bankruptcy court's ruling that indenture trustees are eligible to sit as voting members of a committee. The Commission argued that there was no inherent conflict between fiduciary responsibilities of an indenture trustee to represent debtholders and its fiduciary
responsibilities as a member of the committee also to represent other creditors
of the estate. The Commission pointed out that, if an actual conflict arose on a
particular matter, the indenture trustee could simply recuse itself, relinquish its
voting rights or resign. The appeal is pending.
Trustees and Examiners-Under the Bankruptcy Code, the court may appoint
a trustee either "for cause," including fraud, dishonesty, or gross mismanagement of the debtor's affairs by current management, or in the interests of
creditors or equity security holders. The trustee's primary duties are to operate
the debtor's business, conduct and report to the court the results of the investigation of the debtor and file a plan. Where there is no trustee, an examiner
may be appointed under conditions specified in the Bankruptcy Code. The
Commission participates on questions concerning the appointment of trustees
and examiners and the scope of their duties because of the important role that
these independent fiduciaries play in protecting the interests of public investors
and because information developed in a related enforcement investigation may
demonstrate the need for such an appointment. This fiscal year, the Commission supported successful motions to appoint trustees in In re Kenneth B.
Osborrour'" and In re State Capital Corp. 170
Estate Administration-In
In re Air Florida Systems, 171 the bankruptcy court
found that the value of the debtor, a commercial airline, was a wasting asset
and that its going concern value was of a perishable nature. The Commission
supported, on appeal to the district court, the bankruptcy court's order approving the debtor's application to sell substantially all of its property outside a plan
of reorganization. The Commission sought to strike an appropriate balance
between the need of a debtor to have flexibility in the sale of assetsand the fact
that a sale of substantially all of the company's assets not pursuant to a plan
undermines investor and creditor suffrage, disclosure, and plan confirmation
protections in the Bankruptcy Code. On appeal, the Commission argued, and
the district court held, that the bankruptcy court's findings were consistent with
the standard enunciated in In re LioneL Corp., 172 that there must be a showing of

54

adequate business justification for sale of assetsoutside the context of a plan. A
further appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in
which the Commission did not participate, was dismissed as moot, since the
debtor had closed the sale with Midway prior to oral argument. The court
noted, however, that if it were to reach the merits of the issues raised, it would
have affirmed the ruling in question. 173
In two cases this year'?" the Commission urged that a creditor may file a
claim on behalf of a class of other similarly situated claimants, thereby invoking the class action procedures recognized in ordinary Federal civil litigation
outside of bankruptcy. The Commission maintained that the filing of a class
claim by a putative class representative is fully consistent with bankruptcy principles since it affords the debtor notice of the type and amount of potential
claims outstanding and enables the debtor to formulate a reorganization plan.
The Commission suggested that where a debtor desires more specific information concerning the nature and scope of the class claim, class action procedures permit a notice to be sent to all class members which requires the filing
of individual claims.
In the Baldwin United case the bankruptcy court rejected the Commission's
arguments that a class representative can file a claim on behalf of the class as
their agent, and found that class claims could not be used to protect the rights
of creditors who failed to file their own claims. An appeal to the district court is
pending.
In re Standard Metals"? also raised the issue of whether a debtor which had
taken no steps to effect notice to potential creditors not listed on its schedules
filed with the court, may invoke the procedures of the Bankruptcy Code to cut
off the right of such creditors to participate in the reorganization. The bankruptcy court had concluded that, since the claim based on violations of the Federal
securities laws by the debtor was unknown to the debtor prior to establishment
of the claims bar date, notice of the bar date was not required. On appeal to the
district court, the Commission urged that where there is a reasonable
likelihood that the debtor may not be able to identify all potential creditors
because of the nature and scope of the debtor's business operations, due process at least requires publication notice of a claims bar date calculated to reach
unscheduled creditors. The appeal is pending.
In two other cases the Commission objected to proposals that granted
significant managerial authority over the debtor to persons other than a trustee
or debtor in possession. The Commission was concerned that these other persons did not possessthe fiduciary duties which are imposed by the Bankruptcy
Code upon those who manage the affairs of the debtor in the interests of the entire estate. In In re Pizza Time Tbeetre.t" the bankruptcy court approved an
agreement ousting the debtor's chief executive officer and replacing him with a
"responsible officer," and removing the debtor's board of directors from any
control over the debtor's business. The Commission urged reconsideration of
the order, arguing that the powers accorded to this officer were more akin to
those of a receiver, a type of official that the court is specifically prohibited
from appointing under Chapter 11. In the Commission's view, the Bankruptcy
Code did not authorize the removal of incumbent management except through

55

the appointment of a disinterested trustee. The bankruptcy judge denied the
Commission's objection without comment.
In In re Unioll, J77 the Commission raised a similar objection to a compromise
agreement between the unsecured creditors' committee and the debtor in
possession, which would appoint a "consultant" to the creditors' committee
who was to be given extensive managerial authority over the day-to-day operations of the debtor conducted by the debtor in possession. The Commission's
objection was grounded on the fact that the appointment provided for the exercise of managerial authority by a partisan representative of the creditors, rather
than a fiduciary having duties to all the interests of the estate, including public
investors. The court overruled the Commission's objection, but noted that it
would entertain promptly any objection regarding the consultant's actions.
In In re Ale Photo, 178 the debtor's application to use cash collateral to purchase inventory for its ordinary business operations was opposed by a major
secured creditor. In approving the bulk of the debtor's application, the court
adopted the legal standard urged by the Commission that, where a secured
creditor is found to be adequately protected, expenditures for ordinary business
operations such as inventory should be approved absent a finding that the debtor should not be permitted to operate its business. The bankruptcy court noted
that to deny the debtor the ability to continue as a going concern would harm
the interests of the other creditors and the stockholders.
'Plans of Reorganization/Disclosure Statements-A
disclosure statement is a
combination proxy and offering statement used in connection with the acceptance of a plan of reorganization which often includes the exchange of new
securities for claims and interests of creditors and shareholders in the debtor.
The Bankruptcy Code provides that adequate disclosure is to be made without
regard to whether or not the information provided would otherwise comply with
the disclosure requirements of the Federal securities laws. But, in recognition
of the Commission's special expertise on disclosure questions, bankruptcy
rules require service on the Commission of all disclosure statements, and the
Bankruptcy Code recognizes the Commission's right to be heard, distinct from
its special advisory role, on the adequacy of disclosure.
During the fiscal year, the Commission received approximately 3,600
disclosure statements filed in Chapter 11 cases involving both privately-held
and publicly-held corporations. The staff reviewed every statement filed in
cases in which the Commission entered an appearance, totalling 54, and 174
others.
The Commission staff reviews disclosure statements to determine whether
the plan proposed involves the issuance of securities consistent with the exemption from registration in the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise in compliance
with the Federal securities laws. The Commission also reviews disclosure
statements to determine whether there is adequate disclosure concerning the
proposed plan. Generally, the Commission seeks to resolve questions concerning bankruptcy disclosure through staff comments to the plan proponent. If
those cannot be resolved through this process, the Commission may object to
the disclosure statement in the bankruptcy court.
During the fiscal year the Commission commented on disclosure statements
in 168 cases. Two objections pressed by the Commission in the bankruptcy

56

court are particularly significant. In In re Lionel Corp.,179the Commission
reiterated its objections to a disclosure statement previously filed that failed to
include financial projections to support an opinion that the plan of reorganization was economically feasible. The bankruptcy court agreed with the Commission and ordered the inclusion of financial projections.
In In re Unioil,180 the bankruptcy court, as urged by the Commission, held that
the debtor's five-page disclosure statement, which failed to include current
financial information, projections of future performance, alternatives to the
proposed plan, or information regarding new management, was inadequate as
a matter of law. The court directed the debtor to file an amended disclosure
statement. Subsequently the bankruptcy court approved the debtor's amended
disclosure statement over the objections of the Commission. The Commission
argued that the amended disclosure statement still did not contain adequate information as that term is defined in Section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code. The
bankruptcy court acknowledged that the disclosure statement did not itself
contain necessary information, but nevertheless found that the statement was
sufficient to put persons on "inquiry notice" and directed the debtor to furnish
additional information to persons who requested it. The Commission authorized the staff to pursue the objection, by supporting an appeal taken by a
creditor, that "inquiry notice" established a new legal standard of disclosure
which conflicts with the express provisions of Section 1125. The Commission
urged that such a rule deprives persons voting on the plan of information
necessary to make an informed judgment about whether to accept or reject a
plan. The creditor subsequently withdrew its appeal without resolution of the
Commission's objection by the appellate court.

Compliance with the Registration Requirements of the Securities Act-Section
1145 of the Bankruptcy Code contains a limited exemption from registration
under the Securities Act for the distribution of securities by a debtor, or an affiliate or successor to the debtor, pursuant to a plan of reorganization and in exchange for claims against or securities of the debtor. The issuance of securities
pursuant to a plan is deemed to be a "public offering" which means that there is
no restriction on resale of such securities unless the seller is an "underwriter" as
specifically defined in Section 1145(b). There was significant litigation in the
bankruptcy courts this year over the scope of this exemption. In In re Intemational Waste Water Management Reclamation Technologies, 181 the Commission
objected to a proposed sale of a debtor's assets in exchange for stock of an
unrelated entity on the ground that the proposed transaction violated the
Securities Act registration provisions. In the Commission's view, the proposed
sale was not within the scope of Section 1145 because(1) the shareswere being
sold to the debtor's trustee not pursuant to a reorganization plan, and (2) the
issuer was not a debtor, or an affiliate or successor to the debtor. The Commission subsequently withdrew its objections upon agreement of the issuer to
register the shares under the Securities Act.
In In re The Diet Institute, 182 the Commission objected to a debtor's request
that the bankruptcy court declare stock sold to three entities outside of a plan
of reorganization and not in exchange for claims or interests in the debtor exempt from registration under the Securities Act and freely tradeable. The Commission argued that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enter the

57

declaratory relief sought and that, in any event, the issuance of the shares was
clearly not encompassed by the Bankruptcy Code exemption from registration.
In light of the Commission's objection, the debtor withdrew its exemption application.
In In re Amarex, 163 the Commission, in response to a request for its views, advised the bankruptcy court that a triangular merger proposed in a reorganization plan complied with Section 1145. The plan proposed that assets of the
debtor be transferred to an entity specially organized to acquire those assets,
and that the parent corporation would exchange its stock for claims and interests in the debtor. The Commission stated that the parent may be deemed to
be a "successor" of the debtor under Section 1145. The bankruptcy court, relying on the Commission's views, ruled that the proposed sale of securities by the
parent was exempt under Section 1145.

58

Management, Economic Analysis and
Program Support

With the Commission's operating environment undergoing unprecedented
change, the staff must provide objective economic and statistical analysis and
manage financial and human resources in an effective and efficient manner to
support achievement of the Commission's mission.

Key 1985 Management and Program Developments
Among the most noteworthy of the Commission's Fiscal 1985 accomplishments was the continued progress made toward an operational electronic disclosure system. See the Edgar section, page 19.
In a related effort, a series of office automation projects were undertaken.
This program is designed to demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of stateof-the-art computer applications to operations in line offices and divisions. The
demonstration results will be applied to the future implementation of
Commission-wide office automation. The Executive Director's Office conducted management studies of the Office of the Secretary and the Public Utility
Holding Company program. The latter resulted in a series of recommendations
leading to the transfer of the program to the Division of Investment Management. During the year, headquarters staff coordinated two conferences for
regional administrators to address important substantive and administrative
issues affecting the operation of the Commission's nine regional offices.

Economic Research and Statistics
The economic research and statistics program provides the Commission and
the operating divisions with an objective economic perspective and the
technical support required to evaluate the economic aspects of the Commission's regulatory program. This task is carried out by the Office of the Chief
Economist and the Directorate of Economic and Policy Analysis.
The economics staff provides the Commission with economic advice and
research studies on rule proposals, established policy and the capital markets.
The staff assists the Commission in making decisions affecting the efficiency
and structure of our nation's securities industry and markets. In addition, the
program encompasses statistical monitoring of major program initiatives impacting the securities industry and markets and publication of the SEC's
Monthly Statistical Review.
Changes in the marketplace have increased the number and complexity of
economic issues coming before the Commission. New and more complex
market structures and trading systems are evolving, which increase the need
for economic analysis.

59

During fiscal 1985, the economic staff reviewed 89 rules and rule proposals.
Rule reviews emphasized the economic costs and benefits of alternative approaches to regulation. In addition, advice was given to the operating divisions
on requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), particularly focused on
the economic effects for reducing regulatory burdens on small business entities. In fiscal 1985 the economic staff reviewed 24 RFA analyses and 33 RFA
certifications. During the same time 13 monitoring programs were developed
or maintained to study the Irnplementation of major rules, new trading facilities
or program changes implemented by self-regulatory organizations. The
economic staff also provided advice, technical assistance and empirical
analysis of many issues of concern to the Commission and its operating divisions.
Staff economists analyzed rule proposals related to the concentration of the
customers' margin debits held by broker-dealers and prepared an analysis of
the costs and benefits of possible approaches to regulating currently
unregulated dealers in government securities. Another project analyzed the
proposal by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and certain
exchanges to establish a standardized options market in NASDAQ traded
securities and examined two proposals that would permit unlisted trading
privileges on exchanges with respect to NASDAQ securities and would make
all National List securities eligible for NMS designation.
During fiscal 1985 the economic staff published a comprehensive study
(Capital Study) of the financing and regulatory capital needs of the securities industry. This sti Jy was prepared in conjunction with a concept release in which
the Commission requested public comment on a broad range of regulatory
policy issues regarding the net capital and other financial responsibility rules
for broker-dealers. The economic staff also examined the effectiveness and
costs of maintaining Rule 15c2-11.
The economics staff organized for the Commission the Economic Forum on
Tender Offers in which leading experts from academia and business aired their
views on this subject in a public forum. The economics staff produced three
major studies in the corporate control/tender offer area. One of these evaluated
the relationship between institutional ownership, tender offers, and long-term
investments. Another was an economic analysis of any-or-all, partial, and twotier tender offers. The third dealt with the economic impact of anti-takeover
charter amendments. The relationship of the length of the offer to the percent
of outstanding shares tendered was also analyzed. Shareholder receptivity to
anti-takeover proposals by management was also examined. In other areas, the
staff did a study of the Eurobond market and another of the effects of Rule 415
on revenues and profits of national and regional brokerage firms.
The economic staff continued to monitor the effect of Rule 415 (the Shelf
Rule) on corporate issues, underwriters and securities markets.
Two research projects completed during fiscal 1985 related to the statutory
requirement that investment company shares can only be sold at a price stated
in the prospectus. One project examined the shift from a market completely
dominated by funds sold with sales charges by salesmen to one in which the
majority of funds are offered to investors without a sales charge. The other

60

project analyzed the relationship of fund sales to market performance of the
investment company.
Other issues analyzed during fiscal 1985 included the proposed quarterly filing requirement of sales and net profits by business segments of corporate
issuers operating in multiple lines of business and the use of less complex rules
affecting shareholder resales of restricted securities that would encourage
capital formation while providing necessary protection to investors.

Information Systems

Management

The Commission made continued progress under its Productivity Improvement by Computer (PIC) program with the design of a number of innovative
systems. Among them was an on-line Corporation Index System to provide the
staff and the public with summary information about corporations registered
with the Commission. Another enables staff members to check stock purchase
prohibitions and disclosure requirements contained in the Commission's conduct regulations prior to personal financial transactions. In addition, the Com.
mission was one of the first federal agencies to develop and implement a merit
pay information system, as required by recent changes to the federal personnel
regulations.
Efforts were also directed toward the modernization of existing systems. Of
particular note are efforts over the past year to enhance the Name Relationship
Search System and to integrate that system with all other enforcement information systems. The staff also developed a retirement component for the Com.
mission's recently revamped payroll system.
Expansion of microcomputer technology remains an important aspect of the
PIC effort. During the past year, the number of microcomputers employed by
the staff grew to 150, a 33% increase over the previous year. This growth was
accompanied by a corresponding increase in the services provided by the User
Support Information Center (USIC). Over 200 training courses were provided,
with total enrollment exceeding 1200. In addition, USIC fielded over 1300
technical assistance inquiries from staff members.
During 1985, all of the Commission's local teleprocessing terminals were
replaced with upgraded units. The Commission also acquired and installed a
high speed laser printer to replace two less efficient conventional printers.

Financial Management
For the third year in succession and only the fourth year in its history, the
Commisison collected fees in excess of its annual appropriation. By year end, a
record $144 million in fees had been collected for deposit to the General Fund
of the Treasury. This represents 135% of the agency's appropriation and ex.
ceeds by $22 million the previous record amount, collected in 1984. Fees were
derived from four sources: securities registered under the Securities Act of
1933 (53%), transactions on securities exchanges (26%), tender offer and
merger filings (17%), and miscellaneous filings and reporting fees (5%).
During fiscal 1985, the Commission expanded its use of electronic funds
transfer systems to accommodate the receipt of fees from exchanges and other

61

filers. In excess of $37 million in fees was electronically transmitted from the
exchanges to interest-bearing Treasury accounts, saving the government over
$30,000 in interest revenues. An additional $5 million in miscellaneous fees
was transmitted to Treasury under a "lockbox" arrangement with a commercial
bank, rendering further interest savings.
As part of the government-wide financial management initiative known as
Reform 88, agencies have been urged to consolidate administrative systems
wherever possible. In support of this objective, the Commission has taken steps
to make its highly regarded payroll system available to other agencies seeking
to reduce costly and duplicative administrative systems. During 1985, the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service became the first agency to enter into a shared system arrangement with the Commission. In addition, the Commission made presentations or provided technical assistance to 8 other agencies involved in various administrative system reforms.
A number of important steps were taken to improve internal financial controls. In particular, the staff completed revisions to the agency's accounting
system in order to permit single-entry posting and has begun development of
an automated payments subsystem. These enhancements will improve the accuracy of financial records and ultimately reduce the cost of processing
vouchers. The Commission also instituted the use of the Diner's Card by
employees on official travel. This combined with other efficiencies has reduced
the need for travel advances by 25%.
Microcomputer technology continued to playa central role in the Commission's efforts to improve financial operations. Over the past year, microcomputer applications were devised to track costs associated with temporary
employees, prepare OMB appropriation schedules, and improve contingency
budget planning.
The Comptroller's Office also worked closely with the Office of Internal Audit
to complete an Internal Control Review of the Commission's key financial
management operations.
The Commission is prohibited from accepting reimbursement from
regulated entities. The 1983 Securities Exchange Act amendments, however,
gave the Commission the authority to accept payment and reimbursement
from other organizations to defray the cost of travel and subsistence expenses
incurred by Commissioners and staff participating in meetings and conferences
related to the functions or activities of the SEC. During 1985, Commissioners
participated in 62 meetings/conferences. To pay the costs of attendance,
private entities reimbursed the SEC in the amount of $37,364, while the
government's portion amounted to $5,964. SEC staff participated in 432
meetings/conferences. The SEC was reimbursed in the amount of $156,500;
the government's portion of these costs amounted to $26,389.

Facilities Management
During fiscal 1985, the regional offices required increased administrative
support due to relocations of the Miami, Houston, and Salt Lake branch offices.
Each required considerable space planning and structural design work. In addition, extensive physical alterations were made at headquarters to support program operations of the Divisions of Corporation Finance, Enforcement, and Investment Management, the Office of Internal Audit, Administrative Services,
Public Affairs and the Directorate of Economic Policy and Analysis.

62

In an effort to improve internal control and accounting, an automated property accounting system was established and related property accountability
regulations were revised. The system improves resource planning and property
management by permitting property records to be reconciled with the Commission's financial accounting records.
To reduce the Commission's telecommunications costs, conventional office
telephone systems in the Atlanta, Denver, and Miami offices were replaced with
more efficient direct-line, touchtone systems.
Finally, the Commission's printing facility, recently rated by OMB as among
the best in the federal government, continued its impressive record of productivity improvement. During fiscal 1985, the printing plant produced 49 million
printed pages, an increase of 14% over 1984 production.

Personnel Management
In the current budget environment, it is vital that the Commission manage its
personnel resources efficiently. As a result of prudent staffing practices and an
increased emphasis on computer technology, recent years have witnessed
notable productivity improvements in many of the Commission's program
areas, despite resource limitations.
To improve staffing efficiency, the Commission sought, and was granted,
delegated authority from the Office of Personnel Management to conduct a
recruitment program for security compliance examiners. In addition, the Commission and the OPM cooperated in the design and implementation of
qualification standards for accountants that are closely tailored to the needs of
Commission. This has improved the quality and timeliness of staffing in this
important area.
During fiscal 1985, the Commission achieved a 5% staff reduction through
attrition. The Commission continued efforts to minimize "grade creep" by implementing staffing policies designed to comply with OMB's directive that
agencies reduce staff at the GS 11-15 levels by 2 % by 1986. In addition, an aggressive program of position management was continued, with approximately
50% of the permanent positions subjected to classification reviews during
1985.
The Commission administered an extensive training program designed to
improve the skills and abilities of the staff. During 1985, 900 individuals received training at over 75 courses and seminars.
The staff prepared and distributed revised policy guidelines dealing with
merit promotion, performance appraisals, incentive awards, disciplinary practices, and training. In addition, programs were administered to assist
employees during enrollment periods for health and life insurance programs.
The Commisison also continued to sponsor programs designed to assist
handicapped employees. Courses were offered to improve the communication
skills of hearing impaired employees and to provide instruction to supervisors
of handicapped employees. Finally, the Employee Assistance Program was expanded to provide psychiatric counseling and accessto a greater number of inpatient and out-patient services.

The Office of Public Affairs communicates information on Commission activities to those interested in or affected by Commission actions.
The staff prepares the SEC News Digest, published every business day. It
provides information on virtually all SEC actions: issuer filings, acquisition
reports, rule changes, actions against individuals or corporate entities, releases,
upcoming Commission meetings and events of interest. It is available in the
Public Reference Room, and is published commercially.
Press releases prior to and press briefings after Commission meetings provide insight into proposed and adopted changes in policies and regulation.
Press releases are also issued on upcoming events, on-going programs and/or
special projects. In all, 72 news releases were published during the year. Information on Commission actions is also disseminated every business day
through the Digest, notices of administrative actions, litigation releases and
other appropriate material. Where appropriate, actions are brought to the attention of the national and regional press.
The office directs publication of an annual report that provides information
on Commission activities to Congress, the securities bar and other interested
parties, and, through the Depositary Library System, to selected colleges and
universities throughout the country. A regular newsletter is published and a daily summary of news clips is prepared for Commission employees. In 1984, the
staff responded to approximately 64,500 requests for information from
members of the public and coordinated programs for more than 310 foreign
visitors. Also during the year, publications for use of investors and others interested in the Commission were updated and revised: SEC Publications Guide,
Investigate Before You Invest, What Every Investor Should Know, and The Work
of the SEC.

Consumer Affairs
During fiscal 1985, the Commission's consumer affairs staff handled more
than 30,000 complaints and inquiries. Of these, 44 % involved investor
disputes with registered broker-dealers, 20% concerned issuers of securities,
and 4 % pertained to mutual funds. The remainder were related to transfer
agents, banks and investment advisers.
Matters appearing to entail violations of the Federal securities laws were
referred to an appropriate line division for direct action. Where violations were
not apparent, the staff assisted investors by forwarding complaints either to an
appropriate self-regulatory authority or to the entity that was the subject of the
complaint. In many instances, investors' problems were successfully resolved.
During fiscal 1985, the staff also prepared materials to assist investors in
understanding new investment products, such as government-backed
securities and zero-coupon bonds, and clarifying the jurisdictional responsibilities of the various government regulatory bodies.
During fiscal 1985, 1,710 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and
2,282 requests for confidential treatment were handled. The requests for confidential treatment were typically made in connection with proprietary COr-

64

porate information, and were carefully evaluated to prevent the indiscriminate
and unwarranted release of information exempt from the FOIA. In addition, the
staff processed 46 Privacy Act requests.
Finally, over 18,000 people visited the Commission's Public Reference
Room. To assist these visitors, the staff prepared a booklet explaining the
operation of the Public Reference Room and identifying the types of materials
available for public review.

Equal Employment Opportunity
The Commission continued its program of EEO instruction for the staff. Sixty staff members attended seminars in the headquarters and regional offices
dealing with the principles of equal employment opportunity law and affirmative action, the prevention of discrimination and sexual harassment in the
workplace, and methods for improving employment oportunities for minorities
and women.
While minority employment remained constant during fiscal 1985, the
number of females promoted to supervisory and managerial positions showed
a particularly strong increase.
The contributions and achievements of minority groups were recognized
with special programs highlighting Hispanic Heritage Week, Asian-Pacific
Heritage Week, Women's Week, Afro-American History Month, and Dr. Martin
Luther King's birthday. In addition, during National Secretaries Week, the staff
organized a workshop on emerging occupations and trends in the workplace.
In conjunction with the Securities Industry Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, the Commission continued its support of a scholarship program for deserving minority students pursuing careers in the securities in.
dustry. Five scholarships were awarded in 1985. Brokerage firms, the exchanges, securities industry associations, broker-dealers and investment advisors all contributed to the scholarship fund.

THE SECURITIES

INDUSTRY

Revenues, Expenses and
Selected Balance Sheet Items
Broker-dealers
that are selfregulated through their membership in
a national securities exchange or the
National Association of Securities
Dealers produced revenues of $40.0
billion in 1984, eight percent above the
1983 level. I Almost 34 percent of this
increase in revenues stemmed from the
growth of revenues from outside the
principal
securities
activities
(brokerage, principal transactions and
underwriting).
These "all other"
revenues, which include interest income from securities purchased under
agreements to resell and fees from
handling private placements, mergers
and acquisitions, accounted for 38 percent of revenues in 1984.

Trading gains on firms' securities accounts increased $1 billion, or 12 percent, and represented 24 percent of
total revenues in 1984. Profits from
underwriting decreased $842 million,
but rose as a percent of total revenues
to eight percent in 1984. Securities
commission income declined 11 per.
cent, while mutual fund sales fell to
three percent.
Pre-tax income dropped 47 percent
from the preceding year to $2.8 billion,
as expenses grew by $5.2 billion (16
percent) to $37.2 billion in 1984.
Assets rose by $64.7 billion to
$3169 billion and liabilities grew
$62.6 billion to $298.3 billion. Owner.
ship equity increased $2.1 billion during 1984 to $18.7 billion at year's end.

'Due to changes in FOCUS reporting
requirements,
consolidated information for 1981 is not available. In order
to provide consistent information, new
financial data was developed for prior

years and Table I now presents unconsolidated data for all years. This data
will not be comparable to the Table I
published in the SEC Annual Report
for 1981 and prior years.

Securities Industry Dollar In
1984 For Carrying and Clearing

Firms
Data for carrying and clearing firms
only are presented here to allow for
more detail, as reporting requirements
for introducing and carrying and clearing firms differ and data aggregation of
these two types of firms necessarily
results in loss of detail. Carrying and
clearing firms are those firms which
clear securities transactions or maintain
possession
or control
of
customers' cash or securities. This
group produced 87 percent of the
securities industry total revenues.
Securities commissions and trading
gains accounted for 21 cents and 25
cents, respectively, of each revenue
dollar in 1984. Together these two
items accounted for 46 cents of each
revenue dollar generated in 1984 as
compared to 51 cents in 1983. In terms
of dollars, they accounted for $16.2
billion of the $34.9 billion of total
revenues earned by carrying and clearing firms. Margin interest income accounted for nine cents of each revenue
dollar in 1984 compared with seven
cents in 1983.
Total expenses consumed 94 cents
of each revenue dollar earned in 1984,
seven cents more than the 1983 level
of 87 cents. This cut the industry's pretax profit margin from 13 cents per
revenue dollar in 1983 to six cents in
1984.
Interest expense, again the single
largest expense item, rose in 1984 by
59 percent to absorb 31 cents of each

revenue dollar, which compares to 21
cents in 1983. In dollars, interest expense climbed to $10.7 billion, $4.0
billion more then the year before.
Employee-related expenses (registered
representatives'
compensation
and
clerical and administrative employees'
expenses) consumed 34 cents of the
revenue dollar in 1984, three cents
below the 37.cent level in 1983.
Registered representatives' compensation was seven percent less than the
1983 level and absorbed 18 cents of
each revenue dollar in 1984 compared
to 21 cents in the previous year. In
dollar terms, employee-related
expenses accounted for $11.8 billion of
the $32.8 billion of total expenses.
Other expense categories consumed
about the same proportion of the industry revenue dollar in 1984 as they
did in 1983.
Total assets of broker-dealers carrying and clearing customer accounts
rose by $72.1 billion to $308.7 billion
in 1984. About 89 percent of this increase in assets can be attributed to
two items: resale agreements rose
$32.2 billion, and long positions increased $37.3 billion.
Total liabilities, including subordinated debt, increased $70.2 billion or
32 percent to $292.8 billion with increases in repurchase agreements of
$49.0 billion and short positions in
securities of $7.1 billion. Owners' equity rose 14 percent from $14.0 billion in
1983 to $15.9 billion, and total capital
increased 23 percent to $20.6 billion
from $16.8 billion in 1983.

Self-Regulatory Organizations:
Revenues, Expenses, Pre-Tax:
Income and Balance Sheet
Structure
In 1984 the total revenues of selfregulatory organizations ("SROs") rose
approximately $43.5 million to $559.9
million, a yearly increase of only 8%
compared to the 1983 increase of
27.8%. The New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE"),
National
Association
of
Securities
Dealers ("NASD")
and
American Stock Exchange ("Amex") accounted for over 70% of SROs' total
revenues. Most SRO revenues came from
listing, trading and market data fees. The
NYSE reported total revenues of $223.3
million, of which approximately 55%
was made up of listing and trading fees.
The Amex reported a total revenue figure
of $75.7 million. Approximately 72% of
these revenues were derived from transaction and communications charges.
The NASD reported total revenues of
$91.4 million.
The total expenses of all SROs were
$500.2 million in 1984, an increase of
$66 million, 15% over 1983. The Cincinnati Stock Exchange ("CSE"), Chicago
Board Options Exchange ("CBOE"), and
NASD had the largest percentage increases in total expenses. Conversely,
the Philadelphia
Stock
Exchange
("Phlx") and the Boston Stock Exchange
("BSE") reduced total expenses by 15%
and 7% respectively.
Aggregate pre-tax income of all SROs
fell to $55.9 million in 1984, from a high
in 1983 of $82.0 million, a reduction of
approximately 30%. This can be attributed to increased operational expenses, and decreases in listing and transaction fees. The NYSE showed a
decrease in pre-tax income of $21.3
million, a reduction of 57% from 1983.
The CBOE showed a reduction of over
75% or approximately $4.5 million. This
can largely be attributed to a 34 % rise in
operating expenses at the CBOE com.
bined with lower transaction and appllcation fees. The Amex dropped in pre-tax

income by $3.6 million-28%-from
$12.9 million in 1983 to $9.2 million in
1984. The BSE's pre-tax income surged
past its 1983 figure of $2.5 million by
over 130%, to $5.8 million. This was due
largely to an increase in trading volume
and a corresponding increase in transaction fees. This was followed by an NASD
increase of 21 % or $3.4 million over
1983's figure of $16.1 million, to $19.5
million. The PSE showed a pre-tax loss of
$1 million, a reduction of over twice the
previous year's pre-tax income figure of
$397 thousand. The CSE reported a pretax loss of $775 thousand for 1984, a
loss of $759 thousand over its $16 thousand pre-tax loss of 1983.
The total assets of all SROs were
$827.5 million in 1984, a decrease of
6% from 1983. The NYSE's total assets
were $272.6 million, an increaes of 9%
over 1983. The CBOE increased total
assets by 30% to $88.1 million from $68
million in 1983. The NASD increased its
assets by 33% from $70.2 million in
1983 to $93.3 million in 1984. The
largest relative decrease in total assets
occurred at the PSE where assets fell
38% to $114.7 million in 1984, from
$183.8 million in 1983.
The aggregate net worth of the SROs
rose to $352.2 million from $309.0
million in 1983, an increase of 14%. The
largest percentage increases over the
previous year occurred at the Spokane
Stock Exchange ("SSE") 89%, the NASD
36%, and the BSE 29%. The only
decrease in total assets occurred at the
CSE, which decreased $152 million from
$263 million in 1983 to $111 million in
1984, a 58% reduction.
The clearing
corporation
and
depository SROs reported that aggregate
service revenue increased by $16.2
million in 1984, or over 9%. This consisted of increases of $9.9 million for
depositories and $6.3 million for clearing
agencies. The increase in depository service revenues was due to increases of
$6.5 million for the Depository Trust
Company ("DTC), $2.7 million for the
Midwest Securities Trust Company and

103

$1 million for Philadelphia Depository
Trust Company.
Service revenue or clearing corporations increased $6.3 million primarily
because of increases of $5.3 million at
the Options
Clearing Corporation
("OCe") and a $1.1 million increase at
the Midwest Clearing Corporation. The
OCe. which is a common clearing
organization for all of the listed options
exchanges, experienced its first year-toyear decrease in the number of equity
option contracts traded of 12%, but an
increase in the number of index and currency options caused overall option
volume to increase almost 31 % to a
new high of 196.4 million contracts. Aggregate interest income at the SROswas
up almost $24 million,
with the
depositories accounting for all of the increases.The increase in interest income
paralleled increases in the value of transactions at the depositories.
Depository expenses for 1984 in.
creased by $32 rnilllon, rising 23% for
the second straight year. Employee
costs accounted for almost half of this
increase, which is attributable to the
labor-intensive nature of traditional
depository
operations.
The total
number
of all transactions
at
depositories decreased by 8%, but participants
continued
to make net
deposits of all types of securities.
Deposits are processed manually and
therefore are expensive transactions.
Once the deposit is in the system,
however, the cost-savings associated
with book-entry deliveries of securities
betweeen participants may be realized.
The largest increase in deposits was in
debt securities which have increased
nine fold since 1980, to approximately
$550 billion. Over $500 billion of this
amount is at DTC, The costs associated
with this activity increased D'I'C's costs
by almost $30 million of the $32 million
increase in all depository expenses.
Clearing corporation cost increases
were attributable to OCe's expenses of
processing the large increases in nonequity option contracts. The aggregate

104

clearing corporation expense increase
was almost $4.5 million with OCe's increase being over $4.5 million. Their
largest increases occurred in employee
costs and data processing. The Pacific
Clearing Corporation ("PCC") and the
Pacific Securities Depository Trust
Company ("PSDTC") incurred several
losses in 1984. First, they had operational losses of $678,000 and $46,000,
respectively. These losses would have
been substantially greater had their
parent firm, the Pacific Stock Exchange, not forgiven their allocated administrative and financial costs of
$802,000 and $2.2 million respectively.
Also, PCC recorded an additional loss of
$359,000 as the result of a participant's
inability to settle its securities trades.
Further, to reduce duplication of expense, PCC and PSDTC consolidated
their operations in San Francisco, at additional
costs of $358,000
and
$795,000, respectively.
Combined clearing and depository
net worth increased 8% to almost $25
million. In case of participant default,
the net worth (or shareholders' equity)
and participants' (or clearing) funds provide financial
protection
to the
depositories and clearing agencies. The
depository and equity-clearing agencies' participants' funds remained unchanged at $214 million and $208
million, respectively.
OCe's participants' fund declined
from $211 million to $153 million at the
end of 1984. OCC determined that recent increases in trading volume did not
necessitate a proportionate increase in
their participants' fund, so members'
contribution requirements were reduced. OCC also reduced the minimum
clearing fund requirement for non.
equity options to reflect OCe's reevaluation of the risks associated with
this activity. In addition to the participants' fund, OCC had shareholders'
equity of $3.3 million and $7,600
million in margin deposits at the end of
1984, providing further financial protection.

EXEMPTIONS
Section

12(h) Exemptions

Section 12(h) of the Exchange Act
authorizes the Commission to grant a
complete or partial exemption from
the registration provisions of Section
12(g) or from other disclosure and insider trading provisions of the Act
where such exemption is consistent
with the public interest and the protection of investors.
For the year beginning October 1,
1984 9 applications were pending, and
an additional 13 applications were filed
during the year. Of these 22 applications, 14 were granted. and 3 were
withdrawn. Four applications were pending at the close of the year.

Exemptions For Foreign
Private Issuers
Rule 12g3-2 provides various exemptions from the registration provisions
of Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act
for the securities of foreign private
issuers. Perhaps the most important of
these is that contained in subparagraph
(b) which provides an exemption for
certain foreign issuers which submit,
on a current
basis, the material
specified in the rule. Such material includes that information about which investors ought reasonably to be informed and which the issuer: (1) has made
public pursuant to the law of the country of domicile or in which it is incor-

108

porated or organized; (2) has filed with
a foreign stock exchange on which its
securities are traded and which was
made public by such exchange; and or
(3) has distributed
to its security
holders. Periodically, the Commission
publishes a list of those foreign issuers
which appear to be current under the
exemptive provision. The most current
list is as of July 31, 1985 and contains
a total of 559 foreign issuers.

Rule 10b.6 Exemptions
Exchange Act Rule 10b-6 is an antimanipulative
rule that prohibits
trading in securities by persons interested in a distribution
of such
securities. During the fiscal year, the
Commission granted 25 exemptions
pursuant to paragraph (h) of Rule 10b-6
under circumstances indicating that
proposed purchase transactions did
not appear to constitute manipulative
or deceptive devices or contrivances
comprehended within the purposes of
the rule.

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
There were 2,583 companies registered
under the Investment Company Act of
1940 as of September 30, 1985. New
registrations totaled 299, with 47 registrations terminated during the fiscal year.This
compares with 1984 fiscal year figures of
2,331 total registrations, 256 new registrations and 54 terminations.

SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES
Market Value and Share
Volume
The total market value of all equity
securities transactions on registered
exchanges totaled $993 billion
in
1984. Of this total, $959 billion, or 97
percent, represented the market value
of transactions in stocks and $34
billion, or almost all of the remaining
three percent, the market value of options transactions. The value of equity
transactions on the New York Stock
Exchange was $823 billion, up one percent from the previous year. The

Certificate Immobilization
The securities industry continued to
immobilize certificates during 1984. For
example, the number of certificates
withdrawn from Depository Trust Company (DTC) declined almost 26% from
13.6 million to 10,1 million. In addition,
book-entry
deliveries
of securities
decreased 4% from 50 million to 48

reported by the Consolidated Tape

book-entry deliveries to total certificates
withdrawn increased to 4.8 deliveries per
certificate from 3.7 in 1983 and 1.8 in
1980.

Purpose and Type of
Registration
Effective registrations for cash sale for
the account of issuers in fiscal year 1985
amounted to $191 billion, a 31 percent
increase from $146 billion registered a
year ago. Some $60 billion (31 percent)
was intended for immediate cash, an increase of $21 billion (54 percent) from
fiscal year 1984. Nearly all of this
amount consisted of securities registered
by business to be offered to the general
public. Such registrations totalled $59
billion, an increase of $21 billion (55 percent).
Of this $60 billion, debt securities accounted for $30 brllion (50 percent),
common stock and other equity accounted for $26 billion (43 percent) and
preferred stock $5 billion (eight percent).
Cash right offerings (offerings to security
holders) came to $523 million, a
decrease of $37 million (seven percent)
of such offerings from the previous fiscal
year. Immediate cash offerings by
foreign governments in fiscal year 1985
totalled $600 million, an increase of
$351 million (141 percent) from 1984.
Delayed and extended cash sales
registered for the account of the Issuer
totalled $131 billion (46 percent of all
registrations). Registrations pursuant to
Rule 415, (or so-called "shelf registrations") amounted to $96 billion, or 73
percent of this amount. Securities

registered for the account of Issuers
other than cash sale (in conjunction with
exchange offers for example) amounted
to $85 billion for fiscal year 1985 (30 percent of all registrations). Registrations of
secuntres for secondary offerings (for the
account of security holders rather than
issuers) amounted to $9 billion (three
percent) In fiscal year 1985. Of these latter registrations $3 billion (33 percent)
were for cash sale and $6 billIon (67 percent) were other secondary offerings.
The value of registrations aggregating
$285 billion in fiscal year 1985 consisted
of $121 billion in bonds, debentures and
notes, $13 billion In preferred stock and
$150 billion in common stock and other
equity. Of the $121 billion of debt
securities registered, $30 billion (25 percent) were registered for immediate cash
sale to the general public for the account
of the issuer. Delayed and extended cash
sales accounted for $84 brllion (69 percent). Fifty percent of $13 billion in
preferred stock registrations consisted of
immediate cash offerings, while delayed
and extended registrations for cash sale
for the account of Issuer comprised 16
percent of the total. The $150 billion
volume for common stock and other
equity consisted of $26 billion in Immediate cash, $44 billion in delayed or
extended cash sale, $72 bilhon of noncash registrations for the account of the
issuer and $7 billion of secondary offerings.

ENFORCEMENT
Types of Proceedings
As the table reflects, the securities laws
provide for a wide range of enforcement
actions by the Commission. The most
common types of actions are injunctive
proceedings instituted in the Federal
district courts to enjoin continued or

128

o

threatened secunties law violators, and
administrative proceedings pertaining to
broker-dealer firms and/or individuals
associated with such firms which may
lead to various remedial sanctions as reo
quired in the public interest. When an in.
Junction is entered by a court, violation of
the court's decree is a basis for civil or
criminal contempt against the violator.

Foreign Restricted

List

The Securities and Exchange Commission maintains and publishes a Foreign
Restricted List which is designed to put
broker-dealers, financial institutions, investors and others on notice of possible
unlawful distributions of foreign securities
in the United States. The list consists of
names of foreign companies whose
securities the Commission has reason to
believe have been, or are being offered for
public sale in the United States in possible
violation of the registration requirement of
Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.
The offer and sale of unregistered
securities deprives investors of all the protections afforded by the Securities Act of
1933, including the right to receive a prospectus containing the information required by the Act for the purpose of enabling the investor to determine whether the
investment is suitable for him. While most
broker-dealers refuse to effect transactions
in securities issued by companies on the
Foreign Restricted List, this does not
necessarily prevent promoters from illegally offering such securities directly to investors in the United States by mail, by
telephone, and sometimes by personal
solicitation. The following foreign corporations and other foreign entities comprise
the Foreign Restricted List.

Right to Financial Privacy
Section 21(hX6) of the Securities Ex.
change Act of 1934 [15 U.S.c. 78u(hX6)]
requires that the Commission "compile
an annual tabulation of the occasions on
which the Commission
used each
separate subparagraph or clause of [Sec.
tion 21(hX21)] or the provisions of the
Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 [12
U.S.c. 3401-22 (the "RFPA")]to obtain access to financial records of a customer
and include it in its annual report to the
Congress." During the fiscal year. the
Commission successfully made two applications to courts for orders pursuant to
the subparagraphs and clauses of Section
21(hX2) to obtain access to financial

records of a customer. In these appllcations, the provisions of Subsections
21(hX2XAXiv)and (AXv).(8) were relied
upon. The table below sets forth the
number of occasions upon which the
Commission obtained access to the flnancial records of a customer using the procedures provided by: (i) Section 1104 of
the RFPA [12 U.S.c. 3404]. applicable to
customer authorizations; (ii) Section 1105
of the RFPA [12 us.c 3405]. applicable
to administrative subpoenas; and (iii) Sec.
tion 1107 of the RFPA [12 U.S.c. 3407].

SEC OPERATIONS
During fiscal 1985, the Commission
estimates that it will collect a record $144
million in fees for deposit into the General
Fund of the Treasury. Such fees will
amount to nearly 136% of the Commission's fiscal 1985 appropriation, com-

pared with 111.5% in fiscal 1984. The
four sources of fees were registration of
securities under the Securities Act of
1933 (53 %), transactions on securities exchanges (26%), tender offer and merger
filings (17%) and miscellaneous filings
and reporting fees (5%).
