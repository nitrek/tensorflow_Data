Re: File Number S7-15-16
Dear Mr. Secretary:
We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC)
proposed “Disclosure Update and Simplification” rule.
The stated purpose of the rule is “…to facilitate the disclosure of information to investors, while
simplifying compliance efforts, without significantly altering the total mix of information provided to
investors.” i While we appreciate the goal of the proposal, the following comments raise a number of
significant concerns about how the proposal specifically addresses or, in some cases, fails to address the
stated interests of investors. We also share our views on the questions pertaining to income tax
disclosures in an ever-changing global economy.
Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency (FACT) Coalition
Founded in 2011, the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency (FACT) Coalition ii is a
nonpartisan coalition of more than 100 state, national and international organizations working toward a
fair tax system that addresses the challenges of a global economy and promotes policies to combat the
harmful impacts of corrupt financial practices.
The Stated Interests of Investors
In April 2016, the SEC issued a Concept Release iii to gather feedback from stakeholders on the value of
the SEC’s current disclosure requirements and what, if anything, should be changed, updated, included
or removed. The request for information covered a wide variety of topics including the timing and
frequency of filings, accounting practices and substantive issues involving sustainability among others.
There was significant interest in the Concept Release. According to one outside analysis iv – in which The
FACT Coalition participated -- as of August 16, 2016, 26,512 comments were filed – significantly more
than all but six of 161 major rulemakings since 2008. For comparison purposes, we note that the
median number of comments filed in response to SEC rulemakings in that period is forty-five. By any
measure, the response demonstrates heightened interest in this topic.
The analysis, also found:
“Support [for broad or increased disclosures] came from a wide range of sources: institutional
investment managers, individual investors, public pension funds, research analysts, public

interest advocates, individual members of the public, academics, trade associations, standards
setting organizations, accountants, members of Congress, and even other government entities.
Overall, these commenters tended to be the recipients of companies’ disclosures, those the SEC is
institutionally charged to protect.
A handful of commenters called for “streamlining” or eliminating disclosures. These commenters
were a small handful of companies, professional services providers or associations representing
companies. Not representative of the growing consensus around sustainable corporate practices,
these commenters were notable for their connections to a small handful of industries, such as oil
and gas, chemicals, financial services, and insurance. These commenters generally tend to be the
parties making the disclosures or their representatives.”
A full copy of the analysis is attached.
Any fair reading of the responses would lead to the conclusion that investors and consumers of the
disclosure information were not burdened by ‘information overload.’ Rather, they almost universally
called for increased disclosure to better assess emerging risks – in some instances, risks that may not
have existed in a previous rule writing era. The comments represent important and thoughtful insights
from stakeholders and consumers of the information that deserve serious consideration.
The proposed Disclosure Update and Simplification rule was issued on July 13, 2016, eight days prior to
the close of the comment period for the Concept Release (July 21, 2016). The timing could not have
afforded the SEC the opportunity to review, consider and integrate appropriate feedback into the
proposed rule.
We strongly urge the SEC to review the comments in response to the Concept Release and consider the
concerns of the constituencies that use the information before rulemaking in this area moves further
ahead.
Additional Income Tax Disclosures
The proposed rule specifically asks if, “additional income tax disclosures that would be useful to
investors?” Also noted in the proposed rule: “Rule 4-08(h) requires disclosure of the amount of
domestic and foreign pre-tax income and income tax expense.” This is insufficient to provide investors
with the information needed to properly assess investment risk.
On July 6, 2016, The FACT Coalition submitted detailed comments in response to the Concept Release v
demonstrating the need for additional disclosure of tax strategies of multinational corporations. A copy
of those comments is also attached for inclusion in the record.
We will not repeat the entirety of our comment but will highlight briefly three issues that present a
powerful case for greater disclosure of international tax strategies used by multinational corporations.
In a couple of areas there is additional information that has come to light since we filed our comments
on the Concept Release.
1. The Rise of Offshore Profits

Page 3 of 6

We noted the growth in offshore profits among U.S. multinational issuers. In our comment we wrote:
“The role played by international tax strategies and rates on the operations and earnings of
many U.S. corporations is enormous and growing. In large part, this trend is due to many large
U.S. issuers’ increasing reliance on offshore earnings, cash balances, and tax benefits. For
example, a recent report by Citizens For Tax Justice found that offshore earnings held by U.S.
corporations had in 2015 reached an eye-popping total of $2.4 trillion.”
On September 29, 2016, the Joint Committee on Taxation released an updated estimate of U.S.
corporate profits held offshore. This latest estimate is $2.6 trillion vi -- $200 Billion more than the
number we cited and $300 billion more than an earlier estimate from the IRS.
The importance to investors is that, despite increased scrutiny from policymakers and tax authorities
both domestic and foreign, companies are increasing their offshore holdings. At the same time, there is
reason to believe that they are not adequately disclosing information for investors about the risk of
potential tax liabilities. Whether the withholding of information is willful secrecy or poor judgement in
assessing risk, the result is that the current rules do not provide the information necessary for investors
to properly assess risk and make informed decisions.
2. Apple’s $14.5 Billion Miscalculation, Company Dismissed Earlier SEC Inquiry
On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced that it had “concluded that Ireland granted
undue tax benefits” to Apple and that Ireland must collect approximately $14.5 billion dollars from the
company. vii
A recent review of Apple’s SEC filings suggests that the potential tax liability from $215 billion in profits
held offshore were not adequately disclosed. Even after a 2013 hearing held by the Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations found that the company paid no taxes to any national government on
$30 billion of profit, there was little in Apple’s disclosures to investors about their tax strategy beyond
generic, boilerplate language.
The SEC itself found the information uncovered in the hearing enough of a concern that the Commission
wrote a letter to the company asking for additional information. In the June 13, 2013 letter viii, the SEC
wrote of Apple’s general statement of risk in their filings:
“These appear to be risks that could apply to any registrant with international operations. Please
tell us what consideration you have given to including a more tailored discussion of any specific
risks associated with your current tax structure, including any agreements or arrangements that
provide material tax benefits.”
On the following page of the same letter, the SEC requests information on a country-by-country basis:
“To the extent that a material amount of such funds are held in certain countries, tell us the
names and tax rates of such countries.” (emphasis added)

1225 Eye St. NW, Suite 600 | Washington, DC | 20005 | USA
+1 (202) 827-6401 | www.thefactcoalition.org

Page 4 of 6

In 2013, the Commission made this formal request of Apple recognizing the material nature of the
information, disaggregated by country. The materiality of the information, given the continued growth
in Apple’s offshore funds, is undeniably greater today.
In their response ix, Apple wrote that they believed the risk was sufficiently described:
“…the Company’s existing risk factor disclosure specifically explains that its future effective tax
rates are subject to “changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax
rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or
their interpretation.”
Apple did agree to better describe in future disclosures its offshore holdings and tax liabilities but then
went on to provide draft language. “[F]ilings,” they wrote, “[would be] substantially similar to the
following”:
“If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the
Company’s taxes owed in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of amounts
previously accrued, the Company’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be
adversely affected.”
This exchange demonstrates two critically important points when considering new rules for disclosing
international tax information to investors. First, the SEC already recognizes that country by country
reporting by multinationals of certain profit and tax information can be material to investors. Second,
the current rules do not require sufficient disclosure and management is unlikely to voluntarily disclose
the information, beyond generic statements, necessary for investors to properly assess risk.
3. Dell’s $28 billion Discrepancy in Valuation
In 2013 shareholders of Dell, Inc. approved a management buyout agreement from an investor group
led by Michael Dell. A subset of shareholders dissented from the sale, arguing that the share price was
too low.
A resulting lawsuit led to the hiring of two highly respected valuation experts to estimate the company’s
worth. The court found, the “two highly distinguished scholars of valuation science, applying similar
valuation principles, thus generated opinions that differed by 126%, or approximately $28 billion. This is
a recurring problem.” x The discrepancy, in large part, was due to the differing estimates of how to
appraise the value of the company’s offshore profits given potential tax liabilities.
Central to investors’ interests is the value of the company and the returns they receive upon selling their
interests. If potential tax liability for offshore profits is either not disclosed or disclosed in a cursory or
cryptic manner, investors may wrongly assume a company has engaged is low-risk tax strategies.
Without proper information, they cannot credibly assess risk.
4. Improve Disclosure

Page 5 of 6

Aggregated foreign disclosures are of little use to investors who want to assess the risk associated with
aggressive tax strategies. As the international community steps up scrutiny of low-tax and no-tax
jurisdictions, country-by-country disclosure of revenue, profit and tax information is essential.
The specific information, disaggregated by country, that is important to disclose to investors includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

profit or loss before taxes;
income tax accrued for the current year;
revenues from unrelated parties, related parties, and in total;
income tax paid (on a cash basis);
effective tax rate;
stated capital;
accumulated earnings;
number of employees; and
tangible assets other than cash or cash equivalents.

As to the question of burdens on issuers and impediments to disaggregating this information by
jurisdiction, it should be noted that the IRS recently finalized a rule xi to require country by country
reporting of revenues, profits, taxes paid and certain operations by larger multinational corporations.
The European Union has also established new country by country reporting requirements for larger
firms doing business in any of the member nations. xii
Increasingly, tax authorities have access to the information. Company management already has access
to the information. They only ones without access to the information are those putting their money at
risk.
There can be little doubt that the growing use of offshore tax strategies, the international response to
rein in aggressive tax avoidance and the potential tax liability for corporations engaged in these
practices makes the information material for investors. The SEC has already recognized this to be true in
the case of Apple. As such, the Commission should take immediate steps to require disclosure of this
critically important information.

Re: File No. S7-06-16, Business and Financial Disclosure Required by Regulation S-K
Dear Mr. Fields,
We appreciate the opportunity to share with you some of our views on the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s recent concept release regarding disclosures required by Regulation S-K. The Concept Release,
which is part of the SEC’s broader “Disclosure Effectiveness” project, explores a wide range of topics, from what
types of disclosures public companies should make, to the best formats for those disclosures. Improving
disclosures for investors and the public is a critical objective for the SEC, and we applaud you in undertaking this
effort.
In this letter, we wish to express our views on the standard that the Commission should use to evaluate
substantive disclosures covering a range of issues of interest to investors and public. We will particularly focus
our comments on two specific areas: disclosures of international tax-related issues and subsidiaries.

operations,3 while also establishing the SEC to, amongst other things, “promulgate rules for registrant disclosure
as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.” 4
Over the subsequent eight decades, two largely overlapping standards for what public US companies must
disclose have developed. First, the federal securities laws require companies to disclose information that a
“reasonable investor” could conclude may “significantly alter” the “total mix” of information.5 The principlesbased legal standard for what must be disclosed has been relatively the same for decades.6
Second, the SEC has adopted further requirements for companies to make specific disclosures, much of which
is now captured in Regulation S-K. In theory, these disclosures should be relatively close to the disclosures called
for by the “reasonable investor.” In reality, while investors and the public have increasingly sought more and
better information from U.S. corporate issuers of securities, the SEC’s specific disclosure requirements set forth
in Regulation S-K have not kept pace.
Today, more than ever before, investors and the public care about a number of issues that are un- or underaddressed by the existing regulatory framework. These areas range from executive compensation, worker
training, corporate stock buybacks, sustainability efforts, and political spending, to, most importantly for our
current purposes, international tax practices and subsidiaries.
The SEC should update its specific disclosure requirements to better reflect the reality that “reasonable
investors” want to know more about how their companies’ operate. Unquestionably, and as outlined below,
information regarding a corporation’s tax practices and subsidiaries, is extremely important to both
sophisticated and retail investors. This information can better assist them in ascertaining the value of their
holdings, assess numerous types of risks to their companies, and assess the judgment and integrity of corporate
management. This information is also critical for supporting the public interest in the collection of taxes.7
The SEC should revise its specific disclosure requirements outlined in Regulation S-K, as well as offer guidance,
calling for U.S. corporate issuers to disclose more information about these two basic, yet critically important,
topics.

In general, the Securities Act of 1933 sets for the information that must be disclosed in the public offering of securities,
while the Exchange Act of 1934 sets forth ongoing reporting requirements for publicly held companies.

International Tax Strategies
Background on International Tax Landscape
Increasing Corporate Reliance on Offshore Tax Strategies and Offshore Profits
The role played by international tax strategies and rates on the operations and earnings of many U.S.
corporations is enormous and growing. In large part, this trend is due to many large U.S. issuers’ increasing
reliance on offshore earnings, cash balances, and tax benefits. For example, a recent report by Citizens For Tax
Justice found that offshore earnings held by U.S. corporations had in 2015 reached an eye-popping total of $2.4
trillion.8
Offshore profits and their attendant tax rates can have profound impacts on even the largest U.S. issuers. For
example, in 2010, GE claimed a U.S. profit of just over $4 billion. The company’s tax refund that year was $3.2
billion, largely based on the company’s ability to shift profits overseas to lower tax jurisdictions.9
Apple is another U.S. company that is profoundly impacted by its offshore earnings and tax strategies. In 2013,
the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a hearing examining Apple’s aggressive
offshore tax strategies. The Senate learned, for example, how Apple had established an offshore subsidiary that
reported receiving dividends totaling $30 billion over four years, but paid no corporate income taxes on those
dividends to any national government anywhere in the world. The Subcommittee also found that a lower-tier
Apple subsidiary in Ireland received a total of $74 billion in “sales” income over the same four years, but paid
almost no taxes on that income.10 Since 2013, Apple’s dependency upon its offshore earnings and tax strategies
has become even more pronounced. In 2015, the company reported $53 billion in profits, and accumulated
earnings of $200 billion which it is holding offshore, much of it in tax havens.
In fact, as shown below, U.S. corporations’ reliance on tax havens has increased dramatically in recent years.

Governments Around the World Are Cracking Down
Amidst the rise of offshore profits, complex offshore tax strategies, and lowering effective tax rates,
governments around the globe have begun to crack down on perceived abuses to increase corporate tax
collections and reverse revenue losses. According to the Organization of Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), worldwide “[r]evenue losses from [some offshore tax strategies] are conservatively
estimated at USD 100-240 billion annually.”11 The United States is one of the big revenue losers. A 2016
academic study estimated that offshore profit shifting had likely cost U.S. taxpayers between $77 and $111
billion in corporate tax revenues from 1983 to 2012, with tax revenue losses increasing substantially in recent
years.12
To combat this legal tax avoidance, but also tax evasion (which isn’t included in the estimates above), tax
authorities around the world have been investigating the tax practices of many of the largest U.S. issuers, and
imposing significant revisions to past, current, and potential future tax liabilities. Just last year, Chevron was hit
with a $269 million tax assessment by the Australian government. This preceded reports that the U.S. energy
giant had paid a mere $248 Australian dollars in taxes on $1.7 billion Australian dollars in profits (less than

1/10,000 of a percent).13 Similarly, Google, Starbucks and Amazon have each faced withering scrutiny by
European authorities following revelations of extremely low tax payments to governments. For example, in
2011, Amazon, had sales in the UK of 3.35 billion pounds, yet reported a "tax expense" of 1.8 million. 14 In May
2016, the Paris offices of Google were raided by tax officials, amid reports that the French government is seeking
tax payments of 1.6 billion euro (about $1.8 billion).15
U.S. tax authorities are also investigating offshore tax abuses by large U.S. issuers. Caterpillar has reported, for
example, that the IRS is seeking significant additional tax payments16 and prosecutors are investigating its
offshore tax practices.17 Yet, its disclosures do not arm investors or the public with sufficient information about
which to assess the potential risks involved. Instead, they serve merely as a “heads up” notice that the company
may face enormous tax risks—without articulating any of the details as to why or how much is really involved.
For that information, investors and the public need to look elsewhere, such as Congressional hearings and press
reports.18
Hewlett-Packard has also been investigated for its use of serial short-term loans financed with its offshore profits
to run its U.S. operations, without paying any tax on the repatriated funds.19 And it has fought the IRS in a
number of international tax-related matters, including its use of derivatives sold by AIG’s infamous Financial
Products Group to generate foreign tax credits and capital losses.20
While many other companies that have been reported as being under investigation, their SEC filings do not

appear to reflect the investigations, or provide only cursory information that is inadequate to assess the risks.
Tax authorities around the world are also looking to change the rules.
In 2013, the Organization of Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), which includes the United
States, expressed concerns that “National tax laws have not kept pace with the globalisation of corporations
and the digital economy, leaving gaps that can be exploited by multi-national corporations to artificially reduce
their taxes.”21 At the request of G-20 leaders, in 2015, the OECD released 15 detailed Action Plans to combat
international tax strategies—many of which are used by large U.S. corporate issuers. As part of its efforts, the
OECD has worked diligently with G-20 finance officials, including the U.S. Treasury Secretary, to develop
consensus on how to tighten international tax treaties and agreements to stop abusive tax practices, and they
are currently expanding their efforts.
Further, the European Commission has begun invalidating some tax arrangements as “illegal state aid” that
disadvantages other corporations, and demanding additional tax assessments. The European community has
begun to condemn secret sweetheart tax deals between individual countries and specific multinationals—some
of which are publicly traded U.S. corporations.22
The United States Treasury Department is contributing to the revision of offshore tax rules. Earlier this year, the
Treasury Department revised its rules to remove potential benefits from so-called corporate “inversions,” which
has already dramatically impacted corporate valuations and merger activity. For example, Pfizer’s years-long
efforts to engage in a so-called corporate inversion strategy (which had progressed to a formal proposed merger
with Dutch-based Allergan) were immediately abandoned once the U.S. Treasury Department revised tax rules
that the strategy was intended to exploit.23 The impacts were immediately felt by the companies involved and
throughout the markets.24
Further, bipartisan legislation and several budget proposals seek to close what are perceived as corporate tax
loopholes. Just one of those proposals, calling for the aggregation of foreign tax credits, would eliminate
corporate tax benefits estimated at over $50 billion.

Disappointingly, none of these events are clearly reflected or discussed in any of the affected U.S. companies’
disclosures.25
Increasing Importance to Investors
When Congress adopted the federal securities laws in the 1930s, it specifically recognized the important role of
disclosures in valuing securities and promoting the effective collection of tax.26 In recent years, taxes, and
particularly international taxes, have become increasingly critical in gauging a corporation’s value, profitability,
and risks—core areas of interest for the SEC.
Investors Need Additional International Tax Information to Perform Even Basic Valuations
International tax strategies play an increasingly central role in valuing some of the largest US companies. One
recent high-profile case involving the valuation of Dell Corporation demonstrates the key role that certain
international tax information can play.27
The key dispute in the case involved valuing the company in connection with a potential management buyout.
The court found that “two highly distinguished scholars of valuation science, applying similar valuation
principles, thus generated opinions that differed by 126%, or approximately $28 billion. This is a recurring
problem.”28 One of the key drivers of the difference between the two valuations was the scholars’ assumptions
and findings regarding the company’s tax rates on its offshore earnings. 29 One expert concluded that the
company would have to pay $2.24 billion in taxes on its offshore income, even though it was characterized as
indefinitely deferred.30 The other expert determined that, because the company had never paid high rates on
its offshore income, and was extremely unlikely to do so in the future, the company warranted a higher
valuation.31
Almost none of the information needed to resolve the valuation dispute was previously disclosed to investors
or the public. After comprehensive discovery and analysis by offshore tax experts, one valuation expert
determined his valuation on a projection that Dell would have an ongoing future effective tax rate of slightly
over 35%, while the other projected a future tax rate of just 21%.32 Their disagreement over the corporation’s

25

Some companies appear to have vague discussions of the potential risks associated with changes in U.S. or foreign tax
laws, but these disclosures provide insufficient information to assess the impacts on the issuers of these changes.

appropriate tax rate produced valuations that differed by billions of dollars, demonstrating investors’ desperate
need for improved disclosures on offshore profits, effective tax rates, potential tax liabilities, and related risks.
International Tax Strategies Pose Unique Opportunities for Financial Manipulation
The current disclosure obligations for companies allows management complete control over nearly all aspects
of the determination of what to disclose, and provides no ability for investors to verify the accuracy of the
financials related by the company. Essentially, a company may disclose some information related to its offshore
assets and taxes, but that information—if any—is often so piecemeal that investors cannot reasonably
determine if the judgments are accurate.
There is reason for investors to be concerned. Because company management can elect what is “permanently
reinvested” overseas, and the impacts of that election is often dramatic on a company’s tax bill (as could
numerous other tax-related decisions), tax strategies provide ripe opportunities for corporate management to
manipulate earnings.33 Far from a theoretical concern, the academic research suggests this already occurs.34 For
example, a 2004 paper found evidence that firms that had missed earnings targets manipulated overseas
income to make up shortfalls in future periods.35
The SEC has even appeared to at least somewhat recognize this concern, as evidenced by its reported efforts to
examine Disney’s decision to reclassify its tax risks, which had dramatic impacts on its earnings. As it was
reported by Bloomberg,
In 2013, Disney nearly tripled to $1.5 billion the amount of foreign earnings exempt
from U.S. taxes from a year earlier. Part of that was revenue from 2012. In a Feb.
2014 letter to Disney, the SEC questioned why the company had reclassified
earnings from an earlier year and why the overall tax rate had declined even though
the company had earned less money in lower-tax countries. In its reply, Disney said
it made the moves because it needed more money for its media business, theme
parks and resorts outside of the U.S. The company also said the decision to
reclassify earnings from a prior year was appropriate under accounting rules. The
regulator hasn’t sought additional answers from the company. The media company
announced a similar move Feb.3, when it again raised the amount of income it
holds abroad. The move helped to lower its tax rate for the fiscal first quarter of

2015 to 33.3 percent from 35.2 percent a year earlier. Once again, Disney didn’t
explain to investors why it made the move. (emphasis added).36
Further, a senior SEC official in the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance recently stated that companies’
international tax disclosures “are not sufficient and certainly cannot be called transparent is that many of the
items included in that foreign tax line are subject to different trends and uncertainties.” 37 We agree with this
SEC staffer’s assertion, which is why we propose below that the SEC should mandate that U.S. issuers disclose
certain key information.
Leading Research Analysts Focus on US Companies’ International Tax Strategies and Risks
Leading research analysts are also increasingly focused on the implications of offshore tax issues for U.S.
corporations.
Many analysts are focusing on international tax strategies in their stock recommendations. For example, a
recent research report by Equity Research analysts at Credit Suisse found that for many major U.S. companies,
including Mattel, HP, Xerox, and Western Union, potential offshore tax liabilities represented over 10 percent
of the company’s total market capitalization.38 These analysts also found that for a whopping 68 U.S. issuers,
their estimated foreign tax liabilities exceeded 5% of the companies’ market capitalization.39 Similarly, in May
2016, analysts at Goldman Sachs sent out a newsletter urging clients to ““Buy stocks with high US sales and high
effective tax rates and avoid firms with high foreign sales and low tax rates.” This analysis and investment advice
is presumably based on perceived risks associated with aggressive corporate tax practices subject to
enforcement actions and tax policy changes at home and abroad.
Unfortunately, the facts that could best inform this analysis are generally not disclosed by issuers today, even
though they would unquestionably “significantly alter” the “total mix” of information. As one analyst from
Macquarie Capital USA put it, “there is very little transparency in tax,” which “happens to be one of the most
opaque areas of accounting.”40

Investors Want to Assess U.S. Companies’ Use of Funds Impacted by International Tax Strategies
Separate and apart from the valuation concerns and risk assessments identified above, investors are increasingly
seeking information about how U.S. companies are using their offshore funds. Many large U.S. multinational
corporations are stating that their offshore profits are “permanently reinvested” abroad, but the form of
reinvestment of these billions of offshore dollars is in cash or cash equivalent instruments (with low returns).
Thus, while aggressive international tax strategies may allow companies to avoid payment of U.S. taxes on their
income, the cost associated with those strategies may be that the income earned is then not put to its most
productive uses, but is instead parked in extremely low yielding investments like U.S. treasury securities. Some
investors have begun to openly question whether this result is beneficial to investors or the company. 41 Here’s
how one investor put it:
Some multinationals have more than 50% of their assets 'permanently reinvested'
offshore. According to a Wall Street Journal investigation, however, 93% of the
money Microsoft has officially ‘offshore’ was invested in U.S. assets, like
Treasuries. Arguably, this is not a productive use of 50% of one of the world’s
largest company’s assets, and may represent significant opportunity costs to
investors.42
Currently, Regulation S-K does not specifically require registrants to disclose how a company’s offshore funds
are invested, even when those funds represent a material portion of the company’s assets. As a result, investors
are not well-positioned to assess whether stockpiling what may amount to tens of billions of dollars in extremely
low yielding securities or cash equivalent instruments is a wise allocation of the company’s capital, which might
otherwise be used for acquisitions, employee training, or capital investments to drive the company’s business
forward. This information should be provided to investors.
A related issue is whether the funds that a corporation declares to be offshore for tax purposes are, in fact, held
outside of the United States. Many companies deposit their “offshore” earnings with foreign banks and direct
those banks to keep the funds in the form of U.S. dollars. To do so, foreign banks typically deposit the corporate
funds in U.S. dollar accounts opened by those foreign bank at U.S. financial institutions. The funds are then
typically invested in certificates of deposit, U.S. treasuries, or other secure capital instruments located in the
United States. Investigations have determined that, on average, U.S. corporations keep nearly 50% of their
“offshore” funds in U.S. dollars, U.S. bank accounts, and U.S. investments; at some corporations, the figure
exceeds 75%.43

That information is of interest to investors and the public in part because investments in U.S. dollars are more
likely to retain their value, and cash deposited in U.S. banks is more likely to be more secure. For that reason, SK disclosures should require registrants to disclose what percentage of their funds treated as “offshore” for tax
purposes are actually being held within the United States.
Investors are Increasingly Focusing on Public Policy Considerations Related to Corporations’ Tax Strategies and
Practices
Aside from needing this information to make basic investment decisions based on purely short-term financial
considerations, investors are also increasingly concerned with how their companies’ tax strategies long-term
social and economic impacts.
The shareholder advisory service ISS has reported that its “institutional investor clients have shown significant
interest in the public policy debate swirling around inversions and other tax avoidance strategies.” 44 Similarly,
an organization of investors managing more than $45 trillion in assets found that over 100 of its members
viewed tax as a significant concern.45 As it’s Managing Director articulated, “[Investors] are worried about the
legal and regulatory environment and the risk of tax evasion, and they are starting to engage with the companies
they invest in.”46
Far from just expressing concerns, investors are working together to revise how they factor international taxes
into their investment decision processes. For example, in November 2014, 45 union-affiliated organizations
from 19 countries called upon pension funds to incorporate tax risks as a core part of responsible investment
policies.
In the US, members of the Council of Institutional Investors have expressed concerns with aggressive
international tax strategies and corporate inversions based on broad policy concerns, as has the Church of
England abroad.47 Thus, international tax strategies are now part of the investment-making decisions for many
large investors. Again, the disclosures made by many U.S. corporate issuers, are simply inadequate for them to
make sufficiently informed decisions.

Strategies

Investors have engaged in numerous initiatives to improve companies’ disclosures, including:





Engaging with companies to improve their disclosures;48
Working through the 14a-8 process to require individual companies to enhance disclosures;
Proposing new exchange listing standards that would required disclosure of key environment, social, and
governance (ESG) factors, one of which related to “tax strategy/tax avoidance”;49 and
Proposing revised disclosure obligations.

These efforts have involved dozens of organizations around the globe.50 Unfortunately, these efforts have
resulted in only limited improvements. Particularly disappointingly, due to the SEC staff’s strained
interpretations and the limitations of the 14a-8 process, the 14a-8 efforts have been largely thwarted.51
Collectively, these efforts have yielded no broad-based reforms or enhancements for investors. Investors and
the public still don’t have what they want or need.
Investors Need Country-by-Country Reporting
As described above, current SEC reporting by US issuers is wholly inadequate to determine a company’s tax
practices, actual and projected tax liabilities, and potential tax problems. Existing tax disclosures can be used to
hide actual tax payments, exaggerate US or other country-specific tax rates, and overstate tax assets. It also
impedes accurate assessments of the value of public companies.
As a practical matter, tax practices, liabilities, and risks can be assessed only on a country-by-country basis,
because taxes are assessed by individual jurisdictions. Yet current U.S. tax-related disclosures appear primarily
in the footnotes to a corporation’s financial statement, and provide only limited disclosures – provisions made
for U.S. federal taxes, U.S. state taxes, and “foreign” taxes. The current structure provides tax data on the United
48

For example, the United Nations Principles on Responsible Investment, with more than 1,300 signatories managing $45
trillion, has created an initiative to provide guidance for investors on how to engage with investee companies on corporate

The UN Principles for Responsible Investment has assembled a catalogue of tax-related disclosure efforts for investors’

For example, in 2011, the SEC issued a no-action letter to Lazard Ltd., effectively permitting the company to exclude a
proposal to “annually assess the risks created by the actions Lazard takes to avoid or minimize U.S. federal, state, and local
income taxes, and that it provide a report to shareholders on the assessment.” In granting Lazard’s request, the SEC noted
that the proposal relates to “decisions concerning the company’s tax expenses and sources of financing.” Lazard Ltd. NoAction Letter, Feb. 16, 2011, available at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2011/afscme02161114a8.pdf.

States versus the rest of the world combined. The data on foreign taxes is particularly unhelpful given that
different corporations operate in different countries which vary widely in their tax rates, credits, and deductions,
not to mention their tax enforcement. A combined foreign tax rate is of little practical value. In addition, it
obscures rather than illuminates a corporation’s tax risks in individual countries. For example, if a corporation
maintains significant operations in one country, then a raid by that country’s tax officials would matter more to
investors than if the raid took place elsewhere.
In addition, some countries base taxes on where a corporation or its subsidiaries are incorporated, while others
according to where corporate management and control take place. Some countries are considering proposals
to apportion corporate profits. Thus, it should be no surprise that corporations themselves recognize this
importance, and determine their effective tax rates and other information based on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction
basis.52 Investors need country-by-country data to evaluate each corporation’s existing and potential tax
liabilities and risks.
Importantly, the United States is not the only country faced with this problem. Abroad, foreign governments
recognize the need to improve their companies’ disclosures. The European Union, for example, is requiring
member countries to begin disclosing cross-border tax deals with multinationals, and is considering proposals
to require country-by-country reporting among the 28 member nations and designated tax havens.
To better inform investors, the SEC should revise its international tax disclosure framework to specifically
require multinational corporations to disclose, on an annual, country-by-country basis:










profit or loss before taxes;
income tax accrued for the current year;
revenues from unrelated parties, related parties, and in total;
income tax paid (on a cash basis);
effective tax rate;
stated capital;
accumulated earnings;
number of employees; and
tangible assets other than cash or cash equivalents.

Much of this information is likely already collected by corporations internally for business, payroll, and tax
purposes, and so would not require much additional effort to report publicly. Some of it may already be included
in a corporation’s existing Regulation S-K-mandated disclosures.
Each of the listed factors would provide basic data about a corporation’s operations. None involves proprietary
data. As proof, some financial institutions and corporations in the extractive industries already provide most of

the information in their E.U. public filings with no ill economic effects. The European Union further appears to
be moving towards expanding those same public disclosures to all of its corporations.
Large U.S. multinational corporations will soon be required to provide similar information in non-public,
country-by-country filings with the IRS. Rather than create a patchwork of SEC and IRS disclosure requirements
for various industries and corporations, the SEC should require the same information for all publicly traded
corporations.
It is only with a full appreciation of basic facts about a corporation’s operations at a country-by-country level
that an investor can meaningfully assess that corporation’s international tax practices, liabilities, and risks. As a
practical matter, the relevant information could be easily introduced as a slightly-revised version of various
Items of Regulation S-K (most easily, Items 101 and 102).
Investors and the Public Deserve Additional Explanations of Tax Disclosures
In addition to country-by-country reporting, investors and the public would have much greater ability to
understand international taxes if the SEC further specified in modest rules changes or, if appropriate, guidance
that U.S. corporate issuers should:


provide their U.S. and foreign effective tax rates and explain any effective tax rate that is significantly
lower than the statutory rate in the countries in which they do business;



use the company's weighted average statutory rate based on geographic revenue mix instead of home
country statutory rate in the tax rate reconciliation schedule (which would help explain the likely
effective tax rate, especially as worldwide rules change);



explain any large or increasing Unrecognized Tax Benefit balance;



disclose for all non-de minimis intracompany debt transactions, the countries where the debt is held,
the amount of the debt, and the average interest rate "paid" by the relevant subsidiary on that debt;



disclose and explain any material tax incentives or benefits provided by a foreign jurisdiction, including
the estimated tax savings, any conditions attached to the incentive or benefit, and the likelihood that
the incentive or benefit may be lost; and



disclose of any legal proceedings by foreign governments related to taxes paid to any such
government, regardless of whether such matter is material to the financial position of the
corporation.53

53

We note that item 103 directs companies to disclose “any material legal proceedings.” Importantly, the SEC has
recognized that materiality in this context may is broader than just what may be “material” to the financials of the
company. For example, the SEC directs companies to disclose government actions involving environmental laws that the
company “reasonably” believes may result in penalties of $100,000 or more. C.F.R. 229.103, Instructions to Item 103,

Each of these disclosures would enable investors to identify significant offshore tax-related risks. Depending
upon the substance of the disclosures, each could provide information to investors that would “significantly
alter” the “total mix” of information about the company. For example, we note that the first four items would
likely have had a dramatic impact on resolving the valuation discrepancies at issue in the Dell case described
above.
Collectively, the SEC should revise Items 101, 102, 103, and 303 of Regulation S-K, as well as the instructions to
them, to more effectively capture this critical information for investors.
Disclosure of International Subsidiaries
A second issue of concern involves corporate subsidiaries. Regulation S-K currently requires companies to
disclose a list of subsidiaries of the registrant.54 However, that list currently only needs to include subsidiaries
that are “significant,” as defined by Regulation S-X. As the SEC’s own Investor Advisory Committee noted
“[d]isclosure documents may not, therefore, provide a complete understanding of a company’s structure and
leaves open the possibility of undisclosed pockets of meaningful firm-specific and systemic risk.”55
The use of corporate subsidiaries has sky-rocketed in recent years. At the same time, the use of offshore
subsidiaries in complex international tax strategies is also very high. For example, the vast majority of Fortune
500 companies have at least one subsidiary in a country identified as a tax haven.56
Today, some issuers fail to disclose (or fully identify) subsidiaries that control billions of dollars. For example, a
study by American for Tax Fairness found that US issuer, Walmart, had 78 previously unknown subsidiaries in
tax havens.57 According to the study, Walmart owns at least $76 billion in assets through subsidiaries domiciled
in the tax havens of Luxembourg ($64.2 billion) and the Netherlands ($12.4 billion), accounting for a stunning
90 percent of the assets in Walmart’s International division ($85 billion) or 37 percent of its total assets ($205
billion).58
Because the SEC doesn’t require full disclosure of all subsidiaries, investors and the public have no way of really
knowing how many subsidiaries there are, or the risks associated with them. Interestingly, unlike the SEC,
entities that are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors do have to make more meaningful
disclosures about their respective subsidiaries. One recent study by Citizens for Tax Justice found that, for 27
firms regulated by the SEC and Federal Reserve Board of Governors, they reported 7 times more subsidiaries to

the Federal Reserve than in their SEC filings.59 If their primary regulator thinks these disclosures are important,
it should not be unreasonable for an investor to think so to. Unfortunately, for firms that are not regulated by
the Federal Reserve, investors have almost no ability to collect any of this information.
Perversely, as the importance of information about offshore activities and taxes has increased, the amount of
disclosures has decreased. Today, investors are actually receiving less information than they used to.
One academic study looking at the subsidiaries disclosed by Google and Oracle found that 98 and 99 percent of
these companies’ subsidiaries disappeared from exhibit 21 between 2009 and 2010, even though most of those
subsidiaries appeared to be active a year later.60 Similarly, after Citizens for Tax Justice highlighted Nike’s
numerous subsidiaries in Bermuda in a report in 2013, the following year, half of those subsidiaries disappeared
from its SEC filing.61
These large U.S. corporate issuers thought these subsidiaries were important enough to disclose one year, but
as scrutiny on tax havens and liabilities increased, these leading U.S. corporations decided that the disclosures
were no longer important. This is a clear failure for investors and public policy.
Public companies should disclose all of their subsidiaries, rather than just “significant” ones, providing the name,
location, Legal Entity Identifier number,62 and relation to the parent entity. This information is critical for
investors to understand how companies are structured and operate, including whether they are operating in
high risk jurisdictions, may have actual or potential tax liabilities, or may be engaged in other types of unknown
or ill-understood corporate activities.
The SEC should stop corporations from hiding the billion-dollar balls and require basic disclosures of all foreign
affiliates of U.S. corporations. Stopping this abuse would require a simple change to Item 601 of Regulation SK.
Conclusion
For markets to function properly, it is critically important for investors and the public to be armed with sufficient
information to meaningfully assess the business operations, management, and risks of U.S. public companies.
As multinational corporations have increasingly relied upon complex, international tax strategies to effect their

Executive Summary
Investors, the public, and regulators must be informed and empowered to address the great
challenges facing our companies, our country, and the world. Information and transparency
are essential.
The federal securities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
have brought a level of transparency to U.S. public markets for over eighty years. Yet, our
world has changed in that time. Whether these issues are climate change, human rights, tax,
political spending, or workforce matters; investors and the public are increasingly demanding
transparency on a wider range of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues than ever
before. Fortunately, modern technologies permit stakeholders to process far more information
than ever before. Yet despite this demand for more information, and the increased capabilities
of investors to utilize it, the SEC has nevertheless declined to meaningfully update its ESG
disclosure requirements for decades.1
Change is occurring, though. On the one hand, an array of private efforts to obtain additional
information on ESG matters, combined with a growing desire among some corporations to
engage in sustainable and responsible practices, has resulted in diverse new channels for the
dissemination of ESG information.2 Albeit, this information is not standardized, balanced,
complete, even sometimes reliable. Yet these trends show that some corporations have
already put in processes to collect and disseminate a range of ESG disclosures.
At the same time, increasing investor interest, growing business complexity, more active
public pressure, and other factors have spurred a growth in the volume of disclosure
documents. Annual filings that were once dozens of pages may now be hundreds of pages
long. Some of this growth relates to ESG issues. But much of the new volume of disclosure has
not resulted in more or better information. Instead, many disclosures lack specificity, metrics,

and standards, and are not readily comparable across companies, much less industries.
Boilerplate language is common.3
Unsurprisingly, all sides are frustrated. Companies and their service providers highlight the
costs of sprawling disclosure documents and question the utility of them. Investors and the
public simultaneously highlight how the patchwork of disclosures means they are still not
receiving the information they need.
We can all do better.
Investors and the public would benefit from more and better disclosures to make informed
decisions. Companies and their service providers would appreciate a standardized process with
a more level playing field. Stakeholders on all sides have pressed the SEC to step into the void.
After taking the helm of the SEC in 2013, Chair Mary Jo White began what has subsequently
come to be called the “Disclosure Effectiveness” Initiative to identify and reform corporate
disclosure requirements. Since early 2014, the SEC has openly sought public comments on
what it should do, and over 9,835 commenters have responded with their thoughts.4
Two years after it formally kicked off its “Disclosure Effectiveness” review, on April 13, 2016,
the SEC issued a Concept Release on whether and how it should change its core disclosure
rules.5 In that Concept Release, the SEC asked for public feedback on the frequency and
formats of companies’ disclosures, accounting practices and standards, and the substantive
areas that should be disclosed, including a section on sustainability. This report briefly walks
through the purpose of the Concept Release and the public response to it.
The overwhelming response to the Concept Release seems to reflect an enormous pent up
demand by disclosure recipients for more and better disclosure. As of August 16, 2016, the SEC

had received 26,512 comments in response to its Concept Release.6 By way of comparison, of
the 161 major proposals by the SEC since 2008, only six (less than 4 percent) have received
more than 25,000 comments.7 In fact, the median number of comments received during this
period was just forty-five. The existence of this broad public engagement, including through
two public campaigns, is meaningful in showing significant public interest in what many might
consider an obscure regulatory topic.8
Commenters expressed clear support for expanded and enhanced disclosures. Support came
from a wide range of sources: institutional investment managers, individual investors, public
pension funds, research analysts, public interest advocates, individual members of the public,
academics, trade associations, standards setting organizations, accountants, members of
Congress, and even other government entities. Overall, these commenters tended to be the
recipients of companies’ disclosures, those the SEC is institutionally charged to protect.

6

Numerical calculations in this report were arrived at through a review of the publicly available
comments listed on the SEC’s website by the author, with research assistance provided by the Center
for American Progress and input from the sponsoring organizations. Comments were subjectively
characterized thereafter as for or against expanded or improved disclosures of particular issues based
on the author’s best interpretation of the text of the letters.
7
For the purposes of this Report, we have identified major proposals as rule proposals, Concept
Releases, and interim final rules. We have excluded all rule filings by self-regulatory organizations,
which total more than 1200 filings per year.
8
While some may seek to undermine or dismiss these comments due to their more generalized nature,
we do not. Rather, the fact that a topic as obscure and complex to investors and the public as SEC
disclosure rules garnered significant interest demonstrates the power of these issues. Each individual
comment, including those filed through public campaigns, represents a person’s commitment of time,
energy, and even reputation. These commenters care enough about these matters to seek to have their
voice be heard by a governmental body. The SEC should not simply listen to only commenters who
have extremely technical expertise or sufficient wealth to afford sophisticated legal counsel on these
matters. That said, we also note similar submissions were not just a result of the public interest
campaigns. Significant portions of submissions from various trade associations in opposition to certain
disclosure enhancements similarly appear to borrow heavily from one another. While the number of
comments on an issue is important to keep in mind, that should also not be the only focus. Rather, the
SEC should also note the types of comments, as well as the perspectives being brought by the various
commenters. As demonstrated below, when viewed through this lens, a clear pattern emerges. Users
of disclosures tended to want more and better disclosures while a handful of companies who are
responsible for making disclosures and their service providers and representatives offered resistance.

9

A handful of commenters called for “streamlining” or eliminating disclosures. These
commenters were a small handful of companies,9 professional services providers10 or
associations representing companies.11 Not representative of the growing consensus around
sustainable corporate practices, these commenters were notable for their connections to a
small handful of industries, such as oil and gas, chemicals, financial services, and insurance.
These commenters generally tend to be the parties making the disclosures or their
representatives.12
Some of the most-discussed substantive areas raised by commenters included disclosures
related to:

taxes, which were discussed in 26,287 comments;
environmental/climate change, which were discussed in 10,113 comments;
political spending, which was discussed in 9,994 comments;
human capital and workforce issues, which were discussed in 48 comments;
human rights, which was discussed in 46 comments; and
financial stability risks, in particular from derivatives, which were discussed in 20
comments.

Clearly, these issues were important to commenters. In this report, a wide range of
organizations focused on empowering investors, improving the economy, and advancing the
public interest come together with those thousands of commenters to call on the SEC to
modernize its rules. Investors, the public, and regulators need more information about what
their companies are doing, and standardization is critical. By modernizing its rules, the SEC can

Background on Companies’ Disclosure Requirements
The federal securities laws and the SEC exist, in large part, to ensure that investors, the public,
and regulators have the information they need about how companies are structured, how they
operate, and what they do. As such, the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws
demand complete and accurate disclosure of information that would “significantly alter” the
“total mix” of information for a “reasonable investor.”13
The SEC has adopted specific rules to flesh out this obligation which require companies to
disclose selected information when they sell shares to the public and in quarterly, annual, and
episodic reports thereafter. Regulation S-K, which was adopted in 1982, provides the general
framework for these disclosures.14 It requires basic disclosures about the business’ property,
legal proceedings against it, its financial condition, its owners and management, its
governance, and other facts. Regulation S-K has not been revised significantly in years.

“Disclosure Overload”, “Disclosure Effectiveness”,
and the Concept Release
Shortly after taking leadership of the SEC, Chair Mary Jo White began efforts with the SEC to
review and overhaul the agency’s disclosure requirements for companies. In a speech to
corporate directors in late 2013, Chair White explained that, as a former corporate director
herself, she believed that the agency should peel back companies’ disclosure obligations and
reduce “information overload”15 for investors. As Chair White put it:
I am raising the question here and internally at the SEC as to whether investors
need and are optimally served by the detailed and lengthy disclosures about all
of the topics that companies currently provide in the reports they are required
to prepare and file with us.
When disclosure gets to be “too much” or strays from its core purpose, it could
lead to what some have called “information overload” – a phenomenon in which
ever-increasing amounts of disclosure make it difficult for an investor to wade
through the volume of information she receives to ferret out the information
that is most relevant.16
A few months later, the SEC formally announced its “Disclosure Effectiveness” Initiative and
began seeking public comments on its corporate disclosure rules. Since early 2014, over 9,835
commenters have responded with their thoughts.17
On April 13, 2016, the SEC issued the Concept Release outlining several potential disclosure
reforms. The Concept Release, while ostensibly limited to just the business and financial
disclosure elements of Regulation S-K, is nevertheless quite lengthy, composed of 341 pages
and 340 enumerated questions.18 Comments were ostensibly due within sixty days, but are still
trickling in.
The Concept Release covers everything from companies’ accounting practices to substantive
disclosures on a wide swath of areas, including international taxes, corporate structuring,
human resources practices, environmental and climate issues, and corporate stock buybacks.

Concept Release.

Although it includes a section on sustainability, it strangely does not specifically address
executive compensation or political spending disclosures (except for acknowledging in a
footnote that more comments have come in on the petition calling for political disclosures
than received in agency history, 1.2 million). Nevertheless, many commenters sought to
address those issues.
Because the Concept Release is not a rule proposal, there is no immediate action pending. At
the same time, the “Disclosure Effectiveness” project, and the Concept Release in particular,
have provided the first formal opportunity in years for both disclosing parties and disclosure
recipients to publicly offer their broad views on what should be disclosed and how. While the
Concept Release covers most disclosure issues, several other proposed rulemakings arising out
of the SEC’s “Disclosure Effectiveness” initiative are currently pending.19

19

For example, on July 13, 2016, the SEC proposed to reduce and eliminate a number of specific
disclosure requirements, largely based on the assumption that those requirements would be captured
by rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Disclosure Update and
Simplification, SEC, 81 Fed. Reg. 51608 (Aug. 4, 2016), available at https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR2016-08-04/pdf/2016-16964.pdf. In addition, FASB is actively engaged in its own “Disclosure
Effectiveness” project that would change the accounting definition of materiality and make several
other significant changes to what would need to be disclosed in the financial statements. See generally,

Comment Summary on Selected Issues
In response to its Concept Release, the SEC received 26,512 comments. In addition to 348
unique posted comments, the public also weighed in more broadly in response to two distinct
public campaigns. As a result of one public interest campaign, 9,859 individual members of the
public submitted copies of one form letter expressing support for enhanced disclosures on
taxes, political spending, and environmental/climate sustainability issues.20 As a result of a
separate public interest campaign, another 16,302 individual members of the public submitted
copies of another form letter expressing support for enhanced international tax disclosures.21
Taking these campaigns into account, more than 99 percent of commenters supported
expanding ESG disclosures.
With 26,512 comments, the Concept Release garnered more public comments than all but 5 of
the 161 major proposals issued by the SEC since 2008.22 This does not even count the
thousands of rules changes filed by self-regulatory organizations (e.g., FINRA) for which the
SEC solicits input each year — more than 90 percent of which receive no comments all.
Interestingly, four of those other five major proposals that received more comments related to
enhancing disclosures for key areas, such as extraction payments to governments and
executive compensation, while the fifth regarded the implementation of the so-called Volcker
Rule, one of the highest profile parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act.
In fact, during this period that covers rulemakings for the Dodd-Frank Act and the Jumpstart
Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, the median number of total comments received by the SEC
was just 45. Clearly, this Concept Release struck a chord with the both investors and the public.

We determined “major proposals” to include all proposed rules, interim final rules, and concept
releases. Calculations were made based on comments posted to the SEC’s website.

15

The Two Camps: Those Who Read Disclosures Versus
Those Who Make Them
Generally speaking, the comments can be broken down into two buckets: (1) arguments for
expanded and enhanced disclosures (such as by providing tax reporting on a country-bycountry basis), and (2) arguments for “streamlining” or reducing perceived burdensome
disclosures (such as by narrowing the definition of “materiality” or providing greater
“flexibility” for companies).23
Comments overwhelmingly expressed support for more or better disclosures in one or more
areas. Commenters identifying themselves as institutional investment managers,24 public
pension funds or trustees,25 private pension funds and trustees,26 religious investors,27

Several disclosure recipients and disclosure makers expressed objections to many companies’ use of
“boilerplate” disclosures. See, e.g., Letter from Andrew Friedman, AJF Financial Services, Inc. to SEC,

Several of these commenters explained that they use environmental, social, and governance
(ESG)-related information to make investment decisions, and need more information than the
SEC currently requires.39
Although investors have made these demands for years,40 recent interest likely reflects the
dramatic increases in number, size, and diversity of investors concerned with ESG issues: from
2012 to 2014, professionally managed assets engaged in one or more socially responsible
investing (SRI) strategies grew from $3.74 trillion to $6.57 trillion to account for more than one
out of every six dollars under professional management in the United States.41 But that is just a
fraction of the total number of investors who have expressed their interest in more and better
disclosures. In fact, more than 1,500 investors from around the world (managing more than
$60 trillion in assets) have signed onto the Principles for Responsible Investment.42
Not surprisingly, comments from investors and investor organizations did not reflect the
opinion that they were somehow “overburdened.”43 In fact, investors and investor
organizations generally asserted the opposite.

“Although much has been made of information overload we do not
believe any investors are worse off for access to too much
information.”

“The Fund considers sustainability issues in our investment process

—New York State Comptroller
Several commenters focused on the Supreme Court’s definition of “materiality” as information
that a “reasonable investor” would think “significantly alter[s]” the “total mix” of information
available.45 These commenters argued that investors and the public have come to seek more
and better information from companies that is material to them as “reasonable investors”, and
the SEC should therefore require the disclosure of the information they seek.46
On the other end of the spectrum, commenters arguing to reduce disclosures (such as by
limiting them to only financially “material” information) or to relieve the perceived burdens,
tended to be companies47 and their service providers48 or representatives.49 These
commenters argued that current disclosures are overwhelming the disclosure recipients50 or
that disclosure obligations should be narrowed (such as by tying disclosures to a narrow
definition of “materiality”).51

Further, many of these commenters expressed the view that the substantive areas about
which disclosure is frequently sought were “not material,” and thus should be excluded from
the SEC’s requirements.52 One prominent law firm went so far as to assert that the SEC should
“confirm” its view that “’materiality’ is an economic standard, relating solely to matters that
could ultimately be thought to bear on firm value and thus the value of the issuer's
securities.”53 Several of these commenters suggested that the SEC should not cater to “certain
investors” or “special interests” when crafting its disclosure requirements.54

What Should (or Should Not Be) Disclosed
With 350 distinct letters submitted by more than 26,000 separate commenters, the responses
to the Concept Release demonstrate both substantive depth and broad support for enhancing
disclosures in multiple areas. We focused on the following areas: (i) international tax practices
or corporate structuring; (ii) environmental or climate change; (iii) political spending; (iv)
human capital or employee training, compensation, or rights; (v) human rights; and (vi)
financial stability.
Taxes and Corporate Structuring
In recent years, corporate structures and international tax planning strategies have had
increasingly dramatic impacts on companies, their shareholders, and governments. As the
public and governments have increasingly focused on these issues, so have investors.
Taxes and corporate structuring disclosures were the single most commented on area of the
Concept Release, where 99 percent of all comments received raised the issue, and nearly all of
them expressed clear support for expanded disclosures. This issue was raised in both of the
public interest campaign letters, as well as in more than 120 other unique comments. Not a
single commenter clearly objected to expanded tax disclosures.
Environmental, Climate and other ESG Issues
Addressing climate change is a global imperative. Companies, investors, the public, and
governments are all wrestling with how to adapt and move forward. To do that, investors and
the public need to know what their companies are (and are not) doing to address this new
reality.
With 10,113 comments on climate, environmental, and other ESG disclosures, this was a
priority for investors. Here, 10,070 commenters expressed clear support for enhanced
disclosures, while just 43 commenters expressed oppositional or more ambiguous views. As
with the other enhanced disclosures generally, supporters covered a wide swath of investors
and the public. Again, opponents tended to be a small number of companies, their service
providers, and their representatives.55

Attorneys General Letter, (“[T]he Commission should reject the invitation to allow itself to be used as a
tool to promote such special interests.”).
55
But see, State Attorney Generals Letter.

21

Political Spending
Following the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United,56 the public has become increasingly
concerned with companies’ political spending. Investors want to make sure that their
companies’ funds are being used in manners that are prudent, and consistent with their
beliefs.57 With 9,994 comments on political spending disclosures, this was clearly a hot-button
issue for investors. Here, 9,984 commenters expressed clear support for enhanced disclosures,
while just 10 commenters expressed opposition or raised the issue in a neutral manner.
As with enhanced tax disclosures, supporters for increased disclosure on political spending
covered a wide swath of investors and the public. On the other hand, the clear opponents to
enhanced disclosures included just one company, and six industry organizations.
Human Capital
The development, utilization, and compensation of the human capital — that is, the workers —
of a company may be one of the most important factors in its long-term success. And while
this issue did not garner the broad public support of either of the public interest campaigns,
professional investors clearly expressed their strong support for enhancing human capital
disclosures. Some of the recommended disclosures related to the number of employees and
independent contractors, as well as the categories of workers, and information related to
outsourcing.58
With 48 unique comments raising the issue, this area received about the same amount of
comments as the median SEC proposal since 2008. Of these comments, 34 expressed clear
support for enhanced disclosures, most of which were from investors and investor-based
organizations. The eight comments that clearly opposed enhanced disclosures were filed by
one company, two law firms, and five trade groups.
Human Rights
Human rights are a key area of interest for many investors given the substantial financial and
reputational risks that can be incurred when companies fail to appropriately manage human
rights concerns. In recent years, many companies have responded to investors’ increased
demands for more and better human rights information by dramatically increasing their

voluntary human rights reporting.59 Some 46 unique comments raised the issue of human
rights reporting, and while some other commenters expressed opposition to ESG issues
generally, there was no direct opposition to enhanced disclosure of human rights policies,
practices, or impacts.
Financial Stability
In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, companies, investors, the public, and
regulators all learned a great deal about the risks to our economy and well-being from an
unstable financial sector. During the crisis and the recession that followed, companies incurred
billions of dollars in losses as derivatives risks manifested themselves in ways never before
disclosed to investors. Investors and the public have since pressed for enhanced disclosures of
derivatives risks, to limited avail.
These issues were raised by 20 commenters, with some limited opposition to expanded or
enhanced derivatives disclosures coming from a financial services firm, an accounting firm, and
a financial services trade association. That said, some commenters recommended targeting
any enhanced disclosures on particularly impacted industries, such as financial firms, as
opposed to all issuers.

Conclusion
The challenges facing our world require active partnerships of investors and regulators,
markets and communities, and workers and executives. Those companies and executives that
want to do the right thing face an unlevel playing field and additional risks from going it alone.
Unfortunately, the SEC’s current disclosure obligations fail to ensure that these stakeholders
have the information they need about what companies are — or are not — doing. This creates
misaligned incentives for all involved. Now that the SEC is considering modernizing its rules,
the demand is clear: Investors and the public overwhelmingly seek more and better disclosures
on a range of topics so that they can better support the long-term sustainability of our
economy. It’s time for the SEC to act.
59

For example, 78 percent of reporting companies and 82 percent of the Global 250 companies use the
Global Reporting Initiative’s G4 reporting standards as the basis for their corporate responsibility
