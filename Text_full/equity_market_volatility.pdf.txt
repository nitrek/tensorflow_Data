Research Note:
Equity Market Volatility on August 24, 2015
Staff of the Office of Analytics and Research
Division of Trading and Markets1

December 2015
On Monday, August 24, 2015, the U.S. equity markets and equity-related futures markets
experienced unusual price volatility, particularly during the period surrounding the 9:30 a.m.
E.T.2 start of regular trading hours for the equity markets.
•

Prior to 9:30, the most actively traded equity product – the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust
(“SPY”) – declined to more than 5% below its closing price on the previous trading day
(Friday, August 21, 2015). The most actively traded equity-related futures contract – the
E-Mini S&P 500 (“E-Mini”) – declined to its limit down price of 5% below the previous
trading day’s closing price and was paused for trading from 9:25 to 9:30.

•

At 9:30, SPY opened for regular trading hours at 5.2% below its previous day’s close and
then further declined to a daily low of 7.8% by 9:35. By 9:40, SPY recovered past its
opening price and eventually closed down 4.2%. SPY’s decline from previous day close
to August 24 open was the second largest in the last decade, while SPY’s decline from
previous day close to August 24 daily low was the 10th largest in the last decade.

•

From 9:30 to 9:45, more than 20% of S&P 500 companies and more than 40% of
NASDAQ-100 companies reached daily lows that were 10% or more below their previous
day’s closing price.

This Research Note assesses the operation of U.S. equity markets under the stressed conditions
of August 24. In recent years, the SEC and self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”) have
implemented several regulatory initiatives to address transitory price volatility. Among other
things, August 24 provides a useful opportunity to evaluate the practical operation of these
initiatives.
This Research Note provides empirical data and other information to help assess trading on
August 24, including several issues that have been debated among market participants and in

the media. These issues include the opening process at primary listing exchanges, the
triggering of trading pauses under the National Market System Plan to Address Extraordinary
Market Volatility (commonly known as the Limit Up-Limit Down, or “LULD”, Plan), and the
effects of market volatility on trading in exchange-traded products (“ETPs”).3
Section I describes the data used in the paper and provides summary statistics about the data.
Section II provides an overview of trading on August 24 by examining two broad indices – the
S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 – and their related products.
Section III compares trading in a large dataset of corporate stocks and ETPs on August 24 with
trading during previous control periods.
Section IV addresses the opening process at the primary listing exchanges.
Section V examines the operation of the LULD Plan and associated SRO rules and practices.
Finally, Section VI focuses on the widely varying nature of trading in ETPs on August 24, with a
minority experiencing extreme volatility and a large number of LULD halts.
The following are some key data points in the paper:
Price Declines (Section III.A):
•

Corporate stocks (“Corporates”) with the largest capitalization were particularly
affected on August 24.4 Of the 41 Corporates in the Very Large capitalization bin (which
alone represent nearly a third of Corporates market capitalization), more than half (21)
declined by 10% or more on August 24. These included 5 of the largest 10. In
comparison, only 30% of the more than 4,000 Corporates in the Large, Mid, and Small
capitalization bins declined by 10% or more.

•

The largest capitalization ETPs experienced declines that were similar to those of smaller
ETPs. Of the 50 largest capitalization ETPs, 20 (40.0%) declined by 10% or more, while
36.5% of more than 1,300 other ETPs also declined by 10% of more.

3

Unless otherwise specified, leveraged ETPs are excluded from the term “ETPs” in this paper.
As noted in Section I below, leveraged ETPs are designed to trade differently in many respects
than other ETPs. They therefore are excluded from most of the analyses in this paper to obtain
more comparable statistics. The number of LULD halts and other summary statistics for
leveraged ETPs are provided in Section VI below.
4

Market capitalization bins for Corporates and ETPs are defined in Section I below.

•

Regulation SHO short sale restrictions (“SSRs”) were triggered on August 24 in more
than 2,000 securities, which is the second largest number since SSRs were implemented
in 2011. SSRs were triggered in 108 constituents representing more than 37% of the
market capitalization of the S&P 500, and in 42 constituents representing more than
50% of the market capitalization of the NASDAQ-100. When SSRs are triggered, short
sale orders in that security generally are subject to a price test that requires the orders
to be executed at prices greater than the national best bid for the security.

Trading Metrics (Sections III.B and III.C):
•

Trading metrics for control periods indicate that the opening 15 minutes of regular
trading hours typically are the least liquid portion of the trading day, with wider spreads,
less quoted depth, and higher volatility. These patterns were observed on August 24,
but with much larger trading volume than normal.

•

Trading volume in the minutes following the open was much higher than in control
periods, particularly for Very Large Corporates (more than 400% higher) and for nearly
all market capitalization bins of ETPs (ranging from more than 400% higher for Large
ETPs to more than 800% higher for Small ETPs). The fact that prices also declined most
substantially in the Very Large Corporates and in ETPs indicates that much of this
volume surge after the opening was initiated by sell orders that were relatively
insensitive to the previous day’s prices.

•

Quoted depth (inside through 19 cents away), which typically is at its daily lows in the
opening minutes of a trading day, was much lower in the opening minutes on August 24
than in control periods, particularly for Very Large Corporates (more than 70%
reduction) and for ETPs (more than 90% reduction). Consequently, the surge in selling
in the minutes following the open on August 24 interacted with much lower than
normal levels of displayed liquidity.

Opening Process and Market-Wide Circuit Breakers (Sections II and IV):
•

NASDAQ and NYSE Arca open their listed equities electronically at 9:30. The NYSE
incorporates a manual element in its opening process, particularly on volatile days. On
August 24, many NYSE-listed stocks opened for trading later than 9:30 on the NYSE
(though NYSE-listed stocks were traded at other exchanges and off-exchange venues
before and after 9:30). By 9:35, for example, the NYSE had opened 38% of its listed S&P
500 companies representing 53% of such companies’ market capitalization. By 9:45,
these figures increased to 86% of NYSE-listed S&P 500 companies representing 91% of
such companies’ market capitalization.

•

The S&P 500 Index (“SPX”), as calculated and disseminated by S&P Dow Jones Indices
LLP (“S&P DJI”), declined on August 24 by only 5.2% from its previous day’s close. Until
approximately 9:42, SPX remained substantially higher than the prices of the SPY (7.8%
3

decline), E-Mini (7% decline), and the net asset value (“NAV”) of SPY (8% decline, as
calculated with reference to consolidated real-time trade prices). S&P DJI generally uses
last sale prices from only the primary listing market to calculate its equity indexes. Until
NYSE-listed constituents of the S&P 500 index were opened on the NYSE, the SPX
disseminated by S&P DJI reflected NYSE closing prices from August 21. The use of these
previous day closing prices to calculate SPX in the opening minutes of August 24 likely
caused its decline to be less than S&P 500 related products that reflected real-time
trade prices.
•

The SPX is referenced in SRO rules to determine whether market-wide circuit breakers
are triggered. Because the SPX did not decline by 7% (the first level trigger) on August
24, the market-wide circuit breakers, which would have implemented a 15-minute
trading pause in all equities and related products, were not triggered on August 24.

•

Six of the 41 Very Large Corporates reached daily lows of more than 20% below their
previous closing price soon after the opening cross on their primary listing exchange.
Much of the decline occurred in a very short period of continuous trading after the
opening cross. The rapid price decline was accompanied by a volume surge after the
opening cross that substantially exceeded the volume executed prior to and in the
opening cross itself. An LULD pause was triggered in one of the six Corporates.

LULD Halts (Section V):
•

Although most of the 1,278 LULD trading halts on August 24 occurred in ETPs, 80% of
ETPs did not experience a single LULD halt. Overall, there were 1,058 LULD halts in 327
ETPs (many halts were repeats in the same ETP), and 220 LULD halts in 144 non-ETPs.

•

Corporates were much less likely to experience an LULD halt. Only 8 constituents of the
S&P 500 and 2 constituents of the NASDAQ-100 experienced LULD halts.

•

A great majority (84%) of ETPs have small market capitalizations and, accordingly, most
LULD pauses occurred in smaller ETPs. The rate of ETPs with LULD halts, however, was
the same for both the largest and smaller ETPs. LULD trading pauses occurred in 20% of
the 50 largest capitalization ETPs, and in 20% of the remaining 1,491 ETPs.

•

More than 60% of LULD halts followed a price rise, and most of these (88%) occurred
after 9:45 when the LULD percentage price bands are no longer doubled (as they are
during the first 15 minutes of regular trading hours).

•

NYSE Arca, which is the primary listing exchange for more than 85% of ETPs, applied
price collars to reopening auctions after LULD halts on August 24. The reopening
auctions on NYSE Arca generated prices that were substantially less dispersed than
reopening auctions on other primary listing exchanges. The reopening auctions on NYSE
Arca also left many unexecuted order imbalances. For reopening auctions with sell
4

imbalances, 94% of the total imbalances resulted from market orders. For reopening
auctions with buy imbalances, 91% of the total imbalances resulted from orders with
limit prices.
•

Following LULD halts on August 24, 4,078 trades totaling $34.6 million in volume were
executed at prices outside of the LULD bands that were disseminated after the halts.
Reports of the trades generally were disseminated by the securities information
processors (“SIPs”) for the consolidated data feeds in a very short period (a few
milliseconds) around the time that the SIP disseminated a trade resumption message
and a message with new LULD price bands based on the reopening price of the primary
listing exchange.

ETPs (Section VI):
•

ETPs as a class experienced more substantial increases in volume and more severe
volatility than Corporates on August 24, but individual ETPs varied widely in terms of
their volatility. A majority of all ETPs (63.3%) declined by less than 10% -- a level that is
consistent with broad market declines on August 24. A minority of ETPs (19.2%),
however, declined by 20% or more (compared to only 4.7% of Corporates).

•

Extreme volatility seemed to occur idiosyncratically among otherwise seemingly similar
ETPs. SPY, for example, traded at a premium to its NAV until 9:37, while the next largest
ETP – the iShares Core S&P 500 (“IVV”) – traded at a substantial discount to the SPY, EMini, and SPY NAV until 9:43.

•

The second most actively traded ETP on August 24 – the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series
1 (“QQQ”) – is designed to track the NASDAQ-100 index, which does not include any
NYSE-listed constituents. All NASDAQ-100 constituents opened for regular trading
hours on NASDAQ at 9:30. Similar to IVV, however, QQQ traded at a substantial
discount to its NAV until 9:37.

•

ETPs focused on U.S. equities (“US Equity ETPs”) were much more affected on August 24
than other types of ETPs, but most (58%) did not experience a single LULD halt. For the
499 US Equity ETPs, 41.9% experienced an LULD halt and their mean percentage range
for the day (reflecting the difference between their highs and lows) was 19.2%.

•

Even within the category of US Equity ETPs, however, there was a wide variation in
trading on August 24. Of the 114 US Equity ETPs with Large or Mid market
capitalizations,5 the most volatile 24 ETPs experienced an average of 8.2 LULD halts per
ETP and had a mean percentage price range of 42.8%, while the least volatile 31 ETPs
did not experience a single LULD halt and had a mean percentage price range of 7.2%.

5

Market capitalization bins are defined in Section I below. As noted in Section VI below, Large
and Mid US Equity ETPs represent 77% of the total market capitalization of US Equity ETPs.
5

•

Section VI below explores trading metrics that are associated with these widely varying
levels of volatility among seemingly similar ETPs. A pre-August 24 metric with a
particularly strong association with volatility is secondary market turnover rate – the
ratio of average daily volume in the secondary market for an ETP to its shares
outstanding. Large and Mid market capitalization US Equity ETPs with comparatively
low secondary market turnover rates in a control period were much more likely to
experience severe volatility and multiple LULD halts on August 24 than ETPs with
comparatively high secondary market turnover rates.

The foregoing data points are based on publicly available information. They, along with all of
the empirical analyses and information provided in this Research Note, are not intended to
reach or suggest any legal conclusions or factual findings regarding the causes of the volatility
on August 24 or potential steps to address volatility. Rather, publication of this paper should be
regarded as a preliminary step to help inform a public assessment of the operation of U.S.
equity markets under stressed conditions. In this regard, SEC staff continue to examine a broad
spectrum of issues related to trading on August 24. These include, among other things:
●

factors that may have been associated with volatility in ETPs and other securities,
including the nature of selling pressure, sources of liquidity provision, and, for ETPs,
create and redeem activity;

●

the effect of Regulation SHO SSRs;

●

the opening process on primary listing exchanges, including the nature of trading prior
to and immediately after the opening auction on the primary listing exchange;

●

the reopening process following LULD halts, including the nature of participants in the
reopening auctions on primary listing exchanges and the rules and practices employed
by exchanges in connection with reopenings;

●

the operation of the LULD Plan, particularly as it applies in the period following the
opening of regular trading hours and to reopenings following LULD halts; and

●

the operation of market-wide circuit breakers, particularly as they apply in the period
following the opening of regular trading hours.

Data and Summary Statistics

Except as otherwise noted, the data used for the analyses in this paper was accessed through
the SEC’s Market Information and Data Analytics System (“MIDAS”) and is sourced from the
consolidated data feeds disseminated by the SIPs and the direct data feeds disseminated by the
exchanges.
Our dataset comprises all tickers with trades reported by the SIPs for the consolidated market
data plans on August 24, 2015. For most analyses, we exclude tickers that both are not
included in the database of the Center for Research in Securities Prices (“CRSP”) and are not
included in the database of ETPs accessed through the Bloomberg Professional Service.
We further categorize included tickers based on whether they are reported in CRSP as
corporate stocks (CRSP share codes 11 and 12) (“Corporates”), reported in CRSP as ETPs (CRSP
share codes 73 and 74) or in Bloomberg Professional Service as ETPs. For most analyses, we
exclude ETPs that are leveraged (“Leveraged ETPs”). In many respects, the Leveraged ETPs are
designed to trade differently than other ETPs. They are excluded to obtain more comparable
statistics.
All included tickers other than Corporates and ETPs are categorized as “Other Tickers.” These
include a variety of types of products, such as American Depositary Receipts and Real Estate
Investment Trusts.
Corporates and ETPs are further categorized into four bins based on their market capitalization
on August 24: Very Large >=$100 billion, Large >=$10 billion, Mid >=$1 billion, and Small <$1
billion.
While a variety of analyses are provided in the Sections that follow, Table I-1 below provides a
few summary statistics for the various ticker categories and market capitalization bins on

Table I-1: Summary statistics for ticker categories and market capitalization bins. Market
Cap and Dollar Volume are calculated for August 24.

Market capitalization and trading volume for both Corporates and ETPs are highly tiered. The
424 largest Corporates (Very Large and Large) represent 77.8% of Corporates market
capitalization and 75.1% of Corporates dollar volume on August 24. Similarly, the 246 largest
ETPs (Very Large, Large, and Mid) represent 89.6% of ETP market capitalization and 95.0% of
ETP dollar volume on August 24.
Two additional characteristics of ETPs warrant noting.
First, the Very Large ETP bin includes only one ticker, which is SPY. In many respects, SPY is
quite different from all other ETPs. First, its market capitalization on August 24 was more than
twice as large as the next largest ETP – IVV (and IVV was only 14% larger than the third largest
ETP). Second, its $97.3 billion dollar volume on August 24 dwarfed all other tickers, whether
ETP or Corporate. It was more than six times larger than the next highest volume ETP (QQQ),
and more than five times larger than the next highest volume Corporate (AAPL).
Second, a great majority of ETPs fall within the Small market capitalization bin. The 1,295 Small
ETPs represent 84.0% of ETP tickers, but only 10.3% of ETP market capitalization and 5.0% of
ETP dollar volume on August 24.

II.

S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 Indices and Market-Wide Circuit Breakers

To give an overview of trading on August 24, this section examines two broad market indices –
the S&P 500 index and the NASDAQ-100 index – along with selected related equities and
futures.
The constituents of the S&P 500 index represented 76% of Corporates market capitalization on
August 24. A majority of its constituents (77%) have their primary listing on NYSE, with the
remaining 23% listed on NASDAQ. The largest ETPs related to the S&P 500 are SPY and IVV, and
the most active related futures contract is the E-Mini.
The constituents of the NASDAQ-100 index represented 27% of Corporates market
capitalization on August 24. All of its constituents have their primary listing on NASDAQ. The
NASDAQ-100 thereby provides a useful point of comparison for assessing the extent to which
some features of trading on August 24 are or are not associated with characteristics of the NYSE
versus NASDAQ as a primary listing exchange. The largest ETP related to the NASDAQ-100 is
QQQ, and the most active related futures contract is the E-Mini NASDAQ-100 futures contract
(“N100 Future”).
A.

Pre 9:30 Trading

Even prior to the opening of regular trading hours on the equity markets at 9:30, the most
active ETPs and futures products reflected substantial declines in the broad market indices. For
the period from 9:00 to 10:00, Figure II-1 below provides relative returns from August 21
closing prices for SPY and E-Mini (top panel) and for QQQ and N100 Future (bottom panel).6

6

The charts in Figure II-1 reflect prices at the end of 10-second increments to provide more
precise comparisons of prices across the different products. Prices that occurred within the
increments will not be reflected in the charts. Consequently, the charts may not reflect daily
lows for a product if the low price occurred within a 10-second increment.

Figure II-1: Return relative to August 21 close for the E-mini and SPY (top panel) and the
N100 Future and QQQ (bottom panel) from 9:00 to 10:00.

10

By 9:00, SPY and E-Mini had declined nearly 4% from their previous day close, and QQQ and
N100 Future had declined by 5%. Indeed, N100 Future had reached its pre-9:30 limit down
level of 5% (reflected in the horizontal line on its chart).
From 9:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., prices continued to decline. By 9:30, SPY was down more than 5%.
At approximately 9:15, E-Mini reached its pre-9:30 limit down level of 5% (reflected in the
horizontal line on its chart). QQQ declined further to more than 8% by 9:30.
At 9:25, both E-Mini and N100 Future paused for trading until the 9:30 opening of regular
trading hours in the equity markets. Both products trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(“CME”), and its rules prescribed a pause at 9:25 because the prices of the products had
reached their pre-9:30 limit down levels for a sustained period of time. E-Mini and N100 Future
reopened for trading at 9:30 with wider limit down levels of 7%.
B.

Start of Regular Trading Hours

At the 9:30 start of regular trading hours for the equity markets, the primary listing exchanges
conduct opening auctions in their listed tickers (and sometimes others). The primary listing
exchange is NYSE Arca for SPY and NASDAQ for QQQ, both of which conduct a fully automated
opening auction in their listed products.
Figure II-1 above indicates that SPY opened consistent with its pre-9:30 decline of more than
5%. The SPY then further declined to more than 7% by 9:35, before recovering above its
opening price by 9:40. Consistent with SPY, E-Mini opened at a more than 5% decline and then
further declined to its wider limit down level of 7%, before recovering largely in line with SPY.
QQQ and N100 Future traded quite differently – both from each other and when compared to
the S&P 500 products. QQQ opened consistent with its pre-9:30 price level, but rapidly
declined to its daily low of approximately 17% at 9:31. QQQ then recovered in choppy trading,
exceeding its open price at approximately 9:36. N100 Future, as with E-Mini, reopened on CME
at 9:30 with a lower limit down level of 7%. It immediately hit the 7% limit down level and
remained there until approximately 9:38. when it began to recover. By 9:45, it was trading
largely in line with QQQ.
C.

Tracking of Indices and Related Products

To help further assess the extent to which the broad-market indices and related products
tracked each other during regular trading hours, Figure II-2 below charts prices throughout the
trading day of SPX (as calculated and disseminated by S&P DJI), SPY, IVV, E-Mini, and SPY NAV
(as we computed based on consolidated last sale prices). Figure II-3 below provides the same

11

chart in relative returns7 for the NASDAQ-100 index (“NDX”), QQQ, N100 Future, and QQQ NAV
(as we computed based on consolidated last sale prices).

Figure II-2: End-of-period (last trade) prices on August 24 for SPX, SPY, E-Mini, IVV, and
computed SPY NAV.

Figure II-3 provides returns from August 21 close, rather than prices, to adjust for the different
pricing convention of QQQ relative to NDX.

Figure II-3: Return relative to August 21 close for NDX, QQQ, N100 Future, and computed
NAV for QQQ.

Both Figure II-2 and Figure II-3 indicate that prices of the broad-market indices and their related
products tracked each other closely throughout nearly all of the trading day, with the notable
exception of the first 15 minutes of trading.
To better illustrate how prices diverged during the opening minutes of trading, Figures II-4 and
II-5 below provide the same charts as above, except limited to the period from 9:30 to 10:00
and with prices in 100 millisecond intervals.

9:30 to 10:00

Figure II-5: Return relative to August 21 close for NDX, QQQ, N100 Future, and computed
QQQ NAV.

For the SPX and related products, Figure II-4 indicates that SPY, E-Mini, and SPY NAV varied
somewhat during the initial minutes of regular trading hours, but began tracking relatively
closely at 9:38. Both SPY and E-Mini traded at a premium to SPY NAV during this period. In
contrast, SPX and IVV varied more substantially and for longer periods from SPY, E-Mini, and
SPY NAV.
SPX opened higher than all other related prices and remained higher until it largely began to
track SPY, E-Mini, and SPY NAV at 9:43. This variation between SPX and related products likely
is attributable to the S&P DJI methodology for calculating SPX. S&P DJI generally relies on
trades executed by only the primary listing market to calculate SPX. As discussed further in
Section IV below, many NYSE-listed stocks did not open immediately at 9:30 on the NYSE
(though they were immediately open for trading at other exchanges and off-exchange venues).
On the morning of August 24, the SPX calculation would have continued to reflect August 21
closing prices for NYSE-listed stocks that were not yet opened on NYSE. Based on this
methodology, SPX reached its daily low of a little more than 5% at 9:35 and then recovered. At
around 9:42, SPX began to track closely with SPY, E-Mini, and SPY NAV.
15

In contrast to SPX, IVV declined much farther than SPY, E-Mini, and SPY NAV immediately after
9:30. IVV reached a daily low of a more than 20% below its previous day’s close, thereby
trading at a large discount to SPY, E-Mini, and SPY NAV. At approximately 9:43, IVV fully
recovered and began to closely track the other S&P 500 prices throughout the day. The issue of
severe ETP volatility relative to broad-market indices is addressed in Section VI below.
Turning to NDX and related products, Figure II-5 above indicates that NDX and QQQ NAV
tracked each other closely soon after the open. They opened at an approximately 8% decline,
declined further to nearly 10% at 9:32, and then recovered above their opening prices by 9:35.
In contrast, N100 Future almost immediately hit its limit down level of 7% after 9:30 and
remained there until 9:38 before beginning to recover. By 9:42, N100 Future began to track the
other NASDAQ-100 prices closely throughout the trading day.
Finally, QQQ declined much more substantially immediately after the open than did NDX and
QQQ NAV. It reached a daily low of more than 17% down at 9:31, thereby trading at a large
discount to NDX and QQQ NAV. After trading choppily for several minutes, QQQ began to
closely track NDX and QQQ NAV at 9:37. The issue of severe ETP volatility relative to broadmarket indices is addressed in Section VI below.

Market-Wide Circuit Breakers

The fact that SPX did not decline as far as its related products on August 24 had a significant
effect on market-wide circuit breakers established by SRO rules, which are outlined in Table II-1
below.8

The first level of market-wide circuit breakers is triggered when SPX, as calculated and
disseminated by S&P DJI, declines by 7% during regular trading hours from its previous day’s
close. At this point, trading is paused for 15 minutes in all equities and equities related futures
and options. Unlike the prices for SPX-related products, however, SPX itself did not decline by
7% or more in the opening minutes of regular trading hours. Consequently, market-wide circuit
breakers were not triggered on August 24.
8

The market-wide circuit breakers are described in SEC Press Release No. 2012-107, “SEC
Approves Proposals to Address Extraordinary Volatility in Individual Stocks and Broader Stock
Market” (June 1, 2012) (available at
http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171482422).

Trading in Corporates and ETPs

To broaden the analysis of trading on August 24, this Section III provides data on a variety of
trading and market quality metrics for the more than 4,000 Corporates and more than 1,500
ETPs that traded that day. We first provide data on percentage declines and Regulation SHO
short sale restrictions (which generally are triggered by a 10% decline from previous day’s
close). Next are charts comparing total share volume9 and national best bid and offer (“NBBO”)
sizes on August 24 with a control day -- the preceding Monday, August 17. Finally, we provide
charts comparing dollar volume, quoted spreads, and quoted depth on August 24 with a longer
control period – the three-week period from August 3 to August 21, 2015.
A.

Percentage Declines

Figure III-1 below provides histograms that set forth percentage declines (August 21 close to
August 24 low) for Corporates, and Figure III-2 below provides histograms that set forth
percentage declines for ETPs. Both Corporates and ETPs are binned by market capitalization.
Following the histograms, Tables III-1 and III-2 below set forth counts of the data underlying the
histograms. The data sources for the histograms and tables are the consolidated data feeds
disseminated by the SIPs.
The histograms and tables indicate that Very Large Corporates experienced a larger percentage
of severe declines on August 24 than other sizes of Corporates, with a proportionally higher
number of tickers experiencing declines of 10% or more. For example, 51.2% of the 41 Very
Large Corporates reached lows of 10% or more, while only 29.6% of the more than 4,000
Corporates in the Large, Mid, and Small bins reached lows of 10% or more.
As a class, ETPs experienced larger percentage declines than Corporates, with a proportionally
higher number of tickers experiencing declines of 10% or more (36.6% of all ETPs compared to
29.8% of all Corporates). As just noted, however, Very Large Corporates experienced a rate of
10% or more declines (51%) that was greater than ETPs as a class (36.6%).
Moreover, individual ETPs varied widely in terms of their volatility. While 19.2% of all ETPs
declined by 20% or more, 63.4% of all ETPs experienced declines of less than 10% -- a level that
is consistent with broad market declines on August 24. The wide variation in volatility among
ETPs is addressed further in Section VI below.

Regulation SHO Short Sale Restrictions

Under Rule 201 of Regulation SHO, short-sale restrictions (“SSRs”) generally are triggered when
a ticker’s price declines 10% below the previous day’s close. At that point, short sale orders
(other than those that are exempt) generally cannot be executed at prices that are equal to or
lower than the national best bid. When triggered, the SSRs continue for the rest of that trading
day (“new triggers”) and carryover to all of the next trading day (“carryovers”). In addition, for
a security primarily listed on the NYSE, NYSE rules provide that new triggers cannot occur on a
trading day until the NYSE has opened trading in that security.
1.

Total Number of SSRs

SSRs were implemented in February 2011. Since then, the largest number of new triggers was
2,318 on August 8, 2011.15 On August 24, new SSR triggers totaled 2,069. The great majority,
however, occurred by 9:45.
Table III-3 below sets forth the number of new triggers and carryovers from 9:30 to 10:00 on
August 24.

15

Data used in this Section III.B for calculating the number of Regulation SHO SSRs was
obtained from NASDAQ and NYSE for securities primarily listed on NASDAQ, NYSE, NYSE Arca,
and NYSE MKT.

SSRs in S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 Constituents

Under Regulation SHO, SSRs are designed, among other things, to prevent short selling from
driving down further the price of a security that has already experienced a significant intra-day
price decline, and to facilitate the ability of long sellers to sell first upon such a decline.16 In this
respect, some have suggested that SSRs could affect the ability of traders to engage in arbitrage
between an ETP and its underlying constituents.17 This effect could occur if an ETP’s price
declined faster than the price of a basket of its underlying constituents. In this situation,
arbitrage typically would be conducted by buying the relatively underpriced ETP and selling the
relatively overpriced basket of underlying constituents. For traders that were short the
underling constituents, their ability to conduct this type of arbitrage could be affected by SSRs.
If so, SSRs potentially could help reduce selling pressure in the underlying Corporates of an
index that had experienced a large intraday decline, but also could reduce buying in an ETP
based on the index.
To help assess the extent of a potential effect on arbitrage in products related to the S&P 500
and NASDAQ-100 indices, Figures III-3 through III-6 below set forth the number and market
capitalization of constituents of the two indices that were subject to SSRs on August 24. SSRs
were triggered in 108 constituents representing more than 37% of the market capitalization of
the S&P 500, and in 42 constituents representing more than 50% of the market capitalization of
the NASDAQ-100.

Share Volume and NBBO Sizes

Figures III-7 through III-18 below provide average (mean) share volume18 and average (mean)
NBBO size comparisons of trading on August 24 with a control day of the preceding Monday,
August 17, 2015. Corporates and ETPs are treated separately, and each is binned by market
capitalization. For each metric, a chart with full day data is provided, followed by the same
chart focused on the first thirty minutes of trading. The data sources for the charts are the
consolidated data feeds disseminated by the SIPs.
On August 24, average share volume was substantially larger in the opening minutes than the
control day for all sizes of Corporates and ETPs, and remained higher through the trading day.
Volume in the opening minutes was particularly higher than the control day for Very Large
Corporates and for Large, Mid, and Small ETPs.
For both Corporates and ETPs on the control day, average NBBO bid and ask sizes generally are
smallest in the opening minutes and improve through the trading day. On August 24, this
intraday pattern continued, though with generally smaller sizes.

Dollar Volume, Quoted Spreads, Quoted Depth, and Range Ratio

Figures III-19 through III-32 below provide mean dollar volume,20 median quoted spread,
median quoted depth, and mean range ratio comparisons of trading on August 24 with a threeweek control period of August 3 to August 21, 2015. Corporates and ETPs are treated
separately, and each is binned by market capitalization. For each metric except quoted spread,
a chart with full day data is provided, followed by the same chart focused on the first sixty
minutes of regular hours trading.
As with the average share volume charts provided in Section III.C above, mean dollar volume on
August 24 was substantially larger in the opening minutes than the control period for all sizes of
Corporates and ETPs, and remained higher through the trading day. The ratio of August 24 to
control period dollar volume in the opening minutes was particularly high for Very Large
Corporates and for Large, Mid, and Small ETPs.
For both Corporates and ETPs, median quoted spreads were much wider in the opening
minutes than other times of day during the control period. On August 24, quoted spreads were
even wider than during the control period for all sizes of both Corporates and ETPs. Quoted
spreads for Large, Mid, and Small ETPs were particularly affected, with August 24 spreads
reaching levels that were at least 7 times wider than during the control period.
For both Corporates and ETPs, median quoted depth (inside through 19 cents away) during the
control period is smallest in the opening minutes, improves through the trading day, and
reaches its highest levels at the close. On August 24, quoted depth was substantially smaller in
the opening minutes than during the control period for all sizes of Corporates. Quoted depth
for all sizes of ETPs declined by more than 90%.
After the opening minutes, median quoted depth for Corporates improved throughout the day
and generally reached levels consistent with the control period. In contrast, quoted depth for
ETPs improved somewhat through the trading day, but did not reach levels consistent with the
control period.
Mean range ratios for the control period (price range during each minute as a percentage of
price range for the day) indicate that volatility for both Corporates and ETPs was much higher in
the opening 15 minutes than other times of the trading day. On August 24, this pattern
continued. The opening 15 minutes were by far the most volatile period of the day.
In sum, trading metrics for the control period indicate that the opening 15 minutes typically are
the least liquid portion of the trading day, with wider spreads, less quoted depth, and higher
volatility. These intraday patterns were observed on August 24, but with much larger trading
volume.

Openings on Primary Listing Exchanges

The opening process on the primary listing exchanges is important in a variety of respects. A
large volume of orders typically participate and are executed in the opening cross on the
primary listing exchange. As discussed in Section II above, S&P DJI generally uses prices from
only the primary listing exchange for calculating index values, including the S&P 500 index that
provides the reference for triggering market-wide circuit breakers. Finally, as discussed in
Section V below, the price of the opening cross on the primary listing exchange (if it occurs
before 9:35) is used as a reference price for calculation of the first LULD price bands of a trading
day.
The primary listing exchanges have different processes for opening securities for trading in
regular trading hours. The basic cross functions have similarities, but significant differences can
exist among the primary listing exchanges with respect to timing, dissemination of information,
and price controls.
A.

BATS, NASDAQ, and NYSE Arca Opening Process

The opening processes for BATS,21 NASDAQ22 and NYSE Arca23 are fully automated. They occur
at 9:30 and, with some distinctions, are priced to maximize the volume that can be executed in
the cross. Prior to the cross, they all periodically disseminate messages with imbalances and
indicative prices through their direct data feeds. These messages provide direct data feed
recipients with information on the likely price and size of a cross, given the current state of buy
and sell interest.
As set forth in Table IV-1 below, the exchanges differ in the securities subject to the opening
cross and the price controls for the cross.

21

BATS Rule 11.23 governs its opening process.

22

NASDAQ Rule 4752 governs its opening process.

23

NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.35 governs its opening process.

NYSE Opening Process25

Although other markets trade NYSE-listed symbols prior to the completion of NYSE’s opening
process, NYSE does not begin trading until the Designated Market Maker (DMM) opens a
symbol for trading. The DMM may open a stock manually or electronically, on a trade or a
quote, at 9:30 or thereafter, and the opening should be, according to NYSE Rule 123D, “fair and
orderly, reflecting a professional assessment of market conditions at the time, and appropriate
consideration of the balance of supply and demand as reflected by orders represented in the
market.”
Before the open on August 24, NYSE published information about order imbalances and
indicative prices through its direct data feeds until the earlier of 9:35 or the opening.26 If there
is a significant price change in a symbol from the prior close, the DMM is required to obtain the
approval of a floor official and manually disseminate a price range indication through the SIP.
In the event of an extreme market volatility condition that is likely to have a floor-wide impact
on the ability of DMMs to arrange for a fair and orderly opening, NYSE can invoke Rule 48 and
suspend the DMMs’ obligation to seek certain approvals from floor officials and to publish

24

On September 8, 2015, NYSE Arca revised the collar percentages applicable to the
Market Order Auction to 10%, 5% and 3%.

25

NYSE Rules 15 and 123D govern its opening process. NYSE MKT follows the same
process as NYSE for its opening.

26

On October 26, 2015, NYSE extended the period for publishing imbalance information
until the symbol is opened. NYSE Trader Update, “NYSE and NYSE MKT: Changes to
Imbalance Publication” (October 22, 2015) (available at https://www.nyse.com/traderupdate/history).

certain indication messages in the SIP data feeds. Rule 48 does not affect the information
about order imbalances and indicative prices that NYSE provides through its direct data feeds.
C.

Timing of NYSE Openings

On August 24, NYSE invoked Rule 48 to reflect volatile conditions in the pre-opening. NYSE
opened trading in many of its symbols later than 9:35 (though NYSE-listed symbols traded on
other exchanges and off-exchange venues at 9:30). Tables IV-2 below sets forth the timing, by
market capitalization and number of securities, for NYSE openings in NYSE-listed constituents of
the S&P 500 index.

For NYSE-listed constituents of the S&P 500, NYSE had opened 38% of its listed S&P 500
companies representing 53% of such companies’ market capitalization by 9:35. By 9:45, these
figures increased to 86% of NYSE-listed S&P 500 companies representing 91% of such
companies’ market capitalization.

Table IV-3: Opening cross volume increases on the primary listing exchange on August 24
relative to August 17 and percentage price changes from August 21 close to August 24 open.
The percentage volume change is based on the mean percentage change of the group.
Securities that did not have any volume in the primary listing exchange's opening cross on
August 17 or August 24 were not included in the analysis.

Table IV-3 indicates that opening cross volumes were substantially higher on August 24 than on
August 17 for all categories of Corporates and ETPs. The volume increases for ETPs were
greater for all market capitalization bins than the volume increases for Corporates. In contrast,
the percentage price declines for ETPs from August 21 close to August 24 open were smaller for
all market capitalization bins than the percentage price declines for Corporates.
Table IV-4 below provides another view into August 24 opening prices in relation to closing
prices on August 21. Data is set forth by number of securities and is categorized by primary
listing exchange and by percentage price changes from August 21 close to August 24 open.

Pricing after Openings

Table IV-6 below sets forth absolute volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) changes
following the opening cross in Corporates with primary listings on NYSE and NASDAQ, when the
opening cross on the primary listing exchange occurred prior to 9:35. Table IV-7 below sets
forth absolute VWAP changes following the opening cross in Corporates with primary listings on
NYSE, when the opening cross on the primary listing exchange occurred after 9:35. The time
periods for the two tables are chosen to reflect that, as discussed in Section II above, broad
market prices had turned upward by approximately 9:35.

For the five minutes (5 Minute VWAP) following opening crosses that occurred prior to 9:35,
NYSE-listed Corporates in the Very Large and Mid market capitalization bins displayed larger
deviations from the opening cross prices than did NASDAQ-listed Corporates, while NASDAQlisted Corporates in the Large and Small market capitalization bins displayed larger deviations
from opening cross prices than NYSE-listed Corporates. For NYSE openings after 9:35, NYSElisted Corporates displayed smaller deviations from opening cross prices than did both NYSElisted and NASDAQ-listed Corporates with opening crosses that occurred prior to 9:35.

Largest Corporate Decliners

As noted in Section III.A above, Very Large Corporates experienced a larger percentage of
severe declines (August 21 close to August 24 low) than other sizes of Corporates. Of the 41
Very Large Corporates, six (15%) declined by 20% or more, and 21 (51%) declined by 10% or
more. Of the 383 Large Corporates, in contrast, only 13 (3%) declined by 20% or more, and 121
(32%) declined by 10% or more. Moreover, Section III.B indicates that the great majority of
declines exceeding 10% or more (and thereby triggering Regulation SHO SSRs) occurred within
15 minutes from the start of regular trading hours at 9:30.
To provide a more granular view into the dynamics of trading before, in, and after the opening
cross on August 24, Table IV-8 below sets forth data for the six Very Large Corporates with
percentage declines on August 24 that exceeded 20%.

Table IV-8: Price, time, and volume information for the six Very Large Corporates with
largest daily declines on August 24. Time from Opening Cross to Low measures the period
from the time of the opening cross on the primary listing exchange to the time of the
consolidated daily low price. Volume: 9:30 to Opening Cross is consolidated share volume
from 9:30 to the opening cross on the primary listing exchange. Volume: Opening Cross is
share volume on the primary listing exchange. Volume: Opening Cross to Low is
consolidated share volume from the time of the opening cross on the primary listing
exchange to the time of the consolidated daily low price.

The six symbols in Table IV-8 display a similar pattern. Each reached a daily low of more than
20% soon after the opening cross, and the price decline was substantially reversed by the end
of the day. Their opening cross prices, in contrast, were closer to their end-of-day prices. With
the exception of CVS (discussed below), much of the day’s decline occurred in a short period
after the NYSE opening cross.27 MDT declined by 16.5% in 39 seconds; JPM declined by 13.3%
in 65 seconds; GE declined by 14.1% in 42 seconds; HD declined by 15.5% in 70 seconds; and
PEP declined by 15.7% in 102 seconds. These rapid price declines were accompanied by volume
surges after the opening crosses that substantially exceeded the volumes executed prior to and
in the opening crosses themselves.
While each of the six symbols in Table IV-8 declined by at least 10% below its opening price in
less than two minutes after the NYSE opening cross,28 CVS differs from the other five symbols in
that its price changes triggered LULD halts. The first LULD halt in CVS was triggered 35 seconds
after the NYSE opening cross. When trading resumed five minutes later, CVS hit its daily low
within one second following the NYSE reopening cross. The daily low was only one cent below

Each of the six Very Large Corporates in Table IV-8 is primarily listed on NYSE. Of the total 41
Very Large Corporates, 30 are primarily listed on NYSE.

As noted in Section V below, the reference price for determining LULD price bands for the
first 30 seconds following a primary market opening cross that occurs prior to 9:35 is the
opening price itself. After 30 seconds, however, the reference price can be updated to reflect
the arithmetic mean price of eligible trades over the previous 30 seconds.

Operation of LULD Plan and Related SRO Rules and Practices

The SEC first approved the LULD Plan on a pilot basis in 2012,29 and it has continued to operate
on a pilot basis since then. As the most volatile trading day since the Plan’s approval, August 24
enables an assessment of the operation of the Plan, and related SRO rules and practices, under
stressed market conditions. This Section V is intended to provide background information and

Background on LULD and Its Application to August 24

The impetus for the LULD Plan can be traced to the “Flash Crash” in the U.S. equity market on
May 6, 2010. After the Flash Crash, trades were broken in 326 securities with irrational price
moves of 60% or greater. Of those, 237 were in ETPs and 89 were in other securities.
The LULD Plan was adopted to prevent trades in individual NMS securities from occurring
outside specified price bands and provide trading pauses to accommodate more fundamental
price moves (as opposed to erroneous trades or momentary gaps in liquidity). Certain elements
of the Plan are summarized below to facilitate an understanding of the following analysis.
The LULD bands are calculated and disseminated by the SIPs in the consolidated market data
feeds. The bands generally are based on a reference price that equals the arithmetic mean
price of trades over the preceding five-minute period. Each new reference price remains in
effect for at least 30 seconds, and a new reference price does not become effective unless it is
one percent or more from the last reference price.
The bands are calculated during regular trading hours and are set at 5%, 10% or 20% from the
reference price, depending on predefined tiers of securities and their previous closing prices.
Securities with a previous closing price of less than $0.75 have a band of the lesser of $0.15 or
75%, and leveraged ETPs have the applicable band percentage multiplied by their leverage
ratio. From 9:30 to 9:45 and from 3:35 to 4:00, the band percentages are doubled.

When the national best bid or offer reaches the band price on the contra side (that is, the
national best bid reaches the upper band price or the national best offer reaches the lower
band price), the security enters a Limit State. A Limit State will end if the national best bid
(offer) moves below (above) the upper (lower) band. If the market does not exit the Limit State
within 15 seconds, then the primary listing exchange declares a trading pause of at least 5
minutes that applies to all equity exchanges and off-exchange trading venues.
The initial reference price of the day and the first reference price following a trading pause are
the first trade or, if there is no trade, the mid-point of the first bid and offer on the primary
listing exchange. During the period less than five minutes after the opening, the reference price
is the arithmetic mean price of trades following the opening. If the primary listing exchange
does not open within 5 minutes after the start of regular trading hours at 9:30, the first
reference price is the arithmetic mean price of trades by other markets during the preceding 5
minutes. The bands are not in effect until the earlier of the opening of the primary listing
exchange or 9:35. If the primary listing exchange does not open within 10 minutes after a
trading pause, the first reference price following the pause will be equal to the last reference
price before the trading pause, and the bands will be tripled for the next 30 seconds.
Following a trading pause, the primary listing market for the symbol reopens in a similar
manner to its opening for regular trading hours, but with some important differences. NASDAQ
does not restrict the reopening auction price, but delays a reopening auction until all market
orders can be matched. BATS also delays a reopening auction for unmatched market orders,
and it applies a collar to the price of the auction. NYSE Arca also applies a collar to the price of
its reopening auctions. NYSE’s reopening process is not subject to certain floor official
approvals for price moves, but the reopening may be delayed in the event of a significant
imbalance.

Categories of LULD Halts

On August 24, 1,278 LULD halts were triggered in 471 securities.30 The halts were concentrated
in ETPs (83%), and less than 2% of the components of the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 indices
triggered halts. One quarter (25%) of the impacted securities triggered halts in the first minute
of regular hours trading, and most of the halts (87%) triggered in the first 45 minutes. More
than half (55%) of the impacted securities triggered more than one halt, and over one quarter
(26%) of the impacted securities were halted 4 or more times.

30

Unless otherwise stated, the analysis of the LULD halts is based on all securities subject to
LULD. Tables based on securities described in Section I of this Research Note are explicitly
identified herein as “Covered Securities.” Data are sourced from the consolidated data feeds
disseminated by the SIPs, direct data feeds disseminated by the exchanges, and
www.nasdaqtrader.com.
68

Just over 60% of all LULD halts were limit up halts, and most (88%) of the limit up halts
triggered after the LULD bands tightened at 9:45. Of the securities with just one halt, 62% were
limit up halts. Most (85%) of the multi-halt securities triggered both limit down halts and limit
up halts, and 81.5% of all the halted symbols triggered at least one limit up halt.
A great majority (84%) of ETPs have small market capitalizations and, accordingly, most LULD
pauses occurred in smaller ETPs. The rate of ETPs with LULD halts, however, was the same for
both the largest and smaller ETPs. LULD trading pauses occurred in 20% of the 50 largest
capitalization ETPs, and in 20% of the remaining 1491 ETPs.

Duration of LULD Halts

On August 24, almost all (95%) of the LULD halts lasted less than 6 minutes. However, more
than half (51%) of NYSE’s 78 halts lasted more than 6 minutes, 9% of NYSE’s halts lasted more
than 10 minutes, and NYSE’s longest halt lasted over 18 minutes. NASDAQ also had some
longer halts: 9% of its 194 halts lasted more than 6 minutes, over 6% lasted more than 10
minutes, and NASDAQ’s longest halt lasted 43 minutes. BATS only had three halts, but one
lasted for 28 minutes. All of NYSE Arca’s halts lasted for 6 minutes or less.
Potential reasons for longer halts include: NYSE’s reopening auctions are conducted manually
by the DMM; NASDAQ and BATS electronically delay reopening auctions until market order
imbalances are resolved; and NASDAQ will also delay reopening auctions if the last available
imbalance reference price, when compared to any of the three preceding reference prices,
differ by more than the greater of 5% or 50 cents.
If a primary listing market extends a halt beyond 10 minutes, the LULD bands are set by the SIP
at triple-wide based on the prior reference price and the other markets are permitted to
resume trading. In practice, most markets do not resume trading until the primary market
reopens and issues a trade resumption message. On August 24, 11 of the 19 securities with
halts over 10 minutes triggered another LULD halt shortly after reopening.

Intervals between LULD Halts

On August 24, 257 securities triggered more than one halt, and those multi-halt securities
accounted for 1,064 of the 1,278 halts. The average interval between the resumption of
trading from one halt to the beginning of the next halt in the same security was just over 4
minutes (4:14) for the 807 intervals in the 257 securities. Over one quarter (26%) of those
intervals lasted 15 seconds – the minimum possible interval due to the 15-second Limit State
provided by the LULD Plan. Close to half (45%) of the halt intervals lasted less than 30 seconds,
and more than half (58%) lasted less than 1 minute.

LULD Limit States

As noted above, a security enters a Limit State if the national best bid equals the upper LULD
price band or the national best offer equals the lower LULD price band. If the Limit State
persists for 15 seconds, then the security is halted.
On August 24, 642 securities entered 5,551 Limit States. Most (73%) of the 642 securities that
entered at least one limit state eventually halted, but most (77%) of the 5,551 limit states did
not trigger a halt. Almost 30% of all limit states were concentrated in 6 securities.

LULD Bands Disseminated before NYSE Opening Auctions

If the primary listing exchange does not open by 9:35, the SIP sets the LULD bands based on the
arithmetic mean price of trades by other markets during the preceding 5 minutes. On August
24, NYSE opened many of its listed securities later than 9:35. Table IV-2 above, for example,
indicates NYSE opened 62% of its listed S&P 500 companies after 9:35. These securities were
able to trade on away markets without LULD bands until 9:35.
Of NYSE-listed securities that had opening crosses on August 24, there were 67 halts in 53
symbols. More than half of these NYSE-listed securities (31 of 53) opened after 9:35, and,
consequently, their initial LULD bands were established based on trades from non-primary
markets. Eight of those securities (BAP, GDP, HCA, HUSI-F, PAG, SCL, TTC, XL) triggered halts
before NYSE’s opening auction and 3 of those securities (HCA, HUSI-F, XL) halted again within
45 seconds of NYSE’s auction. An additional 5 securities (CXP, EPE, GDP-D, GNK, MYJ) with nonprimary LULD bands halted within 17 seconds of NYSE’s post-9:35 opening and 1 (GEL) halted
within 46 seconds.
G.

Reopening Auctions

Almost one-third (31%) of LULD halts resulted in a reopening without an auction trade. This
includes 19 halts that reopened for trading after 10 minutes because the primary listing market
had not yet reopened. Close to two-thirds (64%) of LULD halts reopened with auction trades of
less than 1000 shares or without a trade.

NYSE Arca Reopening Price Collars

Under the LULD Plan, pricing bands are not applied to reopening auctions. In approving the
LULD Plan, the SEC noted that “the Plan is also designed to accommodate more fundamental
price moves, albeit in a manner that lessens the velocity of such moves. In this regard, the
Commission notes that the Plan provides that the price bands shall not apply to single-priced
reopenings, which allows for the stock to enter a trading pause and reopen at a price that is
potentially significantly above or below its previous price. The Commission finds that this
mechanism is reasonably designed to allow for more fundamental price moves to occur.”31
NYSE Arca applied price collars to its reopening auctions after LULD halts on August 24, similar
to its price collars for opening auctions noted in Section IV above. The collars were tiered based
on the price of the last trade prior to the auction. The collars were 1% for last trade prices over
$50, 2% for last trade prices from $25.01 to $50.00, and 5% for last trade prices $25.00 and
under. BATS also applied price collars to its three reopening auctions, which were the same
percentages as for openings noted in Section IV above (3% from a collared midpoint of the
NBBO for midpoints over $50.00; 5% for midpoints from $25.01 to $50.00; and 10% for
midpoints of $25.00 or under). NASDAQ did not apply price collars to its reopening auctions.
Price collars on reopening auctions after LULD halts potentially limit the extent to which prices
can adjust to changing conditions without triggering additional LULD halts. One effect of price
collars on an auction is that market orders and limit orders with limit prices better than the
auction price may not be executed in the auction. After the collared auction ends, the
unexecuted market orders and limit orders can seek immediate execution at the primary listing
exchange or at other exchanges.

To help assess the effect of the NYSE Arca price collars on reopenings after LULD halts, Table V9 below compares the best offer (best bid) at the time of a limit down (up) halt with the price
executed in the auction at the resumption of trading after the halts. Reopening auctions on
NYSE Arca generated prices that were substantially less dispersed than reopening auctions on
other exchanges. In total, 13% of NYSE Arca reopening auctions in ETPs generated prices that
were 5% or more away from the relevant quote prior to the halt. In contrast, 54% of NASDAQ
reopening auctions in ETPs generated prices that were 5% or more away from the relevant
quote prior to the halt. For non-ETPs, 42% of all NASDAQ and NYSE reopening auctions
generated prices that were 5% or more away from the relevant quote prior to the halt.

NYSE Arca Imbalance Messages before Reopening Auctions

Through its direct data feeds, NYSE Arca disseminates imbalance messages before auctions that
provide the indicative match price (the price at which the maximum volume of shares are
executable), the matched volume at the indicative match price, the total imbalance of any
remaining orders executable at the indicative match price, and the portion of the total
imbalance that is comprised of market orders. Updates to NYSE Arca’s imbalance messages are
event driven, and NYSE Arca is the only exchange that specifically identifies market order
imbalance volume.
NYSE Arca disseminated imbalance messages prior to 900 of the 999 reopening auctions. The
remaining 99 reopening auctions did not result in any trades. In 80 of the 900 reopening
auctions with imbalance messages, the shares traded in the auctions differed from the matched
shares in the imbalance messages. The remaining 820 imbalance messages provided a matched
share volume and indicative price that equaled the volume and price of the resulting auction,
and as such are a reasonably reliable indicator of the orders that were executable in the
auction.
A very large portion of those 820 messages (93% or 762) identified an imbalance volume, and
more than half (62% or 509) identified a market order imbalance volume. More than a quarter
(26% or 133 of the 509) of the auctions that were preceded by messages with market order
imbalances did not result in a trade in the auction. In those instances, there were no contraside orders in the auction that were within NYSE Arca’s price collars, although there may have
been contra-side orders executable outside of the collars.
Table V-10 below compares the volume of market order imbalances to the volume executed in
the resulting auction. Twenty messages identified market order imbalances exceeding 100,000
shares and the average market order imbalance in those messages was over 175,000 shares.
The average volume executed in the resulting auctions, however, was just over 15,000 shares.
The large disparity between the size of the market order imbalance and the volume in the
auction continued in each of the Table V-10 imbalance bins, except for the bins below 5,000
shares. As noted above, after the auction, the orders in the imbalance may seek immediate
execution in continuous trading.
Table V-10 also shows that market order imbalances represented 94% of total sell imbalances.
For buy imbalances, market order imbalances represented only 9% of the total imbalances.
This distinction is also shown in the count of imbalance messages without a market order
imbalance: 91% of the sell imbalance messages included market order imbalances while 52% of
the buy imbalances included market orders. In sum, market orders were a significant source of
the sell pressure in NYSE Arca’s reopening auctions, but a much less significant source of buy
pressure.

Trades Outside of LULD Bands

The SIPs reported over 4,000 trades totaling more than 835,000 shares and $34 million that
occurred at prices outside of the LULD bands following LULD halts. Reports of most of the
trades were disseminated by the SIPs in a short period (less than 2 seconds) from the time that
the SIPs disseminated a trade resumption message and a message with new LULD price bands
based on the reopening price of the primary listing exchange.
More than 97% of the trades occurred in NYSE-Arca listed ETPs, and over 38% of the trades
were executed on Direct Edge. Almost one quarter (24%) of the trades were executed by the
primary listing exchange.
Some of these trades set the daily low or high for certain securities and were the reference
price for NYSE Arca’s auction collars.

VI.

Trading in ETPs

As addressed in several preceding sections, ETPs as a class were particularly affected on August
24. Section III indicates that ETPs experienced a larger number of extreme price declines than
Corporates. For example, 19.2% (288) of ETPs experienced price declines of 20% or greater,
while only 4.7% (280) of Corporates experienced such declines. Trading volume surged and
displayed liquidity dropped, particularly at the open, in Large, Mid, and Small ETPs. Moreover,
Section V indicates that 83% of LULD halts on August 24 were in ETPs, even though they
represent less than 20% of the securities subject to the LULD Plan that were traded that day.
It bears emphasis, however, that there was a wide variation among ETPs in their volatility and
number of LULD halts. The preceding sections also indicate, for example:
•

Most ETPs (859, 63.3% of total ETPs) experienced price declines of less than 10% -- a
level that is generally consistent with the broad-market price declines on August 24 and
therefore suggestive that they traded with little, if any, discount to the indices they
were designed to track.

•

Most ETPs (1,226, 80% of total ETPs) did not experience even a single LULD halt on
August 24, but the 315 ETPs that did experience an LULD halt averaged 3.3 halts per
ETP.

•

SPY, the largest ETP that tracks the S&P 500 index, traded in line with or at a premium to
SPY NAV, while IVV, the second largest ETP that tracks the S&P 500 index, traded at a
substantial discount to SPY, SPY NAV, and E-Mini in the opening minutes of August 24.

•

Many NYSE-listed Corporates did not open on NYSE at 9:30 and their delayed opens
potentially could have affected trading in ETPs designed to track indexes that include
NYSE Corporates (such as the S&P 500). Nevertheless, all NASDAQ-100 constituents are
listed on NASDAQ and opened on NASDAQ at 9:30, and still the highly active QQQ
traded at a substantial discount to QQQ NAV in the opening minutes of August 24.

This Section VI is intended to provide data on ETP trading that helps illuminate two questions –
why were a minority of ETPs more affected than Corporates on August 24 in terms of their
volatility and number of LULD halts, and yet why did the majority of ETPs trade in a manner
consistent with the broad market price declines in Corporates and not experience any LULD
halts?
To begin, Table VI-1 below provides summary trading data on Corporates and ETPs for a control
period from July 27 to August 21, 2015.

Table VI-1: Summary trading data on Corporates and ETPs for a control period from July 27
to August 21, 2015. Range is defined as ((daily high - daily low)/daily close). ADV Turnover
Rate is calculated by taking a security’s average daily volume (“ADV”) from July 27 to
August 21 and then dividing that number by the security’s shares outstanding from August
21. The mean of this ratio is then determined for each grouping. Securities that did not
trade on all days from July 27 to August 21 were excluded from the analysis.

Table VI-1 shows that the great majority of ETPs (84%) fall within the Small market
capitalization bin. These ETPs generally are much less actively traded than other ETPs, with
mean daily trading volume of 91,297 shares compared to 2,472,408 shares for next larger bin of
Mid ETPs.
During the control period, ETPs were less volatile than Corporates. While Very Large
Corporates was the least volatile bin of Corporates with a 1.7% mean percentage range, all bins
of ETPs had a range of 1.1% or less. In addition, the ADV Turnover Rate (the volume of trading
in the secondary market in relation to the outstanding shares for a security) for all ETPs was
higher than for any category of Corporate.
For comparison to the control period, Table VI-2 below provides the same metrics for trading
on August 24.

Table VI-2: Summary trading data on Corporates and ETPs on August 24. Securities that did
not trade on all days from July 27 to August 21 were excluded from the analysis. Range is
defined as ((daily high - daily low)/daily close). Volume Increase is calculated by taking the
volume per security on August 24 divided by that security's ADV from July 27 - August 21.
This value is then averaged over the entire bin. 8/24 Turnover Rate is calculated by taking
a security’s ADV from August 24 and then dividing that number by the security’s shares
outstanding from August 21. The mean of this ratio is then determined for each grouping.

Table VI-2 indicates how substantially trading on August 24 changed from the control period. In
particular, the mean percentage ranges across all bins of both Corporates and ETPs increased
substantially. With the exception of SPY in the Very Large ETP bin, however, each ETP bin for
mean percentage range changed from being less volatile than the corresponding Corporates bin
in the control period to being more volatile on August 24. Moreover, when comparing the
mean to median percentage ranges for August 24 trading, the mean percentage ranges for each
category of ETP (excluding SPY) were substantially higher than the median percentage range,
indicating substantial variability within the same ETP market capitalization bin. In contrast, the
differences between mean and median percentage ranges were less for all Corporates bins
than any ETP bin (excepting SPY). Finally, the volume increases from the control period to
August 24 were more substantial for all ETP bins than for any Corporates bin.
Among ETPs, the level of market capitalization and trading volume does not appear to be
substantially associated with their degree of volatility on August 24. Large and Mid ETPs, with
82

higher market capitalizations and trading volumes than Small ETPs, nevertheless experienced a
wider range of volatility on August 24 than did Small ETPs.
To further assess the variation of trading among ETPs, Table VI-3 below provides a variety of
trading metrics that are categorized by geographic focus and asset class. In addition, Table VI-4
provides some information on trading activity specifically for Leveraged ETPs, which are
generally excluded from the other analyses in this Research Note. As noted in Section V above,
Leveraged ETPs have their LULD price band percentages multiplied by their leverage ratio. For
example, the LULD price band percentage in the period from 9:30 to 9:45 on August 24 for a
Tier 1 Leveraged ETP with a triple leverage ratio would have been 30%, rather than the 10%
price band percentage applicable to a Tier 1 non-leveraged ETP.

geographic focus and asset class focus were obtained from Bloomberg Professional Service.
Securities that did not trade on all days from July 27 to August 21 were excluded from the
analysis. Range is defined as ((daily high - daily low)/daily close). Volume Increase is
calculated by taking the volume per security on August 24th divided by that security's ADV
from July 27 to August 21. This value is then averaged over the entire bin. ADV Turnover
Rate is calculated by taking a security’s average daily volume (“ADV”) from July 27 to
August 21 and then dividing that number by the security’s shares outstanding from August
21. The mean of this ratio is then determined for each grouping.

Table VI-4: Trading metrics for Leveraged ETPs categorized by geographic focus and asset
class. The geographic focus and asset class focus were obtained from Bloomberg
Professional Service. Securities that did not trade on all days from July 27 to August 21
were excluded from the analysis. Range is defined as ((daily high - daily low)/daily close).
Volume Increase is calculated by taking the volume per security on August 24th divided by
that security's ADV from July 27 to August 21. This value is then averaged over the entire
bin. ADV Turnover Rate is calculated by taking a security’s average daily volume (“ADV”)
from July 27 to August 21 and then dividing that number by the security’s shares
outstanding from August 21. The mean of this ratio is then determined for each grouping.

For ETPs and Leveraged ETPs, volatility levels and number of LULD halts were higher in U.S.
ETPs relative to Global ETPs.
To further refine the analysis, Table VI-5 below provides trading metrics for ETPs focused on
U.S. Equities (“US Equity ETPs”) and for Corporates. The table adds a metric that focuses on
volume increases during time intervals immediately following the 9:30 start of regular trading
hours for the U.S. equity markets – the ratio of ADV during these time intervals in the control
period to volume during the corresponding intervals on August 24.

Table VI-5: Trading metrics for US Equity ETPs and Corporates. Range is defined as ((daily
high - daily low)/daily close). Volume Increase is calculated by summing all volume for the
respective bin and time interval for August 24 and dividing it by all volume for the
respective bin and time interval from August 17. Securities that did not trade on August 17
were excluded from the analysis. ADV Turnover Rate is calculated by taking a security’s
ADV from July 27th to August 21 and then dividing that number by the security’s shares
outstanding from August 21. The mean of this ratio is then determined for each grouping.

Table VI-5 indicates that US Equity ETPs were much more likely to experience an LULD halt and
had much wider percentage ranges than were Corporates. With the exception of SPY (the sole
Very Large ETP), these ETPs generally experienced greater volume increases (as a ratio of
August 17 to August 24 volume) during the opening minutes of August 24 than did Corporates,
indicating that more selling pressure likely was brought to bear on the US Equity ETPs relative
to Corporates. This was particularly true for Small US Equity ETPs, which experienced a volume
increase in the first minute of trading on August 24 that was 27.4 times larger than during the
control period.
Among the different market capitalization bins of US Equity ETPs, Table VI-5 indicates that Mid
US Equity ETPs were more likely than Small US Equity ETPs to experience higher volatility and
an LULD halt. Even Large US Equity ETPs experienced nearly as high a mean percentage range
of volatility (17.4%) and LULD halts (32.1%) as Small US Equity ETPs (18.4% and 40.4%,
respectively).
In addition, 290 of the US Equity ETPs (58.1%) did not experience even a single LULD halt on
August 24, while the remaining 209 US Equity ETPs experienced 825 LULD halts. To further
analyze characteristics that might help explain variations within this category of ETP, Table IV-6
below categorizes US Equity ETPs by the extent of their percentage range on August 24. To
86

eliminate the effect of normally very inactive Small ETPs and of the single Very Large ETP (SPY),
Table VI-6 focuses on the 114 US Equity ETPs that fall within the Large and Mid bins of market
capitalization. These Large and Mid ETPs represent 77% of the market capitalization of US
Equity ETPs.32

Table VI-6: Large and Mid US Equity ETPs categorized by the extent of their percentage
range on August 24. Range is defined as ((daily high - daily low)/daily close). Volume
Increase is calculated by taking the volume per security on August 24 divided by that
security's ADV from July 27 to August 21. This value is then averaged over the entire bin.
Securities that did not trade on all days from July 27 to August 21 were excluded from the
analysis. Depth of Book Percent At 9:30:10 is calculated by taking the cumulative volume
19 cents from the national best bid for all securities in the bin. This amount is then divided
by a similar amount from August 17. The Mean and Median Imbalance Relative to Opening
Volume columns are calculated by taking the imbalance amount from the last imbalance
message prior to the security's open and dividing it by the opening volume. The
mean/median of these ratios are calculated across bins. ADV Turnover Rate is calculated by
taking a security’s ADV from July 27 to August 21 and then dividing that number by the
security’s shares outstanding from August 21. The mean of this ratio is then determined for
each grouping.

Nearly all of the LULD halts for these ETPs occurred in the groups with ranges of 20% or more.
On August 24, the two most volatile groups had higher volume increase ratios compared to the
two less volatile groups, as well as lower depth of book percentages (a comparison of depth of
book at 9:30:10 on August 24 compared to the control period). The two most volatile groups
also experienced more significant imbalances in their opening auctions.
Volume increases, depth-of-book percentages, and imbalances are “after-the-fact” metrics
based on August 24 trading. ADV Turnover Rate, in contrast, is based solely on control period
trading volume in the secondary market. It measures average daily trading volume during the
control period in relation to the number of outstanding shares of a security. As noted in Table
VI-1, for example, SPY, the sole Very Large ETP, has a high ADV Turnover Rate of 14.6%, while
the mean ADV Turnover Rate for Large ETPs is 2.3%.

32

SPY alone represents 15% of the market capitalization of US Equity ETPs. The 384 Small US
Equity ETPs represent 8% of market capitulation of US Equity ETPs.
87

Table VI-6 indicates that ADV Turnover Rate is associated with the likelihood a Large and Mid
US Equity ETP was going to experience severe volatility and multiple LULD halts on August 24.
The US Equity ETPs in the two least volatile groups exhibited ADV Turnover Rates (3.8% and
5.3%) that are at least three times higher than the rates for the most volatile groups (0.6% and
1.0%). The ADV Turnover Rates for the two most volatile groups also are very low when
compared to the average turnover rates for all Large and Mid ETPs set forth in Table VI-1 above
(2.3% for Large and 3.0% for Mid).
To further assess the association between secondary market turnover rates and volatility, Table
VI-7 below categorizes Large and Mid US ETPs by their ADV Turnover Rates.

Table VI-7: Large and Mid US Equity ETPs categorized by ADV Turnover Rate. ADV

Turnover Rate is calculated by taking a security’s ADV from July 27th to August 21st and
then dividing that number by the security’s shares outstanding from August 21st. The mean
of this ratio is then determined for each grouping. Range is defined as ((daily high daily low)/daily close). Volume Increase is calculated by taking the volume per

security on August 24th divided by that security's ADV from July 27 to August 21.
This value is then averaged over the entire bin. Securities that did not trade on all
days from July 27 to August 21 are excluded.

Table VI-7 indicates that the three bins with the lowest secondary market turnover rates during
the control period (0.39%, 0.61%, and 1.05%, respectively) experienced price ranges on August
24 that were much higher than the bin with the highest secondary market turnover rate during
the control period (9.12%). The three low turnover rate bins also include nearly all of the LULD
halts in Large and Mid US Equity ETPs.
