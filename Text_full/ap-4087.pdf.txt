ORDER POSTPONING
HEARING

On August 9, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission, failed to timely report the
termination of the auditor-client relationship, and are delinquent in their periodic filings. A
hearing is scheduled for August 25, 2016.
On August 23, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a motion to adjourn the hearing,
noting that it has scheduled a telephonic prehearing conference with Respondent John D. Oil and
Gas Company for August 26, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. EDT, and that none of the other Respondents
have answered the Division’s requests to confer. The Division also noted that two Respondents,
Chang-On International, Inc., and Computer Graphics International Inc. have not yet been served
via the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in
Civil or Commercial Matters.
The Division is directed to file by August 29, 2016, a declaration of service establishing
that the four Respondents located in the United States have been served with the OIP in
accordance with Rule of Practice 141(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2). If Respondents fail to
timely file an answer, they will be deemed in default and the registrations of their securities will
be revoked. OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). The Division is also directed to update
this Office, via email to alj@sec.gov, on the status of service on the two Respondents located in
China by November 23, 2016, and every three months thereafter until service is accomplished.
The Division’s motion is GRANTED and the hearing is postponed. The Division and
Respondent John D. Oil and Gas Company are ORDERED to hold a telephonic prehearing
conference without the hearing officer by August 26, 2016, to discuss each numbered item in

Rule of Practice 221(c), 17 C.F.R. § 201.221(c), including the date by which each item will be
accomplished. By September 2, 2016, these parties shall file a joint prehearing statement, which
addresses each numbered item and includes proposed due dates where applicable. 1 Based on this
prehearing conference statement, a subsequent prehearing conference with the hearing officer
may be scheduled. If the parties are unable to hold a prehearing conference by August 26, 2016,
the Division shall notify this office.
The parties are also asked to email alj@sec.gov courtesy copies of any filings in PDF
text-searchable format and, when possible, in Word format. Email, however, is not a substitute
for the required hardcopy filing with the Commission’s Office of the Secretary.
