ORDER DETERMINING WHISTLEBLOWER AWARD CLAIM
On April 7, 2016, the Claims Review Staff issued a Preliminary Determination
related to Notice of Covered Action Redacted (the “Covered Action”). The Preliminary
Determination recommended that Claimant (“Claimant”) receive a whistleblower
award because Claimant voluntarily provided original information to the Commission
that led to the successful enforcement of the Covered Action pursuant to
Section 21F(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), 15
U.S.C. § 78u-6(b)(1), and Rule 21F-3(a) thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-3(a).
Further, the Claims Review Staff recommended that such award be set in the
amount of
of the monetary sanctions collected or to be collected in
Redacted
the Covered Action, which should yield a total award of between $5 and $6 million. In
arriving at this recommendation, the Claims Review Staff considered the factors set forth
in Rule 21F-6, 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-6, in relation to the facts and circumstances of
Claimant’s application.
On April 7, 2016, Claimant provided written notice to the Commission of
Claimant’s decision not to contest the Preliminary Determination within the 60-day
deadline set out in Rule 21F-10(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, 17 C.F.R.
§ 240.21F-10(e). Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 21F-10(f), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-10(f),

the Preliminary Determination became the Proposed Final Determination of the Claims
Review Staff.
Upon due consideration under Rules 21F-10(f) and (h), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-10(f)
and (h), the Preliminary Determination of the Claims Review Staff is adopted.
Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the Preliminary Determination, it is hereby
Redacted
ORDERED that Claimant shall receive an award of
of the monetary
sanctions collected in this Covered Action, including any monetary sanctions collected
after the date of this Order.
By the Commission.
