ORDER POSTPONING HEARING
AND SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On February 17, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in
their periodic filings. A hearing is scheduled for March 14, 2016.
On March 3, 2016, the Division of Enforcement submitted a declaration of service,
establishing that Respondents were served with the OIP by February 23, 2016, in accordance
with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii), (iv). Accordingly, Respondents’ answers are due by March
7, 2016. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160, .220(b).
I POSTPONE the hearing scheduled for March 14, 2016, and schedule a prehearing
conference to take place that day, at 1:00 p.m. EDT. If Respondents fail to timely file answers,
appear at the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend the proceeding, I will deem them in
default, determine the allegations in the OIP are true, and revoke the registrations of their
securities. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f).
