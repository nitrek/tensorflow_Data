On March 15, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Sections
15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 9(b) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940.
On March 30, 2016, I found that Respondent was served with the OIP on March 22,
2016, and that his answer is due by April 11, 2016. Barry B. Clare, Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 3749, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1184.
On April 5, 2016, Respondent filed a motion requesting an extension until April 20,
2016, to file his answer due to the high volume of documents recently produced to Respondent
by the Division of Enforcement. The Division does not oppose the motion.
Consistent with 17 C.F.R. § 201.161, the request is GRANTED and Respondent’s answer
is due April 20, 2016.
