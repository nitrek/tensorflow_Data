In the Matter of the Application of
KEITH D. GEARY
For Review of Action Taken by

ORDER DENYING STAY AS
MOOT

FINRA

Keith D. Geary (“Geary”) appeals from a FINRA order finding that he permitted his firm
to operate a securities business while it lacked the required net capital. FINRA suspended him in
all capacities for 30 business days, barred him from acting in any principal or supervisory
capacity with any FINRA member firm, and directed him to pay $20,000 and hearing costs.1 On
August 18, 2016, Geary filed a “motion to stay sanctions” pending his appeal to the Commission.
Geary’s motion seeks a stay of the “30 business day suspension in all capacities . . . and payment
of a $20,000 fine and hearing costs.”2 Although Geary acknowledges that FINRA notified him
that the suspension, fine, and hearing costs would be stayed pending appeal to the Commission,
Geary states that he submits his motion for a stay as a “precaution.” FINRA opposes Geary’s
motion as moot. For the reasons below, we agree and deny Geary’s motion.
FINRA Rule 9370 provides that “[t]he filing with the SEC of an application for review
by the SEC shall stay the effectiveness of any sanction, other than a bar or an expulsion, imposed
in a decision constituting a final disciplinary action of FINRA.”3 In its opposition to Geary’s
motion, FINRA states that “FINRA Rule 9370 uncontrovertibly provides that all sanctions, other
than a bar, imposed in a final FINRA disciplinary action . . . are stayed upon the filing with the

Geary does not seek a stay of, and we do not address, FINRA’s order barring him from
acting in any principal or supervisory capacity.

75839, 2015 WL 5172955, at *12 n.68 (Sept. 3, 2015) (observing that Grey’s application for
Commission review stayed FINRA’s order that he be suspended in any capacity for 18 months).

Commission of an application for review.” And in its letter attaching its final disciplinary
decision, FINRA stated explicitly that the “filing with the SEC of an application for review shall
stay the effectiveness of any sanction except a bar or expulsion.” As discussed above, Geary has
filed an application for review with the Commission. We therefore agree with FINRA that
Geary “already possesses the specific relief he seeks” and deny Geary’s motion as moot.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Keith D. Geary’s August 18, 2016 motion for a stay
of sanctions FINRA imposed pending Commission review of his appeal is denied.
For the Commission, by the Office of the General Counsel, pursuant to delegated
authority.
