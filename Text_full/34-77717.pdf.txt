In the Matter of
CABELA’S
INCORPORATED and
RALPH W. CASTNER, CPA
Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that ceaseand-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against Respondents Cabela’s Incorporated (“Cabela’s”)
and Ralph W. Castner, CPA (“Castner”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have each submitted
Offers of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for
the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondents consent
to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order
(“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds1 that:
Summary
Cabela’s is a specialty retailer and direct marketer of hunting, fishing, camping, and related
outdoor merchandise headquartered in Sidney, Nebraska. In January 2012, Cabela’s entered into a
new intercompany agreement (“ICA”) with its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, World’s Foremost
Bank (“WFB”), that increased the amount WFB paid to Cabela’s each quarter for WFB’s use of
the company’s intellectual property and trademarks and for the cost of bank promotions relating to
the Visa credit card that WFB issued (the “promotions fee”). Contrary to Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and statements in Cabela’s periodic filings for each quarter and
fiscal year-end for 2012, Cabela’s failed to eliminate the intercompany promotions fee in preparing
its consolidated financial statements. Cabela’s failure to comply with this GAAP requirement
resulted in an understatement of merchandise costs and a corresponding understatement of
financial services revenue on the company’s consolidated income statement. This in turn increased
Cabela’s merchandise gross margin percentage, a key company-specific financial metric that
signaled the profitability of the company and was referenced by the company in earnings releases
and analysts calls. The non-elimination of the promotions fee contributed approximately 47% to
100% to a reported year-over-year increase in the metric for the first through third quarters and
year-end 2012.2 Cabela’s description of the reasons for the year-over-year increase in merchandise
gross margin percentage in its filings3 and its earnings releases failed to disclose the role that the
promotions fee played in the year-over-year increase. This resulted in materially misleading
financial disclosures in the company’s 2012 MD&A and earnings releases that were reinforced by
Cabela’s incorrect statements in its periodic filings that “[a]ll intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.” During the relevant period, Castner was
Cabela’s chief financial officer (“CFO”). He was aware of the contribution of the promotions fee
to Cabela’s reported merchandise gross margin percentage, and he made the decision not to
disclose it because of his stated view that the associated promotional costs incurred by Cabela’s
offset the impact of the promotions fee on the quarterly increase. It was materially misleading for
Cabela’s and Castner not to disclose the impact of the promotions fee on the year-over-year
increase in merchandise gross margin percentage each quarter in 2012.
In the third quarter of 2012, Cabela’s also failed to account properly for various other items
in conformity with GAAP. These accounting errors increased net income for that quarter. Castner

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers of Settlement and are not binding
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
Merchandise gross margin is defined in Cabela’s 2012 Form 10-K as merchandise sales less the costs of related
merchandise sold and shipping costs. Cabela’s used the terms merchandise gross margin and merchandise gross
profit interchangeably. Merchandise gross margin percentage reflects Cabela’s gross profit as a percentage of its
merchandise sales.

Cabela’s discussed merchandise gross margin percentage in its Management’s Discussion and Analysis

accounting decisions were not reported to Castner.
Respondents
1.
Cabela’s is a Delaware corporation, based in Sidney, Nebraska, and a specialty
retailer and direct marketer of outdoor merchandise. Cabela’s became a public company in 2004.
Cabela’s stock is registered with the Commission under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and
trades on the NYSE (Symbol: CAB).
2.
Castner, CPA, age 52, resides in Sidney, Nebraska. Castner has been employed by
Cabela’s since 2000 and has served as its CFO since 2003. He has been a licensed CPA in
Nebraska since 1985. His CPA license has been inactive since 2000. Before joining Cabela’s,
Castner served in various finance positions with First Data Corporation from 1990 to 2000 and was
an auditor with Touche Ross & Co. from 1985 to 1990.
Cabela’s Failure to Disclose the Impact of the Promotions Fee
3.
Since the formation in 2001 of WFB, Cabela’s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, the
operating relationship between Cabela’s and WFB has been governed by an ICA. As part of that
relationship, WFB issues and manages Cabela’s Club Visa credit card, which serves as Cabela’s
primary customer loyalty rewards program. Although the ICA has been amended several times
since its inception, the ICA generally provides for WFB to compensate or reimburse Cabela’s for
WFB’s use of the company’s intellectual property and trademarks and the cost of bank promotions
– e.g., club card points, merchandise discounts, and shipping discounts. The reimbursement
provided for in the ICA is called a promotions fee. Up until January 2012, WFB paid Cabela’s a
fixed promotions fee of $2.3 million annually.
4.
Effective January 1, 2012, Cabela’s entered into a new ICA with WFB. Under the
new ICA, the promotions fee was calculated based on the charge volume on Cabela’s Club Visa
credit cards. If customer charges were greater than $11 billion, WFB paid a fee to Cabela’s of
0.10% of the charges. If customer charges were less than $11 billion, the fee was 0.05% of the
charges. Because customer charges exceeded $11 billion in 2012, WFB paid to Cabela’s 0.10% of
the charges or approximately $15.8 million in 2012. The fee was paid quarterly through
intercompany accounts.
5.
Under the new ICA, Cabela’s recorded the promotions fee as a reduction of WFB’s
revenue and a decrease in cost of merchandise sales for Cabela’s. Under GAAP, intra-entity
transactions must be eliminated in the preparation of consolidated financial statements.4
Specifically, Cabela’s consolidation entries should have increased WFB revenue and Cabela’s
merchandise cost of sales by the amount of the fee each quarter in order to eliminate the impact of
ASC 810-10-45 requires that “in the preparation of consolidated financial statements, intra-entity balances and
transactions shall be eliminated. This includes intra-entity open account balances, security holdings, sales and
purchases, interest, dividends, and so forth … [A]ny intra-entity profit or loss on assets remaining within the
consolidated group shall be eliminated; the concept usually applied for this purpose is gross profit or loss.”

the promotions fee. Cabela’s also stated in each of its periodic filings from 2012 through the first
quarter of 2014 that “[a]ll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.” Contrary to GAAP and its representations in its 2012 periodic filings, Cabela’s
failed to eliminate the financial impact of the promotions fee in its consolidated financial
statements. As a consequence, Cabela’s income statement understated both financial services
revenue and merchandise costs during that period. Castner knew all intercompany accounts
needed to be eliminated in consolidation.
6.
Cabela’s error in failing to eliminate the promotions fee in consolidation had a
material positive impact on Cabela’s merchandise gross margin percentage. Merchandise gross
margin percentage is a key company-specific financial metric signaling the profitability of the
company on the sale of its product and is highlighted by Cabela’s in its periodic filings and
earnings releases. Cabela’s calculated this measure by subtracting merchandise costs from
merchandise revenue and then dividing that number by total merchandise revenue. Because
Cabela’s merchandise cost was reduced each quarter by the promotions fee, the merchandise gross
margin percentage was overstated on a gross basis by approximately 50 to 70 basis points (“bps”)
(or .5% to .7%) from 2012 through the first quarter of 2014.5
7.
Cabela’s focused the investment community on changes in its merchandise gross
margin percentage year-over-year. The most dramatic year-over-year increase in merchandise
gross margin percentage was in 2012 because the 2012 quarters were compared to 2011 quarters
when the fee was substantially lower. In fact, the promotions fee contributed approximately 47%
to 100% of the year-over-year increase in the merchandise gross margin percentage for each
quarter in 2012 and the 2012 year end.6 Analysts reported on Cabela’s merchandise gross margin
percentage increase and many analysts cited to the merchandise gross margin percentage as a basis
for a favorable view of the company during 2012.
8.
Cabela’s merchandise gross margin and merchandise gross margin percentage were
not separately delineated in the company’s financial statements, but they were discussed in its
MD&A in its quarterly filings, in earnings releases, and on earnings calls. Specifically, in the
MD&A section of each of its periodic filings from first quarter 2010 through year-end 2012,
Cabela’s reported on its progress in meeting strategic initiatives identified in 2010 in its long term
strategic plan commonly referred to as “2012 Vision.” One of the initiatives was to improve
merchandise gross margin or merchandise performance by 200 to 300 bps or 2-3% from 34.6% in
2009 to at least 36.6% by year-end 2012. In each of its periodic filings in 2012, Cabela’s listed the
primary contributors to the increase year over year in merchandise gross margin percentage.
Cabela’s typically repeated these items in its quarterly earnings releases during 2012 which were
filed with the Commission in Forms 8-K.
5

Cabela’s failed to disclose the impact of the promotions fee on the merchandise gross margin percentage until the
second quarter of 2014 when the company determined that the non-elimination of the promotions fee in the
consolidated financial statements was an error. In Cabela’s second quarter 2014 Form 10-Q, Cabela’s began
eliminating the promotions fee in its consolidated financial statements on a going forward basis.
6

The impact of the fee on the year-over-year comparison became less significant in 2013 when comparing the
promotions fee paid by WFB to Cabela’s in 2013 to 2012 because the calculation for both years contained the
increased fees, $17.6 million and $15.8 million respectively.

4

9.
Cabela’s failed to disclose in the MD&A of each periodic filing and its quarterly
earnings releases in 2012 the material contribution of the promotions fee to the quarterly 2012
increases in the merchandise gross margin percentage. Moreover, because the filings incorrectly
stated that intercompany transactions had been eliminated in consolidation, investors were not
aware that an intercompany payment was responsible for a material part of the improvement in the
key financial metric.
10.
In preparation for the earnings call for the first quarter 2012, Castner was provided
with an earnings release report (“ER Report”) describing the factors that contributed to that
quarter’s increase in merchandise gross margin. In Q1 2012, Cabela’s merchandise gross margin
percentage increased to 34.5%, up from 33% in Q1 2011, or 150 bps year-over-year. The report
showed that the promotions fee was responsible for 70 of the 150 bps increase year over year
(almost half of the increase). If the promotions fee had been eliminated in consolidation, Cabela’s
would have only reported an 80 bps increase in the merchandise gross margin percentage year over
year.
11.
In the first quarter 2012, Castner made the decision not to disclose the effect of the
promotions fee in the first quarter 2012 Form 10-Q and earnings release and rejected proposed
language disclosing the impact of the promotions fee on the metric for inclusion in filing because
of his stated view that the associated promotional costs incurred by Cabela’s offset the impact of
the promotions fee on the quarterly increase. Because Castner rejected disclosure in the first
quarter of 2012, the issue did not come up again and Cabela’s continued not to disclose the impact
of the promotions fee on the reported merchandise gross margin percentage until it filed its second
quarter Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014.
12.
In Cabela’s first quarter 2012 Form 10-Q, Cabela’s highlighted in MD&A that the
merchandise gross margin as a percentage of merchandise revenue was increasing, noting that it
“increased 150 bps to 34.5% in the three months ended March 31, 2012” comparative year over
year. In the filing, Cabela’s also stated that “[t]his increase was primarily attributable to better
inventory management, . . . improvements in vendor collaboration, and advancements in price
optimization . . . .” Cabela’s failed to mention that the promotions fee was responsible for 70 bps,
or almost one-half, of the merchandise gross margin percentage increase year over year.
13.
Cabela’s earnings release for the second quarter 2012 stated that “Merchandise
margin increased 70 basis points [or .7%] to 37.4%, the highest level in more than five years.”7
Cabela’s claimed in the release that the increase was attributable to ‘[o]ngoing focus on Cabela’s
branded products, improved in-season and pre-season planning, and greater vendor collaboration.”
The ER Report for the second quarter that Castner received in preparation for the earnings call,
however, showed that the promotions fee contributed 78 bps or 100% of the increase to the metric
year over year. Without the promotions fee, Cabela’s would have reported no change in its
merchandise gross margin percentage year over year for the quarter. Cabela’s made similar
misstatements and omissions in the second quarter 2012 Form 10-Q.

7

Cabela’s second quarter 2011 merchandise gross margin percentage was 36.7%.

5

14.
Cabela’s earnings release for the third quarter stated that “Merchandise gross
margin increased 130 basis points to 37.2%. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of merchandise
margin improvement.”8 Both the earnings release and the Form 10-Q attributed the increase to an
“[o]ngoing focus on Cabela’s branded products, improved in-season and pre-season planning, and
greater vendor collaboration …” which “overcame strong sales of firearms and ammunition, which
had a 60 basis point negative impact on merchandise gross margin.” The third quarter ER Report
that Castner received, however, showed an increase of 1.25% year over year for the third quarter
(rounded up to the reported 130 basis points increase) to which the promotions fee contributed 66
basis points, or over one-half of the increase.
15.
Moreover, Cabela’s 2012 Form 10-K, addressing year-end rather than quarterly
results, stated, “our merchandise gross margin as a percentage of merchandise revenue increased
70 basis points to 36.3% in 2012 compared to 35.6% in 2011.” For the year 2012, the promotions
fee contributed approximately 50 basis points to the 70 basis point year-over-year increase. The
Form 10-K attributed the increase to various factors that did not include the promotions fee.
Financial Statement, Accounting, and Disclosure Failures in Third Quarter 2012
16.
In the third quarter 2012, Cabela’s failed to account properly for several items as
required under GAAP in its financial statements. These errors increased Cabela’s third quarter
2012 net income by approximately $2.02 million or 4.72%.
17.
After the close of the third quarter books, Cabela’s discovered an error in the
calculation of Cabela’s current quarter state income tax expense. The correction of this tax error
would have increased third quarter income tax expense by approximately $674,000. Instead of
correcting the tax error, Cabela’s made an adjustment to offset the additional income tax expense
by increasing the portion of its revenue characterized as “indefinitely invested foreign earnings”
by $5 million, which had the effect of reducing tax expense by approximately $674,000.9 Under
GAAP, the presumption that all undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary will be transferred
to the parent entity generating a deferred tax expense for the anticipated repatriation may be
overcome if the subsidiary has invested or evidences an intent and ability to reinvest the
undistributed earnings indefinitely, pursuant to ASC 740-30-27-17. Cabela’s did not have the
requisite support for changing (increasing) the amount of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings
as of the end of the third quarter, which is required under GAAP. Because Cabela’s
inappropriately offset its income tax expense, it should have corrected the state income tax error
in the third quarter by recording an expense of $674,000 in its financial statements. This error
resulted in a $674,000 decrease in income tax expense and an increase in Cabela’s third quarter
net income.
8

Cabela’s third quarter 2011 merchandise gross margin percentage was 35.9%.

“Indefinitely invested foreign earnings” are undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary that will not be repatriated
to the U.S. parent in the foreseeable future. Increasing the amount of indefinitely reinvested earnings has the effect of
providing a foreign tax benefit. The foreign tax benefit results from including lower foreign taxes in the consolidated
income tax expense without an additional deferred tax expense due to the incremental U.S. taxes that will occur upon
repatriation (in cases where the U.S. tax rate is higher than the foreign tax rate).

18.
The quarterly calculation of WFB’s allowance for loan loss reserve, the reserve
for doubtful credit card receivables, was based on two components – a model reserve and a
discretionary management adjustment in which management considered general economic and
business conditions affecting key lending areas, credit concentration, changes in origination and
portfolio management, and credit quality trends. In the third quarter 2012, WFB changed the
way it determined the pool of delinquent loans underlying the management adjustment by
removing from the delinquent pool accounts with credit scores of 691 and above (the loans less
likely to be delinquent). In calculating the adjustment based on this new pool, WFB used the
wrong loss rate. Contrary to GAAP, WFB initially calculated the loss rate for the revised pool
(19%) but chose to use the lower rate (17.8%) that it had used when the pool included the less risky
accounts as the difference was deemed immaterial to the reserve. 10 This action resulted in an
under-accrual of the reserve by $367,784 and a positive impact on net income of $248,990.
19.
Cabela’s historically booked receivables for overpayments to vendors. The
potential overpayments were first identified by an accounts payable examination company. They
were then verified by Cabela’s, approved by various departments within Cabela’s for collection,
and then submitted to the vendor to provide it with the opportunity to object to Cabela’s
assessment of the overpayment. The amount of the receivable booked by Cabela’s for an
overpayment depended on where the overpayment was in the lifecycle of investigation. Vendor
overpayment accruals ranged from 0% to 100% of the amount of the overpayment identified,
with claims newly submitted to a vendor on the low end of the range and overpayments approved
by the vendor for payment on the high end of the range. In the third quarter, Cabela’s accrued a
receivable for the “submitted” category of overpayment, the category in the earliest stage of the
lifecycle in which the accounts payable examination company had just identified the potential
overpayment. Cabela’s had historically accrued the submitted category at 0% because Cabela’s
had not done any work to assess the validity of the claims nor determined whether to seek
reimbursement from the vendors if the claims appeared to be valid. Instead, in the third quarter
of 2012, Cabela’s accrued 73% of the items in the submitted category, increasing the vendor
receivable from $547,214 to $939,271. The 73% was simply based on the number of vendors in
the prior year from which Cabela’s had successfully collected overpayments with no regard to the
amounts collected. Cabela’s did not have sufficient evidence as of the third quarter to support its
claim to an asset for the submitted category. Because an insufficient evaluation of the claims had
been performed to determine if the claims were valid or if the counterparty would pay, it was
improper to accrue the $392,077 for the submitted claims.11 This error decreased cost of goods
sold by $392,077 and increased net income by $265,436.
20.
In the third quarter of 2012, Cabela’s excluded from the pool from which
Cabela’s calculated its general obsolescence reserve guns that had been specifically designed to
celebrate Cabela’s 50th anniversary in business. The purpose of Cabela’s obsolescence reserve
The ASC 250-10-20 Glossary defines an “Error in Previously Issued Financial Statements” as “an error in the
recognition, measurement, presentation, or disclosure in financial statements resulting from mathematical mistakes,
mistakes in the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), or oversight or misuse of facts that
existed at the time the financial statements were prepared.”

was to reduce Cabela’s merchandise inventory to lower of cost or market. Cabela’s obsolescence
reserve was a general reserve for all items in inventory. Cabela’s written obsolescence reserve
procedures acknowledged that the obsolescence pool used to calculate the reserve included items
that would not be sold below cost and vice versa. No inventory had previously been removed
from the pool. The removal of the 50th anniversary guns totaling $1.4 million from the obsolete
inventory pool was done without any analysis of overall inventory levels, but instead based on the
belief that the 50th anniversary guns would not be sold below cost. The impact of removing the
$1.4 million of 50th anniversary guns was to reduce the obsolescence reserve by $327,000. GAAP
requires that the reserve must be supported by well-documented analyses and applied
consistently from period to period.12 Because Cabela’s changed the pool of inventory in its
obsolescence reserve without sufficient analysis, this was an error under GAAP.13 This error
decreased the cost of goods sold by $327,000 and increased net income by $221,379.
21.
In the third quarter 2012, Cabela’s booked an $899,607 receivable correcting an
earlier error relating to the overpayment of sales taxes that occurred and was quantified in a prior
period. Cabela’s had previously calculated the amount of the correction and should have booked it
in a prior period. As a result of this error, Cabela’s incorrectly recognized in its third quarter
financial statements an $899,607 increase to revenue, which resulted in an increase to net income
of $609,034.14
Books, Records, and Lack of Internal Controls
22.
Cabela’s improperly recorded its intercompany accounts and transactions, cost of
sales, WFB’s revenue, various receivables and reserves, and tax obligations, and its books, records
and accounts did not, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and
dispositions of assets.
23.
Cabela’s failed to implement internal accounting controls relating to its
intercompany accounts and transactions; cost of sales; WFB’s revenue; and various receivables,
reserves, and tax obligations which were sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
transactions were recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP.
Violations by Cabela’s
24.
As result of the conduct described above, Cabela’s violated Section 13(a) of the
Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder, which require every issuer of a
security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act file with the Commission
information, documents, and annual and quarterly reports as the Commission may require, and

assessing impairments be applied consistently from year to year.

mandate that periodic reports contain such further material information as may be necessary to
make the required statements not misleading.
25.
As a result of the conduct described above, Cabela’s violated Section 13(b)(2)(A)
of the Exchange Act, which requires reporting companies to make and keep books, records, and
accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and
dispositions of their assets.
26.
Lastly, as a result of the conduct described above, Cabela’s violated Section
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which requires all reporting companies to devise and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
and to maintain accountability for assets.
Violations by Castner
27.
As result of the conduct described above, Castner caused Cabela’s violations of
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder relating to the
failure to eliminate the intercompany promotions fee in preparing its consolidated financial
statements, which require every issuer of a security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the
Exchange Act file with the Commission information, documents, and annual and quarterly
reports as the Commission may require, and mandate that periodic reports contain such further
material information as may be necessary to make the required statements not misleading.
28.
As a result of the conduct described above, Castner caused Cabela’s violations of
Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act relating to the failure to eliminate the intercompany
promotions fee in preparing its consolidated financial statements, which requires reporting
companies to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect their transactions and dispositions of their assets.
29.
Lastly, as a result of the conduct described above, Castner caused Cabela’s
violations of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act relating to the failure to eliminate the
intercompany promotions fee in preparing its consolidated financial statements, which requires all
reporting companies to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets.

investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.

523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by
Respondent Castner, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or
other amounts due by Respondent Castner under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent
order, decree or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the
violation by Respondent Castner of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued
under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
