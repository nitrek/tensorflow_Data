College, in Claremont, California, and an LL.B. degree in 1948 from
the Harvard Law School. At the time of his appointment to the
Commission, Commissioner Wheat was a member of the Los Angeles
law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, with which he became associated
upon his graduation from law school. His practice was primarily in
the field of corporation and business law, including the registration of
securities for public offering under the Securities Act of 1933. He has
been active in bar association work, including service as Chairman
of the Committee on Corporations of the Los Angeles County Bar
Association and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Investment Companies and Investment Advisers, Committee on Federal Regulation
of Securities, American Bar Association (Banking and Business Law
Section).
He also has written or co-authored articles on various
aspects of the securities business and its regulation, both under Federal
and State law. He took office as a member of the Commission on
October 2, 1964, for the term expiring June 5, 1966, and was reappointed for the term expiring June 5, 1971.

INTRODUCTION
Changing Conditions in the Securities

Indnstry

Changes are taking place in the nation's securities markets and the
securities industry. The dramatic growth of institutional investment
in equity securities and the advent of automation are but two examples
of the changes which raise basic questions about the structure of the
securities industry and its ways of doing business. The Commission
must continually study and assess the implications of these changes
and take appropriate action if it is to fulfill its statutory obligations
and help to maintain public confidence in the securities markets.
The Commission has recently completed and submitted to the Congress a Report on the Public Policy Implications of Investment
Company Growth. The Report was submitted pursuant to Section
14(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which authorizes the
Commission, "if it deems that any substantial further increase in the
size of investment companies creates any problem involving the protection of investors or the public interest, to make a study and investigation" and "to report the results of its studies and investigations
and its recommendations to the Congress."
Both the securities industry and the Commission have taken important first steps in the use of electronic data-processing equipment,
but much remains to be done in that area. The Commission's computer is already serving an important role in the surveillance of the
securities markets and in developing a better understanding of the
operation of the securities markets. The Commission is also working
with the self-regulatory organizations, namely, the national securities
exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, to develop automated procedures which will make possible more efficient
and effective procedures for the execution of securities transactions,
the publication of more timely and informative price and other information, and the establishment of improved surveillance programs.
The Commission staff has drafted improved financial reporting
forms for broker-dealers and investment advisers, and is discussing
these forms with industry groups. The information derived from
these forms, coupled with the use of computer simulation techniques,
should facilitate the evaluation of trends and problems within the industry and of the effects of alternative regulatory actions.
Changes in the securities markets and in the companies whose
securities are traded require a reassessment of the Commission's disXVII

closure requirements. At the present time the Commission is working with the accounting profession and corporate executives to improve
financial reporting by "conglomerate" companies and to enhance the
comparability of financial statements of similar companies. In addition the Commission is reviewing its disclosure requirements under the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to
be coordinated and simplified so as
determine if the requirements
to provide more meaningful information to investors.
In sum, changes in the structure of the securities markets, in the
composition of the investor population, and in technology all require
knowledge and understanding on the Commission's part and imaginative regulation to deal with the problems raised. The Commission's
budget and staff have been strained in an effort to keep pace with
these problems. The Commission is attempting, through improved
coordination and cooperation with the states and the self-regulatory
bodies and other measures, to achieve the best utilization of its available resources.

PART I
IMPORTANT

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

As indicated in the Introduction to this Report, the Commission
and its staff devoted considerable attention during the 1966 fiscal
year to the study of changes taking place in the securities field and
consideration of the appropriate regulatory response. Some of the
problem areas had
touched on in the Report of the Special Study
of Securities Markets and various of the actions taken during the year
were to implement recommendations of that Study. Another important step forward was the acquisition of a computer, coincident
with the Commission's move into a new building. The computer will
contribute substantially to the Commission's efforts to discharge its
responsibilities more effectively. The sections that follow describe
in brief the principal matters under consideration during the year
(aside from developments with respect to the Securities Acts Amendments of 1964 which are discussed in Part II of this Report), the longawaited move to satisfactory quarters, and the Commission's entry
into the computer age.

been

Proposed Broker-Dealer Financial Reporls

The Commission has submitted to industry leaders an informal
proposal to require broker-dealers to furnish increased financial
information on a periodic basis.
In making this proposal, the Commission considered several factors.
It noted that this is a period of rapid change in the securities markets
and the security industry. The resulting situation calls for actions
and decisions which require an informed analysis of the operations of
the markets and of persons and organizations in the markets. It is
necessary to evaluate the effects which various changes and proposals
by the Commission and others may have on the functioning of the
industry, its profitability and its ability to attract capital and people
with the imagination and energy so necessary to the continued growth
and development of our national economy. The Commission believes
that a full regulatory response to these conditions should be based on
informed analysis of the economic factors at work in the industry.
The Commission, the stock exchanges and the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. now receive assorted financial information at
various times but often in a form which does not permit meaningful
1

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

evaluation and there is an almost complete absence of information
about the sources of income and expense for large segments of the
industry. Conferences with industry leaders are continuing.
Level and Structure of Commission Rate

During the fiscal year, the staff continued its research on the level
of the exchange commission rate. Considerable effort was devoted to
improving the quality and quantity of available data. As noted above
a proposed report form for broker-dealers has been drafted. Pending
resolution of the problems in developing such a report, the New York
Stock Exchange, following conferences with the Commission staff,
improved and made mandatory the filing of the Exchange's income
and expense report by all members doing a public commission business. It also adopted a form to provide supplementary balance sheet
information for the firms filing such reports.
The Commission staff has also continued its consultations on the
commission rate structure with the New York Stock Exchange staff
and others. These were directed towards gaining a fuller understanding of the various practices which now permit arrangements
qualifying the fixed minimum commission schedule established by the
Exchange. Based partly on these discussions, the Commission, with
a view to insuring a reasonable commission rate structure, has been
evaluating such current practices as "give-ups" and "give-aways",
reciprocal arrangements, and the provision of special services.
Odd-Lot Studies

The Special Study recommended that the New York Stock Exchange, with appropriate participation by the Commission, undertake It cost study of the odd-lot business. It also recommended that
the Commission, in conjunction with other exchanges, undertake
studies of the methods and costs of handling odd-lots on those exchanges. During the fiscal year the Commission reviewed the odd-lot
differential charged by New York Stock Exchange firms in the light
of the cost studies of the Exchange discussed in last year's annual
report,' the analysis made by the Commission's staff, and the numerous
conferences with the exchanges on the matter.
On June 16, 1966, effective July 1, 1966, the New York Stock
Exchange, at the request of the Commission, adjusted its odd-lot
differential. The new differential is 12% cents on each share of stock
selling for less than $55 and 25 cents on each share selling for $55
or over. The previous "break point" was $40. In requesting this
change the Commission indicated that it expected that a further review of the odd-lot differential charge of the New York Stock Ex1

change would be made promptly after the end of 1966. In addition,
the Commission determined to extend its inquiry into the mechanics
and principles under which odd-lot transactions are effected in all
securities markets. It has requested the comments of all the exchanges
and the NASD with regard to a number of significant issues and
problems pertinent to such a study.
Review of Exchange Rules Regarding

Off-Board Trading

The Special Study Report recommended that the Commission and
its staff give continuing attention to "factors contributing to or detracting from the public's ready access to all markets," as well as
limitations on competition between markets and the effects of such
limitations on the fair and orderly functioning of the markets.
Until recently Rule 394 of the New York Stock Exchange prohibited all off-board transactions in listed securities, whether effected
on a principal or agency basis, unless the securities are specifically
exempted by the Exchange. The other national securities exchanges
have similar rules. Near the close of fiscal 1965 the Commission's
staff began a study to determine whether such prohibitions were consistent with the standards established under Section 19(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act for fair dealing in securities traded on exchanges. This inquiry was conducted during fiscal 1966. Following
the end of the year, the Exchange, at the request of the Commission,
amended Rule 394 to permit member broker-dealers to execute transactions with certain non-member broker-dealers who maintain markets in listed securities,- The rule is designed to promote competition
between the exchange specialist and the non-member market-maker
and to provide the public customer with the benefits of the best available market.
Automation

of Market Facilities

During the past year the Commission appointed certain members
of its staff to an Electronic Data Processing Committee. The Committee's responsibilities include (1) the continuous examination of
industry practices and Commission rules to insure that the development and use of automation in the securities industry fulfills the needs
of both the industry and the Commission; and (2) the recommendation
of policies and procedures to implement its findings.
The Committee has met with representatives of the various exchanges, the National Association of Securities Dealers, suppliers of
stock market data and other interested parties to discuss various aspects
of automation in the securities industry. Discussions with the exchanges have dealt with such matters as the establishment of central
• See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7981 (October 20,1966).

4

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

bookkeeping systems and central depositories for securities, the improvement of quotations, the aut.omation of surveillance procedures
and the clearing operation, and the automation of the execution of
odd-lot transactions. Automation in the over-the-counter market has
been discussed with the National Association of Securities Dealers,
with broker-dealers, and with vendors who hope to supply the equipment and related services for any such program.
In recent years the New York Stock Exchange has worked toward
the development of a centralized system for the handling and delivery
of securities through the use of automated procedures. To further
the development of such systems, the Commission during fiscal year
1966 amended Rules 8c-1 and 15c2-1 under the Exchange Act 3 to provide that the hypothecation of customers' securities held by a clearing
corporation or other subsidiary organization of a national securities
exchange or national securities association or by a custodian bank
pursuant to a central system in which customers' securities are commingled with securities of others will not of itself constitute a commingling prohibited by those rules. Generally speaking, the exemption is available only where the custodian agrees to deliver the securities
it holds as directed by the system and not to assert any claim against
them; the system has safeguards for the handling, transfer and delivery
of the securities; and the system provides for fidelity bond coverage
of employees and agents of the clearing corporation or other subsidiary
organization and for periodic examination by independent public
accountants. In addition, the Commission must find that the custody
agreement and the safeguards established are adequate for the protection of investors. At the time the Commission amended the rules
it found that the New York Stock Exchange's Central Certificate
Service met the specified standards.'
While the amendment makes clear that the presence within a system
of a stock certificate representing the interests of various customers and
other parties, including pledgees, does not constitute a prohibited
commingling, it does not make legal a hypothecation prohibited by
Ru1es 8c-l and 15c2-1. Thus, it would still constitute a violation of
these rules to hypothecate the securities of more than one customer
of a member, broker or dealer to secure a loan unless the consent of
each customer is obtained, or to hypothecate the securities of a
customer with those of any person other than a customer to secure
a loan.
Over-the-Counter

Markets

The Special Study pointed out serious inadequacies in the supervisory controls utilized by broker-dealers in their surveillance of the
• Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7896 (May 25,1966).
• Ibid.

selling activities of salesmen and other employees and recommended
the strengthening of such procedures and the adoption by the selfregulatory agencies of clearer standards and stronger enforcement
procedures to assure more effective supervision by their member firms.
The Commission's staff initiated discussion with the NASD to deal
with these problems and on July 1, 1965, the NASD adopted rules
dealing with supervision procedures and selling practices of Association members. Among other things, these rules require the establishment and enforcement of written supervisory procedures and
designation of a partner or officer to be responsible for their execution.
The internal procedures must include periodic review of customer
accounts and at least an annual inspection of each branch office. The
NASD rule governing discretionary accounts has also been amended
to require written customer authorization, supervisory review, and
approval of activity in such accounts. A revised statement summarizing many of the selling practices which violate a member's
responsibility for fair dealing also was adopted. To aid in the implementation of these new rules, the Association has prepared and
distributed to its members a separate comprehensive manual which
contains detailed guidelines and suggestions for effective supervisory
procedures.
All of these areas were subjects of Special Study
recommendations.
During the year a number of further conferences were held between
the NASD and the Commission staff concerning the NASD markup
policy. The NASD has had a special committee reviewing the Association's markup policy, which also was the subject of a number of
significant recommendations by the Special Study. The Association
hopes to present a revised markup policy to its Board of Governors
for adoption in the near future.
As noted in last year's annual report, the NASD engaged an outside
management consulting firm to study the effects of its revised newspaper quotations system which was adopted in response to the provisions of Section 15A(b) (12) of the Securities Exchange Act as
amended in 1964 and the recommendations of the Special Study. The
study was also designed to assist in evaluating the possible effects and
appropriateness of the Special Study's recommendations regarding
the prohibition of so-called "riskless" principal transactions in the
over-the-counter markets and the disclosure of prevailing inter-dealer
markets to investors. In October 1966, the findings and conclusions
of the study were announced by the NASD. The study found that
the quotations revisions made in 1965 had had no substantial impact
on the markets for the securities affected, and that the issuers of these
securities as well as well as those quoted in local lists sponsored by the
NASD favored publication of inter-dealer (i.e. wholesale) quotations.

6

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The NASD has revised its rules to provide that all over-the-counter
quotations in national news media reflect inter-dealer markets including those in securities traded only on a local basis. With respect to the
possible impact of adoption of the other Special Study proposals,
the consulting firm concluded that certain types of NASD members
would be adversely affected. These conclusions are now being reviewed
by the Commission's staff.
Coordination of Regulatory Efforts

During the past year, the Commission gave increased emphasis to
the coordination of its regulatory activities with those of the various
states and the self-regulatory institutions to improve the effectiveness
of regulation and at the same time to reduce the burdens of compliance. The regional offices took steps to improve the coordination
of inspection and other activities with state securities administrators
and with the NASD in those areas where the respective jurisdictions
overlap. Staff members of the Commission and of certain of the state
authorities have conducted joint inspections which have strengthened
and made more effective the entire inspection program.
The Commission has also developed procedures for informing state
administrators about important investigations the Commission is
conducting in their respective states and for advising them of injunctive or public administrative proceedings which are to be instituted
there.
To make information filed with the Commission more readily available to the states, the Commission now furnishes to the interested
state administrators a copy of the prospectus in the first registration
statement filed by a company under the Securities Act of 1933. The
Commission will also send a copy of any broker-dealer withdrawal
form to the state administrator in the state in which the firm's principal officeis located. This form may help the state administrator determine whether any regulatory action under state law is appropriate.
To reduce the burden on persons filing broker-dealer application
forms, the North American Securities Administrators recently approved the adoption of a uniform form, which will be available to
all administrators. A common core of information would be provided
by the Commission's broker-dealer registration form, and that information would be supplemented by information, if any, required by
a particular jurisdiction. This new form will reduce the burden on
firms who must now furnish the same or similar information to various
regulatory bodies.
Significant progress has also been made to coordinate the administration of examinations given to securities salesmen, to relieve them
of the need to take essentially duplicative examinations. In its exami-

nation program for persons associated with broker-dealers that are
not members of the NASD, the Commission grants reciprocity to
securities examinations meeting established standards," Since the
initiation of the Commission examination program in January 1966,
a majority of the 31 states which require salesmen to pass a general
securities examination, and the NASD, have granted reciprocity to
the Commission's own examination.
Conflicts of Interest of Investment

Advisers

The Special Study Report discussed various situations where the
nature of the advice given by investment advisers could be affected
by consideration of their own interests. It particularly questioned
the purchase of securities by an investment adviser for his own account
shortly before recommending such securities, followed by a sale after
the market price reflects the impact of the recommendation. This
practice is known as "scalping."
With a view to identifying and possibly regulating conflicts-ofinterest situations involving investment advisers, the Commission
amended Rule 204-2 (a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to
require investment advisers to maintain records concerning transactions in which they or their "advisory representatives" (as that term
is defined in the rule) have a beneficial interest,"
In announcing the amendment, the Commission pointed out that an
investment adviser is a :fiduciary, and as such owes his clients undivided loyalty, should not engage in any activity in conflict with the
interest of clients, and should take the steps reasonably necessary to
fulfill his :fiduciary obligations. It referred to the holding by the
United States Supreme Court in SEO v, Oapital Gains Research
Bureau, 375 U.S.1S0 (1963), that "scalping" by an investment adviser
violates the anti-fraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and (2) of the
Advisers Act unless appropriately disclosed. The Commission has considered whether it should adopt a rule designed to prevent "scalping"
by prohibiting specified transactions by investment advisers and their
associates in securities recommended by them. It is expected that the
new record-keeping requirement will assist the Commission in determining whether such a rule is necessary and if so, what its nature and
scope should be. In addition, the reports furnished to investment
advisers by their "advisory representatives" should provide the investment advisers with valuable information on the basis of which
• See pp.16-17, infra.

Its adoption was
announced in Investment Advisers Act Release No. 203 (August 11, 19(6). To
allow investment advisers adequate time to establish the internal procedures
necessary for compliance with its provision, the Commission made the amendment
effective on October 1, 1966.

they may establish appropriate internal controls over representatives'
trading.
New Building

The Commission completed its move into new quarters in June 1966
The building is conveniently located at. 500 North Capitol Street, facing Union Station Plaza.
For the first time in its 32-year history, the Commission's Headquarters Officeis housed in a single modern officebuilding with suitable
facilities and accommodations. This consolidation of the Washington
staff (including the Washington Regional Office) into one building
will contribute to a more orderly and efficient conduct of the Commission's business. Coincident with the move, the Commission undertook
to improve its service to the public. For example, better facilities are
now available for the public's examination of corporate and other reports on file with the Commission. In addition, new and improved
telephone facilities have been installed which will permit direct transfers of incoming telephone calls without rerouting through the master
switchboard. The Commission will continue to press forward in
every possible way to make improvements in its service to the public.
In a message sent to the dedication ceremonies, President Johnson
said:
"It gives me great pleasure to congratulate you on the attainment
of a much-needed goal-the efficient and attractive quarters being
dedicated today.
For many years the Securities and Exchange Commission has
labored under the handicap of a series of so-called "temporary"
buildings. I am glad that we could finally obtain this new and
more pleasant working environment for your dedicated public
servants.
The modern facilities now at your disposal will undoubtedly result in even better service to the public and the securities industry.
A valuable by-product of the new SEC building deserves mention.
The important Washington gateway at Union Station, adjacent
to the Capitol, should add to an impressive first view for our
visitors arriving by rail. The SEC building significantly improves the vista on this spacious plaza. It makes a notable contribution to our efforts to create a more beautiful Washington.
I share the pride of the Commission and its staff in your new
home and you have my best wishes for the future."
Installation and Use of Electronic Data-Processing Equipment

In May 1966, following extensive studies and preparatory work,
a computer was delivered to the Commission in its new building. The

TEITRTY-SECOND ANNUAL

REPORT

equipment is being used for a variety of regulatory, enforcement,
statistical and house-keeping uses.
In one important application of EDP, the Commission has begun
operation of an integrated regulatory and enforcement information
system which combines information as to names, numbers and descriptions previously contained only in a number of separate indexes. The
new system will permit a speedier, more accurate and more comprehensive verification of information in incoming documents against
information already on file. It will also be used to provide supervisory personnel with meaningful information about the large number
of documents which are under examination at any given time. A
second important application of automation is in the area of surveillance of the over-the-counter securities markets on a comprehensive
basis which was not feasible under the former manual methods. The
computer is programmed to identify unusual price movements or dealer
interest, securities which are quoted in the inter-dealer market after
lengthy absence, and those in which there are "special arrangements"
among broker-dealers. If a security is identified for any of these
reasons, the system will print out the security and the dealers involved,
permitting the rapid detection of potentially troublesome areas.
The computer is also being used to analyze various data relating
to the securities industry. These analyses will materially assist the
Commission in carrying out its regulatory functions. EDP applications planned for the future include the development and programming
of a system for legal and accounting research and the expansion of
the integrated regulatory and enforcement system to provide for EDP
surveillance of security holdings and transactions required to be
reported by corporate insiders.

PARTn
OPERATION OF THE SECURITIES ACTS AMENDMENTS OF 1964
Extension of Disclosure Requirements

to Over-the-Counter

Secnrities

Section 12(g) of the 1964 amendments extended to many securities
traded in the over-the-counter markets the registration, periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and insider reporting and trading provisions of the Exchange Act previously applicable to securities listed on
a national securities exchange. This Section requires a company with
total assets exceeding 1 million dollars and a class of non-exempt equity
securities not previously registered under Section 12 which is held of
record by 500 or more persons 1 to register those securities by filing a
registration statement.
During the fiscal year, 676 registration statements were filed under
Section 12(g). From the enactment of the 1964 amendments through
June 30, 1966, 2,184 registration statements were filed under this Section. Six of these statements were withdrawn before they had become
effective upon the determination that they were not required to be filed
under the Act. Sixteen registrations were terminated pursuant to
Section 12(g) (4) because the number of shareholders fell under 300.
Of the 2,184 registration statements filed under Section 12 (g), 1,310
were filed by issuers already subject to the reporting requirements of
Sections 13 or 15 (d) of the Act. Of this latter figure 106 registration
statements (78 in fiscal 1965 and 28 in fiscal 1966) were filed by issuers
with another security registered on a national securities exchange
under Section 12 of the Act, and 1,204 were filed by issuers subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) (851 during fiscal 1965
and 353 during fiscal 1966) . These latter companies had not been subject to the proxy solicitation and insider reporting and trading provisions of Sections 14 and 16 of the Exchange Act. The remaining
868 issuers which filed registration statements had not been subject to
any of the disclosure or insider trading provisions and became subject
to them through registration.
During the fiscal year, the Commission granted 250 extensions of
time for filing, including more than one request by some issuers. A
majority of these requests was based on the difficulties encountered
by independent accountants in preparing certified financial statements
1

Until JUly 1, 1966, the number was 750.

11

within the prescribed time when prior financial statements had not
been certified.
During the fiscal year, 1,304 definitive proxy statements were filed
pursuant to Regulation 14A by issuers with securities registered under
Section 12(g). In addition, 19 out of 37 proxy contests occurring
during the year which were subject to Regulation 14A involved securities registered under Section 12(g) .
As a further consequence of Section 12(g), there was a great increase
in the number of ownership reports filed this year pursuant to
Section 16(a).
Section 14(c) of the Exchange Act, added by the 1964 amendments,
requires issuers of securities registered under Section 12 to file with
the Commission and transmit to security holders from whom proxies
are not solicited for a meeting of stockholders an information statement containing information comparable to that which would be
furnished in proxy material if proxies were solicited. During the
fiscal year, the Commission adopted Regulation 14C, setting forth the
requirements for this information statement. In the case of an annual meeting the issuer is also required to transmit to security holders an annual report including financial statements certified by independent public or certified public accountants, similar to the annual
report required of issuers which solicit proxies,"
Rule 14c-7 of the new regulation provides that if the issuer knows
that securities of any class entitled to vote at a meeting are held of
record by a broker, dealer, bank or voting trustee, or their nominees,
the issuer must inquire whether other persons are beneficial owners of
such securities and must furnish the record holder with enough copies
of the information statement and annual report to enable the record
holder to send copies to the beneficial owners. The issuer must pay
the reasonable expenses of the record holders in transmitting this
material. This latter provision is similar to Rule 14a-2(b) of the
proxy rules.
Regulation 14C applied to any meeting of security holders held on or
after March 15, 1966. During the fiscal year, 53 information statements in definitive form were filed with the Commission pursuant to
the regulation.
Section 12 (i) provides, in effect, that for securities issued by banks,
the responsibility for administering and enforcing Sections 12, 13,
14(a), 14(c) and 16 of the Exchange Act is vested in the Comptroller
of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, depending on
which agency has primary supervisory jurisdiction over a particular

bank. The Commission understands that information regarding the
operation of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1964 with respect to
banks under the supervision of these agencies is discussed in their
respective annual reports or is otherwise available from them,"
Exemptions From Registration

Section 12(h) of the Act authorizes the Commission, either by rules
and regulations or by order upon application of an interested person,
to grant a complete or partial exemption from the provisions of Sections 12(g), 13,14, 15(d), or 16 if the Commission finds that because
of the number of public investors, the amount of trading interest in
the securities, the nature and extent of the activities of the issuer, the
income or assets of the issuer, or otherwise, the exemption is not inconsistent with the public interest or the protection of investors.
During the fiscal year, 22 applications for complete or partial exemptions were filed; 21 applications filed during the prior year were
pending. Of these 43 applications, 22 were granted,' 2 were denied,
7 were withdrawn, and 12 were pending at the end of the year. Exemptions were granted for a wide variety of reasons. Several mutual
or cooperative organizations which did not meet all of the technical
criteria of Section 12(g) (2) (F) for exclusion :from registration under
Section 12(g) were granted complete exemptions. Several issuers
which were in the process of liquidation or of taking steps which would
shortly terminate the public ownership of their securities, and whose
registrations would therefore be shortly terminated were also exempted
completely. Exemptions from Section 14(c) only were granted to
several other issuers, only a small percentage of whose securities were
held by the public and whose operations consisted solely of the receipt
of rentals for property leased to affiliates.
Section 12(g) (2) exempts various types of securities from the registration requirements of Section 12(g) including the securities of an
insurance company if (1) the company is required to and does file an
annual statement conforming to that prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NATC") with the insurance
regulatory authority of its domiciliary state; (2) the company is regulated in the solicitation of proxies as prescribed by the NATC; and
(3) after July 1, 1966, the purchase and sale of securities issued by the
company are subject to reporting and trading regulations by its

domiciliary state in substantially the same manner as provided by
Section 16 of the Act.
The N AlC has prescribed a uniform annual reporting form which
has been adopted in every State and the District of Columbia as the
required form for insurance companies. As part of that form, the
NAIC has developed a "stockholders' information supplement" to determine whether the company has furnished its stockholders with information substantially equivalent to that which the Commission
would require under its periodic reporting requirements and proxy
rules. The Commission has been informed that, as of the close of
the fiscal year, the insurance regulatory agencies of every State and
the District of Columbia had adopted rules and regulations requiring companies within their jurisdiction to file the supplement and
any future revisions, and to comply with the proxy solicitation practices referred to therein. Many states also had enacted legislation specifically authorizing the adoption of such rules and regulations.
The NAlC also supported enactment of a model insider trading
statute affording investor protections comparable to those of Section
16 of the Exchange Act. As of August 15, 1966, all of the States
and the District of Columbia had passed such legislation.
Section 12(g) (3) authorizes the Commission to exempt foreign securities and certificates of deposit for such securities from the registration requirements of Section 12(g) if it :finds that such action is
in the public interest and is consistent with the protection of investors.
Rule 12g3-1, adopted on September 15, 1964, exempted all foreign
securities from registration until November 30, 1965.G This exemption afforded the Commission time to study the problems of the registration of foreign securities traded in the over-the-counter market.
On November 16, 1965, the Commission published for public comment
proposed rules and forms for the registration of foreign securities
under Section 12 (g) .6
The Commission received many comments on the proposed rules,
including many from persons and companies who would be directly
affected by them and from representatives of foreign governments.
Most of those who submitted comments suggested that the application
of the requirements of the Exchange Act to foreign issuers which were
neither listing shares on a United States securities exchange nor offering new shares in this country would be improper under international
law. A number of comments indicated that in particular areas there
would be technical difficulties in superimposing the requirements of
the proposed rules on existing law to which issuers were subject in
their country of incorporation.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

After considering the comments, the Commission further postponed
the application of Section 12 (g) to foreign issuers, by amending Rule
12g3-1 to extend the exemption from registration to November 30,
1966.7 During the further period of exemption, the Commission continued its study of the adequacy of information now furnished by
foreign issuers, the development and effects of the changing foreign
law in this field, and the need for technical changes in the proposed
rules because of foreign laws and practices. As of November 30,1966,
the exemption had not been extended further.
The earliest date by
which a foreign issuer would be required to register, if the Commission did not. grant a further exemption, is 120 days after its first fiscal
year ending after November 30, 1966.
To assist the Commission during the further exemption, and to
provide information as promptly as possible to American investors,
the Commission asked foreign issuers to furnish the Commission with
certain information if they had in excess of $1 million of total assets
and a class of equity securities with 500 or more holders (at least 300
of which are residents of the United States) at the end of a :fiscal year
ending after November 30, .1965. The information requested was that
which issuers were required to publish under foreign law or to furnish
to foreign stock exchanges, or which they distributed to their own
security holders. The information so furnished would be available
for public inspection.
On August 10, 1966, the Commission published a list of 80 foreign
issuers which had furnished information voluntarily and 32 issuers
which had not done SO.8 The Commission will publish additional
lists as additional companies furnish information.
The Commission
believes that these lists will be useful to brokers and dealers in making
recommendations to their customers concerning the securities of foreign companies.
Proposed Definitions Under the "Market.Maker"
Trading Provisions

Exemption From Insider

Section 16 (d) of the Exchange Act, added by the 1964 amendments,
exempts market-making transactions by broker-dealers from the profit
recovery provisions of Section 16 (b) and the "short sale" and "sale
against the box" provisions of Section 16(c). On June 16, 1966, the
Commission proposed for public comment a new Rule 16d-1 defining
certain terms in Section 16( d) and specifying conditions for the availability of the exemption,"
The proposed rule would define the term "securities held in an investment account" as used in Section 16 (d) to mean securities which

account, securities acquired in other than market-making transactions
and securities held by the dealer more than 5 business days after the
dealer ceases to maintain a market in the securities. The acquisition
of these securities would not be exempt from Section 16 (b) even
though made in a market-making transaction. The term "transactions made in the ordinary course of business and incident to the
establishment or maintenance of a primary or secondary market"
(referred to in the rule as "market-making transactions") would be
defined to mean both retail and inter-dealer transactions in securities
which are sold, or acquired and held for sale, in the ordinary course of
business and incident to the establishment or maintenance of a market.
The rule would require as a basis for exemption that the dealer maintain a continuous inter-dealer market in the securities on each business
day for a period of at least 45 consecutive calendar days, including
the day of the transaction for which exemption is claimed. At the
close of the fiscal year, the Commission was considering the comments
and suggestions which it had received.
Disciplinary

Action Against Broker-Dealers

and Their Associated Persons

The 1964 amendments added several important provisions to Section
15 of the Exchange Act concerning disciplinary action against brokers
and dealers and persons associated with them. For the first time,
the Commission was authorized to proceed directly against and impose sanctions on individuals associated with broker-dealer firms.
These sanctions include a suspension or a bar from being associated
with a broker-dealer. The sanctions which the Commission may impose against broker-dealers were expanded to permit censure and suspension of registration for up to 12 months. The statutory disqualifications from being registered as or associated with a broker-dealer were
expanded to include additional types of injunctions, convictions and
violations.
During fiscal 1966, the Commission applied the new provisions in
many instances. It instituted four proceedings solely against individuals associated with broker-dealers. Another such proceeding was
pending at the start of the fiscal year. During the year, a respondent
in one of the above proceedings was barred from further association
with a broker-dealer. In proceedings in which broker-dealers as well
as certain of their associated persons were named as respondents, 67
individuals were barred from further association with a broker or
dealer, and 9 others were suspended from such association for varying periods of time. The Commission also suspended the registrations of six broker-dealer firms.

Regulation of Broker-Dealers
Associations

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

Who Are Not Members of Registered

Secnrities

Prior to the 1964 amendments, broker-dealers registered with the
Commission who were not members of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), or one of the principal exchanges,
were not subject to any comprehensive regulation concerning qualifications, experience in the securities business, or fair business practices.
A major objective of the amendments was "to insure that the Commission has the necessary authority to provide regulation of non-member
brokers and dealers comparable to that imposed by (self-regulatory)
associations on their membership, including the requirement that these
non-member brokers and dealers pay fees which will compensate the
Commission for this additional regulation."
New subsections (8), (9), and (10) of Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act authorize the Commission to adopt rules and regulations
prescribing standards of training, experience and other qualifications
for such brokers and dealers and persons associated with them, as well
as to adopt rules and regulations for non-member broker-dealers
designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to provide
safeguards against unreasonable profits or unreasonable rates of
commissions or other charges, and in general to protect investors and
the public interest and to remove impediments to and perfect the
mechanism of a free and open market.
During the past fiscal year, the Commission continued to implement
these provisions. In September 1965, the Commission adopted Rule
15b8-1 which, among other things, established qualification requirements for registered broker-dealers who do an over-the-counter business and who are not members of a registered securities association,
and for their principals, salesmen and other associated persons."
Subject to certain exemptions, every associated person engaged directly
or indirectly in securities activities must now successfully complete a.
qualifications examination, and broker-dealers subject to the rule must
file a personnel form for every such associated person with the
Commission.
In January 1966, the Commission's general securities examination,
administered by the NASD, was given for the first time. The examination covers a broad range of securities subjects, including corporate
structure, financial statements and accounting theory, investment companies, the securities laws, details of underwriting, trading and distributions, and other Federal rules and regulations such as Regulations
"T" and "U" of the Federal Reserve Board. By the end of the fiscal
year, 8,315 examinations had been given in over 70 testing centers in

the United States and Puerto Rico. The examination was first given
in United States consulates abroad in .August 1966.
.An associated person may also satisfy the examination requirement
by passing an examination which the Commission deems a satisfactory
alternative to its own. Such examinations include, thus far, those
given by the N .ASD, certain of the national securities exchanges, many
States, and the NAIC (in connection with variable annuities).
The Commission reviewed and processed more than 22,000 personnel
forms received from approximately 450 non-member broker-dealers
during the year. The Commission will use the information in these
forms to formulate further qualification standards for non-member
broker-dealers and associated persons. The data is also being coded
and tabulated for a statistical study of non-member broker-dealers.
In June 1966, the Commission adopted Rule 15b8-2, which among
other things established assessments for fiscal 1966.12 The assessments
apply to broker-dealers who had been registered with the Commission
for at least 45 days as of June 30, 1966, and who were not members of a
registered securities association on that date, as well as to broker-dealers who, although members of a registered securities association on
August 1, 1966 (the effective date of the rule), were for at least 45
days during fiscal 1966 both registered with the Commission and not
members of such association. The rule requires the filing of an assessment form and payment of a base fee for each such broker-dealer, and
imposes an additional levy for each associated person and each office
of the broker-dealer.
The rule also requires broker-dealers registering with the Commission after the effective date of the rule, who do not become members of
a registered securities association within 45 days after their registration with the Commission, to pay a fee of $150. In addition, there is a
$25 fee for each personnel form filed after .August 1, 1966, except those
forms filed for persons for whom such a form had previously been
filed by the firm and for persons who conduct all their securities activities outside the United States and do not deal with any United States
residents or nationals.
The rule exempts broker-dealers who are members of a national securities exchange if they do not carry customers' accounts and if their
annual gross income derived from over-the-counter business is no more
than $1,000. This exemption applies mainly to exchange specialists
and other floor members who occasionally introduce accounts to other
members .
.A program for the inspection of non-member broker-dealers has
been formulated, and the first inspections were conducted in August
1966. In addition, the Commission's staff has drafted rules under

Section 15(b) (10) concerning the business conduct and selling practices of broker-dealers, and additional rules concerning advertising

Summary Suspension of Over-the-Counter Trading

Section 15(c) (5) of the 1964 amendments authorizes the Commission to suspend over-the-counter trading in any security (except an
exempted security) summarily for 10 days if the Commission believes
the public interest and protection of investors so require. Brokerdealers are prohibited from trading in any such security during the
period of suspension. This provision is a counterpart to Section
19(a) (4) which provides for summary suspension of trading in securities listed on a national securities exchange.
During the 1966 fiscal year, the Commission temporarily banned
trading in five over-the-counter securities. In three of these cases,
the Commission suspended trading when it learned of information not
generally known to the securities community and investors which indicated that there were substantial questions concerning the financial
condition or business operations of the companies involved. The suspensions were ordered pending clarification and adequate public dissemination of information concerning these matters."
The Commission suspended trading in the securities of two other
issuers concurrently with the institution of court action to enjoin violations of the Federal securities laws in the offer and sale of such
securities. These suspensions were imposed to permit public disclosure of the information developed and the steps taken by the Commission in the course of its investigations of the violations.>
The Commission also acted under Section 15(c) (5) in several instances where it ordered suspensions at the same time under Section
19(a) (4) for securities traded on national securities exchanges. In
these cases, the Commission found it necessary to suspend over-thecounter trading to prevent circumvention of the exchange suspension.
Changes in NASD Regulations

Pursuant to additional powers granted the NASD under the 1964
amendments, the Association amended its By-Laws and Rules of Fair
Practice in September 1965 to establish further qualification requirements and standards for members and persons associated with members, as well as to expand the Association's bars to eligibility for
membership. These new regulations also permit the Association in
disciplinary actions to proceed directly against associated persons
without necessarily joining the member firm.

PART HI
LEGISLATIVE ACfIVITIES
On October 22, 1965 the President signed Public Law 89-289,
amending the Securities Act of 1933. This legislation, proposed by the
Commission, increased the fees payable for the registration of
securities under the Securities Act from YJ.oo of 1 percent of the
maximum aggregate offering price of the securities to be offered, or
10 cents per $1000, with a minimum fee of $25, to %0 of 1 percent, or
20 cents per $1000, with a minimum of $100. As a result, the Commission will be able to recover more of the costs of administration of
the Federal securities laws.
Chairman Cohen testified on behalf of the legislation on September
14, 1965, before the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce,
House of Representatives, and on September 22, 1965, before the Subcommittee on Securities of the Committee on Banking and Currency,
United States Senate.
On March 11, 1966, Chairman Cohen appeared before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions of the Committee on Banking
and Currency, United States Senate, and submitted a written statement in opposition to S. 2704, a bill to provide for the regulation of
collective investment funds maintained by banks. Under the bill,
interests in such funds would be excluded from the definition of
"security" in the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act, and
the funds would be excluded from the definition of "investment company" in the Investment Company Act. The Chairman stated that
the Commission objected to the bill principally because it was special
legislation which would permit banks to offer to the public collective
investment management similar to that offered by mutual funds but
without the proven safeguards which the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act afford t:o investors.
Chairman Cohen also testified on June 22, 1966, before the Subcommittee on Securities of the Committee on Banking and Currency,
United States Senate, concerning S. 2672, a bill to regulate the interstate sale of undeveloped subdivision lots. Among other things, the
bill, which follows the pattern of the Securities Act, would require a
real estate developer to file with the Commission a registration statement making specified disclosures if he subdivided land into 25 or more
units or interests for the purpose of sale or lease as part of a common
19

20

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

promotional plan, and to furnish a prospectus to a prospective purchaser or lessee at least 48 hours before a contract was entered into.
The bill also contains provisions designed to prevent and punish fraud.
The Chairman pointed out that administration of the bill by the
Commission would to some extent divert its attention from its primary
function, the regulation of the securities markets. He stated, however,
that if the bill were enacted into law, the Commission would do its best
to carry out the legislative purpose effectively and economically. The
Chairman also submitted for the record an analysis of the bill and
certain suggestions for amendment.
The Commission's General Counsel, Philip A. Loomis, Jr., testified
on April 4, 1966, before the Subcommittee on Domestic Marketing and
Consumer Relations of the Committee on Agriculture, House of Representatives, with respect to H.R. 11788, a bill to amend the Commodity
Exchange Act.
During the fiscal year the Commission and its staff analyzed or
commented on 43 bills and other legislative matters referred by various
committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, individual
memb~rs of Congress, the Bureau of the Budget and other Federal
agencies,

PART W
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Securities Act of 1933 is designed to provide disclosure to
investors of material facts concerning securities publicly offered for
sale by the use of the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce,
either by an issuing company or by any person in a control relationship to such company, and to prevent misrepresentation, deceit, or
other fraudulent practices in the sale of securities generally. Disclosure is obtained by requiring the issuer of such securities to file
a. registration statement with the Commission which includes a prospectus containing significant financial and other information about
the issuer and the offering. The registration statement is available
for public inspection as soon as it is filed. Although the securities
may be offered for sale as soon as the registration statement has been
filed, actual sales may not be made until the registration statement
has become effective. A copy of the prospectus must be furnished
to each purchaser at or before the sale or delivery of securities in order
to provide him with an opportunity to evaluate such securities and
make an informed investment decision. The issuer and the underwriter are responsible for the contents of the registration statement.
The Commission has no authority to control the nature or quality of a
security to be offered for public sale or to pass upon its merits or the
terms of its distribution.
Its action in permitting a registration
statement to become effective does not constitute approval of the
securities, and any representation to the contrary to a prospective
purchaser violates Section 23 of the Act.
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRATION PROCESS
Registration Statement and Prespeems

Registration of any security proposed to be publicly offered may
be effected by filing with the Commission a registration statement on
the applicable form containing the prescribed disclosure. Generally
speaking, a registration statement relating to securities issued by a
corporation or other private issuer must contain the information
specified in Schedule A of the Act, while a statement relating to
securities issued by a foreign government must include the information specified in Schedule B. Securities issued by the United States,
by a state, or by any political subdivision of a state are exempt from
21

22

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the registration provisions of the Act. The Act empowers the Commission to classify issues, issuers and prospectuses, to prescribe appropriate forms, and to increase, or in certain instances vary or
diminish, the particular items of information required to be disclosed
as the Commission deems appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors. To facilitate the registration of securities by
different types of issuing companies, the Commission has prepared
special registration forms which vary in their disclosure requirements
so as to provide maximum disclosure of the essential facts pertinent
in a given type of case while a,t the same time reducing the burden
and expense of compliance with the law.
In general, the registration statement of an issuer other than a foreign government must disclose such matters as the names of persons
who participate in the management or control of the issuer's business;
the security holdings and remuneration of such persons; the general
character of the business, its capital structure, past history and earnings; underwriters' commissions; payments to promoters made within
2 years or intended to be made; the interest of directors, officers and
principal stockholders in material transactions with the issuer; pending' legal proceedings; and the purposes to which the proceeds of the
offering are to be applied, and must include financial statements certified by independent accountants. The registration statement of a
foreign government contains information concerning the purposes for
which the proceeds of the offering are to be used, the natural and industrial resources of the issuer, its revenues, obligations and expenses,
the underwriting and distribution of the securities being registered,
and other material matters. The prospectus constitutes a part of the
registration statement and contains the more important of the required
disclosures.
Examination

Procedure

Registration statements are examined by the Commission's staff for
compliance with the standards of adequate and accurate disclosure.
This examination is primarily the responsibility of the Division
of Corporation Finance. Statements filed by investment companies
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 are examined
by the Division of Corporate Regulation. If it appears that a statement does not conform in material respects with the applicable requirements, the registrant is usually notified by a letter of comment and
is afforded an opportunity to file correcting or clarifying amendments.
The Commission also has the power, after notice and opportunity for
hearing, to issue an order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement if it finds that material representations are misleading,

THIRTY-SECOND

ANNUAL REPORT

23

inaccurate or incomplete. In certain instances, such as where the deficiencies in a registration statement appear to stem from careless disregard of applicable requirements or from a deliberate attempt to
conceal or mislead, a letter of comment is not sent and the Commission
either institutes an investigation to determine whether "stop-order"
proceedings should be instituted or immediately institutes such proceedings. Information regarding the exercise of the "stop-order"
power during fiscal year 196Gappears below under the heading "StopOrder Proceedings."
Time Required to Complete Registration

The Commission's staff endeavors to complete its examination of
registration statements in as short a time as possible. The Act provides that a registration statement shall become effective on the 20th
day after it is filed (or on the 20th day after the filing of any amendment thereto) . Since most registration statements require one or more
amendments, they usually do not become effective until some time
after the original 20-day period. The period between filing and
effective date is intended to afford investors an opportunity to become
familiar with the proposed offering through the dissemination of the
preliminary form of prospectus. The Commission can accelerate the
effective date so as to shorten the 20-day waiting period, taking into
account the adequacy of the information respecting the issuer theretofore available to the public, the facility with which the facts about the
offering can be understood, the public interest and the protection of
investors. The note to Rule 460 under the Act lists some of the more
common situations in which the Commission considers that the statute
generally requires it to deny acceleration.
The median number of calendar days from the date of the original
filing to the effective date for the 1,280 registration statements that
became effective during the 1966 fiscal year 1 was 38, compared with 36
days for 1,097 registration statements in fiscal year 1965 and 36 days
for 960 registration statements in fiscal year 1964.
The following table shows by months during the 1966 fiscal year the
number of calendar days elapsed during each of the three principal
stages of the registration process for the median registration statement, the total elapsed time and the number of registration statements
which became effective.
I This figure excludes 247 amendments filed by investment companies pursuant
to Section 24{e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940,which provides for the
registration of additional securities through amendment to an effective registration statement rather than the filing of a new registration statement.

VOLUME OF SECURITIES REGISTERED

During the fiscal year 1966, 1,523 registrations of securities in the
amount of $30.1 billion became effective under the Securities Act of
1933.2 The number of statements was the highest since the year ended
June 1962, and the dollar amount of registrations was the largest on
record. The large volume of issues reflected the general expansion in
the economy during the period and the sharply increased need for
funds by business. The chart on page 25 shows the number and
dollar amounts of registrations from 1935 to 1966.
The figures for 1966 include all registrations which became effective
including secondary distributions and securities registered for other
than cash sale, such as issues exchanged for other securities, and
securities reserved for conversion. Of the dollar amount of securities
registered in 1966, 85 percent was for account of issuer for cash sale,
8 percent for account of issuer for other than cash sale, and nearly
7 percent for account of others, as shown below.

The amount of securities offered for cash for account of issuer, $25.7
billion, represented an increase of $11 billion, or 75 percent, over the
previous year. Registration of new common stock issues aggregated
$18.2 billion, $7.6 billion more than in the 1965 fiscal period, reflecting
the continuing increase of registrations of investment company issues
which aggregated a record $12.4 billion. The amount of investment
company issues was almost double that of the preceding year. Registration of new bonds, notes and debentures increased 90 percent from
the previous year and accounted for $7.1 billion of the 1966 volume.
Preferred stock issues amounted to $445 million. Appendix Table 1

amounts registered for each of the fiscal years 1935 through 1966,

for cash sale on behalf of the issuer during those years. More
detailed information for 1966 is given in Appendix Table 2.
Corporate issues scheduled for immediate cash sale totaled almost
$8.8 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion over the previous year. Electric, gas and water companies registered $3.0 billion of new issues,
the largest amount for this group since 1958. Manufacturing company issues were next highest in volume, totaling $2.8 billion, the
largest amount since 1961. Issues of communication companies
amounted to $1.3 billion, almost double the amount registered in the
previous year. Among the other industry groups, registration of
financial and real estate issues totaled $1.0 billion, while trade, service,
mining and other miscellaneous issues amounted to over $500 million.
Registration of foreign government issues scheduled for immediate
sale increased to $482 million from $303 million in the preceding year.

Of the $8.8 billion expected from the immediate cash sale of corporate securities for the account of issuers in 1966, over 90 percent was
designated for plant and equipment expenditures ($6.4 billion) and
working capital ($1.5 billion). The total figure of $7.9 billion represented an increase of more than '50 percent over the corresponding
figure for fiscal 1965. The balance was to be used for retirement of
securities and for other purposes including purchase of securities and
repayment of bank loans. Appendix Table 2, Part 4 contains a classification of uses of proceeds by principal industry groups.
Registration of issues to be offered over an extended period amounted
to $16.5 billion compared with $9.0 billion in 1965, the largest amount
in any previous fiscal year. These issues are classified below:

FILED

During the 1966 fiscal year, 1,697 registration statements were filed
for offerings of securities aggregating $31.1 billion, as compared with
1,376 registration statements filed during the 1965 fiscal year for
offerings amounting to $19.1 billion. This represents an increase of
23.2 percent in the number of statements filed and 62.5 percent in the
dollar amount involved.
Of the 1,697 registration statements filed in the 1966 fiscal year,
422, or 25 percent, were filed by companies that had not previously
filed registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933. Comparable figures for the 1965 and 1964 fiscal years were 458, or 33 percent, and 322, or 27 percent, respectively.
From the effective date of the Securities Act through June 30, 1966,
a cumulative total of 27, 119 registration statements has been filed by
12,065 different issuers covering proposed offerings of securit.ies aggregating over $308 billion.

STOP ORDER PROCEEDINGS

Section 8 (d) of the Act provides that, if it appears to the Commission at any time that a registration statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the Commission may institute proceedings to determine
whether a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration
statement should be issued. Where such an order is issued, the offering
cannot lawfully be made, or continued if it has already begun, until
the registration statement has been amended to cure the deficiencies
and the Commission has lifted the stop order.
At the beginning of the 1966 fiscal year, one stop order proceeding
was pending. Four additional proceedings were instituted during the
year, two were terminated (one through issuance of a stop order," and
one through withdrawal of the registration statement pursuant to an
offer of settlement 4), and three were pending at the end of the year.
The Wolf Corporation 5-The registration statement of a cash flow
real estate company was found materially false and misleading because
it substantially overstated registrant's cash flow, net income and assets,
and failed to disclose adequately registrant's relationship with affiliated persons. The Commission's opinion pointed out that the registrant's ability to maintain cash disbursements at the existing level was
of paramount importance to prospective purchasers of its securities,
and therefore a clear, uncomplicated statement of the basic facts re• Great Southwest Drilling Programs, Inc., Securities Act Release No. 4834

lating to this issue was essential. Instead, registrant's presentation of
its cash distribution policy and practices was highly deceptive. Registrant not only included in the term "cash available for distribution"
amounts which represented anticipated income rather than cash, but
included in such anticipated income substantial amounts of rent
arrearages without disclosing any of the facts indicating that such
arrearages were uncollectible. In view of registrant's affirmative representation that it believed such amounts would be paid in the :future,
the Commission found that a sophisticated investor-and
certainly an
unsophisticated one---could reasonably believe that the qualifying
statement that "there is no assurance" that the rent arrearages would
be paid was attributable to an excess of caution in the interest of :full
disclosure, and conclude that the uncollected (and uncollectible) rents
were for all practical purposes equivalent to cash in hand. In fact,
registrant had distributed to stockholders a sum which was more than
twice as much as the cash actually derived from operations; the remainder apparently had come from :funds borrowed for the purpose of
making cash distributions to stockholders and thus maintaining a false
appearance of a high level of cash available from operations.
A.lthough the deficiencies were considered serious and extensive,
the Commission did not issue a stop order but permitted the withdrawal of the registration statement pursuant to an offer of settlement. Registrant's offer provided that a stipulation correcting the
principal deficiencies of the registration statement be included in the
public record of the proceeding and that a written communication advising of the stop order proceeding be distributed to its stockholders
and other persons to whom copies of the preliminary prospectus had
been sent. In the Commission's view, this communication, which was
to be reviewed by the Commission's staff prior to release, was sufficient
to give adequate public notice of the dismal record of the abortive
financial program and the deceptive disclosures in the prospectus.
The factors that led to this conclusion were: (1) the registration statement had never become effective; (2) none of the securities had been
sold; (3) the proposed financing had been abandoned; and (4) the
stipulation correcting the deficiencies was to become part of the publie record.
EXAMINATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission is authorized by Section 8 (e) of the A.ct to make
an examination in order to determine whether a stop order proceeding
should be instituted under Section 8(d), and in connection therewith
is empowered to examine witnesses and require the production of pertinent documents. The Commission is also authorized by Section 20(a)
of the Act to make an investigation to determine whether any provi-

sion of the Act or any rule or regulation prescribed thereunder has
been or is about to be violated. In appropriate cases, investigations
are instituted under this Section as an expeditious means of determining whether a registration statement is false or misleading or
omits to state any material fad. The following tabulation indicates
the number of such examinations and investigations with which the
Commission was concerned during the year:

EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION OF SMAIL ISSUES

The Commission is authorized under Section 3 (b) of the Securities
Act to exempt, by its rules and regulations and subject to such terms
and conditions as it may prescribe therein, any class of securities from
registration under the Act, if it finds that enforcement of the
registration provisions of the Act with respect to such securities is
not necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors
because of the small amount involved or the limited character of the
public offering. Only offerings not exceeding $300,000 may thus be
exempted.
Acting under this authority, the Commission has adopted the following exemptive rules and regulations:
Rule 234: Exemption of first lien notes.
Rule 235 : Exemption of securities of cooperative bousing corporations.
Rule 236 : Exemption of shares offered in connection with certain transactions.
Regulation A: General exemption for United States and Canadian issues up to
$300,000.
Regulation B: Exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights
up to $100,000.
Regulation F: Exemption for assessments on assessable stock and for assessable
stock offered or sold to realize the amount of assessment thereon.

Under Section 3 (c) of the Securities Act, which was added by Section 307(a) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958,the Commission is authorized to adopt rules and regulations exempting securities
issued by a company which is operating or proposes to operate as a
small business investment company under the Small Business Investment Act. Acting pursuant to this authority, the Commission adopted
Regulation E which exempts, subject to terms and conditions substantially similar to those contained in Regulation A, securities offerings not exceeding $300,000 by any small business investment company which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

ANNUAL REPORT

Exemption from registration under Section 3 (b) or 3 (c) of the Act
does not carry with it any exemption from the provisions of the Act
prohibiting fraudulent conduct in the offer or sale of securities and
imposing civil liability or criminal responsibility for such conduct.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A

Regulation A permits a company to obtain needed capital not in excess of $300,000 (including underwriting commissions) in anyone year
from a public offering of its securities without registration, provided
specified conditions are met. These include the filing of a notification
supplying basic information about the company with the Regional
Office of the Commission in the region in which the company has its
principal place of business, and the filing and use in the offering of an
offering circular. However, an offering circular need not be filed or
used in connection with an offering not in excess of $50,000 by a company with earnings in one of the last 2 years.
During the 1966 fiscal year, 410 notifications were filed under Regulation A, covering proposed offerings of $'75,218,434, compared with
39'7notifications covering proposed offerings of $'7'7,36'7,235in the 1965
fiscal year. Included in the 1966 total were 9 notifications covering
stock offerings of $2,242,800 by companies engaged in the exploratory
oil and gas business, 12 notifications with respect to offerings of
$2,190,224 by mining companies and 23 notifications covering offerings of $5,823,23'7 by companies featuring new inventions, products or
processes.

shall be made upon completion or termination of the offering.
During the fiscal year 1966, 864 Reports of Sales were filed reporting
aggregate sales of $48,632,121.
Suspension

or

Exemption

Regulation A provides for the suspension of an exemption thereunder where, in general, the exemption is sought for securities for
which the regulation provides no exemption or where the offering
is not made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the regulation or with prescribed disclosure standards.
Following the issuance
of a temporary suspension order by the Commission, the respondent
may request a hearing to determine whether the temporary suspension
If no hearing is requested
should be vacated or made permanent.
within 30 days after the entry of the temporary suspension order and
none is ordered by the Commission on its own motion, the temporary
suspension order becomes permanent.
During the 1966 fiscal year, temporary suspension orders were issued
in 6 cases, which, added to the 7 cases pending at the beginning of the
fiscal year, resulted in a total of 13 cases for disposition.
In 11 of
these cases, the temporary suspension became permanent during the
fiscal year: in 5 cases after hearing, in 5 by withdrawal of the request
for hearing, and in 1 by lapse of time. Thus, there were 2 cases pending at the end of the fiscal year.
A decision of particular interest rendered by the Commission during
the year in a Regulation A suspension proceeding was Del Oonsolidated Industries, hw.6 In that case the Commission found that the
offering circular filed by the issuer, which had been organized to engage in oil, gas and mining operations, contained materially misleading statements.
The introductory statement of the circular represented that the
issuer had an option to acquire certain properties, including "working
interests in four proven oil leases" in New Mexico, "consisting of four
wells which produced approximately 15,000 barrels of oil in 1961,"
and that the properties were more fully described in the section "Business and Property."
The introductory statement did not disclose
that the options covered substantially less than the entire working interests in the leases. That fact was disclosed only in the "Business
and Property" section, six pages later in the circular, following statistics regarding the production applicable to the entire working
interests.

Act Release NQ. 4795 (July 26,1965).

THIRTY-SECOND

ANNUAL

33

REPORT

The Commission found that the misleading implication in the introductory statement that the option covered the entire working interests was not cured by the subsequent description. The Commission
pointed out that even though an offering circular contains all of the
essential facts, it still may not satisfy the disclosure requirements if
the facts are not presented so clearly that they will be plainly evident
to the ordinary investor. The Commission stated that the burden
should not be placed on the investor to examine the offering circular
for qualifying language to counteract the misleading nature of a statement in the introductory material which does its damage in its initial
effect on the prospective investor.
The issuer requested that the temporary suspension order be vacated,
asserting that it had abandoned plans for the proposed offering and
that it had not been guilty of bad faith. However, the Commission,
affirming the recommendation of the hearing examiner, concluded
that the suspension should be made permanent, since it was satisfied
that the issuer did not make "a diligent and careful effort" to make
an accurate and adequate filing.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1966, 235 offering sheets and
302 amendments thereto were filed pursuant to Regulation B and were
examined by the Oil and Gas Section of the Commission's Division
of Corporation Finance. During the 1965 and 1964 fiscal years, 173
and 242 offering sheets, respectively, were filed. The following table

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation E

Regulation E provides a conditional exemption from registration
under the Securities Act for securities of small business investment
companies which are licensed under the Small Business Investment
Act of 1958 or which have received the preliminary approval of the
Small Business Administration and have been notified by the Administration that they may submit an application for such a license. As
has been noted, the terms and conditions of the exemption are substantially similiar to those provided by Regulation A. One notification was filed under Regulation E during the 1966 fiscal year for an
offering of securities aggregating $100,000, which was pending at the
end of the year.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation F

Regulation F provides an exemption for assessments levied upon
assessable stock and for delinquent assessment sales in amounts not
exceeding $300,000 in anyone year. It requires the filing of a simple
notification giving brief information with respect to the issuer, its
management, principal security holders, recent and proposed assessments and other security issues. The regulation requires a company
to send to its stockholders, or otherwise publish, a statement of the
purposes for which the proceeds of the assessment are proposed to be
used. Copies of any other sales literature used in connection with the
assessment must be filed. Like Regulation A, Regulation F provides
for the suspension of an exemption thereunder where the regulation
provides no exemption or where the offering is not made in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the regulation or in accordance with
prescribed disclosure standards.
During the 1966 fiscal year, 21 notifications were filed under Regulation F, covering assessments of $486,231. These notifications were
filed in three of the nine regional offices of the Commission: Denver,
San Francisco and Seattle. Underwriters were not employed in any
of the Regulation F assessments. No Regulation F exemptions were
suspended during the fiscal year.

REPORT

REVISION OF RULES, REGULATIONS AND FORMS
Amendments to Rule 416

During the fiscal year, the Commission published for comment a
proposal to amend Rule 416 relating to the coverage by a registration
statement of certain securities issued to prevent dilution as a result of
stock splits and stock dividends." After consideration of the comments received, the Commission adopted the proposed amendments
with certain changes." The former Rule 416 has been designated
Rule 416(a), and concerns the coverage of securities offered or issued
pursuant to anti-dilution provisions to holders of warrants, options,
convertible securities, or similar rights to purchase securities, upon
exercise of their rights. Rule 416(b) broadens the scope of the former
rule by extending the coverage of a registration statement to additional securities issued pursuant to a split of a class of securities which
includes undistributed securities covered by the statement or pursuant
to a dividend declared on and payable in securities of such class, where
there are no applicable anti-dilution provisions. The rule also provides that when all the securities of a class which includes undistributed registered securities are combined by a reverse split into a
lesser number of shares, the amount of undistributed securities of such
class covered by the registration statement shall be proportionately
reduced.
Amendment of Rules and Forms Relating to Registration Fees

Part III of this Report discusses the statutory increase in the fees
payable for the registration of securities. During the fiscal year the
Commission amended Rules 45'7 and 458 and Forms D-1, D-1A and
s-6, all of which refer to the required filing fee, to conform to the
statutory changes," At the same time the Commission adopted additional amendments to Rule 45'7to clarify the rule and to incorporate
certain recurring administrative interpretations concerning the computation of filing fees. The rule sets forth the method of calculating
fees in various situations in which the maximum aggregate offering
price is based on fluctuating factors, such as market price or underlying asset values, or is otherwise uncertain at the time of filing.
In order to incorporate all provisions relating to the calculation of
filing fees into one rule, the calculation provisions contained in Forms
8-8 and 8-12 were transferred to Rule 45'7,calculation provisions in
Forms D-1, D-1A and 8-6 which were duplicated in Rule 45'7 were

comments received, withdrew proposed amendments of Rule 485.10
That rule prescribes the procedure for obtaining confidential treatment of material contracts.

The Commission adopted a new Form 8-13 for the registration of

of securities exchanges, the registration of securities listed on such
exchanges and, under new Section 12 (g) , the registration of securities
traded over the counter where the issuers of such securities have total
assets in excess of $1 million and the securities constitute a class of
equity securities held of record by at least 500 persons (until July 1,
1966, the minimum number was 750). It establishes, for issuers of
securities registered under the Act, financial and other reporting
requirements and regulation of proxy solicitations and, for directors,
officers and principal security holders of such issuers, reporting requirements and restrictions on trading in the securities of their companies. The Act also provides for the registration and regulation of
national securities associations and of brokers and dealers doing business in the over-the-counter markets, contains provisions designed to
prevent fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative acts and practices on
the exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets and authorizes the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to regulate the use
of credit in securities transactions.
The principal purpose of the various statutory provisions is to ensure the maintenance of fair and
honest markets in securities transactions on the organized exchanges
and in the over-the-counter markets.

Review or Exchange Rules and Procedures

Rule 17a-8 of the Exchange Act provides that each national securities exchange must file with the Commission three copies of any
proposed change in its rules not less than 3 weeks (or such shorter
period as the Commission may authorize) before final action is taken
by the exchange. These proposals are submitted for review to the
Commission's Division of Trading and Markets. That Division also
reviews, on a continuing basis, the existing rules, regulations, procedures, forms and practices of the national securities exchanges. The
purposes of this review are to permit the Division to (a) ascertain the
effectiveness of the application and enforcement by the exchanges of
their own rules; (b) determine the adequacy of the rules of the exchanges, and of related statutory provisions and rules administered
by the Commission, in light of changing market conditions, and (c)
anticipate and define problem areas so that preventive or remedial steps
can be taken. Most significant aspects or the rules and procedures of
the national securities exchanges are subject to review by the staff in
the course of a year.
When problems occur, conferences are held to permit the exchange
and the Division to reach satisfactory solutions. These conferences
sometimes lead to studies or current rules and practices, or proposed
exchange's performance, the staff communicated its views to the particular exchange and discussions were held between the staff of the
Commission and the exchange to arrive at appropriate solutions.
Commission Inspections or the Exchanges

Pursuant to the regulatory scheme of the Act, the Commission
actively oversees the performance by the national securities exchanges
of their self-regulatory activities. As part of this program, the Office
or Regulation in the Division of Trading and Markets conducts regular
inspections of various phases of exchange activity. During the past
year, it conducted two such inspections of the New York Stock Exchange and three inspections of the American Stock Exchange.
These
inspections covered such areas as specialist and registered trader surveillance, exchange procedures for investigation and inquiry into
unusual market situations, and exchange inspections of member firms'
office procedures.
In addition, the Office of Regulation carried out
general inspections of the Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington,
Boston and Pittsburgh Stock Exchanges. The inspection program enables

THIRTY-SECOND

ANNUAL REPORT

39

the Commission to insure that the exchanges are complying with their
self-regulatory responsibilities and to recommend improvements and
refinements designed to increase the effectiveness of self-regulation.
Where it appeared to the Commission's staff that revisions in internal procedures or policies were desirable in order to improve an
exchange's performance, the staff communicated its views to the particular exchange and discussions were held between the staff of the
Commission and the exchange to arrive at appropriate solutions.
Proceedings Against San Francisco Mining Exchange

During the fiscal year, the Commission issued a decision pursuant
to Section 19(a) (1) of the Exchange Act in which it held that it was
necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to withdraw
the registration of the San Francisco Mining Exchange as a national
securities exchange,"
The Commission found that over a period of years the Exchange
had repeatedly neglected to enforce compliance by its mem:bers and
by issuers of securities listed thereon with the reporting, insider trading and anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act and had lent its
facilities to securities distributions made in violation of the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission
also found that officials of the Exchange had been personally involved
in repeated violations of the securities acts. In rejecting the Exchange's request that it be given an opportunity to rehabilitate itself,
the Commission pointed out that the Exchange had failed to avail
itself of prior opportunities to take corrective measures, that it did
not perform any signficant function as a trading market, and that an
effective rehabilitation would in effect require the organization of an
entirely new exchange. On June 20, 1966, the Exchange filed a petition for review of the Commission's order with the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit. The Court has issued a stay of the Commission's order pending final determination
of the Exchange's
petition.
Exchange Disciplinary Action

Each national securities exchange reports to the Commission disciplinary actions taken against its members, member firms, and their
associated persons for violation of any rule of the exchange or of the
Securities Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder. During the fiscal year, eight exchanges reported 133 such actions, including
impositions of fines in 44 cases ranging from $25 to $10,000, with total
fines aggregating $68,575, and the suspension from membership of 14
1

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

individuals and 9 member organizations.
These exchanges also reported the imposition of various sanctions against 65 registered representatives and employees of member firms. In addition, a number of
informal staff actions of a cautionary nature were reported by several
exchanges.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES

Unless a security is registered on a national securities exchange under the Securities Exchange Act or is exempt from such registration it
is unlawful for a member of such exchange or any broker or dealer to
effect any transaction in the security on the exchange. In general, the
.Act exempts from registration obligations issued or guaranteed by a
state or the Federal Government or by certain subdivisions or agencies
thereof and authorizes the Commission to adopt rules and regulations
exempting such other securities as the Commission may find necessary
or appropriate to exempt in the public interest or for the protection of
investors. Under this authority the Commission has exempted securities of certain banks, certain securities secured by property or
leasehold interests, certain warrants and, on a temporary basis, certain
securities issued in substitution for or in addition to listed securities.
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange .Act, an issuer may register
a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission and
the exchange an application which discloses pertinent information
concerning the issuer and its affairs. Information must be furnished
regarding the issuer's business, its capital structure, the terms of its
securities, the persons who manage or control its affairs, the remuneration paid to its officers and directors, and the allotment of options,
bonuses and profit-sharing plans, and financial statements certified by
independent accountants must be filed as part of the application.
Form 10 is the form used for registration by most commercial and
industrial companies. There are specialized forms for certain types
of securities, such as voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit
and securities of foreign governments.
STATISTICS RELATING TO SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES
Number of Tssuers and Securities

As of June 30, 1966, a total of 2,578 issuers had 4,220 classes of securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges, of which
2,958 were classified as stocks and 1,262 as bonds. Of these totals
1,445 issuers had 1,648 stock issues and 1,161 bond issues listed and
registered on the New York Stock Exchange.
Thus, 56.1 percent of
the issuers, 55.7 percent of the stock issues and 92 percent of the bond
issues were on the New York Stock Exchange.
Table 4 in the appendix to this report contains comprehensive statistics as to the number of

securities issues admitted to exchange trading and the number of
issuers involved, as of June 30, 1966.
During the 1966 fiscal year, 161 issuers listed and registered securities on a national securities exchange for the first time, while the registration of all securities of 105 issuers was terminated. A total of 326
applications for registration of securities on exchanges was filed during
the year.
Market Value of Securities Available for Trading

The market value on December 31, 1965, of stocks and bonds, both
listed and unlisted, admitted to trading on one or more stock exchanges
in the United States was approximately $707 billion.
There is no duplication of issues between the N ew York and American Stock Exchanges.
The figures for all other exchanges are for the
net number of issues appearing only on such exchanges, excluding the
many issues on them which were also traded on one or the other of the
New York exchanges. The number and market value of issues as
shown below exclude those suspended from trading and a few others
for which quotations were not available.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The New York Stock Exchange has reported aggregate market
values of all stocks listed thereon monthly since December 31, 1924,
when the figure was $27.1 billion. The American Stock Exchange has
reported totals as of December 31 annually since 1936. Aggregates
for stocks exclusively on the remaining exchanges have been compiled
as of December 31 annually by the Commission since 1948. The
available data since 1936 appear in Table 5 in the appendix of this
Annual Report. It should be noted that changes in aggregate market
values over the years reflect not only changes in prices of stocks but
also such factors as new listings, mergers into listed companies,
removals from listing and issuance of additional shares of a listed
security.

PRIVILEGES

ON EXCHANGES

Stocks with unlisted trading privileges which are not also listed
and registered on other exchanges continued to decline in number,
from 132 on June 30, 1965, to 114 on June 30, 1966. The American
Stock Exchange accounted for the entire decline except for 1 issue
removed from the Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington
Stock Exchange. During the calendar year 1965, the reported volume of
trading on the exchanges in stocks with only unlisted trading
privileges similarly declined to about 23,775,000 shares, or about
.92 percent of the total share volume on all exchanges, from about
24,521,000 shares and about 1.2 percent of share volume during
calendar year 1964.
About 97 percent of the 1965 volume was on the American Stock
Exchange while four other exchanges contributed the remaining
3 percent. The share volume in these stocks on the American Stock
Exchange represented 4 percent of the total share volume on that
exchange.
Unlisted trading privileges on exchanges in stocks listed and
registered on other exchanges numbered 1,735 as of June 30, 1966.
The volume of trading in these stocks for the calendar year 1965
was reported at about 87,761,000shares. About 17.4 percent of this
volume was on the American Stock Exchange in stocks listed on
regional exchanges and 82.6 percent was on regional exchanges in
stocks listed on the New York or American Stock Exchange. While
the 87,761,000shares amounted to only 3.4 percent of the total share
volume on all exchanges, they constituted substantial portions of the
share volume of most regional exchanges, as reflected in the following
approximate percentages: Cincinnati, 84 percent; Boston, 78 percent;

BWCK DISTRIBUTIONS REPORTED BY EXCHANGES

The usual method of distributing blocks of listed securities
considered too large for the auction market on the floor of an exchange
is to resort to "secondary distributions" over the counter after the
close of exchange trading. Secondary distributions, as reported since
1942, reached a new high of $1,603,107,000during the calendar year
1965, surpassing the previous peak of $926,514,000 in 1961. During
the first 6 months of 1966, there were 72 secondary distributions
aggregating $1,126,091,000. Unusually large secondary distributions
have caused these record high figures. Secondary distributions of
the common stocks of Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.
accounted for 38 percent of the 1965 total value, and a distribution of
Trans W orId Airlines common stock comprised more than half the
total for the .first 6 months of 1966.

Special Offering Plans were adopted by many of the exchanges in
1942, and Exchange Distribution Plans in 1953, in an effort to keep
as much trading as possible on their floors. Since 1962 there have
been no special offerings. Exchange distributions increased to reach
a record of 72 in 1963 but have since declined. In 1965 there were
57 with a value of $86,479,000.
OVER.THE.COUNTER TRADING IN COMMON STOCKS TRADED ON
NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGES

Pursuant to the recommendations of the Special Study of Securities
Markets, the Commission in December 1964 adopted Rule 17a-9 providing a system for the identification of broker-dealers making offboard markets in common stocks traded on national securities exchanges and for the reporting of summaries of over-the-counter
trading in common stocks traded on national securities exchanges
(sometimes referred to as the "third market") .
In accordance with this rule, since January 1965 brokers and dealers
who make markets in common stocks traded on national securities exchanges have been reporting their trading over the counter and on
exchanges in the common stocks in which they make markets. They
also report certain off-board trading in other common stocks traded on
exchanges. Broker-dealers who are not market makers report certain
large third market transactions.
The reporting system is designed to
reflect all sales to persons other than broker-dealers, i.e., to individuals
and institutions.
During the calendar year 1965, total third market sales of common
stock amounted to 50,362,000 shares valued at $2,563,000,000. This
latter figure was the equivalent of 2.9 percent of the value of shares of
common and preferred stocks traded on all national securities exchanges. Almost 98 percent of the third market dollar volume was in
common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Over-thecounter sales of these stocks during 1965 amounted to the equivalent of
3.4 percent of the New York Stock EXChange's value of trading in
common and preferred issues.
In the first half of 1966, third market volume was larger than in the
corresponding period of 1965 but did not keep pace with the sharply
increased volume on exchanges. In this period, third market sales of
common stocks amounted to 31,009,000 shares valued at $1,596,000,000,
or 2.3 percent of the dollar volume on all national securities exchanges.

In order to enable the
238-643-67-5

48

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

Commission to meet its responsibilities for the surveillance of the
securities markets, the market surveillance staff has devised a number
of procedures to identify possible manipulative activities. A program
has been adopted with respect to surveillance over listed securities,
in which the staff's activities are closely coordinated with the stock
watching operations of the New York and American Stock Exchanges.
Within this framework, the staff reviews the daily and periodic stock
watch reports prepared by these exchanges and on the basis of its
analysis of the information developed by the exchanges and other
sources, determines matters of interest, possible violations of applicable law, and the appropriate action to be taken.
In addition, the market surveillance staff maintains a continuous
ticker tape watch of transactions on the New York and American
Stock Exchanges and the sales and quotations sheets of regional exchanges to observe any unusual or unexplained price variations or
market activity. The financial news ticker, leading newspapers and
various financial publications and statistical services are also closely
followed. Matters raised by private investors in letters to the Commission may also be used in determining whether possible violations
have occurred.
If any of these sources reveal possible violations, the market surveillance staff conducts a preliminary inquiry into the matter. These
inquiries, some of which are conducted with the cooperation of the
exchange concerned, generally begin with the identification of the
brokerage firms which were active in the security. Contact may be
made with partners, officers or registered representatives of the firms,
with customers, or with offlcials of the company in question to determine the reasons for the activity or price change in the securities
involved and whether violations may have occurred.
The Commission, recognizing the utility of electronic data-processing equipment, has developed an automated over-the-counter surveillance program to provide more efficient and comprehensive
surveillance.
The automated equipment is programmed to identify,
among other things, unlisted securities whose price movement or
dealer interest varies beyond specified limits in a pre-established time
period. When a security is so identified, the automated system prints
out current and historic market information concerning it. This data,
combined with other available information, is collated and analyzed to
select those securities whose activity indicates the need for further
inquiry or referral to the Commission's enforcement staff.
Stabilization

Stabilization involves open-market purchases of securities to prevent or retard a decline in the market price in order to facilitate a

THIRTY-SECOND

ANNUAL

REPORT

49

distribution.
It is permitted by the Exchange Act subject to the
restrictions provided by the Commission's Rules 10b-6, 7, and 8. These
rules are designed to confine stabilizing activity to that necessary for
the above purpose, to require proper disclosure and to prevent unlawful manipulation.
During fiscal year 1966, stabilizing was effected in connection with
stock offerings totaling 57,793,000 shares having an aggregate public
offering price of $2,158,883,000 and bond offerings having a total
offering price of $247,974,000. In these offerings, stabilizing transactions resulted in the purchase of 1,992,000 shares at a cost of $85,974,000 and bonds at a cost of $2,078,000. In connection with these
stabilizing transactions, 9,761 stabilizing reports, showing purchases
and sales of securities effected by persons conducting the distribution,
were received and examined during the fiscal year.
REGISTRATION OF OVER-THE-COUNTER SECURITIES

As previously noted, Section 12 (g) of the Exchange Act requires the
registration of securities traded over the counter, when certain standards as to assets of the issuer and number of shareholders are met. The
same forms used for the registration of securities on an exchange are
used for the registration of over-the-counter securities. Part II of
this report includes statistics regarding the number of registration
statements filed during the fiscal year pursuant to Section 12(g) and
related matters.
PERIODIC REPORTS

Section 13 of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 to file periodic reports keeping current
the information contained in the application for registration or registration statement. These periodic reports include annual, semi-annual,
and current reports. The principal annual report form is Form lQ-K,
which is designed to give current information regarding the matters
covered in the original filing. Semi-annual reports required to be filed
on Form 9-K are devoted chiefly to furnishing mid-year financial
data. Current reports on Form 8-K are required to be filed for each
month in which any of certain specified events of immediate interest to
investors have occurred. A report on this form deals with matters
such as changes in control of the registrant, important acquisitions
or dispositions of assets, the institution or termination of important
legal proceedings and important changes in the issuer's capital securities or in the amount thereof outstanding.
Section 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, generally speaking, requires issuers who have filed
registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933 that have
become effective to file the same reports as the issuers described above.

REGULATION OF PROXIES
Scope of Proxy Regulation

Regulation 14A, adopted pursuant to Sections 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 12 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, and 20 (a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
requires the disclosure in a proxy statement of pertinent information in connection with the solicitation of proxies, consents and
authorizations in respect of securities subject to those provisions, in
order to enable holders of such securities to act intelligently on the
matters involved. The regulation also provides, among other things,
that when the management is soliciting proxies, any security holder
desiring to communicate with other security holders for a proper
purpose may require the management to furnish him with a list of
all security holders or to mail his communication to security holders
for him. A security holder may also, subject to reasonable prescribed
limitations, require the management to include in its proxy material
any appropriate proposal which such security holder desires to submit
to a vote of security holders. Any security holder or group of security
holders may at any time make an independent proxy solicitation upon
compliance with the proxy rules, whether or not the management is

THIRTY-SECOND

ANNUAL

REPORT

51

making a solicitation.
Certain additional provisions of the regulation
are applicable where a contest for control of the management of an
issuer or representation on the board is involved.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminary form prior to the date of the proposed solicitation.
Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed disclosure
standards, the management or other group responsible for its preparation is notified informally and given an opportunity to correct the
deficiencies in the preparation of the definitive proxy material to be
furnished to security holders.
The Securities Acts Amendments of 1964 extended the proxy solicitation requirements to those over-the-counter securities which are
registered under Section 12(g) of the Act. In addition, new Section
14(c) of the Act provides that issuers of securities registered under
Section 12 shall, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed
by the Commission, transmit information comparable to proxy material to security holders from whom proxies are not solicited. During
the fiscal year the Commission adopted Regulation 14C implementing
this statutory provision. a
Statistics Relating to Proxy and Stockholder Information Statements

During the 1966 fiscal year, 4,109 proxy statements in definitive
form were filed under the Commission's Regulation 14A for the solicitation of proxies of security holders; 4,084 of these were filed by management and 25 by non-management groups or individual stockholders. These 4,109 solicitations related to 3,773 companies, some
336 of which had 2 solicitations during the year, the second generally
for a special meeting not involving the election of directors.
There were 3,632 solicitations of proxies for the election of directors,
446 for special meetings not involving the election of directors, and 31
for assents and authorizations.
During fiscal year 1966, the votes of security holders were solicited
with respect to the following types of matters, other than the election

of directors:
Mergers, consolidations, acquisitions of businesses, purchases and sales
of property, and dissolutions of companies________________________

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

During fiscal year 1966, 53 information statements under new Regulation 14C were filed by 52 companies, 1 company filing 2 such
statements. The 53 statements related to 48 annual meetings and 5
special meetings.
Stockholders' Proposals

During the 1966 fiscal year, 156 proposals submitted by 35 stockholders were included in the proxy statements of 103 companies under
Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14A.
Typical of such stockholder proposals submitted to a vote of security holders were resolutions relating to amendments of charters or bylaws to provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors,
limitations on the grant of stock options to, and their exercise by,
key employees and management groups, the sending of a post-meeting
report to all stockholders, and a change of the place of the annual
stockholders' meeting.
A total of 58 additional proposals submitted by 39 stockholders
was omitted from the proxy statements of 30 companies in accordance
with Rule 14a-8. The principal reasons for such omissions and the
number of times each such reason was involved (counting only one
reason for omission for each proposal even though it may have been
omitted under more than one provision of Rule 14a-8) were as follows:

in 24 cases involved contests for control of the board of directors and
those in 13 cases involved contests for representation on the board.
Management retained control in 10 of the 24 contests for control of
the board of directors, 2 were settled by negotiation, non-management
persons won 6 and 6 were pending as of June 30, 1966. Of the 13
cases where representation on the board of directors was involved,
management retained all places on the board in 6 contests, opposition
candidates won places on the board in 6 cases and 1 was settled by
negotiation.
INSIDERS' SECURITY HOLDINGS AND TRANSACTIONS

Corporate insiders, by virtue of their position, may have knowledge
of a company's condition and prospects which is unavailable to the
general public and may be able to use such information to their personal advantage in trading in the company's securities. Section 16 of
the Securities Exchange Act and corresponding provisions in Sections
17 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and Section
30(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 are designed to provide
other stockholders and investors with information as to insiders'
security transactions and holdings, and to prevent the unfair use of
confidential information by insiders to profit from short-term trading
in a company's securities.
Ownership

Reports

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended, requires
every person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, more than
10 percent of any class of equity security which is registered under
Section 12 (b) for exchange listing or under Section 12 (g) for over-thecounter trading, or who is a director or an officer of the issuer of any
such security, to file statements with the Commission disclosing his
ownership of the issuer's equity securities and changes in ownership.
Copies of such statements must also be filed with exchanges on which
securities are listed. Similar provisions applicable to insiders of
registered public-utility holding companies and registered closedend investment companies are contained in Section 17 (a) of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act and Section 30 (f) of the Investment
Company Act. The administration of the insider reporting provisions
of the three Acts is combined in one section in the Division of Corporation Finance.
During the fiscal year, 96,232 ownership reports (23,989 initial statements of ownership on Form 3 and 72,243 statements of changes in
ownership on Form 4) were filed with the Commission. This repre-

54

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

sents an increase of 51,601 over the 44,631 reports filed during the 1964
fiscal year and an increase of 39,678 over the 56,554 reports filed during
the 1965 fiscal year. The bulk of the increase is attributable to the
extension of the reporting requirements to insiders of issuers of overthe-counter securities registered under Section 12 (g) .
All ownership reports are made available for public inspection as
soon as they are filed at the Commission's office in Washington and
at the exchanges where copies are filed. In addition, the information contained in reports filed with the Commission is summarized
and published in the monthly "Official Summary of Security Transactions and Holdings," which is distributed by the Government Printing Officeon a subscription basis to more than 25,000persons.
Recovery of Short-Swing Trading Profits by Issuer

In order to prevent insiders from making unfair use of information which they may have obtained by reason of their relationship
with a company, Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, Section 17(b)
of the Holding Company Act, and Section 30 (f) of the Investment
Company Act provide for the recovery by or on behalf of the issuer
of any profit realized by insiders (in the categories listed above) from
certain purchases and sales, or sales and purchases, of securities of
the company within any period of less than 6 months. The Commission has certain exemptive powers with respect to transactions not
comprehended within the purpose of these provisions, but is not
charged with the enforcement of the civil remedies created by them.
INVESTIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO REPORTING PROVISIONS

Section 21 (a) of the Act authorizes the Commission to make such
investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether any person
has violated or is about to violate any provision of the Act or any rule
or regulation thereunder. The Commission is authorized, for this
purpose, to administer oaths, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence and require the production of records. In
addition to the investigations undertaken in enforcing the anti-fraud,
broker-dealer registration, and other regulatory provisions of the Act,
which are discussed in Part XI of this report under ''Complaints and
Investigations," the following investigations were undertaken in
connection with the enforcement of the reporting provisions of Sections 12, 13, 14 and 15(d) of the Act and the rules thereunder, particularly those provisions relating to the filing of annual and other
periodic reports and proxy material:

Proceedings

The scope of the administrative sanctions which the Commission
may impose against brokers and dealers and persons associated with
a broker or dealer, pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 15.A of the Exchange .Act, was enlarged in significant respects by the Securities .Acts
.Amendments of 1964. Thus, in addition to the previously available
sanctions against a broker-dealer of denial or revocation of registration and expulsion or suspension from a registered securities association or national securities exchange, the Commission may now
suspend a broker-dealer's registration for a period not to exceed 12
months and may impose censure. Under prior law the Commission

56

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

could not proceed directly against individuals associated with a
broker-dealer :firm, although incidental to a proceeding against the
firm it could make findings with respect to such individuals which had
the effect of disqualifying them from employment in the securities
mdustry. The Act, as amended, permits direct action against
associated persons, with or without joining the firm. The Commission
may censure an associated person, may suspend or bar him from being
associated with a broker or dealer, and may suspend or bar him from
being associated with a member of a registered securities association.
Under Section 15(b), a sanction of revocation, denial or suspension
of registration, or censure may be imposed upon a broker-dealer if,
after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that
such sanction is in the public interest and that the broker-dealer, or
any person associated with such broker-dealer, is subject to one or
more of the specified statutory disqualifications. The Commission
may censure, or bar or suspend from association with a brokerdealer, an associated person where it finds that such action is in the
public interest and that such person has committed or omitted any act
or omission which would be a basis for the imposition of a sanction if
such person were a broker-dealer. The statutory disqualifications,
which have been enlarged by the 1964 amendments, include the
following:
(1) wilfully false or misleading statements in an application for
registration or other report required to be filed under the Exchange
Act;
(2) conviction within the previous 10 years of a felony or misdemeanor which involved the purchase or sale of securities; arose out of
the conduct of business as a broker-dealer or investment adviser; involved embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, or misappropriation of
funds or securities; or involved violation of the provisions of the
United States Code dealing with various frauds and swindles committed by use of the mails, telephone, telegraph, radio or television;
(3) injunction by a court of competent jurisdiction against engaging in certain practices related to the securities business;
(4) wilful violation of any provision of the Securities Act of 1933,
the Exchange Act, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or the Investment Company Act of 1940or any of the Commission's rules or regulations thereunder;
(5) wilfully aiding or abetting another person in a violation of the
Federal securities laws or rules and regulations thereunder or failing
reasonably to supervise other persons who commit such violations; and
(6) employing a person barred or suspended from being associated
with a broker-dealer.
Section 15A of the Exchange Act as amended empowers the Commission to suspend or expel a broker-dealer from membership in a

Deci8iol1ll of Particular Interest

It is not feasible to discuss within the confines of this report each
of the many decisions rendered by the Commission during the 1966
fiscal year in administrative proceedings with respect to broker-dealers
and their personnel. However, a few cases of unusual interest or
significance are summarized in the following paragraphs:
The Commission's decision in Shearson, Hammill & 00.,4 involving
one of the major Wall Street brokerage houses, was of particular
interest to the financial community,
The Commission found that
certain activities which had taken place in three California branch
offices of the firm, primarily in Los Angeles, resulted in violations
of both the registration provisions of the Securities Act and the
anti-fraud provisions of that Act, the Exchange Act, and the Investment Advisers Act. A significant aspect of the case is that the
Commission held responsible not only the firm and certain branch
officepersonnel directly involved in the misconduct, but also the firm's
five principal partners who comprised its executive committee charged
with supervision of the firm's nationwide operations. The Commission found that their failure "diligently to enforce (the firm's) system
of internal controls resulted in the perpetration of fraud upon many
customers," and that these principals bore "a heavy responsibility"
for the violations.
The Commission stated that the willful violations established "were
so grave and extensive as to warrant the imposition of substantial
sanctions." However, the firm had terminated the employment of
most of the branch office personnel involved in the violations and by
the adoption of enlarged internal controls had reduced the risk of any
recurrence of injury to investors of the type found, and the Commission recognized that further sanctions against the firm would affect
many innocent people. In view of these factors, the Commission concluded that it would be inclined to withhold imposition of a sanction
against the firm if the members of the executive committee were dissociated from the firm for an appropriate period. Accordingly, it
withheld issuance of an order to permit the firm to submit a proposal
providing for the separation of those persons from the firm for 60 days
each and for their surrender of any share in firm profits during that
period. A proposal was thereafter submitted, and approved by the

Commission, which provided that during the period of dissociation
the executive committee members would not receive, directly or indirectly, any salary or share of the profits, and that all salaries and
profits attributable to that period would be distributed as a stock
dividend to the stockholders of the firm's successor corporation other
than the executive committee members. A compliance report submitted in August 1966 disclosed that the profits allocable to the period
of dissociation were $573,168, that salaries and consulting fees which
would have been payable but were not paid to the executive committee
members amounted to $24,790, and that the total of these amounts had
been distributed in the form of a stock dividend.
The case of Russell L. I risk 5 involved a broker-dealer specializing in
the retail sale of mutual fund shares. The Commission found that
Irish, contrary to the best interests of his customers and for his own
gain, induced purchases and redemptions of such shares in the accounts
of customers which were excessive in size and frequency in view of
the "non-trading" character of those accounts. Among other things,
he followed a policy of recommending to customers that they redeem
the shares of one fund and use the proceeds to buy those of another
fund, requiring the payment of a new sales commission. Many of
these switches were effected within a relatively short time after shares
in the first fund had been acquired. This policy, the Commission
found, was highly profitable to Irish and detrimental to his customers.
In addition, Irish sold mutual fund shares to customers in amounts
slightly below the "break-point" at which a reduced sales load would
have been available, without adequately disclosing the savings which
could have been obtained through slightly larger investments.
The
Commission concluded that Irish's conduct violated the anti-fraud
provisions of the securities acts and that it was appropriate in the
public interest to revoke his registration.
In Lile & 00., lna.,6 the Commission found, among other things,
that the firm's president and sole stockholder obtained loans from a
customer of the firm, for the purpose of financing the firm, and in
doing so made misrepresentations to the customer. The president represented that the firm's business was good and would be expanded and
failed to disclose the firm's actual precarious financial condition. In
finding that this conduct was fraudulent, the Commission stated that
"The propriety of inducing a customer to make substantial loans for
the purpose of financing an unprofitable broker-dealer would seem to
be particularly questionable in any case where, as here, the brokerdealer had established a relationship of trust and confidence with the

customer. At the least, where such loans are solicited, the anti-fraud
provisions require candid disclosure to the customer of all the material
facts."
A significant aspect of the decision in Olarenoe Earl Thornton 7 was
the holding that a state-licensed broker-dealer, who with knowledge
of Thornton's purchase of securities from a customer at a price far
below the market price loaned the purchase price to Thornton in anticipation of purchasing the securities from him at a discount, had aided
and abetted Thornton's fraudulent conduct. The Commission revoked
Thornton's registration and found the other broker-dealer a cause of
the revocation.
As in the past, a number of cases decided during the year involved
so-called "boiler-rooms." Among these cases were Hamilton Waters
&: 00., bw.8 and M. J. Merritt &: 00., Inc.,9 in both of which the Commission found that the respondents had engaged in the sale of securities by means of high pressure selling techniques including the use of
false and misleading statements concerning the securities being sold
and their issuers. As is typical of "boiler-room" activities, the securities involved were unseasoned and speculative and were generally
sold to persons with whom the respondents were not acquainted and
in disregard of the financial needs and objectives of such persons.
The Commission revoked the broker-dealer registrations of both firms
and found various individuals associated with the firms, who either
participated directly in the misconduct or by virtue of their position
or interest in the firms were responsible for it, to be "causes" of the
revocation.
Suspension of Registration Pending Final Determination

Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to suspend a broker-dealer's registration pending final determination as to whether registration should be revoked. In order to
suspend registration, the Commission must find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that suspension is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest or for the protection of investors. The registration of one broker-dealer was suspended during the past fiscal year
on the basis of such findings.10 The entry of a suspension order is of
course not determinative of the ultimate issue whether registration
should be revoked.

Net Capital Rule

Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act, commonly known as the net
capital rule, was amended during fiscal year 1965 to impose minimum
net capital requirements on brokers and dealers (effective December 1,
1965) and in certain other respects. As before, the rule limits the
amount of indebtedness which may be incurred by a broker-dealer in
relation to its capital, by providing that the "aggregate indebtedness"
of a broker-dealer may not exceed 20 times the amount of its "net
capital" as computed under the rule. During the past fiscal year,
violations of the net capital rule were charged in eight administrative
proceedings instituted against broker-dealers.
Registered broker-dealers who participate in "firm commitment"
underwritings must have sufficient capital to permit the participation
provided by the underwriting contract without impairing the capitaldebt ratio or minimum net capital prescribed by the rule. If a brokerdealer is unable to meet such requirements, he must decrease his "firm
commitment" to the extent necessary to achieve compliance with the
rule. If necessary, he may have to withdraw from the underwriting
or participate on a "best efforts" basis only.
Financial

Statements

Rule 17a-5 under Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act requires registered broker-dealers to file annual reports of financial condition with
the Commission. Such reports must be certified by a certified public
accountant or public accountant who is in fact independent, with certain limited exemptions applicable to situations where certification
does not appear necessary for customer protection. A broker-dealer's
first report must reflect his financial condition as of a date between the
end of the 1st and 5th months after the effective date of registration.
All reports must be filed within 45 days after the date as of which the
report speaks.
Through these reports the Commission and the public may evaluate the financial position and responsibility of broker-dealers.
The
financial report is one means by which the staff of the Commission determines whether the registrant is in compliance with the net capital
rule. Failure to file the required reports may result in the institution
of administrative proceedings.
During the fiscal year 4,134 reports of financial condition were filed
with the Commission, compared to the 1965 total of 4,317.
Broker-Dealer

Inspections

Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act provides for regular and periodic inspections of registered broker-dealers.
During the fiscal year
a total of 1,272 such inspections was conducted. Inspections provide

62

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

one of the most useful means available to the Commission for the protection of investors. Among other things, the staff members conducting the inspection determine a broker-dealer's financial condition,
review his pricing practices, evaluate the safeguards employed in
handling customers' funds and securities, and determine whether
adequate and accurate disclosures are made to customers.
The Commission's inspectors also determine whether brokers and
dealers are maintaining books and records as required by the Exchange
Act and the Commission's rules thereunder and are conforming to the
margin and other requirements of Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Inspectors also look for excessive trading or switching in customers' accounts. They frequently
find evidence of the sale of unregistered securities or of fraudulent
practices such as use of improper sales literature or sales techniques.
When an inspection reveals that a broker-dealer is in violation of applicable statutory provisions or rules, the action taken depends on the
type of violation and its effect on the public. The Commission does
not take formal action as a result of every infraction discovered. However, if the violation appears to be wilful and the public interest is
best served by formal action against the broker-dealer, the Commission promptly institutes appropriate proceedings.

inspection program during the fiscal year:

SUPERVISION OF ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
SECURITIES DEALERS, INC.

Section 15A of the Exchange Act provides for registration with the
Commission of national securities associations and establishes standards and requirements for such associations. The National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) is the only association registered
under the Act. The Act contemplates that such associations will
serve as a medium for self-regulation by over-the-counter brokers and
dealers. Their rules must be designed to protect investors and the
public interest, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and
to meet other statutory requirements. They are to operate under the

THIRTY-SECOND

ANNUAL REPORT

63

general supervision of the Commission, which is authorized to review
disciplinary actions taken by them and to consider all changes in their
rules. Review of the NASD rules, generally speaking, is carried out
in the same manner and for similar purposes as the review of exchange
rules described above."
In adopting legislation permitting the formation and registration
of national securities associations, Congress provided an incentive to
membership by permitting such associations to adopt rules which preclude a member from dealing with a non-member except on the same
terms and conditions as the member affords the investing public. The
NASD has adopted such rules. Accordingly, membership is necessary
to profitable participation in underwritings since members may properly grant price concessions, discounts and similar allowances only
to other members. Loss or denial of membership due to expulsion
or suspension or other ineligibility due to a statutory disqualification,
or the failure to meet standards of qualification established in NASD
rules, may thus constitute a severe economic sanction.
At the close of the fiscal year the NASD had 3,707 members,
reflecting a net decrease of 158 members during the year. This decrease was the net result of 229 admissions to and 387 terminations of
membership.
At the end of the year NASD member firms had 5,025
branch offices, reflecting a net increase of 197 offices during the year.
This increase was the net result of the opening of 768 new offices and
the closing of 571 offices. During the year the registered representative population, which generally includes all partners, officers, traders,
salesmen and other persons employed by or affiliated with member
firms in capacities which involve their doing business directly with the
public, increased by 6,798 to stand at 83,641 as of June 30, 1966. This
increase was the net result of 13,424 initial registrations, 11,418 reregistrations and 18,044 terminations of registrations during the year.
NASD Disciplinlll7'

Actions

The Commission receives from the NASD copies of its decisions in
all disciplinary actions against members and registered representatives.
In general, such actions are based on allegations that the respondents
violated specified provisions of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice.
Where violations are found the NASD may impose one or more sanctions upon a member, including expulsion, suspension, fine, or censure.
If the violator is an individual, his registration as a representative
may be suspended or revoked, he may be suspended or barred from
being associated with all members, and he may be fined and/or censured.
Under Section 15A(bH4) of the Exchange Act and the NASD's bylaws, no broker-dealer may be admitted to or continued in NASD

membership without Commission approval if he has been suspended or
expelled from membership in the NASD or a national securities exchange; he is barred or suspended from association with a broker or
dealer or with all members of the NASD or an exchange; his registration as a broker-dealer has boon denied, suspended, or revoked; he has
been found to be a cause of certain sanctions imposed upon a member by
the Commission, the NASD or an exchange; or he has associated with
him any person subject to one of the above disqualifications.
During the past fiscal year the Association reported to the Commission its final disposition of disciplinary complaint actions against 197
member firms and 167 individuals associated with them. With respect
to 52 members, complaints were dismissed as a result of findings that
the allegations of violations had not been sustained.P
In the remaining cases, violations were found and penalties were imposed on 145
members and 115 registered representatives or other individuals. The
maximum penalty of expulsion from membership was imposed against
14 members, and 6 members were suspended from membership for
periods ranging from 15 days to 3 months. In many of these cases,
substantial fines were also imposed. In another 104 cases, members
were fined amounts ranging from $50 to $7,500. In 21 cases, the only
sanction imposed was censure, although censure was usually a secondary penalty where a more severe penalty was also imposed.
Various penalties were also imposed on registered representatives
found in violation of NASD rules. The registrations of 50 representatives were revoked, and 23 representatives had their registration suspended for periods ranging from 30 days to 18 months," Fines in
various amounts were also imposed against many revoked or suspended
representatives.
In addition, 42 other representatives were censured
and/or fined amounts ranging from $100 to $10,000. Complaints
against 52 representatives were dismissed on findings that no violations
had been established.
12 The majority
of the cases where allegations against members were dismissed
involved misuse of customers' and/or firm securities or funds by a representative
under such circumstances that the member could not have known of or prevented
the impropriety.
The Securities Acts Amendments of 1964 authorized registered securities associations to take disciplinary action directly against individuals associated with members. The NASD has amended its rules to provide for
such action. In the fiscal year there were eight cases in which the sole respondents were individuals associated with members.
11 As has been noted, a person found a cause of the expulsion
or suspension of a
member is disqualified from association with a member. The cause finding is
therefore often used where an individual found to have violated Association rules
should have been but was not registered as a registered representative.
The
numbers used in the text combine unregistered individuals found to have been a
cause of the expulsion or suspension of a member with registered representatives
whose registrations were revoked or suspended, since this is the practical consequence of a cause finding.

Commission Review or NASD Disciplinary

REPORT

65

Action

Section 15A(g) of the Act, as amended, provides that disciplinary
actions by the NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its
own motion or on the timely application of any aggrieved person.
This Section also provides that upon application for or institution of
review by the Commission the effectiveness of any penalty imposed by
the NASD is automatically stayed pending Commission review, unless
the Commission otherwise orders after notice and opportunity for
hearing.
Section 15A(h) of the Act defines the scope of the Commission's review. If the Commission finds that the disciplined party
committed the acts found by the NASD and thereby violated the rules
specified in the determination, and that such conduct was inconsistent
with just and equitable principles of trade, the Commission must sustain the NASD's action unless it finds that the penalties imposed are
excessive or oppressive, in which case it must cancel or reduce them.
At the start of the fiscal year, 19 NASD disciplinary decisions were
pending before the Commission on review. During the year 13 additional cases were brought up for review. Seventeen cases were disposed
of by the Commission. In 14 of these cases, the Commission sustained
the disciplinary action taken by the NASD,14 in one it set aside the
Association action," and in the remaining two cases the Commission
reduced the penalties imposed by the Association."
Fifteen cases
were pending as of the end of the year.
In the course of the year there were two important decisions concerning the obligation of members to exercise adequate supervision over
employees.
The Commission sustained the NASD's action expelling L. B. Secu'l'ities Oorporation from membership in the Association and revoking
the registration as a registered representative of R. B. Marx, its president and sole stockholder."
The action of the NASD was in large
part based upon the activities of C. Mackie Brown, Jr., a salesman,
who was found to have violated the Association's fraud rule by causing
the firm to send confirmations for the purchase of stock of L. F. Popell
& Co., Inc. ("Popell") to two customers who had never ordered the
stock.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

According to the Commission's opinion, at a time when L. B. Securities was making a market in Popell stock, Marx had telephone conversations with Brown who was then employed by another member and,
being impressed by his selling abilities, offered him a position. Marx
had never met Brown and knew nothing about his character and background. Marx's pre-employment investigation consisted of a telephone
conversation with Brown's former employer who told Marx that he had
had some "problems" with Brown, but that if he "could be controlled
he would be a heck of a salesman." The nature of the problems was
not identified and Marx did not inquire about them. While Marx
claimed that he had received a favorable recommendation concerning
Brown :from other firms who were trading Popel] stock, the Commission noted that Brown had never been employed by any of these firms
and that it appeared that the recommendations were related to his
selling abilities.
The Commission :found that during the 2 weeks Brown was employed
by L. B. Securities he sold large quantities of Popell stock to his prior
customers and that he was given a free hand and no attempt was made
to supervise him. The Commission rejected applicants' excuse that
they were unable to supervise Brown because Marx was the firm's sole
supervisor and the market :for Popell stock during Brown's association
with the firm was hectic and disorderly. It stated that it was incumbent
upon applicants to provide supervisory controls adequate to the business being conducted and added that this duty was "heightened by the
fact that they were permitting a newly hired salesman with a doubtful
recommendation to engage in selling activities, directed to customers
who were not known to the applicants, in a highly speculative security
that was declining in price."
The Commission also sustained NASD findings that applicants
violated the Commission's net capital and books and records requirements and that the firm had permitted Brown to effect securities
transactions before he became registered with the NASD as a representative of the firm.
In another case involving failure to supervise, the Commission
sustained the NASD's action expelling A. J. Gabriel & 00., Inc. from
membership in the Association and revoking the registration of
Aaron J. Gabriel, its president and sole stoekholder.P
It was undisputed that in a 20-month period the member confirmed as ageat
and charged customers commissions in 73 transactions in which the
member actually had acted as principal; failed to disclose in 28 transactions that it was acting in a dual agency capacity; and failed to
liquidate promptly 116 purchases by customers as to which payment
was not made within 7 business days as required by Regulation T of

the Federal Reserve Board. It was also undisputed that the member's books and records were not maintained in accordance with the
Commission's rules and that on July 31, 1961, the member was not in
compliance with the Commission's net capital rule.
The Commission also sustained NASD findings that the applicants
violated the Association's interpretation with respect to ":free-riding"
and withholding by allocating 500 shares of the member's 2,000-share
participation in a public offering of Hupp Systems, Inc. stock to the
account of Gabriel's wife. Applicants contended that the NASD had
failed to establish that the member had unfilled orders from the public
or had failed to make a bona fide public offering. In rejecting this
contention, the Commission pointed out that the stock, offered at
$3 per share, was being quoted in the over-the-counter market immediately after the offering at $4 bid and $4.50 asked, and that within
a week the wife had sold 400 of her shares at $3.50 and another 100
shares at $3.75 per share. The Commission concluded that "these
facts lead to the inference that public purchasers were available at
the time of the underwriting."
Although the applicants did not deny their failure to supervise
adequately, they urged in mitigation that the violations, other than
the free-riding violations, were caused by the incompetence and carelessness of back officepersonnel and that a rapid increase in the firm's
business had forced Gabriel to spend most of his time dealing with
sales and supervision of registered representatives. However, the
Commission found that the violations were pervasive and representative of a general failure to supervise vital areas of the member's
operations, and stated that Gabriel "should have made arrangements
for additional supervision or restricted the business rather than rely
completely on clerical personnel for compliance with important
regulatory requirements." The Commission further held, however,
that while Gabriel was not qualified to manage a broker-dealer business, the public interest did not require that he be prohibited from
working in the securities business as an employee upon a showing of
adequate supervision.
Other decisions of interest involved the appropriate standards for
determining the fairness, under the NASD's markup policy, of prices
charged by members in retail sales.
Both in O. A. Benson & 00., Irw.r and Strathmore Securities,
Irw.,20 a principal issue related to the proper basis upon which to
compute the amount of markups. The Commission reaffirmed its
holdings in prior cases that in the absence of countervailing evidence

a dealer's contemporaneous cost is the best evidence of current market
price. Applicants contended that they were making wholesale markets and that the NASD should have computed the markups on the
basis of their own inside offering prices, but the Commission found
that they were selling the stocks in question entirely or almost entirely to retail customers and that the few sales made by the Strathmore firm to other broker-dealers were not made at its asked quotations.
The Commission concluded that under these circumstances the NASD
had properly disregarded those quotations. However, the Commission reversed the NASD's findings respecting 41 sales made by the
Strathmore .firm as to which the NASD had computed the markups
based on the cost of a large block of stock. The firm purchased that
block at a low price from a dealer who had sought unsuccessfully
to dispose of it for some time. The Commission determined that the
NASD should have based its computations on the higher prices paid
to other dealers in smaller transactions effected at about the same
time and concluded that on this basis the sales prices were not unfair.
COMMISSION REVIEW

OF NASD ACITON ON MEMBERSBIP

As previously noted, Section 15A(b) (4) of the Act and the by-laws
of the NASD provide that, except where the Commission finds it
appropriate in the public interest to approve or direct to the contrary,
no broker or dealer may be admitted to or continued in membership
if he, or any person associated with him, is under any of the several
disabilities specified in the statute or the by-laws. A Commission
order approving or directing admission to or continuance in Association membership, notwithstanding
a disqualification under Section
15A (b) (4) of the Act or under an effective Association rule adopted
under that Section or Section 15A(b) (3), is generally entered only

The actions giving rise to Truen's disqualification occurred while he
was employed as a salesman by N. Pinsker & Co., Inc. ("Pinsker")
between September 1957 and March 1959, when he engaged in an intensive high-pressure telephone campaign to sell two highly speculative
stocks to customers irrespective of their investment needs and objectives.28 In 1962 Truen's earlier misdeeds with the Pinsker firm formed
the basis for the Commission's action denying an application by A. J.
Oaradeas» & 00., Inc. for registration as a broker-dealer and finding
Truen a cause of such denial.v Truen was Caradean's president and
owned50per~ntofllsstock
It was contended by Truen and on his behalf that the Commission
should grant the continuance application because Truen was young
and inexperienced at the time of the violations and his duties with
the prospective employer would be confined to the areas of mergers,
acquisitions, and underwritings, where he would work in a supervised
capacity.
In its opinion, the Commission referred to its earlier statement
made at the time of the denial proceeding that Truen's conduct demonstrated "gross indifference to the basic duty of fair dealing required
of securities salesmen." The Commission also noted the representation made by Truen's prospective employer that Truen would not be
permitted to engage in retail sales or trading, but pointed out that
the standard of conduct required in other aspects of the securities
business is "no less high and exacting." Under the circumstances
the Commission found that Truen's prior conduct did not "inspire
confidence" that he would maintain high standards of fair dealing in
the area of his proposed employment. In denying the application the
Commission concluded that Truen had failed to make a positive showing that his conduct since his violations had been on "such a high plane
as to demonstrate that he has changed his ways."
Commission Inspections of the NASD

Under the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act the Commission
is also charged with general oversight of national securities associations in the perfonnance of their self-regulatory activities. In carrying out this responsibility the Commission staff conducts periodic
inspections of various phases of NASD activity. These inspections
assist the Commissiion in insuring that the NASD is complying with
its self-regulatory responsibilities and enable the Commission to recommend improvements designed to increase the effectiveness of such
self-regulation.

to improve the Association's performance, the staff's views were communicated to the Association and conferences were held to arrive at

REVISION OF RULES, REGULATIONS AND FORMS

Parts I and II of this Report discuss several new or amended rules
which were adopted or proposed during the fiscal year in connection
with the implementation of the Report of the Special Study of Securities Markets and the Securities Acts Amendments of 1964. Additional revisions are summarized below.
Amendment of Rule 3a12-3

During the fiscal year the Commission adopted an amendment to
Rule 3a12-3.25 Notice of the proposed amendment was published earlier in the year 26 and all comments and suggestions received in response to that notice were considered in the preparation of the rule as
adopted by the Commission.
Rule 3a12-3 as previously in effect exempted securities of certain
foreign issuers listed on a national securities exchange and registered
under Section 12(b) of the Act from the operation of Sections 14(a)
and 16 of the Act. The amendment removes this exemption with
respect to certain equity securities and receipts and voting trust certificates therefor, if more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer are held by United States residents and the
business of the issuer is administered principally in the United States
or 50 percent or more of the members of the board of directors are
residents of the United States.
Amendments to the Proxy Rules

During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted certain amendments
to its proxy rules contained in Regulation 14A under the Act which
clarified the existing rules and embodied in the rules certain longstanding practices of the Commission. A limited number of substantive changes in the rules were also adopted. For example, Rule 14a-4
was amended to require that where a proxy is solicited for elections to
office and for other specified matters, provision shall be made whereby
the security holder may withhold authority to vote for elections to
office. Rule 14a-9, which relates to false or misleading statements in

proxy solicitations, was amended to state specifically that the filing of
proxy material with the Commission or the examination of such material by the Commission is not to be deemed a finding by the Commission that such material is accurate or complete or not false or misleading or that the Commission has passed upon the merits of the statements
contained therein or any matter to be acted upon by security holders.
Item 14 of Schedule 14A specifies the information to be furnished
where proxies are solicited in regard to a proposed merger, consolidation, acquisition or similar matter. The item previously required certain information to be furnished with respect to each person, other
than the issuer, involved in the proposed transaction. It was amended
to codify present administrative practice in requiring that such information be furnished for the issuer also in order that security holders
may have a complete picture of the nature and effect of the proposed
transaction. The amended item also codifies present administrative
practice in requiring information with respect to the existing and pro
forma capitalization and appropriate summaries of earnings on an
historical and pro forma basis for the persons involved in the proposed
transaction.
In addition, the scope of Item 7(f) of Schedule 14A, calling for a
description of any material interest of certain persons in transactions
with the issuer, was clarified and extended.
A detailed description of all of the amendments is contained in
Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 7775 (December 22,1965) and
7804 (January 27, 1966) .
Amendment of Rule 15b6-1 and Adoption of Related Form BDW

The Commission amended Rule 15b6-1 to require that notice of
withdrawal from registration as a broker-dealer be filed on a new form
designated Form BDW and to provide a 6O-day waiting period
between the filing of the form and the effective date of withdra waJ.21
Form BDW requires a broker-dealer seeking to withdraw to furnish
specified information: (a) whether he owes any money or securities to
any customer, broker, or dealer (and if he does, he must show the
amount involved and arrangements made for payment and submit a
current financial statement); (b) whether he is involved in any legal
actions or proceedings and whether there are any unsatisfied judgments or liens against him; (c) the name and address of the person
who will have custody or possession of his books and records required
to be preserved under Rule 17a-4; and (d) the address where such
books and records are located. The form also contains a consent by
the withdrawing broker-dealer to make the books and records he is
required to preserve available for examination by authorized members

Renumbering of Rules Under Sections 15(b) and 15A and Amendment of
Rules 15Al2-1, 17a-5, and 19a3-1 to Conform

Prior to the Securities Acts Amendments of 1964, Section 15 (b) consisted of 4 unnumbered paragraphs.
As a result of those amendments the Section now consists of 10 numbered paragraphs.
Therefore, the Commission renumbered its rules under Section 15 (b) to
identify the specific numbered paragraph of that Section to which
each rule primarily relates. In addition, to avoid confusion the Commission renumbered the rules under Section 15A by changing the initial lower case letter "a" in the designation of each of those rules
to the upper case letter "A." The Commission also amended renumbered Rule 15Al2-1 and Rules 17a-5 and 19a3-1 so that the references in those rules to the renumbered rules under Section 15 (b)
reflect the new designation of such rules."
Amendment of Rule 100-2

An amendment to Rule 16a-2 adopted during the fiscal year, relating to the method of computing percentage ownership under Section 16(a) of the Act (the insider reporting provision),
was
described in the 31st Annual Report."
Proposed Amendment of Rule 100-6

During the fiscal year the Commission invited public comments on
a proposed amendment of Rule 16a-6 to require the reporting of
certain additional transactions under Section 16(a) of the Act.80
These would include the acquisition or disposition of any put, call,
spread, straddle or other option or privilege, the pledge, including the
hypothecation, of a security or the release of a security from a pledge,
and the loan of a security or the repayment of such a loan.
Amendment of Rule 16b-3

Rule 161>-3exempts from Section 16 (b) of the Act (providing for
the recovery of "short swing" trading profits realized by insiders)
acquisitions of shares of stock (other than stock acquired upon the
exercise of an option, warrant or right) by an officer or director pursuant to a stock bonus, profit sharing, retirement, incentive, thrift,
savings or similar plan, if such plan meets the conditions specified in
the rule. The rule also exempts the acquisition of a "qualified" or a

An amendment was adopted during the fiscal year which under
certain conditions excludes from the phrase "exercise of an option,
warrant or right" an election to receive a cash award, payment of

Amendment of Rule 16b--6

Rule 16b-6 provides an exemption from Section 16 (b) for long-term
profits arising from the disposition in certain transactions of securities
within 6 months after the purchase of such securities through the
exercise of an option or similar right acquired more than 6 months before its exercise or pursuant to the terms of an employment contract
entered into more than 6 months before its exercise.
During the fiscal year, the Commission amended the rule to provide
that the exemption shall also be available where the security acquired
through the exercise of the option or right is disposed of in a
transaction involving the transfer of the issuer's assets to a third person which is controlled by the issuer of the securities to be received in
the exchange. In such case, "control" is to be determined by the
definition in Section 368(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.82
Amendments of Rules 16b--8 and 16b-9

During the fiscal year the Commission invited public comments on
proposed amendments to Rules 16b-8 and 16b-9,33and, after consideration of the comments received and further consideration of the matter, adopted amendments to those rules.34
The amended Rule 16b-8 provides that the acquisition and disposition of equity securities pursuant to the deposit or withdrawal of such
securities under a voting trust or deposit agreement are exempt from
the operation of Section 16 (b) of the Act, subject to certain conditions.
It requires as a condition to the exemption that substantially all of the
assets held under the voting trust or deposit agreement immediately
after the deposit or immediately prior to the withdrawal consist of
equity securities of the class deposited or withdrawn.
The amended Rule 16b-9 provides an exemption from Section 16 (b)
for the conversion of an equity security into another equity security
of the same issuer, provided that no more than 15 percent of the value
of the security received at the time of the conversion is received or paid

Proposed Amendments to Forms 3 and 4

During the fiscal year, the Commission announced that it had under
consideration the proposed revision of Forms 3 and 4 which are used
for reporting security holdings and transactions pursuant to Section
16 (a) of the Exchange Act, Section 17 (a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and Section 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.35 Form 3 is prescribed for initial statements of
beneficial ownership and Form 4 for reporting changes in such
ownership.
Among other things, the amended forms would require the reporting
person to list his Social Security or I.R.S. Employer Identification
number, in order to provide a ready means of identification in connection with the Commission's automatic data-processing
program.
Amended Form 4 would provide that the price per share be reported
with respect to securities bought or sold for cash, and that, with respect
to securities purchased or sold otherwise than in the open market, the
name and address of the seller or purchaser be given.
Proposed Amendments to Form 8-K

Certain proposed amendments to Form 8-K which were described
in the 31st Annual Report 36 were still under consideration at the close
of the fiscal year.
Amendments to Forms 10, 12, 100K and 12-K

During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted certain amendments
to the instructions contained in Forms 10,12, lO-K and 12-K.31 In
general, the amendments relax previous requirements with respect to
the disclosure required regarding the number of holders of non-transferable employee stock options and increases and decreases in such
options.

Certain proposed amendments to Forms 16 and 16-K were described

The revised forms provide that the document shall be signed by all

all the trustees. If it is signed by less than all of the trustees it must
include an opinion of counsel as to the authority of the person signing
to bind the others.
Proposed Revisions of Form X-17A-5 and Minimwn Audit Requirements

Proposed revisions of Form X-17A-5 (the form for the annual
financial report required to be filed by brokers and dealers under Rule
17a-5) and of the minimum audit requirements under Rule 17a-5
were announced by the Commission during the year.40 The proposed
changes of the form are designed to strengthen it by expanding and
clarifying the requirements, especially for the benefit of the smaller
broker-dealers who may have difficulty in preparing the present form.
The proposed revision of the minimum audit requirements would emphasize (1) that the purpose of the audit is to enable the accountant
to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control and
procedures for safeguarding securities as well as on the financial questionnaire, and (2) that the requirements are a minimum only and
should not be interpreted as limiting or permitting the omission of any
other audit procedure which may be necessary under the circumstances .

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PURtle UTILITY BOLDING
eoMP ANY ACT OF 1935
In administering the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
the Commission regulates interstate public-utility holding-company
systems engaged in the electric utility business and/or in the retail distribution of gas. The Commission's jurisdiction also extends to natural gas pipeline companies and other non-utility companies which
are subsidiaries of registered holding companies. Although the matters under the Act dealt with by the Commission and its staff embrace
a variety of intricate and complex questions of law and fact generally
involving more than one area of regulation, briefly there are three
principal regulatory areas. The first covers those provisions of the
Act, contained principally in Section 11 (b) (1), which require the
physical integration of public-utility companies and functionally related properties of holding-company systems and those provisions,
contained principally in Section 11 (b) (2), which require the simplification of intercorporate relationships and financial structures of holding-company systems. The second covers the financing operations of
registered holding companies and their subsidiaries, the acquisition
and disposition of securities and properties, and certain accounting
practices, servicing arrangements and intercompany transactions.
The third includes the exemptive provisions of the Act, the provisions
covering the status under the Act of persons and companies, and those
regulating the right of a person affiliated with a public-utility company to acquire securities resulting in a second such affiliation. Matters embraced within this last area of regulation come before the Commission and its staff frequently. Many such matters do not result in
formal proceedings and others are reflected in such proceedings only
in an indirect manner when they are related to issues principally under
one of the other areas of regulation.

HOLDING-COMPANY

SYSTEMS

At the close of the fiscal year there were 26 holding companies registered under the Act. Of these, 21 are included in the 18 holdingcompany systems which are herein classified as "active registered

ing companies in these active systems,' The remaining 5 registered
holding companies are of relatively small size and are excluded from
the active holding-company systems," In the 18 active systems there
are 88 electric and/or gas utility subsidiaries, 69 non-utility subsidiaries, and 35 inactive companies, or a total, including the parent holding companies and the subholding companies, of 213 system companies.
The table on page 78 shows the number of active holding companies
and the number of subsidiaries (classified as utility, non-utility, and inactive) in each of the active systems as of June 30,1966, and the aggregate assets of these systems, less valuation reserves, as of December 31, 1965.
SECTION 11 MATI'ERS IN REGISTERED BOLDING-COMPANY SYSTEMS

As reported previously," the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
disagreed with the Commission's interpretation of the phrase "loss of
substantial economies" in Clause (A) of Section l1(b) (1) and reversed the order of the Commission directing New England Electric
System to divest itself of its gas properties. However, in a decision
rendered on May 16, 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States
sustained the Commission's position, and remanded the case to the
Court of Appeals for further consideration in the light of its decision.'
On June 14, 1966, the Court of Appeals vacated its previous order and
directed the filing of further briefs,"
On December 21, 1965, immediately after its acquisition of approximately 42 percent of the outstanding common stock of United Gas
Corporation, Pennzoil Company registered as a holding company
under the Act. United is a gas utility company engaged in the retail
distribution of natural gas principally in Louisiana, Mississippi and
Texas. Pennzoil directly, and United through subsidiary companies,
are also engaged in substantial non-utility businesses.
Pennzoil and United subsequently filed a plan pursuant to Section
l1(e) of the Act. Part I of the plan proposes the sale of United's
gas distribution system, and Part II proposes the consolidation of

value of $14,336 million were sold at competitive bidding under
the rule. These totals compare with 233 issues of securities with
an aggregate value of $2,407 million which have been sold pursuant to orders of the Commission granting exceptions from the
competitive bidding requirements of the rule under paragraph (a) (5)
thereof.t" Of the total amount of securities sold pursuant to such
orders, 128 issues with a total value of $1.,924million were sold by the
issuers and the balance of 105 issues with a dollar value of $483 million
were portfolio sales. Of the 128 issues sold by the issuers, 70 were
in an amount from $1 to $5 million, 2 bond issues were in excess of
$100 million each," and 2 stock issues totaling $36 million were issued
in :fiscal 1966 to holders of convertible debentures and employee stock
options.
POLICY AS TO REFUNDABILITY OF BONDS

In accordance with its long-standing policy under the Act, the
Commission has continued to require that bonds and preferred stock
sold by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries he fully
refundable at the option of the issuer upon reasonable notice and
that any redemption premium be reasonable in amount. During
fiscal year 1966, no companies subject to the Act took advantage of
the refunding privilege.

petitive bidding, whether or not subject to the Act, indicated that the
presence or absence of a restriction on free refundability has not
affected the number of bids received by an issuer at competitive bidding. The 31st Annual Report, pages 91-92, contains a summary of
the results of an examination of all electric and gas utility bond issues
(including debentures) sold at competitive bidding 'between May 14,
1957, and June 30, 1965, by companies subject to the Act as well as
those not so subject. This study was extended to include fiscal year
1966.
During the period from May 14, 1957, to June 30, 1966, a total of
591 electric and gas utility bond issues, aggregating $13,770.9 million
principal amount, was offered at competitive bidding. These included
434 refundable issues totaling $8,582.5 million principal amount, and
157 non-refundable issues totaling $5,188.4. The latter issues were all
non-refundable for a period of 5 years, except one which was nonrefundable for 7 years. The refundable issues thus represented 73.4
percent of the total number of issues and 62.3 percent of principal
amount.v
The weighted average number of bids received was 4.80 on the refundable issues and 4.30 on the non-refundable issues. The median
number of bids was 5 on the refundable and 4 on the nonrefundable
issues." With respect to the success of the marketing of the bond
issues, an issue was considered to have been successfully marketed if
at least 95 pereent of the issue was sold at the syndicate price up to the
date of termination of the syndicate. On this basis, 63.8 percent of the
refundable issues and 61.1 percent of the non-refundable issues were
successful."
In terms of principal amount, 59.3 percent of the refundable issues were successful, while 59.4 percent of the non-refundable
ones were successful."

refundable issues represented 69.6 percent of all the issues, while, in terms

PART VII
PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT
The Commission's role under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act,
which provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the U.8.
district courts, differs from that under the various other statutes which
it administers.
The Commission does not initiate Chapter X proceedings or hold its own hearings, and it has no authority to determine any
of the issues in such proceedings.
The Commission participates in
proceedings under Chapter X in order to provide independent, expert
assistance to the courts, the participants, and investors in a highly
complex area of corporate law and finance. It pays special attention
to the interests of public security holders who may not otherwise be
represented. effectively.
Where the scheduled indebtedness of a debtor corporation exceeds
$3 million, Section 172 of Chapter X requires the judge, before approving any plan of reorganization, to submit it to the Commission for its
examination and report. If the indebtedness does not exceed $3 million, the judge may, if he deems it advisable to do so, submit the
plan to the Commission before deciding whether to approve it. Where
the Commission files a report, copies or a summary must be sent to all
security holders and creditors when they are asked to vote on the
plan. The Commission has no authority to veto or to require the
adoption of a plan of reorganization.
The Commission has not considered it necessary or appropriate to
participate in every Chapter X case. Apart from the excessive administrative burden, many of the cases involve only trade or bank creditors
and few public investors. The Commission seeks to participate principally in those proceedings in which a substantial public investor
interest is involved. However, the Commission may also participate
because an unfair plan has been or is about to be proposed, public
security holders are not represented adequately, the reorganization
proceedings are being conducted in violation of important provisions
of the Act, the facts indicate that the Commission can perform a useful
service, or the judge requests the Commission's participation.
The Commission has lawyers, accountants and financial analysts
in its New York, Chicago and San Francisco regional offices who are
85

86

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

engaged actively in Chapter X cases in which the Commission has
filed its appearance. Supervision and review of the regional offices'
Chapter X work is the responsibility of the Division of Corporate
Regulation of the Commission, which, through its Branch of Reorganization, also serves as a field officein cases arising in the Atlanta and
Washington, D.C. regional areas.
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

In the fiscal year 1966, the Commission continued to maintain a high
level of activity under Chapter X. During the year, the Commission
entered its appearance in 13 new proceedings involving companies
with aggregate stated assets of $105 million and aggregate indebtedness
of approximately $109 million. These proceedings involve corporations engaged in various businesses including, among others, the construction of residential dwellings, the manufacture of aluminum and
automotive products, investment in real estate and real estate mortgages, small loan and retail installment financing, motels and nursing
homes, asphalt refining, and a securities broker-dealer.
During the year the Commission was a party in a total of 102 reorganization proceedings, including the new proceedings. The stated
assets of the companies in all these proceedings totaled approximately
$634 million and their indebtedness approximately $581 million. The
proceedings were pending in district courts in 31 States and the District of Columbia, as follows: 14 in New York; 10 in Florida; 9 in
Oalifornia; 5 each in Arizona, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan and New
Jersey; 4 each in North Carolina, Texas and Washington; 3 each in
Montana, Nevada and Pennsylvania; 2 each in District of Columbia,
Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and South Dakota; 1 each in Arkansas,
Connecticut, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia. Proceedings involving 14 principal debtor corporations were closed during the
year. Thus, at the end of the fiscal year the Commission was participating in 88 reorganization proceedings.
JURISDICTIONAL, PROCEDURAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE HAlTERS

In Chapter X proceedings in which it participates, the Commission
seeks to have the courts apply the procedural and substantive safeguards to which all parties are entitled. The Commission also attempts to secure judicial uniformity in the construction of Chapter X
and the procedures thereunder.
In Luslc Oorporationd an involuntary petition under Chapter X
was filed within 4 months of a preferential transfer by the debtor of

a substantial portion of its property as security for an antecedent debt.
The debtor, after the expiration of the 4 months, filed an answer admitting all allegations in the petition except the act of bankruptcy,
and at the same time filed a voluntary petition which the court approved. The preferred creditor filed an answer and a motion to dismiss
the involuntary petition. The Commission was of the view that the
court should not have approved the voluntary petition when a prior
involuntary petition was pending. The Commission suggested that
the court vacate its order of approval and nunc pro tunc approve the
involuntary petition.
As reported previously," in Joe Newcomer Finance Oompany,S the
court initially directed the debentureholders' committee, which had
solicited contributions from public investors, to return the funds to
the contributors and refused to allow committee members reimbursement of expenses from these funds. Subsequently, the court modified
its order to provide that the cash still on hand be returned, but that
the amounts already spent to pay expenses of the committee need not
be reimbursed.
In Hydrocarbon Ohemicals, Inc.,4 the Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit 5 affirmed an order of the district court which disallowed
a priority for the claim of a creditor who had advanced funds to the
receiver in the prior Chapter XI proceeding. The court agreed with
the Commission that the creditor was not entitled to a priority since
the borrowing had not, as required by the Bankruptcy Act, specifically
been authorized by the referee. In another appeal involving this
debtor, the same court of appeals held that the Chapter X court lacked
jurisdiction to enjoin a foreclosure sale of property owned by a corporation, not in reorganization, in which the debtor held a majority
of the stock,"
In The Sire Plan Management Oorp.,7 the district court denied a
motion by the indenture trustees for the public investors who owned
fractional interests in real estate leased to the debtor to direct the
Chapter X trustees to surrender possession and control of these properties. The indenture trustees alleged that the filing of the Chapter
X petition had terminated the leases by reason of forfeiture provisions contained therein. On appeal the Commission argued for affirmance on the ground that a Chapter X court may protect public
investors by refusing to surrender properties in its custody to an inden• 31st Annual Report, p. 98.

ture trustee who has failed to perform fiduciary responsibilities in
connection with the properties. The court of appeals did not reach
the argument of the Commission but affirmed because on the facts it
appeared the indenture trustees were estopped from invoking the
power of termination in the leases,"
In Tayl<Yl'Iraernationai Oorp.,9 a claim was filed against the debtor
for over $4 million, based upon (a) the alleged failure of the debtor
to complete construction of five large apartment buildings, and (b)
the default of the debtor in making payments on the debtor's guaranty
of a minimum monthly distribution to the public limited partners
in these ventures. Although the claim was filed several months after
the expiration of the date set by the court for filing of claims, the court
approved the allowance of a compromise claim in the amount of
$1.1 million.
In both General Economics Syndicate, Inc. and G.E.O. Funding
Oorp./o involving two related debtors, the district court entered an
order, over Commission objection, substituting both reorganized companies as plaintiffs in suits brought by the trustees against the former
management. The Commission had opposed the motion on the ground
that Section 216 of Chapter X required that causes of action accruing
to the estate should be prosecuted by the trustee. The Commission contended that, if the reorganized companies were seeking to take over
the lawsuits for the purpose of discontinuing them, as suggested in
the record before the court, the proper procedure was to file a motion
for an order directing the trustees to discontinue the suits.
In Yale EXPress System, Inc~,l1the district court agreed with the
Commission that a set-off under Section 68a of the Bankruptcy Act
should not be permitted in Chapter X proceedings where it would
jeopardize the chance for a successful reorganization," The Court
of Appeals agreed in principle but remanded the proceeding to the
district court on other grounds,"
Prior to the inception of the Chapter X proceeding in respect of this
same debtor, a number of present and past holders of the debtor's stock
and 41A, percent convertible subordinated debentures had commenced
at least 16 actions in State and Federal courts against a group of defendants including the debtor, its auditors and underwriters.v

the prospectus, by which $6.5 million principal amount of the debentures and 400,000 shares of stock issued by the debtor were sold to
the public in 1963, and subsequent statements and reports issued by
the debtor, were false and misleading. These suits against the debtor
were stayed by the reorganization court and the trustee has been substituted in place of the debtor.
The managing underwriters of the 1963 issue of debentures and
stock have applied to the reorganization court for leave to file crossclaims against the trustee, contending that if they are adjudged liable
in the alleged class actions, they will be entitled to indemnification
from the debtor pursuant to the underwriting agreement, and that
the underwriters may also be defrauded purchasers of the debtor's
securities and be entitled to recover if the plaintiffs in the class actions
recover. The Chapter X court issued an order fixing September 30,
1966, as the last date for the debentureholders and stockholders to
file proofs of claim with the trustee. Any person who is a member
of the class on whose behalf the suits have been brought must file such
a claim to preserve his right to participate in awards or settlements
against or by the debtor or its trustee,"
In Yuba OonsoZidated Industries, Inc.,lB several stockholders asserted claims for over $1.3 million based on their allegations that
the debtor, prior to the Chapter X proceeding, had converted their
common stock by preventing the sale of such stock. These stockholders initially had acquired the stock for investment. Relying on advice
from the Commission's staff, the debtor had instructed its transfer
agent not to transfer their stock because the transfer might result in
a sale in violation of the registration requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933. Under a compromise approved by the court the claimants were paid $150,000 in cash and were allowed claims as creditors
to the extent of $225,000.

modest sum for distribution, pro rata, to non-management preferred

court, but in no event was any stockholder to receive more than the
price he had paid for his stock.
TRUSTEE'S INVESTIGATION

A complete accounting for the stewardship of corporate affairs by
the prior management is a requisite under Chapter X. One of the primary duties of the trustee is to make a thorough study of the debtor to
assure the discovery and collection of all assets of the estate, including
claims against officers, directors, or controlling persons who may have
mismanaged the debtor's affairs.
In Hydrocarbon Ohemicals, Inc.,tU the trustee instituted a plenary
action against the Bank of Commerce of New York and officers and
directors of the debtor and others to recover over $2 million, alleging
that the debtor was defrauded in the issuance of its stock.
In Oontinental Vending Machine Oorp.,20 the trustee brought suit
against the former management and directors of the debtor, its accountants and others, seeking $41 million in damages to the debtor.

advisory report.v
In F. L. Jacobs 00.,25 the plan of reorganization provided for the
internal reorganization of the debtor and the continuation of the
debtor's business. Under the plan, the reorganized company was to
assume all debts and obligations incurred by the trustees during the
proceeding. The plan provided for a distribution of debentures and
cash to the preferred stockholders, with the present common stock to
remain outstanding. The preferred stockholders were to receive 6
percent debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $2,706,350,
such amount being equal to the involuntary liquidation preference of
$50 per share on the outstanding preferred stock exclusive of dividend
arrearages. Dividend arrears of about $1 million on the preferred
stock were to be paid in cash, substantially from the proceeds of a $1
million bank loan. The debentures were to mature in 15 years from
the date of issue and under the proposed indenture the reorganized
company would deposit 40 percent of its annual net income in a
sinking fund for retirement of debentures by purchase in the open
market, solicitation of tenders or redemption. No dividends could be
paid on the common stock until one-half of the principal amount of
debentures was redeemed or otherwise retired, or the $1 million bank
loan was paid in full, whichever occurred first.
The Commission concluded that the plan was feasible and would be
fair and equitable if it were amended to remove the dividend restriction on the common stock. 28 The court agreed with the Commission
and the trustees amended the plan and as so amended the plan was
approved and confirmed.

the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the
district court's determination of insolvency "was supported by substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous." 29
In Rocky Mountain Ohemical Oorp.,ao the court approved a plan of
reorganization which provided for the sale of the assets to a new company formed by a stockholders' committee, which raised funds from
the sale of stock pursuant to a Regulation A offering. The debtor had

committee was sufficient only to pay the expenses of administration.
In Edward N. Siegler &: 00.,31 a registered broker-dealer which was
a member of the Midwest Stock Exchange filed a petition for reorganization in Cleveland, Ohio on May 23, 1966. With the assistance of the
Commission, an agreement was worked out which provided for the
satisfaction of the claims of all customers in full by the transfer of
the customers' accounts to Hartzmark & Co., Inc., a Cleveland brokerdealer. Hartzmark has undertaken to honor all of the customers' paid
security positions and free credit balances. This agreement was approved by the court on August 1, 1966. The assets held by the debtor
for customers were approximately $160,000 short of the amount required to satisfy these liabilities.
The Midwest Stock Exchange
contributed $135,000 towards the deficiency and Hartzmark provided

ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD TO ALWW ANCES

Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem
of determining the allowance of compensation to be paid to the
various parties for services rendered and for expenses incurred in the
proceeding. The Commission, which under Section 242 of the Bankruptcy Aot may not receive any allowance for the services it renders,
has sought to assist the courts in assuring economy of administration
and in allocating compensation equitably on the basis of the claimants'
contributions to the administration of estates and the formulation of
plans. During the fiscal year 197 applications for compensation
totaling about $6.9 million were reviewed,
In Automatic Washer Oompfi:n,y,36 the court disagreed with the view
of the Commission th3Jt no compensation or reimbursement of expenses
should be allowed a fee applicant in connection with the preparation
of his application for an allowance or attendance at the hearing on his
application.
The court said that the preparation of a fee application
and attendance at a hearing thereon in a Chapter X proceeding may
require a substantial amount of time, which would be considered in
ma.king an allowance for fees,"
In General Eoonomios Syndwate, Inc.,33 application for final allowances totaled $276,000, the Commission recommended $136,000, and the
district court allowed $160,500. On appeal, the court reduced the
allowances to the trustees and their counsel to the amount recommended Iby the Commission and agreed with the Commission that the
allowance to counsel for certain stockholders was so low as to constitute an abuse of discretion. Counsel for the stockholders had requested $25,000, the Oommission recommended $15,000, and the
district court awarded $3,500. The court of appeals allowed $10,000.39
The court of appeals stressed the necessity for attorneys who expect to
obtain an allowance to keep accurate time records.
InSwan-Finch Oil 007'p07'ation,40 20 applicants requested a total of

adopted by the court, except for allowance to the trustee. The latter
had requested $650,000, the Commission had recommended $450,000,

In Tucker Oorporation,41 a proceeding in which the Commission
was not participating, the Commission informed the attorney for the
trustee that final allowances to four law firms had been approved by
the court on the basis of applications which had understated the
amounts previously received by these firms as interim allowances. All
four firms admitted having received interim payments which they did
not report to the court at the time they applied for final allowances, but
sought court approval to correct the record to show the amounts
actually received as interim allowances.
The Commission moved for leave to file its appearance in the
Chapter X proceeding and urged that the court order the return by
the four firms of the full amount of the excess payments received by
them, plus interest. The Commission also suggested that there should
be an inquiry as to the circumstances surrounding the overpayments.
The court denied the Commission's motion to enter the proceeding and
granted the motion of the four law firms to correct the record, finding
that the inaccuracies in the petitions for fees "were the result of inadvertent and honest mistakes." As a result, two of the firms actually
received payments in excess of the total originally requested.

debtors can effect arrangements with respect to their unsecured debts
under court supervision. Where a proceeding is brought under that
chapter but the facts indicate that it should have been brought under
Chapter X, Section 328 of Chapter XI authorizes the Commission or
any other party in interest to make application to the court to dismiss
the Chapter XI proceeding unless the debtor's petition is amended to
comply with the requirements of Chapter X, or a creditors' petition
under Chapter X is filed.
In Imperial "4(){}" National, Inc.,42 a company engaged in the business of developing and operating motels on a co-ownership basis proposed an arrangement under Chapter XI whereby the interests of the
850 common stockholders were to be eliminated and the estimated
several hundred holders of the $994,000 of convertible debentures were
to receive 50 percent of the stock of the reorganized company. The
Commission's motion under Section 328 was based on the major adjustment of the rights of the debenture holders and the fact that the debtor

was attempting a comprehensive reorganization under Chapter XI
rather than a simple composition of its unsecured debts. The court
agreed with the Commission's position and granted the motion stating,
among other things, that there was a need for the appointment of a
disinterested trustee with broad powers of investigation and for the
assistance of the Commission. The debtor subsequently amended its
petition to comply with Chapter X.
In American Guar«:nty Uor-poraiionc" reported previously," the
district court affirmed its previous denial, in 1963,45 of the Commission's Section 328 motion, which was again before the district court on
remand from the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit," The Commission advised the court of appeals, which had retained jurisdiction
over the matter, that it did not desire to press its appeal further and
the court of appeals dismissed the appeal.
In First Mortgage Oorp. of Stuart,41 the debtor, on the complaint of
the Florida Securities Commission, had been placed in a State court
receivership together with several other corporations alleged to be related to or affiliated with the debtor, including Tower Oredit (Iorporation. A few days thereafter the debtor filed a petition under Chapter
XI. This Commission's motion under Section 328, joined in by the
Florida Securities Commission and many attorneys representing
public investors, was denied without prejudice. Shortly thereafter the
court adjudicated the debtor bankrupt. Several months later an involuntary petition under Chapter X was filed by three purported
creditors against Tower,48 which the court dismissed on the ground
that the petitioning creditors did not have valid claims. After the
close of the fiscal year, three different creditors filed another involuntary Chapter X petition against Touter."

ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes, debentures and similar securities publicly offered for sale, except as specifically exempted by the Act, be issued under an indenture which meets
the requirements of the Act and has been duly qualified with the Commission. The Act requires that indentures to be qualified include
specified provisions which provide means by which the rights of
holders of securities issued under such indentures may be protected and
enforced. These provisions relate to designated standards of eligibility and qualification of the corporate trustee to provide reasonable
financial responsibility and to minimize conflicting interests. The Act
outlaws exculpatory provisions formerly used to eliminate all liability
of the indenture trustee and imposes on the trustee, after default, the
duty to use the same degree of care and skill in the exercise of the
rights and powers vested in it by the indenture as a prudent man would
use in the conduct of his own affairs.
The provisions of the Trust Indenture Act are closely integrated
with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant
to the Securities Aot of securities to be issued under a trust indenture
subject to the Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective unless the indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter
Act, and necessary information as to the trustee and the indenture
must be contained in the registration statement. In the case of securities issued in exchange for other securities of the same issuer and
securities issued under a plan approved by a court or other proper
authority which, although exempted from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, are not exempted from the requirements
of the Trust Indenture Act, the obligor must file an application for the
qualification of the indenture, including a statement of the required
information concerning the eligibility and qualification of the trustee.

REVISION OF RULES. REGULATIONS AND FORMS
Adoption of Rule 7a-9

During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted a new Rule 7a-9
which provides for the filing with an application for the qualification
of an indenture under the Act, or as an amendment to such an application which has not become effective, of an amendment which will delay
the effectiveness of the application until the 20th day after a superseding amendment is filed, or until the Commission upon request
accelerates the effective date.' The purpose of the new rule is to
make it unnecessary to file successive delaying amendments to such
applications.
Amendmenlll

to Forms T-I and T-2

Forms T-l and T-2 are prescribed for statements of eligibility and
qualification of corporations or individuals, respectively, designated
to act as trustees under indentures qualified under the Act. During the
fiscal year, the Commission amended these forms to clarify and simplify them in certain respects, to delete certain required information
deemed not essential to a determination of the eligibility and qualifications of the trustee, to require certain additional information deemed
significant, and to bring the forms in line with the format of the
Commission's more recently adopted forms under other acts. 2

PART IX
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT

OF 1940
The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides for the registration
and regulation of companies primarily engaged in the business of
investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities. The
Act, among other things, requires disclosure of the financial condition
and investment policies of such companies; prohibits changing the
nature of their business or their investment policies without shareholder approval; regulates the means of custody of the companies'
assets; requires management contracts to be submitted to security
holders for approval; prohibits underwriters, investment bankers, and
brokers from constituting more than a minority of the directors of
such companies; and prohibits transactions between such companies
and their officers, directors, and affiliates except with approval of the
Commission. The Act also regulates the issuance of senior securities
and requires face-amount certificate companies to maintain reserves
adequate to meet maturity payments upon the certificates.
The securities of investment companies which are offered to the
public are also required to be registered under the Securities Act of
1933 and the companies must file periodic reports. Such companies
are also subject to the Commission's proxy rules and certain "insiders"
of closed-end companies are subject to reporting and "short swing"
trading rules. In November 1964, certain functions relating to investment companies were reallocated from the Division of Corporation
Finance to the Division of Corporate Regulation, including the administration of the disclosure requirements with respect to registration
statements filed by such companies under the Securities Act of 1933
and the administration of the periodic reporting, proxy solicitation
and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with
respect to registered investment companies. On the basis of the experience since the transfer of functions, the resulting concentration of
responsibility in the Division of Corporate Regulation for the administration of the securities laws as they apply to investment companies
has been of material convenience to registrants and other persons
concerned with investment companies.

COMPANIES REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT

As of June 30, 1966, there were 775 investment companies registered under the Act, including 70 small business investment cornpan&.
Of this total, 667 were "active" companies, wl~oseassets had an aggregate market value of approximately $49.8 billion. Compared with
the corresponding totals at June 30, 1965, these figures represent a n
overall increase of approximately $5.2 billion in the market value of
assets and an increase of 51 in the number of active registered companies. The asset increase is partly due to the appreciation in assets
of previously registered companies and partly to the large increase
in the number of registered companies. The classification of the registered wmpanies and the approximate market value of the assets in

INSPECl'ION AND INVESTIGATION PROGRAM

During fiscal year 1966, 152 investment company inspections were
completed pursuant to Section 31 (b) of the Act. Many of the inspections disclosed violations not only of the Investment Company
Act but also of other statutes administered by the Commission. A
number of the violations uncovered during routine inspections were
serious in nature. They included failure to observe the procedures
which had been established for safekeeping of the company's assets,
and failure to disclose the true sources of periodic income dividends and
capital gain distributions paid to shareholders.
The inspections also
disclosed several situations in which the procedures for pricing shares
for purposes of purchase or redemption did not conform with statutory
requirements or with the procedure set forth in the company's prospectus. The inspections further uncovered a number of instances
in which self-dealing transactions had been effected by affiliated
persons in violation of Section 1'7of the Act.
.

THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT

101

Largely as an outgrowth of information obtained during routine
inspections, 17 private investigations were commenced during the fiscal year to develop the facts concerning what appeared to be serious
violations of the statutes administered by the Commission.
On the basis of the facts obtained in private investigations, three
civil actions were instituted by the Commission during the fiscal year
1966. One action sought, among other things, to enjoin an investment company and its officers and agents from issuing, selling,
purchasing, or redeeming any securities while it failed to maintain
and keep current its books and records. 1 The action further sought
appointment of a conservator for the company's assets to protect the
interests of shareholders.
In another action the Commission obtained
a preliminary injunction restraining a company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries from doing business as unregistered investment companies
in violation of the Act.2 This action further seeks to enjoin affiliated persons from engaging in transactions which, had the company
been registered, would have been prohibited by Section 17(a) of the
Act. The complaint also alleges that certain defendants caused the
filing of false reports with the Commission. In the third action the
Commission seeks to enjoin certain affiliated persons of a registered
investment company from effecting self-dealing transactions with the
investment company, and alleges gross abuse of trust and gross misconduct within the meaning of Section 36 of the Act.s
As a result of an investigation by the Commission, Herman I.
Weiner, former secretary of Revere Fund, Inc., a registered investment company, was charged in a criminal information in the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania with conversion and embezzlement of the
company's assets and transmitting a materially false and misleading
letter to the Commission with respect to his activities. Weiner entered a plea of nolo contendere, and is to be sentenced at a later
date.4
As a result of the Commission's inspection and investigation program, approximately $316,000 was returned to investors either directly
or indirectly during the 1966 fiscal year. The major portion of
this recovery resulted from a court-approved settlement in an injunctive proceeding instituted by the Commission, involving Electro1H.E.O. v, The First Hartfora EfDchangeFuna, Civ. Act. No. 66-433 (S.D.N.Y.,
January 25,1966).

Science Investors, Tnc." Under the terms of the settlement, a former
director of this investment company agreed to pay $225,000 to the
company. The injunctive action had stemmed largely from the director's personal transactions in a security which was also included in
the company's portfolio. In addition, the Commission settled several matters out of court with resulting benefits to investors.
ANNUAL REPORTING BY MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

During the fiscal year, the initial annual reports to the Commission
by registered management investment companies on the revised reporting form, captioned N-1R, were utilized by the Division of Corporate Regulation in the examination of investment company matters,
including the program of inspection and enforment." The reports
have been of substantial assistance in the processing of investment
company filings, the inspection of investment companies, and the disclosure of violations of the Act. They provide considerable savings
in time and expense by making available information relating to individual companies which could otherwise only be obtained through
more frequent and detailed inspections. The reports also enable the
Commission to develop information on various industry practices
as an important aid to the exercise of the Commission's responsibilities
under the statute.
FILINGS REVIEWED

As previously noted, investment companies offering their shares
for sale to the public must register them under the Securities Act of
1933. The companies themselves, of course, must register under the
Investment Company Act. The registration statements of investment companies filed pursuant to the Securities Act are reviewed for
compliance with that Act and the Investment Company Act. The
Commission's rules promulgated under the Investment Company
Act generally require that the basic information contained in notifications of registration and in registration statements of investment
companies filed under the Investment Company Act be kept current
through periodic and other reports. In addition, proxy soliciting
material filed by investment companies is reviewed for compliance
with the Commission's proxy rules. The following table sets forth
the nature and volume of filings processed during the past fiscal year:

APPLICATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

Under Section 6(c) of the Act, the Commission, by rules and regulations, upon its own motion or by order upon application, may exempt
any person, security, or transaction from any provision of the Act
if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the
Act. Other Sections, such as 6(d), 9(b), 10(f), 17(b), 17(d), and
23 (c), contain specific provisions and standards pursuant to which
the Commission may grant exemptions from particular sections of the
Act or may approve certain types of transactions. Also, under certain
provisions of Sections 2, 3, and 8, the Commission may determine
the status of persons and companies under the Act. One of the principal activities of the Commission in its regulation of investment
companies is the consideration of applications for orders under the
sections referred to.
During the fiscal year, 213 applications .filedunder various sections
of the Act were before the Commission, and 183 applications were
disposed of. As of the end of the year, 100 applications were pending. The sections of the Act with which these applications were concerned and the disposition of applications are shown in the following

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Some of the more significant matters in which applications were
considered are summarized below:
On March 9,1966 the Commission, with one Commissioner dissenting, issued its opinion and order granting in part, and denying in
part, an application filed pursuant to Section 6 (c) of the Act by First
National City Bank of New York requesting exemptions from certain
provisions of the Act, principally Sections 10(b) (3), 10(c), and 10
(d) (2), with respect to a Commingled Investment Account ("Account") which the Bank proposed to establish and to register under
the Act as a diversified open-end management investment company,"
The Bank's application proposed that the Account would operate
as a collective investment fund pursuant to regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency and accept investments of $10,000 or more
pursuant to agreements between inv.estors and the Bank. No sales
load would be imposed. The Bank would serve as investment adviser
for the Account, subject to investor approval. The operation of the
Account was to be subject to the supervision of a Committee of at
least three persons, at least one of whom would be unaffiliated with
the Bank. The Commission denied an exemption from Section 10
(d) (2) of the Act. This exemption would have permitted all but one
of the members of the Committee, which would be equivalent to a board
of directors, to be affiliated with the Bank. However, the Commission granted exemptions from Sections 10 (b) (2), 10(b) (3), and 10 (c)
of the Act, which provide in substance that the majority of the board
of directors of a registered investment company may not be (a)
affiliated with the principal underwriter of the investment company,
(b) affiliated with an investment banker, or (c) officers or directors of
anyone bank. The effect of the exemptions granted by the Commission was thus to permit a majority of the Committee to consist of
officers or directors of, or persons otherwise affiliated with, the Bank.
The Account remains subject to Section 10(a) of the Act, under which
not more than 60 percent of the members of the Committee may consist of persons who are affiliated with the Bank.
In granting the exemptions, the Commission stressed, among other
things, that the Account differed substantially from the bank-dominated investment companies with which Congress was concerned in
enacting Section 10 (c) and that there were substantial safeguards

against conflicts of interest which could arise as a result of the Bank's
commercial banking activities.
Commissioner Budge, dissenting from the Commission's decision,
stated that the granting of the exemptions was contrary to the expressed
statutory prohibition against bank domination of investment companies. He referred to the statutory history which indicated
conflicts and potential conflicts of interest between a bank and the
investment company it dominates. He expressed the view that if the
restrictions of Section 10(c) are to be avoided, this should be accomplished through legislation and not through ad hoc exemptions, particularly when, as here, the Commission and the bank regulatory agencies have adopted contrary interpretations as to the very nature of the
proposed investment company.
The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. which appeared in opposition to the Bank's application, has filed a petition
to review the Commission's order in the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. The Investment Company Institute,
which also opposed the application, filed a complaint in the District
Court for the District of Columbia against the Comptroller of the
Currency seeking, among other things, to enjoin his approval of the
Bank's plan.
On May 6, 1966, the Commission released its Findings and Opinions
and Order in Electric Bond and Share Oompany.8 This opinion
denied the application
of Electric Bond and Share Company
("Bond and Share") for an order pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Act
declaring that it had ceased to be an investment company and also
denied Bond and Share's alternative applications pursuant to Section
3(b) (2) of the Act for an order declaring that it is not primarily engaged in the business of an investment company and, pursuant to Seetion 6 (c) of the Act, for an order exempting it from the Act. The
Commission also denied the application of American & Foreign Power
Company Inc. ("Foreign Power"), a majority-owned subsidiary of
Bond and Share, for an order pursuant to Section 3(b) (2) of the Act
declaring that Foreign Power is not an investment company, or
alternatively, for an order exempting it from the Act pursuant to
Section 6 (c).
In rejecting the applications, the Commission stated that obligations of foreign countries, which Foreign Power had received in
exchange for various of its foreign utility interests, are investment
securities as that term is used in the Act. Such securities constituted over 80 percent of Foreign Power's assets from which it derived
about 76 percent of its income. Therefore, the Commission held that

COMMISSION

Foreign Power was no longer primarily engaged in utility operations and that it was not entitled to exemption from the Act. In
addition, the Commission held that Bond and Share was not entitled
to exemption from the Act since about two-thirds of its assets from
which it derived about 60 percent of its income consisted of marketable investment securities and securities of Foreign Power.
On May 11, 1966, the Commission issued its opinion and order
denying motions to dismiss an application filed pursuant to Section
2(a) (9) of the Act by Randolph Phillips, a stockholder of four
investment companies for which Investors Diversified Services, Inc.
("IDS") serves as investment adviser and principal underwriter, and
denying the control determinations sought by Phillips," In refusing
to dismiss the application, the Commission, adhering to the conclusions
reached by it in Fwndamental Investors, Ino./o held that a shareholder
of a registered investment company is an "interested person" within
the meaning of Section 2 (a) (9) of the Act and entitled to file with
the Commission an application for an order that, contrary to the
presumptions contained in that section, a person or group of persons
are in control of an investment company's adviser and the company
controlling such adviser, and that the Commission may make a
determination relating to a period preceding such determination.
Phillips' application alleged that in 1962 Bertin C. Gamble and two
affiliated companies had acquired control of Alleghany Corporation,
which controls IDS, and of IDS. The Commission concluded,
however, that the presumption under Section 2(a) (9) of the Act
that the Gamble group, as the owner of less than 25 percent of
Alleghany's stock, did not control that company had not been rebutted.
In October 1962, John D. Murchison and Clint W. Murchison, Jr.
and their associates, who had gained control of Alleghany in a 1961
proxy contest, sold 15 percent of the voting stock of Alleghany to
the Gamble group and granted that group a right to purchase an
additional 15-20 percent and to assume 2 seats on the 10-man board
of directors. However, the Gamble group failed to reach an accord
with Alan P. Kirby, Sr., a 33 percent stockholder of Alleghany who
was engaged in efforts to regain control of Alleghany, and its contemplated succession to the Murchison group's holdings and positions
did not materialize. The Commission also found that the record
did not establish the existence of a claimed secret agreement between
the Murchison and Gamble groups to transfer control to the latter or
show that certain actions of Alleghany and IDS were attributable to

the controlling influence of the Gamble group. Phillips has filed a
petition for review in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
At the close of the fiscal year there were pending for determination
by the Commission two proceedings involving the issuance of stock
options. In one of these cases, State Bond & Mortgage Company,
a registered face-amount certificate company, was seeking authorization for certain stock options theretofore issued, and to be issued,
under a stock option plan for its officers and employees.u Section
18 (j) of the Act prohibits a face-amount certificate company from
issuing any security, except in accordance with Commission authorization thereunder, other than (i) a face-amount cer:tificate, (ii) a
non-preference voting common stock, and (iii) short term, privately
issued indebtedness.
It also prohibits the issuance of any securities
except for cash or securities.
In the other proceeding, the Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company of America ("VALIC"),
a registered open-end management
investment company, sought an exemption under Section 6 (c) of the
Act for the proposed issuance of stock options under a stock option
plan for its officers and employees."
Section 18(d) of the Act, with
certain inapplicable exceptions, prohibits a registered management
investment company from issuing any warrant or right to subscribe
to a security of which it is the issuer. Section 22(g) of the Act as
applicable prohibits a registered open-end investment company from
issuing any of its securities for services or for property other than
cash or securities. Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, the Commission denied both applications."

and effected at a price determined in accordance with the provisions
of the rule. The exemption would be available only where the transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company, as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under
the Act, and where no brokerage commission, fee or other remuneration is paid in connection with the transaction, except for customary
transfer fees.

PART X
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACf

OF 1940
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 established a pattern of
regulation of investment advisers similar to that contained in the
Securities Exchange Act with respect to the conduct of broker-dealers.
With certain specific exceptions, the Act requires persons engaged for
compensation in the business of advising others with respect to securities to register with the Commission and to conform to statutory
standards designed to protect the public interest. The Act prohibits
fraudulent conduct, and authorizes the Commission to define, and
prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent fraudulent, deceptive
or manipulative acts or practices. Pursuant to such authority, Rule
206(4)-1 proscribes, among other things, the use of testimonials, circumscribes permissible references to past recommendations and the
use of graphs and charts, and prohibits the use of false or misleading
statements.
Under Rule 206(4)-2, an investment adviser who has
custody or possession of the funds or securities of clients must segregate them, maintain them in the manner provided in the rule and
comply with certain other conditions.
The Act prohibits an investment adviser from basing his compensation upon a share of the capital gains or appreciation of his
client's funds, and prohibits the assignment of investment advisory
contracts without the client's consent. Advisers are also required to
make, keep and preserve books and records in accordance with the
Commission's rules and the Commission is empowered to conduct
inspections of such books and records.
Investment advisers who violate any of the provisions of the Act
or of the rules thereunder are subject to appropriate administrative,
civil or criminal sanctions. The Act provides, in Section 203 (d) ,
that the Commission shall deny, revoke, or suspend for not more than
12 months, the registration of an investment adviser if it finds that
such action is in the public interest and that the investment adviser
or any partner, officer, director or controlling or controlled person
of the investment adviser is subject to a specified disqualification.
These disqualifications include wilful misstatements in an application
or report filed with the Commission, the existence of a conviction or
injunction based on or related to specified types of misconduct, wilful
109

violation of any provisions of the Securities Act, Securities Exchange
Act or Investment Advisers Act or any rule or regulation thereunder,
and aiding and abetting any other person's violation of such provisions,
rules or regulations.
In addition, the Commission may seek injunctions to restrain violations of the Act and may recommend criminal
prosecution by the Department of Justice for fraudulent misconduct
or wilful violation of the Act or the Commission's ru1es thereunder.
Registration Statistics

At the close of the fiscal year 1,633 investment advisers were registered with the Commission. The following tabulation contains other

REVISION OF RULES, REGULATIONS AND FORMS
Amendment of Rule 204-2 (a)

During the fiscal year the Commission invited comments on a proposed amendment of Rule 204-2 (a) to require investment advisers to
maintain records containing specified information concerning securities transactions in which they or certain of their personnel have any
beneficial interest. Shortly after the end of the year the amendment
was adopted.' The background and significance of this amendment

OTHER ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION

CIVIL liTIGATION

The several statutes administered by the Commission authorize the
Commission to seek injunctions against continuing or threatened violations of such statutes. Such violations may involve a wide range of
illegal practices, including the purchase or sale of securities by fraud,
and the sale of securities without compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Commission also participates
in various other types of proceedings, including appearances as amicus
curiae in litigation between private parties where it is important that
its views regarding the interpretation of the statutory provisions involved be furnished to the court, corporate reorganization proceedings
under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, and various types of civil
appellate proceedings.
Tables 10 and 12 in the appendix to this report contain statistics
with respect to the various types of civil proceedings in which the Commission participated prior to and during the fiscal year. A summary
of injunction proceedings instituted by the Commission since 1934
may be found in Table 11. This section describes a few of the more
noteworthy cases which were pending during the fiscal year, not including, however, cases arising under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act or Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act; such cases are
discussed in the sections of this report dealing with those statutes.
In an important decision involving the scope of the "insurance" exemptions to the disclosure and regulatory provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in 8E.0. v. United
Benefit Life Insurance 00,1 affirming the decision of the district court,"
held that the "Flexible Fund Annuity" offered and sold by the United
Benefit Life Insurance Company is a contract of insurance and therefore exempt from the coverage of the 1933 and 194:0Acts by virtue of
the statutory exemptions relating to insurance and annuities.
The Commission had urged that the insurance exemptions were unavailable because the Flexible Fund contract is offered and promoted
1359F. 2d619 (C.A.D.C., 1966).

as a vehicle for investing in the stock market and because the purchaser's fortunes during the pay-in period, when he is a participant
in the Flexible Fund, are, to a substantial extent, directly dependent
on the investment experience of a portfolio of securities managed by
the company. The court of appeals, rejecting the Commission's
position, held that the exemptions were available, because (1) under
the minimum guarantee the company has assumed a substantial part
of the investment risk during the pay-in period, and (2) the company
has assumed the major part of the investment risk over the duration of
the entire contract including both pay-in and pay-out periods. After
the close of the fiscal year the Supreme Court granted a petition for
certiorari filed by the Commission.
In Kaplan v. Lehmasi Brothers.' a derivative action on behalf of
certain investment companies seeking injunctive relief and treble damages against the New York Stock Exchange and several member firms
for alleged violations of the anti-trust laws in fixing minimum commission rates for transactions on the Exchange, the district court, relying on Silver v. New York Stock Ernchange,4 held that the Exchange's commission rate rules did not violate the anti-trust laws, since
such rules were specifically contemplated under the regulatory scheme
'of the 1934 Act. The court further held that determination of the
reasonableness of the Exchange's rates should be left to the prospective
decisions of the Commission. Plaintiffs have appealed to the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and that court has granted the Commission leave to participate as amicue curiae.
In Fifth Avenue Ooach Lines, 1M. v. New York Stock Ernchange,6
the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court unanimously
reversed the lower court which had denied the EXChange's motion to
dismiss an action brought by Fifth A venue Coach Lines, Inc. to enjoin
the Exchange from delisting its stock. Fifth A venue had alleged that
such delisting would be arbitrary and harmful to the interests of stockholders. The Exchange had applied to the Commission to delist the
stock. Adopting the position of the Commission, amicus curiae, the
court held that the State court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action in that the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides
the exclusive procedure for delisting securities and such procedure
constitutes a pre-emption of the area by the Federal Government.
The court stated that the "statutory provisions constitute an integrated
'administrative and judicial procedure by which, it seems clear, Congress intended the delisting process to be specially regulated and
controlled. "

During the year, the Commission was involved in numerous actions
seeking injunctive and other relief against practices which it claimed
to be unlawful under the securities laws.
The case of S.E.O. v. Texas Gulf Sulphur 00.,' whose institution
was discussed in the last annual report," proceeded to trial during the
year. Following the close of the fiscal year, the district court rendered
a decision agreeing with certain of the contentions of the Commission
both as to law and fact and disagreeing with others. It dismissed the
Commission's complaint against Texas Gulf Sulphur Co. and 10 individual defendants but found that 2 other individual defendants committed violations of Section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and Rule 101-5 under that Act by purchasing Texas Gulf stock on
the basis of material inside information. Texas Gulf began exploratory
drilling near Timmins, Ontario, in November 1963. On April 16, 1964,
it issued a press release announcing that it had made a major discovery
of copper, zinc and silver. The Commission charged that officers, directors, and employees of Texas Gulf violated Section 10 (b) and Rule
101-5 by purchasing Texas Gulf stock and calls during the intervening period on the basis of undisclosed inside information about the
drilling results and by divulging this information to their relatives
and friends so that these "tippees" could also purchase Texas Gulf
securities on this basis. Some of the individual defendants were also
charged with accepting stock options from the corporation during
this period without disclosing the information in their possession
about the drilling results to those making the decision to issue the
options. Finally, the Commission charged the corporation with issuing a false and misleading press release 4 days before the press
release announcing the discovery.
The court rejected defendants' contentions that the Commission
must prove scienter, intent to deceive, reliance and causation in order
to establish violations of Rule 101-5 and that Section 16 of the 1934
Act is the only limitation on insider trading.
It held that under Rule
101-5 "an insider's liability for failure to disclose material information
which he uses for his own advantage in the purchase of securities
extends to purchases made on national securities exchanges as well as
to purchases in 'face-to-face' transactions."
The court further ruled
that "insiders subject to the disclosure requirements of Section 10 (b)
and Rule 101-5 may include employees as well as officers, directors, and
controlling stockholders who are in possession of material undisclosed
information obtained in the course of their employment."

On the basis of these legal rulings the court found violations by the
two individual defendants who purchased Texas Gulf securities on
April 15, and April 16, 1964. It rejected their contentions that they
were free to trade merely because rumors about the discovery were
current in the press and financial circles, an article emanating from the
corporation had appeared in a trade publication of limited circulation
and an official of the Canadian government had issued a statement of
undetermined circulation.
It referred to the press release by the
corporation as the "official announcement."
Contrary to the position urged by the Commission, the court held
that other insiders who purchased stock and gave tips on April 16, 1964,
did not commit violations, stating that insiders are free to trade on
the basis of inside information once this information has been delivered
to the news media, even though it has not appeared anywhere. The
court also decided that purchases of stock and calls and the giving of
tips by insiders prior to April 9 did not violate Rule 101-5 because
the results of the mineral exploration did not constitute material facts
at that time. The court agreed with the Commission that corporate
officials responsible for the issuance of stock options are entitled to
rely on the information furnished to them by management.
It concluded that a member of the higher echelon of management who
accepts a stock option without disclosing to the responsible officers
all material information violates Section 10 (b) and Rule 101-5, but
that employees who are not members of the higher echelon are entitled
to assume that information already known to their superiors will be
reported by them to the appropriate corporate officials.
In clearing the corporation of charges of violation the court ruled
that a press release issued by a corporation is issued "in connection
with the purchase or sale of any security" and, therefore, comes within
Section 10 (b) and Rule 101-5 only "if its purpose is to affect the
market price of a company's stock to the advantage of the company or
its insiders."
It found no such purpose in this case. Alternatively,
the court held that the accuracy of the press release must be judged
only on the basis of information actually known to the drafters of the
release at the time of its issuance, and that on the basis of such information the release in this case was not false or misleading.
The Commission has appealed.
In 8E.0.
v. Georgia-Pacific Oorporationr the defendants consented to the entry of a decree enjoining them from violating Section
10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 101-5 and 101-6 thereunder.
Georgia-Pacific had entered into agreements to purchase the assets or
stock of several corporations through the issuance of Georgia-Pacific

stock. The agreements provided that the acquisition price would depend in part on the future price of Georgia-Pacific stock on the New
York Stock Exchange during certain periods which were to be determined by Georgia-Pacific itself. The Commission's complaint
alleged that certain officers and an employee of Georgia-Pacific had
caused the employee pension funds to purchase Georgia-Pacific stock
on the Exchange for the purpose of raising the price of the stock and
resulting in the issuance of fewer shares by Georgia-Pacific.
The
consent decree set forth restrictions on future purchases of GeorgiaPacific stock by the company and its pension funds, including a
prohibition on such purchases during any valuation period or within
a 10-day period prior thereto.
In S.E.O. v. Skagit Valley Telephone 00., et al.,I° the Commission
charged certain officials of the company with violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities acts in connection with the purchase
and sale of the company's securities. The complaint alleged that these
officials purchased shares from stockholders at prices of $5 and $10
per share without disclosing the true value of the stock and the offers
that had been made for the stock, and thereafter sold such shares
at $300 per share. The Commission also charged the company which
purchased the stock at $300 from the officials and from other stockholders with violations of the anti-fraud provisions for conspiring
with the other defendants to conceal the fact that others were willing
to pay even more than $300 per share. In addition to consenting to
the issuance of decrees enjoining future violations, the defendants filed
undertakings with the court as a result of which approximately
$400,000 was deposited in a fund to be distributed to the defrauded
stockholders.
In S.E.O. v, VTR, Ino., et al.,l1 the Commission charged that a
group of defendants controlling VTR had misappropriated company
funds to finance their own personal investment ventures and had concealed their misappropriations through false annual reports and proxy
statements.
The Commission sought injunctive relief and the appointment of a receiver. The defendants consented to a permanent injunction requiring them to make an accounting and restitution for their
unauthorized withdrawals and enjoining them from further violations
of the reporting and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities .Act of 1933
and the Securities Exchange .Act of 1934. In lieu of appointing a
receiver, the court directed the controlling group to cause the election
of four independent directors (of a five-man board) designated by the
court to supervise the filing of proper annual reports and proxy state" w,

ments with the Commission and to supervise a determination of the
exact amount misappropriated.
Pursuant to the consent judgment,
the defendants were ordered to make restitution of more than $1.2
million. Restitution has been made of all but about $70,000,for which
a note has been given.
A significant aspect of this case was the court's determination that
jurisdiction under the Securities Act over a foreign business entity
and a resident foreign national could be acquired by personal service
of the summons and complaint in West Germany. This was the first
opinion dealing with this question. The defendants had argued that
such service was ineffective and that as foreign nationals they should
not be subject to United States courts, since" 'physical power' is the
sine qua non of jurisdiction."
The court stated:
"Here there clearly was business transacted by the defendants
in this state. Further, the SEC rules which protect both foreign
and domestic investors who trade on our national exchanges could
be evaded at will if injunctions could not be had against foreign
based brokers and individuals who trade in large volume on such
exchanges."
In S.E.O. v. Seaboard Securities Oorporation,12 the court enjoined
the defendant securities dealer and its president, Leon Nash, from
charging their customers prices not reasonably related to the prevailing market prices with respect to any securities, not merely the two
securities referred to in the complaint. In granting the Commission's
request for a broad injunction, the court stated
"Having observed the defendant Nash, and having heard his
insistence that the statutory and regulatory prohibitions are intolerable, we think it insufficient to enjoin repetitions of the
forbidden actions only with respect to the two particular stocks
in question . •
 . ."
In SE.O. v. S &: P National Corporation; et 01.,18 the Commission
alleged (1) that the corporate defendants have been unregistered investment companies for many years and have transacted business in
violation of the Investment Company Act of 1940, (2) that reports
filed by S & P National Corporation pursuant to the requirements or
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were false and misleading in
failing to state that David M. Milton, one of the individual defendants,
was a parent or director of S & P and in stating that certain persons,

who had resigned or abandoned their offices,were directors of S & P 14
and (3) that the individual defendants had been derelict in permitting
or causing the above violations. Upon motion of the Commission, preliminary injunctions were granted restraining the coporate defendants
in the operation of their business as investment companies, and a
receiver-trustee for the corporations was appointed.
In affirming the above orders, the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit stated that although the Securities Exchange Act does not
expressly provide for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, such
an appointment may be made under that Act by virtue of the court's
equitable powers, as well as under the Investment Company Act,
which provides for the appointment of a trustee, to "bring the companies into compliance with the law, 'ascertain the true state of affairs
. . . and report thereon' to the court and public shareholders and preserve the corporate assets." The court also held that if a company
initially met and presently meets the assets test established by the
Investment Company Act, then it has been, over the intervening years,
an investment company subject to the Act even though it might not
have met that test in every one of those years.
In S.E.O. v. Wong,I5 the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico denied motions to dismiss by the defendants.
The court rejected the argument that the change in the status of Puerto
Rico (in 1952) from a territory of the United States to a Commonwealth deprived the court of jurisdiction over violations of the Federal securities laws. The court also ruled that under Section 36 of
the Investment Company Act, providing for injunctive action for
gross abuse of trust against "a person serving or acting" as an officer
or director of a rep-stered investment company, an action may be
brought against a former officer or director who had resigned prior to
institution of the action, The court stated that the quoted phrase referred to the defendant's capacity at the time the abuse of trust occurred. It further ruled that in an action under Section 36 or under
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may seek as
ancillary relief restitution and an accounting, since the prayer for injunctive relief invokes the full equitable powers of the court.

of tables for the use of attorneys, accountants and others engaged in
preparing income tax returns. The court held that the offer or sale of
these securities, although limited to the issuer's subscribers and to the
members of a local bar association, did not meet the requirements for
a private offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act.
It stated that neither an offeree's position asa subscriber nor the general acumen of attorneys in tax matters has any bearing on their access
to the kind of information which registration would make available
and that "obviously, familiarity with the issuer's publications would
not connote familiarity with the issuer's financial status."
Decisions of the Commission dismissing applications for review of
disciplinary 'action taken by the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. (NASD) were upheld in Merritt, Vickers, Inc. v. S.E.O,17
and Handley Investment Oompany v. S.E.O.18 In the Merritt,
Vickers case, the NASD had found that the firm and its principals
violated NASD rules by selling securities at prices not reasonably related to the current market; improperly extending credit; failing to
maintain required books and records; and failing to disclose the firm's
dual agency role and double commissions received. Rejecting the contention that the NASD improperly relied on the ''pink sheets" in assessing the fairness of mark-ups, the court agreed with the Commission
that "although the quotations in the sheets are not firm offers for a
fixed number of securities, and final prices are subject to change, they
constitute sufficient proof of prevailing market prices 'in the absence
of evidence to the contrary'."
Petitioners urged that the Commission should have permitted them
to adduce additional evidence bearing on the fairness of the mark-ups,
claiming that they did not request production of such evidence in the
hearings before the NASD because it would have been futile in view
of the NASD's lack of subpoena power. The court found the argument "not persuasive," stating that "there is nothing in the record to
demonstrate that process would have been required to obtain the desired information. Mere speculation cannot serve as an excuse for
failure to produce relevant evidence before the NASD."
In the Handley case, the court rejected the argument that the
NASD's disciplinary proceedings were akin to criminal proceedings
and that violations had to be established by convincing evidence overcoming a presumption of innocence. The court indicated that the
NASD and Commission should have wide latitude in establishing professional standards, stating,

"Absent constitutional or statutory infirmities, none of which
appear here, the professional standards established by NASD
and SEC for those engaging in over-the-counter securities business will not be upset by the courts. Petitioner failed to abide
by those standards. The disciplinary action was not excessive,
oppressive, or an a:buseof discretion."

In M. G. Davis & 00., 1M. v. Oohen,I9 the court granted the Commission's motion for summary judgment dismissing an action to enjoin
the Commission from continuing a public proceeding instituted to
determine whether the broker-dealer registration of the corporate
plaintiff should be revoked and whether corresponding sanctions
should be imposed against the individual plaintiffs. In considering
the question of its jurisdiction to entertain an action for injunctive
relief against the Commission prior to exhaustion of administrative
remedies the court stated:
"... a District Court under its general federal question equity
jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. ~
1331, is empowered to correct agency
conduct 'in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to specific
prohibition of the Act' ....
The test to be applied in determining
whether this 'narrow' exception to the customary avenues of review may be invoked ... is 'whether the Commission has stepped
plainly beyond the bounds of its statutory authority, or has acted
in clear defiance of [plaintiffs'] constitutional rights to [their]
irreparable damage'."
The opinion also provides an important interpretation of Section
15(b) (7) of the Exchange Act, which was part of the 1964 amendments to that Act. It held that the provisions of that Section, permitting censure, barring, or suspension of any person, may be applied
with respect to statutory violations which occurred prior to the enactment of the provision. Plaintiffs had argued against such a "retroactive" application, but the court observed that "the amendment simply
provides the Commission with a procedural device for accomplishing
the same enforcement objectives which could formerly be achieved
only circuitously," and ruled that "salesmen who have committed
securities violations in the past could with justification be excluded or
suspended from a profession demanding the utmost in probity from its
members."

accept for filing a purported registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 which was "totally frivolous" and "obviously not a
bona fide attempt to qualify to sell securities to the investing public."
Two cases challenging the validity of the Commission's action under
its Rules Relating to Investigations were concluded this year. In
Oommerclai Oapital Oorporation v. B.E.O.,22 the Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit held that a denial by the Commission, pursuant to Rule 6 of those rules, of a witness' request to purchase
copies of the transcript of his testimony in a private investigation did
not deprive the witness of due process and that "the sale or the withholding of copies of the transcript was within the sound discretion"
of the Commission. The court stated that the legislative history of
the Administrative Procedure Act shows that Congress was aware
that investigations of the Commission, like those of a grand jury,
might -be thwarted if witnesses were able to obtain copies of their
investigative transcripts.
Suspected violators, if in possession of
such transcripts, would be able to tailor their own testimony to that
given by other witnesses or take economic or other reprisals against
those who were about to testify. Accordingly, the court found that
Congress had given agencies authority to deny for good cause a witness' request for a transcript of his testimony in a nonpublic investigation. In the course of its opinion, the court also questioned
whether Congress intended a direct court review of orders entered
by the Commission in the course of a non-public investigation.
In B.E.C. v. Higashi,28 the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
held that a district court could properly condition enforcement of a
subpoena issued in a private Commission investigation upon the Commission's permitting a director of the corporation to be accompanied
and represented by the attorney for the corporation, despite the fact
that the sequestration provisions of Rule 7 (b) of the Commission's
Rules Relating to Investigations had been invoked. While stating
that "the reason for and -
purpose of the Commission's rule are clear
and there can be no question as to its necessity and general propriety,"
the court held that in this case the interests of the director were
"directly and prejudicially" affected by his not being able to use the
corporation's attorney and, accordingly, that invocation of the sequestration rule exceeded the discretion of the Commission.
In a companion subpoena enforcement action, Jenks v. B.E.C.,:' the
court of appeals rejected the defense of harassment advanced by

was not of the witness but of the subjects of the investigation .

COMMISSION

The Commission has successfully defended its administrative investigatory subpoenas in court proceedings to quash them. In
Fountaine v. S.E.O.25 and S.E.O. v, lsbrandtsen,26 recalcitrant witnesses attempted to have such subpoenas declared to be of no effect.
The decisions in these cases, based upon the Supreme Court's ruling
in Reisman v. Oaplin,27 make it clear that since a witness is not subject
to penalties in advance of judicial enforcement proceedings, the subpoenas may not be challenged prior to such proceedings. The Commission therefore retains the right to decide whether or not court
proceedings reviewing and enforcing its subpoena should be
instituted.
The Commission participated as amicus curiae this year in several
cases relating to the applicability of the "short-swing" recovery provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to
transactions by insiders involving conversions of senior securities. In
Heli-Ooil Oorp. v. Webster,28 described in the last Annual Report,"
convertible debentures were converted into common stock by an insider
within 6 months after he had purchased the debentures. He then sold
the common stock within 6 months after the conversion. The Court
of Appeals for the Third Circuit, agreeing with the views expressed
by the Commission as amicus curiae, held, in an en bane decision, that
the conversion of the debentures into common stock constituted a sale
of the debentures and a purchase of the common stock within the
meaning of Section 16(b), that the stock acquired upon conversion
was not exempt from Section 16(b) as a security "acquired in good
:faith in connection with a debt previously contracted," and that the
conversion was not exempt from Section 16(b) as an arbitrage transaction, but that no profit was realized from the disposition of the debentures upon conversion. Accordingly, the court held that recovery
should be limited to the profits realized from the sale of the common
stock.
In Blau v, Lamb,30 the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, disagreeing with the decision in Heli-Ooil, held that a conversion of preferred stock into common was not a sale of the preferred within the
meaning of Section 16(b) . The court also held, inter alia, (1) that
an acquisition of stock by a corporation wholly owned or controlled by
an individual from another corporation 97-percent owned or controlled
by him is not a purchase within the meaning of Section 16(b) and (2)

that when transactions which precede a stock dividend or stock split
are to be matched against transactions which follow it, there must be
a proportionate adjustment in the price of the shares involved in the
earlier transactions in order to determine the true measure of the
profit realized. The court's holdings on the latter two points were in
accord with the views expressed by the Commission as amicus curiae.
With respect to the conversion question, however, the Commission had
urged that although, in its view, no profit was realized from the disposition of the preferred stock upon conversion, the conversion nevertheless constituted a sale of the preferred within the meaning of Section 16(b).
In Blass v, Oppenheim,3! the court adopted the view urged by the
Commission as amicus curiae that a plaintiff who purchased shares in
a corporation whose wholly-owned subsidiary had acquired all the
assets and by merger succeeded to the business of the issuer in whose
securities the Short-swing trading occurred was entitled to sue under
Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act to recover the short-swing profits. The
court held that there is "no support for the defendant's position that
Congress intended that suits for the recovery of short-swing profits
be restricted to the initial issuer whose securities were the subject of
the illicit gains and its security holders, thus leaving no remedy in
those instances where, as here, the issuer by a transfer of all its assets
to another corporation has become extinct and is without its original
security holders."
The case of S.E.O. v. Golconda Mining 00. and Harry F. MarJ1l!Ur
son 32 had been instituted by the Commission in the Southern District
of New York. The defendants moved to transfer the action to the
District of Idaho, but the district court, agreeing with the contentions
of the Commission, denied the motion. The court of appeals 33 held
that a petition for a writ of mandamus rather than for leave to appeal
was the appropriate procedure for review of such an order but declined to grant the writ in this case since there had been "no clear-cut
abuse of discretion."
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

The statutes administered by the Commission provide that the Commission may transmit evidence of violations of any provisions of these
statutes to the Attorney General, who in turn may institute criminal
proceedings. Where an investigation by the Commission's staff indicates that criminal prosecution is warranted, a detailed report is prepared. After careful review by the General Counsel's Office,the report

and the General Counsel's recommendations are considered by the
Commission, and if the Commission believes criminal proceedings are
warranted the case is referred to the Attorney General and to the
appropriate U.S. Attorney.
Commission employees familiar with
the case generally assist the U.S. Attorney in the presentation of the
facts to the grand jury, the preparation of legal memoranda for use in
the trial, the conduct of the trial, and the preparation of briefs on
appeal.
During the past fiscal year 44 cases were referred to the Department
of Justice for prosecution.
As a result of these and prior referrals, 50
indictments were returned against 193 defendants and 16 defendants
were convicted in 39 cases. Convictions of 17 defendants were affirmed
in 11 cases and appeals were still pending in 9 other criminal cases at
the close of the fiscal year. Of 10 defendants in 7 contempt cases pending during the year, 4 defendants were convicted and 5 cases involving
6 defendants were still pending.
As in prior years, the majority of criminal cases prosecuted involved
the offer and sale of securities by fraudulent representations and other
fraudulent practices. It is obviously not feasible to describe individually each of the many criminal matters pending or decided during
the fiscal year; only a few of the more noteworthy ones can be singled
out for discussion.
The conviction of Daniel E. Armel and others by a jury in the
Southern District of Ohio culminated the Commission's investigation
of the corporate "empire" of Armel. The fraudulent offer and sale of
securities of the numerous corporations which made up the "empire"
resulted in the loss of over 9 million dollars to investors. Two of the
defendants convicted, Donald Hathaway and Jack Singleton, were
certified public accountants who actively assisted Armel in perpetrating this fraud. Armel, the chief architect of the fraudulent
promotion, received a sentence of 15 years imprisonment.
The Commission continued its enforcement of the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 with the prosecution of criminal violations of these requirements not accompanied by
charges of fraud. Herman Shaw and The Aquafilter Corporation, of
which Shaw was president and controlling stockholder, were indicted
in the Southern District of N ew York for violating Section 5 in the
offer and sale of unregistered securities of Aquafilter.
William F.
Kane and Myron Freudberg were indicted in the same district for
violating Section 5 in the offer and sale of unregistered securities of
American Dryer Corporation.
Shaw and Aquafilter pleaded guilty,
and Shaw was sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment, fined $3,000 and
placed on probation for 1 year, while the corporation was fined $12,500.
Kane and Freudberg are awaiting trial.

. THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT

The Commission's investigation of the sale of American Bonded
Mortgage Company, Inc. securities culminated in the indictment of
Mark H. Kroll, William Cahn and six other persons in the Southern
District of Florida, for the fraudulent sale of various securities of this
company and its affiiliates. The indictment charged the defendants
with devising and employing a fraudulent scheme to distribute notes
purportedly "guaranteed" by mortgages on owner-occupied homes.
This case is the latest in the Commission's continued effort to combat
new variations of the old "Ponzi" scheme whereby investors are paid
purported "interest" at very high rates with their investments "guaranteed" by alleged valuable collateral. The so-called interest is in
fact paid with funds obtained from other investors.
Near the close of the fiscal year, an indictment was returned by a
Federal Grand Jury in Indianapolis charging 23 individuals and 6
corporations with defrauding investors in securities of Air and Space
Underwriters, Inc. The indictment also charged The Indiana Investor and Business News, Inc. and its editor, Van C. Vollmer, with
publishing and causing the publication of newspaper articles which,
though not purporting to offer the securities of Air and Space Underwriters, Inc., described these securities for a consideration without
disclosing the receipt of such consideration.
During the year the first criminal action for violations of Section
37 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 was prosecuted. The case
is further discussed at p. 101, supra.
One of the more important appellate decisions rendered during the
year was that of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in
United States v. Abrams." In affirming the convictions of Joseph
Abrams and Sydney Albert for violating and conspiring to violate the
registration provisions of the Securities Act in the distribution of their
shares of Automatic Washer Company, the court found that there was
more than sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that
Abrams utilized nominee accounts as conduits for the subsequent distribution of these securities. The court also found that the evidence
presented a question for the jury to determine whether Albert, in
placing his Automatic stock with various banks as collateral for the
repayment of loans, intended not to repay the loans and to have the
stock distributed without registration.
The affirmance of these convictions should serve as a warning to unscrupulous promoters that they
cannot evade the registration requirements of the Securities Act by
spurious reliance on exemptions from those requirements .

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

Each of the Acts administered by the Commission specifically authorizes investigations to determine whether violations of the Federal
securities laws have occurred.
The nine regional officesof the Commission, with the assistance of
their respective branch offices, are chiefly responsible for the conduct
of investigations. In addition, the Office of Enforcement of the Division of Trading and Markets of the Commission's headquarters office
conducts investigations dealing with matters of particular interest or
urgency, either independently or assisting the regional offices. The
Office of Enforcement also exercises general supervision over and
coordinates the investigative activities of the regional officesand recommends appropriate action to the Commission.
There are available to the Commission several sources of information concerning possible violations of the Federal securities laws.
The primary source of information is complaints by members of the
general public concerning the activities of certain persons in securities
transactions. The Commission's staff gives careful consideration to
such complaints and, if it appears that violations may have occurred,
an investigation is commenced. Other sources of information which
are of assistance to the Commission in carrying out its enforcement
responsibilities are the national securities exchanges, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., brokerage firms, state and Canadian securities authorities, better business bureaus, and various law enforcement agencies.
It is the Commission's general policy to conduct its investigations
on a confidential basis. Such a policy is necessary to effective law enforcement and to protect persons against whom unfounded or unconfirmed charges might be made. The Commission investigates many
complaints where no violation is ultimately found to have occurred.
To conduct such investigations publicly would ordinarily result in
hardship or embarrassment to many interested persons and might
affect the market for the securities in question, resulting in injury to
investors with no countervailing public benefits. Moreover, members
of the public would tend to be reluctant to furnish information concerning violations if they thought their personal affairs would be made
public. Another advantage of confidential investigations is that persons suspected of violations are not made aware that their activities are
under surveillance, since such awareness might result in frustration or
obstruction of the investigation. Accordingly, the Commission does
not generally divulge the result of a non-public investigation unless it
is made a matter of public record in proceedings brought before the
Commission or in the courts.

TIDRTY-SECOND

127

ANNUAL REPORT

When it appears that a serious violation of the Federal securities
laws has occurred or is occurring, a "case" is opened and a full investigation is conducted. Under certain circumstances it becomes necessary for the Commission to issue a formal order of investigation which
appoints members of its staff as officers to issue subpoenas, to take
testimony under oath and to require the production of documents.
Usually this procedure is resorted to only when the subjects of the investigation and others involved are uncooperative and it becomes necessary to invoke the subpoena power to complete the investigation.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1966, the Commission issued 136
such :formal orders.
When an investigation has reached the stage at which enforcement
action appears appropriate, the Commission may proceed in one of
several ways, although the use of one procedure may not necessarily
preclude the use of another. The Commission may: (1) refer the
case to the Department of Justice or appropriate local enforcement
authorities for criminal prosecution, (2) institute through its own
staff, in the appropriate U.S. district court, civil proceedings for injunctive relief to halt further violations of law, and, (3) institute administrative proceedings if the case is one where it has the power to
do so.

activities of the Commission during fiscal 1966:

sscuamss

In recent years the volume of unlawful Canadian promotions
reaching into the United States has declined sharply from the 1950's
when Montreal and Toronto "boiler-rooms" were conducting extensive
high-pressure mail and telephone stock-selling campaigns into the
United States. The decline is due primarily to the increased cooperation and liaison with the Commission by the Ontario and Quebec
Securities Commissions and quasi-official regulatory bodies such as
the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Broker-Dealers' Association
of Ontario. In .fiscal 1966 the unlawful offer and sale of Canadian
securities in the United States remained at a low level.
As a result of an investigation of Windfall Oils and Mines Limited
by an Ontario Royal Commission, in which this Commission assisted,

several persons, including the promoters of Windfall, were charged
with criminal violations.
The Commission has also assisted the
Ontario Royal Commission on Atlantic Acceptance Corporation
Limited in its investigation into the circumstances surrounding the
downfall in June 1965 of Atlantic Acceptance, a large Canadian
finance company. A member of this Commission's staff has testified
at public hearings of the Royal Commission. That commission was
appointed in the wake of Atlantic's financial collapse, which has had
substantial repercussions in both Canada and the United States and
caused substantial losses to certain United States institutional investors. Criminal charges have already been brought in Ontario against
several persons.
The Commission continued to be confronted by unlawful promotions
from the Bahamas, particularly those involving unregistered time
deposit certificates issued by so-called "banks" chartered there. Following the Commission's issuance of a public warning release •
 and the
obtaining of injunctive relief against a Bahamian bank, '" the Bahamas
passed new banking legislation designed to prevent the issuance of
unregistered securities by Bahamian banks, and to reduce sharply
the number of 'bank charters available. As a result of such legislation,
there has been a noticeable reduction in unlawful offers and sales of
unregistered Bahamian hank securities in the United States.
In dealing with fraudulent promotions from the Bahamas, Jamaica,
Brazil and elsewhere, the Commission is continuing to benefit from the
new, simplified procedures for obtaining foreign postal fraud orders.
The Post Office Department
has cooperated fully with the
Commission's program.
During the year the Commission maintained its Foreign Restricted
List, consisting of foreign companies whose securities the Commission
had reason to believe were being, or recently had been, distributed
in the United States in violation of the registration requirements of
the Securities Act of 1933. As of June 30, 1966, 73 companies were
on the list. Continuing the trend of recent years, it was necessary
to add only 2 Canadian companies to the list during the year, while
53 others were deleted following compliance with esta:blished procedures. The names of 15 Bahamian companies, 1 Panamanian company and 1 company whose place of incorporation has not been
ascertained were added to the list. The current list and supplements
thereto are issued to and published by the press, and copies are mailed
to all registered broker-dealers and are made available to the public.

SECTION OF SECURITIES VIOLATIONS

A Section of Securities Violations is maintained by the Commission
as a part of its enforcement program to provide a further means of
detecting and preventing fraud in securities transactions. The Section maintains files which provide a clearinghouse for other enforcement agencies for information concerning persons who have been
charged with or found in violation of various Federal and state
securities statutes. Considerable information is also available concerning Canadian violators. The specialized information in these
files is kept current through the cooperation of various governmental
and nongovermental agencies. At the end of the fiscal year, the files
contained information concerning 73,511 persons and firms. Included in the data processed by the Section during the year was information received from several states and Canada respecting 106 criminal actions, 45 injunctive actions, 246 cease and desist type orders
and 116 other administrative orders, such as denials, suspensions and
revocations.
During the fiscal year, the Section received and disposed of 3,180
"securities violations" letters and dispatched 1,634 communications to
cooperating agencies. It added to the Commission's files information
respecting 5,431 persons or firms, including information on 2,028 persons or firms not previously identified.
APPLICATIONS FOR NONDISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

The Commission is authorized under the various Acts administered
by it to grant requests for nondisclosure of certain types of information which would otherwise be disclosed to the public in applications,
reports or other documents filed pursuant to these statutes. Thus,
under paragraph (30) of Schedule A of the Securities Act of 1933,
disclosure of any portion of a material contract is not required if the
Commission determines that such disclosure would impair the value of
the contract and is not necessary for the protection of investors. Under Section 24 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trade secrets
or processes need not be disclosed in any material filed with the Commission. Under Section 24 (b) of that Act, written objection to public
disclosure of information contained in any material filed with the
Commission may be made to the Commission which is then authorized
to make public disclosure of such information only if in its judgment
such disclosure is in the public interest. Similar provisions are con-

REPORT

tained in Section 22 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 and in Section 45 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. These
statutory provisions have been implemented by rules specifying the
procedure to be followed by applicants for a determination that public
disclosure is not necessary in a particular case.

OF THE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

The several Acts administered by the Commission recognize the
importance of dependable informative financial statements which disclose the financial status and earnings history of a corporation or other
commercial entity. These statements, whether filed in compliance with
the requirements under those statutes or included in other material
available to stockholders or prospective investors, are indispensable to
investors as a basis for investment decisions. The Congress, cognizant
of the fact that such statements lend themselves readily to misleading
inferences or even deception, whether or not intended, included express
provisions in the various Acts with respect to financial information
required to be disclosed. Thus, for example, the Securities Act
requires the inclusion in the prospectus of balance sheets and profit and
loss statements "in such form as the Commission shall prescribe" 38 and
authorizes the Commission to prescribe the "items or details to be
shown in the balance sheet and earnings statement, and the methods
to be followed in the preparation of accounts .... " 39 Similar
authority is contained inthe Securities Exchange Act,40 and even more
comprehensive power is embodied in the Investment Company Act 41
and the Public Utility Holding Company Act,42

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

Pursuant to the broad rulemaking power thus conferred with respect
to the preparation and presentation of financial statements, the Commission has prescribed uniform systems of accounts for companies
subject to the Holding Company Act; 43 has adopted rules under the
Securities Exchange Act governing accounting for and auditing of
securities brokers and dealers; 44 and has promulgated rules contained
in a single comprehensive regulation, identified as Regulation S-X,45
which governs the form and content of financial statements filed in
compliance with the several Acts, This regulation is supplemented
by the Commission's Accounting Series Releases, of which 104 had
been issued as of the end of the fiscal year. These releases were
inaugurated in 1937 and were designed as a program for making
public from time to time opinions on accounting principles for the
purpose of contributing to the development of uniform standards
and practice in major accounting questions. The rules and regulations thus established, except for the uniform systems of accounts
which are regulatory reports, prescribe accounting principles to be
followed only in certain limited areas. In the large area of financial
reporting not covered by such rules, the Commission's principal means
of protecting investors from inadequate financial reporting, fraudulent
practices and overreaching by management is by requiring a certificate of an independent public accountant, based on an audit performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
which expresses an opinion as to whether the financial statements are
presented fairly in conformity with accounting principles and practices which are recognized as sound and which have attained general
acceptance.
The Securities Act provides that the financial statements required
to be made available to the public through filing with the Commission
shall be certified by "an independent public or certified accountant." 46
The other three statutes permit the Commission to require that such
statements be accompanied by a certificate of an independent public
aoconntant," and the Commission's rules require, with minor excep.. Uniform System of Accounts for Mutual Service Companies and Subsidiary
Service Companies (effective August 1, 1936) ; Uniform System of Accounts for

tions, that they be so certified. The value of certification by qualified
accountants has been conceded for many years, but the requirement as
to independence, long recognized and adhered to by some individual
accountants, was for the first time authoritatively and explicitly introduced into law in 1933. Under the Commission's rules, an accountant
who is qualified to practice in his own state is qualified to practice before the Commission unless he has entered into disqualifying relationships with a particular
client, such as becoming a promoter,
underwriter,
voting trustee, director, officer, employee, or stockholder; 48 has demonstrated incompetence or subservience to management; or has engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct."
The Commission endeavors to encourage and foster the independence
of the accountant in his relationships with his client so that he may
better be able to perform the service to the public contemplated by the
Congress in the various Acts administered by the Commission. Because of his special status and responsibility, the accountant has a
unique opportunity to be a leader in raising standards of investor protection. The financial statements provide the key information both
in the distribution and trading of securities. The work of the accountant in their preparation and publication is vital. Independent
accountants lend authority to management's representations by their
opinions as experts, and they operate as a check on management in
assuring that the financial data are fairly presented in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.
The Commission is vigilant in its efforts to assure itself that the
audits which it requires are performed by independent accountants;
that the information contained in the financial reports represents full
and fair disclosure; and that appropriate auditing and accounting
practices and standards have been followed in their preparation.
In
addition, it recognizes that changes and new developments in financial
and economic conditions affect the operations and financial status of
the several thousand commercial and industrial companies required
to file statements with the Commission and that accounting and auditing procedures cannot remain static and continue to serve well a dynamic economy. The Commission's accounting staff, therefore, studies
the changes and new developments for the purpose of establishing and
maintaining appropriate accounting and auditing policies, procedures
and practices for the protection of investors. The primary responsibility for this program rests with the Chief Accountant of the Commission, who has general supervision with respect to accounting and
auditing policies and their application .
.. See, for example, Rule 2--01 of Regulation S-X •
.. see Rule 2(e) of Rules of Practice.

134

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Progress in these activities requires continuing contact and consultation between the staff and outside accountants both individually and
through such representative groups as, among others, the American
Accounting Association, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, the American Petroleum Institute, the Financial Analysts Federation, the Financial Executives Institute, and the National
Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, as well as many
Government agencies. Recognizing the importance of cooperation in
the formulation of accounting principles and practices, adequate disclosure and auditing procedures which will best serve the interests of
investors, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the
Financial Analysts Federation, and the Financial Executives Institute
appoint committees which maintain liaison with the Commission's
staff.
In recent years the Accounting Principles Board of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants has performed a vital function in this area. The work of the Board is reflected in accounting
research studies and opinions for the guidance of the profession.
Drafts of these studies are referred to the Commission's accounting
staff for review and comment prior to publication.
The many daily decisions to be made which require the attention of
members of the Chief Accountant's staff include questions raised by the
operating divisions of the Commission, the regional offices, and the
Commission itself. As a result of this day-to-day activity and the need
to keep abreast of current accounting problems, the Chief Accountant's
staff continually reexamines accounting and auditing principles and
practices. From time to time members of the staff are called upon to
assist in field investigations, to participate in hearings and to review
Commission opinions insofar as they pertain to accounting matters.
Prefiling and other conferences with officials of corporations,
practicing accountants and others are also an important part of the
work of the staff. Resolution of questions and problems in this manner
saves registrants and their representatives both time and expense. The
1964 amendments to the securities acts have brought many heretofore
"unregulated" companies into contact with the Commission. In many
cases, the independent accountants certifying the financial statements
of such companies have been a primary bridge between the companies
and the Commission. These companies and the accountants have
also been assisted by members of the Commission and of its staff who
have lectured and participated in institutes and symposiums sponsored
by various groups in different parts of the country where the 1964
amendments have been explained.
Many specific accounting and auditing problems are found in the
examination of financial statements required to be filed with the Com-

TEURTY-SECOND~AL

REPORT

135

mission. Where examination reveals that the rules and regulations of
the Commission have not boon complied with or that applicable generally accepted accounting principles have not been adhered to, the
examining division usually notifies the registrant by an informal letter
of comment. These letters of comment and the correspondence or conferences that follow continue to be a most convenient and satisfactory
method of effecting corrections and improvements in financial statements, both to registrants and to the Commission's staff. Where particularly difficult or novel questions arise which cannot be settled by
the accounting staff of the divisions and by the Chief Accountant, they
are referred to the Commission for consideration and decision.
The increasing use by many companies of installment sales and
similar credit practices and the significance of the increasing amounts
of the related deferred income taxes involved caused the Commission
to state its opinion as to the proper reporting to be followed with
respect to such deferred income taxes. 50 The opinion states that where
installment receivables are classified as current assets in accordance
with the operating cycle practice, the related liabilities or credit items
maturing or expiring in the time period of the operating cycle, including the deferred income taxes on installment sales, should be classified
as current liabilities.
Installment receivables not realizable within
1 year and the related deferred income taxes may be classified consistently as noncurrent items. In financial statements filed with the
Commission for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 1965,
assets and liabilities entering into the operating cycle must be classified
consistently as current or noncurrent items. In addition, appropriate
disclosure of the classification followed and amounts involved should
be made.
During the year a review was made of the accountants' certificates
filed under paragraph (a) (5) of Rule 206(4)-2 under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, which requires that at least once a year an independent public accountant verify by actual examination all funds and
securities of clients held by an investment adviser. This review
showed that there was a wide variation in the scope of the examinations made and in the content of the accountants' certificates. Accordingly, the Commission issued an accounting series release 51 describing the nature of the examination to be made and the content
of the accountant's certificate.
Comments received with respect to the proposed revision of Form
.. Accounting Series Release No. 102 (December 7, 1965). See also Accounting

SECURITIES AND EXCItANGE COMMISSION

X-17A-5,52 the annual report of financial condition required to be filed
by brokers and dealers pursuant to Section 17 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, were under review during the fiscal year.
On the basis of information obtained in a non-public investigation
conducted during the fiscal year, the Commission had reason to believe
that there may have been a lack of adherence to auditing standards
by a certified public accountant in connection with the preparation
and submission of certain material to the Commission. As a conclusion to the investigation the Commission issued an order accepting the accountant's resignation from practice before the Commission. 53
Shortly after the close of the fiscal year the Commission issued
its order accepting the withdrawal from practice before the Commission of Homer E. Kerlin, a certified public accountant. 54 Proceedings
had been instituted pursuant to Rule 2 (e) of the Commission's Rules
of Practice to determine whether Kerlin, an accounting firm of which
he had been a partner, and the senior partner of such firm, had engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct in connection
with the preparation and certification of financial statements of the
Olen Company, Inc. and its successor, the Olen Division of H. L.
Green Company, Inc., in 1958 and 1959. Subsequent to the institution
of such proceedings, the partnership was dissolved and the senior
partner died. The remaining respondent, Kerlin, without admitting
the allegations against him, agreed that he would not appear or practice before the Commission in the future, with the understanding
that the proceedings would be dismissed as to him and that the Commission might issue a statement with respect to its action. Concurrently with its order accepting Kerlin's withdrawal and dismissing
the proceedings, the Commission released a report of the staff's investigation, on the basis of which the staff had concluded that the conduct of the accounting firm in its audit of the Olen accounts, books
and records represented a complete abdication of the responsibilities
of an independent public accountant.

securities as the Commission determines to be appropriate in view of
the special character of the Bank and its operations, and necessary in
the public interest or for the protection of investors. The Commission has, pursuant to the above authority, adopted rules requiring the
Bank to file quartely reports and also to file copies of each annual report of the Bank to its board of governors. The Bank is also required
to file reports with the Commission in advance of any distribution in
the United States of its primary obligations. The Commission, acting
in consultation with the National Advisory Council on International
Monetary and Financial Problems, is authorized to suspend the exemption at any time as to any or all securities issued or guaranteed
by the Bank during the period of such suspension.
The Bank reported a net income of $143.7 million for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1966. This compared with net earnings of $136.9
million in the fiscal year 1965.
On July 28, 1966, the Executive Directors allocated $67.8 million
from the year's net income to the Supplemental Reserve against losses
on loans and guarantees, increasing it to $731.6 million. This raised
the Bank's total reserves, including the Special Reserve, to $1,021.4
million. . The Executive Directors recommended to the Board of
Governors that $75 million of the year's earnings be transferred to
the Bank's affiliate, the International Development Association.
During the year, the Bank made 37 loans totaling $839.2 million,
compared with a total of $1,023.3 million last year. The loans were

Israel, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda (East African
Common Services Authority), Liberia, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco,
New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Sudan, Thailand, Tunisia and Venezuela. This brought
the total number of loans to 461 in 79 countries and territories and
raised the gross total of commitments to $9,793.8 million. By June 30,
as a result of cancellations, exchange adjustments, repayments and
sales of loans, the portion of loans signed still retained by the Bank
had been reduced to $6,527.9 million.
During the year the Bank sold or agreed to sell $81.9 million principal amounts of loans, compared with sales of $106.2 million Iast year.
As of the end of the fiscal year, the total of such sales was $1,966.6
of which all except $69 million had been made without the Bank's
guarantee.
On June 30, 1966, the outstanding funded debt of the Bank was
$2,805.9 million, reflecting a net increase of $81.9 million in the past
year. During the year the funded debt was increased through the
private placement of bonds and notes totaling the equivalent of

bonds under delayed delivery arrangements. The debt was decreased
through the retirement of bonds and notes totaling the equivalent of
$175.6million, and by sinking and purchase fund transactions amounting to $48.4million.
During the year Malawi and Zambia became members of the Bank,
and Indonesia withdrew from membership. (On July 5, 1966, Indonesia applied for readmission.) The following 20 countries increased

on June 30, 1966, the subscribed capital of the Bank amounted to
$22,426.4 million.
INTER.AMERICAN

DEVEWPMENT

BANK

The Inter-American Development Bank Act, which authorizes the
United States to participate in the Inter-American Development Bank,
provides an exemption for certain securities which may be issued by
the Bank similar to that provided for securities of the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Acting pursuant to this
authority, the Commission adopted Regulation lA, which requires
the Bank to file with the Commission substantially the same information, documents and reports as are required from the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Bank is also required
to file a report with the Commission prior to the sale of any of its
primary obligations to the public in the United States.
During the year ended .rune 30, 1966, the Bank made 14 loans
totalling the equivalent of $97,750,000 from its ordinary capital resources, bringing the gross total of loan commitments outstanding to
129, aggregating $678,020,422. During the year, the Bank sold or
agreed to sell $4,159,528 in participations in these loans. All participations were without the guarantee of the Bank except for a participation of $400,000extended to one participant under a special agreement.

On June 30, 1966, the outstanding funded debt of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank was the equivalent of $373,900,000, reflecting
an increase during the year of the equivalent of $89 million. This increase consisted of two bond issues, including a $65 million short term
issue of which $57 million was placed with the central banks or other

central financial institutions of 15 Latin American member countries
and $8 million with central financial institutions of 2 non-member
countries, Israel and Spain. The other bond issue consisted of Italian
Lire in the amount of LIT 15,000,000,000 ($24,000,000).
On June 27,

Development Bank. As of the end of the fiscal year, the Asian Development Bank had not been formally organized.
STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES

The regular statistical activities of the Commission and its participation in the overall Government statistical program under the
direction of the Officeof Statistical Standards, Bureau of the Budget,
have been continued in the Office of Policy Research. The statistical
series described below are published in the Commission's monthly
Statistical Bulletin. In addition, current figures and analyses of the
data are published quarterly on new securities offerings, individuals'
savings, stock trading of financial institutions, financial position of
corporations, and plant and equipment expenditures.

New Securities Offerings

Monthly and quarterly data are compiled covering all new corporate and non-corporate issues offered for cash sale in the United
States. The series includes not only issues publicly offered but also
issues privately placed, as well as other issues exempt from registration
under the Securities Act such as intrastate offerings and offerings of
railroad securities. The offerings series includes only securities actually offered for cash sale, and only issues offered for account of issuers.
Estimates of the net cash flow through securities transactions are
prepared quarterly and are derived by deducting from the amount of
estimated gross proceeds received by corporations through the sale of
securities the amount of estimated gross payments by corporations to
investors for securities retired. Data on gross issues, retirements and
net change in securities outstanding are presented for all corporations
and for the principal industry groups.
Individuals'

Savings

The Commission compiles quarterly estimates of the volume and
composition of individuals' savings in the United States. The series
represents net increases in individuals' financial assets less net increases
in debt. The study shows the aggregate amount of savings and the
form in which they occurred, such as investment in securities, expansion of bank deposits, increases in insurance and pension reserves, etc.
A reconciliation of the Commission's estimates with the personal savings estimates of the Department of Commerce, derived in connection
with its national income series, is published annually by the Department of Commerce as well as in the Securities and Exchange Commission Statistical Bulletin.
Private Pension Funds

An annual survey is published of private pension plans other than
those administered by insurance companies, showing the flow of money
into these funds, the types of assets in which the funds are invested
and the principal items of income and expenditures.
Quarterly data
on assets of these funds are published in the Statistical Bulletin.
Stock Trading of Financial Institutions

A new statistical report published in June 1966 contained data on
stock trading of four principal types of financial institutions.
Information on purchases and sales of common stock by private non-insured

OPINIONS OF THE COMMISSION

Formal administrative proceedings under the statutes administered
by the Commission generally culminate in the issuance of an opinion
and order. Where hearings are held, the hearing officer who presides
normally makes an initial decision following the hearings, unless such
decision is waived by the parties. Under an amended procedure which
went into effect in April 1966, the initial decision includes an appropriate order. If Commission review is not sought, and if the case is not
called up for review on the Commission's own initiative, the initial
decision becomes the final decision of the Commission.
In those instances where it prepares its own decision, upon review
or waiver of an initial decision, the Commission, or the individual
Commissioner to whom a case may be assigned for the preparation of
an opinion, is generally assisted by the Office of Opinions and Review.
This Office is directly responsible to the Commission and is completely
independent of the operating divisions of the Commission, consistent
with the principle of separation of functions embodied in the Administrative Procedure Act. Where the parties to a proceeding waive
their right to such separation, the operating division which participated in the proceeding may assist in the drafting of the Commission's
decision.
The Commission's opinions are publicly released and are distributed
to the press and to persons on the Commission's mailing list. In addition, they are printed and published periodically by the Government
Printing Office in bound volumes entitled "Securities and Exchange
Commission Decisions and Reports."
Procedures for Publishing Hearing Examiners'

InItial Decisions

The Commission recently adopted procedures to make the initial
decisions of its hearing examiners more readily available to the
public."
In accordance with the Commission's Rules of Practice, an announcement of the issuance of an initial decision in public administrative proceedings is carried in the Commission's News Digest. Copies
of such decisions will be made available in the public reference room
of the Commission's headquarters office, and in each regional and
branch office. Those initial decisions which become the decisions of
the Commission, and which the Commission determines are of prec.. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7942 (August 23, 1966).

edential significance, will be published in whole or in part in the
Securities and Exchange Commission Decisions and Reports.
In administrative proceedings which are conducted privately, the
initial decision will not be made publicly available, unless the Commission otherwise orders, until the period within which review may
be sought or ordered has expired and no review has been sought or
ordered. Thereupon, except as noted below, the fact that the initial
decision has been issued and become final will be announced by the
Secretary, and copies will be made available and included in the Decisions and Reports as described above. Initial decisions in private
proceedings which grant an application for confidential treatment or
conclude that the evidence does not sustain the violations charged will
generally not be made public.
Only a limited supply of initial decisions is printed at the time of
their issuance. Requests for copies will be honored until the supply
is exhausted; thereafter, copies may be obtained only upon payment
of the prevailing rate for reproductions.
DISSEMINATION

OF INFORMATION

As the discussion in prior sections of this Report indicates, most large
corporations in which there is a substantial public investor interest
have filed registration statements or applications under the Securities
Exchange Act or the Securities Act with the Commission and are
required to file annual and other periodic reports. The financial
and other data included in these documents receive widespread dissemination through the medium of securities manuals and other financial publications, thus becoming available to broker-dealer and
investment adviser firms, trust departments and other financial institutions and, through them, to public investors generally.
Various activities of the Commission facilitate public dissemination
of corporate and other information. Among these is the issuance of a
daily "News Digest" which contains (1) a resume of each proposal for
the public offering of securities for which a Securities Act registration
statement is filed; (2) 'a listing of those companies whose shares are
traded over-the-counter which register with the Commission and of all
companies which file interim reports reflecting significant corporate
developments; (3) a summary of all orders, decisions, rules and rule
proposals issued by the Commission; (4) a brief report of court 'actions
resulting from the Commission's law enforcement program; and (5)
a brief reference to each release issued by the Commission in its statistical studies. During the year, the News Digest reported information
concerning among other things 1,697 registration statements filed
under the Securities Act, 950 orders, decisions, rules and rule proposals,
272 court enforcement actions, and 74 statistical releases.
238-643--66----11

144

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The News Digest is made immediately available to the press, and
it is also reprinted and distributed by the Government Printing Office,
on a subscription basis, to some 2,350 investors, securities firms, practicing lawyers and others. In addition, the Commission maintains
mailing lists for the distribution of the full text of its orders, decisions,
rules and rule proposals.
During the year, individual members of the Commission and numerous staff officers addressed various professional, business and other
groups and participated in panel discussions of the laws administered
by the Commission, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the
policies, procedures and practices of the Commission. These speeches
and discussions are helpful in promoting a better understanding of the
functions and activities of the Commission, thus facilitating compliance
with the laws and rules. In addition, they stimulate public discussion
of ways and means of improving the administrative process.
Information Available for Public Inspection

The many thousands of registration statements, applications, declarations and annual and other periodic reports filed with the Commission each year are available for public inspection at the Commission's
principal office in Washington, D.C. In addition, copies of recent
reports filed by companies having securities listed on exchanges other
than the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock
Exchange, and copies of current reports of many non-listed companies, may be examined in the Commission's New York Regional
Office. Recent reports filed by companies whose securities are listed
on the New York and American Stock Exchanges may be examined
in the Commission's Chicago Regional Office. Moreover, there are
available for examination in all regional offices copies of prospectuses
relating to recent public offerings of securities registered under the
Securities Act; and all regional offices have copies of broker-dealer
annual financial reports and Regulation A letters of notification filed
in their respective regions.
Reports of companies whose securities are listed on the various
exchanges may be seen at the respective exchange offices. Inaddition,
the registration statements filed pursuant to the new Section 12(g)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available for public
inspection in the principal office in Washington, D.C., the New York,
Chicago and San Francisco Regional Offices, and the regional office
nearest the registrant.
In order to facilitate wider dissemination of financial and other
information contained in corporate reports filed with the Commission
under the Federal securities laws (an objective strongly urged by
the Special Study Report), the Commission has arranged to take

standing orders, on an experimental basis, for photocopies of annual
reports filed on Form 1O-K. This service may be extended later to
other reports, depending upon public reception and the experience
gained in supplying copies of annual reports.
Under the existing contract with a printing company for the reproduction of material in the Commission's public files in response to
requests of members of the public, photocopies may be obtained at
a cost of 10 cents per page for pages not exceeding 81;2" x 14" in size.
The detailed per page prices are given in Release No. 34-7910, which
may be obtained from the Publications Unit of the Commission.
The charge for each certification of any document by the Commission
is $2.
In order to make corporate reports more readily available for
examination by interested members of the public, the Commission
has also made arrangements for the Form 1o-K annual reports and
Form 10 registration statements to be placed on open shelves in the
public area of its Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C., thus
making these reports available for immediate inspection. There are
presently three coin-operated photocopiers in the Public Reference
Room to enable visitors to make immediate reproductions of reports
at a cost of 25 cents per page. (The New York Regional Office has
a similar maehine.)
Each year many thousands of requests for photocopies of and information from the public files of the Commission are received in the
Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. During the year 6,110
persons examined material on file in the Washington, D.C. office,and
several thousand others examined files in the New York and Chicago
regional offices. More than 15,400 searches were made for individuals
requesting information and approximately 2,714 letters were written
with respect to information required.

ORGANIZATION

During fiscal year 1966 and shortly thereafter, certain organizational changes were effected in accordance with the Commission's policy
of continuing review of its organization and functional alignments.
In April 1966, the staff and functions of the Branch of Market
Analysis of the Division of Trading and Markets were transferred to
the Office of Policy Research, to be consolidated with the Commission's
economic and statistical studies and the compilation of data on program activities. At the same time, the staff and functions of the Chief
Counsel's Office in the Office of Policy Research were transferred to
the Office of Regulation in the Division of Trading and Markets, to
assist directly in that Division's responsibilities for the regulation of
the securities market. In addition, two Associate Directors were appointed for the Division of Trading and Markets, one to be responsible
for Markets and Regulation and the other for Enforcement.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In July 1966, a number of organizational changes were effected in
the Division of Trading and Markets. The Office of Criminal Reference and the Office of Proceedings, which performed similar functions,
were consolidated; the Branch of Distribution and Stabilization was
abolished; and the three Branches of Enforcement were consolidated
into two Branches.
PERSONNEL AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Highlights of the Commission's personnel management-program
in
fiscal 1966 included (1) revision of its Conduct Regulation, (2) the
granting of SEC "Distinguished Service" awards for outstanding
career service, (3) participation with other regulatory agencies in a
joint seminar program for summer students, and (4) the addition of
an important fringe benefit in the form of income protection insurance.
Under Executive Order 11222 of May 8, 1965, "Prescribing Standards of Ethical Conduct for Government Officers and Employees,"
the Civil Service Commission issued broad regulations which established a uniform pattern for agency regulations and minimum requirements to be met. The Commission's Conduct Regulation, first
adopted in 1953, "to restate the ethical principles which it believes
should govern and have governed the conduct of Members and employees and former Members and former employees of the Securities
and Exchange Commission," was accordingly revised as of March 21,
1966. The revised version clarified certain provisions of existing rules
and added new rules required by the basic regulations of the Civil
Service Commission, including rules relating to the disclosure by employees of information relating to their finances.
As part of its Eleventh Annual Service and Merit Awards Ceremony
held in October 1965, the Commission inaugurated a new series of
"Distinguished Service" awards for outstanding career service. The
first four recipients of the awards-Commissioner
Byron D. Woodside; Robert H. Bagley, Associate Director, Division of Corporation
Finance; Orval L. DuBois, Secretary of the Commission; and William Green, Administrator of the Atlanta Regional Office-had a combined total of 124 years of SEC service.
The Commission and seven other regulatory agencies supplemented
the 1965 White House Seminar Program for summer students by
conducting a joint program entitled "Regulation in a Democracy."
This half-day program, which included prepared statements by the
panel members and a question and answer session, was devoted to three
topics:
"The Purpose of Regulation in a Democracy"
"The Tasks of Regulatory Agencies"
"Effects of Regulation on Our Daily Lives"

TEITRTY-SECOND

ANNUAL

REPORT

Almost 100 students attended, including 17 employed by the Commission.
In January 1966, under the sponsorship of the SEC Recreation and
Welfare Association, all Commission employees were offered low-cost
income protection insurance designed to minimize the financial burden
in cases of illness or disability.
The insurance, offered as an employee
service at no cost to the Commission, is part of a continuing effort to
make special-type insurance available to employees at low-cost group
rates.
During the fiscal year 1966, within-grade salary increases in
recognition of high quality work performance were granted to 54
employees. These awards are authorized by Section 702 of the Classification Act of 1949, as amended by the Salary Reform Act of 1962.
In addition, cash awards totaling $3,500 were presented to 19 employees for superior performance and 6 employees received a total
of $100 for adopted suggestions.
The following comparative table shows the personnel strength of
the Commission as of June 30, 1965 and 1966 :

The table on page 151 shows, for the fiscal years 1962 to 1967, the
status of the Commission's budget estimates from the initial submission to the Bureau of the Budget to final enactment of the annual
appropriation.
The Commission is required by law to collect fees for or from (1) the
registration of securities proposed to be offered; (2) qualification of
trust indentures;
(3) registration of exchanges; (4) brokers and
dealers who are registered with the Commission but who are not members of a registered national securities association (the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) is the only such organization) ;
and (5) certification of documents filed with the Commission. 51
07 Principal
rates are (1) 1/50 of 1 percent of the maximum aggregate price
of securities proposed to be offered, or 20 cents per $1,000, with a minimum fee
of $100 (Public Law 89-289, approved October 22, 1965, effective January 1, 1966) ;
(2) 1/500 of 1 percent of the aggregate dollar amount of securities sales on the
exchanges; (3) for fiscal 1965 : a basic registration fee of $100 for each non-NASD
broker-dealer, plus $2 per associated person up to a limit of 100 persons, plus $1
for each additional associated person. For fiscal 1966 : a base fee of $150 for each
non-NASD broker-dealer, plus $7 for each associated person, plus $30 for each
office and $25 for each associated person joining such broker-dealer after
August 1, 1966.
