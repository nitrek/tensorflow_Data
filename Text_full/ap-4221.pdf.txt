ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
AND
POSTPONEMENT ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(Exchange Act), on September 16, 2016, and the hearing was scheduled to commence on October 11,
2016. Only Respondent All Energy Corp. remains in the proceeding.1 The OIP alleges that
Respondent is a corporation with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and has repeatedly failed to file required periodic reports. The
Division of Enforcement is seeking to revoke the registration of Respondent’s securities.
The OIP provides that Respondent’s Answer is due within ten days of service of the OIP on
it. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). Respondent was served with the OIP on September 19,
2016, by USPS Express Mail delivery at “the most recent address shown on [its] most recent filing
with the Commission.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii). To date, Respondent has failed to file an
Answer within the time provided.
Accordingly, Respondent is ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE, by October 14, 2016, why it
should not be deemed to be in default and the registration of its securities revoked. See OIP at 3; 17
C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the hearing is POSTPONED sine die, and a prehearing
conference shall be held by telephone on November 18, 2016, at 10:30 a.m. EST, if the proceeding
has not been resolved by then.
