Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that
cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 203(k) of the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) against AssetMark, Inc. (f/k/a Genworth
Financial Wealth Management, Inc.) (“Respondent” or “AssetMark”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the
findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over Respondent and the subject

Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 203(k) of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth
below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds 1 that:

1

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer and are not binding on any other
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

Summary
1.
This matter arises from misstatements made by registered investment adviser
AssetMark to certain of its advisory clients, including clients with separately managed accounts
invested in a strategy offered by F-Squared Investments, Inc. (“F-Squared”). AssetMark made
misstatements by negligently relying on F-Squared’s materially inflated, and hypothetical and
back-tested, performance track record that F-Squared misrepresented.
2.
AlphaSector is a sector rotation strategy based on an algorithm that yields a signal
indicating whether to buy or sell exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”). One of these AlphaSector
strategies was called AlphaSector Premium, which consisted of nine industry ETFs that together
made up the industries in the S&P 500 Index. Between July 16, 2012 and December 2014,
AssetMark offered clients an F-Squared customized asset allocation model known as the Global
AlphaSector Allocator Strategy (“Allocator”). Allocator was a globally diversified strategy
comprised of four sleeves, which encompassed U.S. equities, international equities, fixed
income, and non-correlated assets, such as ETFs covering gold and real estate investment trusts.
The U.S. equities sleeve of Allocator followed F-Squared’s AlphaSector Premium Index.
3.
From July 16, 2012 to October 1, 2013, in reliance on F-Squared’s false
statements, certain of AssetMark’s staff circulated advertisements prepared by F-Squared
concerning the AlphaSector Premium strategy, which was not offered on a stand-alone basis by
AssetMark. These F-Squared advertisements falsely stated that: (a) client assets had been
invested in the AlphaSector Premium strategy from April 2001 to September 2008; and (b) the
AlphaSector Premium track record had significantly outperformed the S&P 500 Index from
April 2001 to September 2008. In fact, no client assets had tracked the AlphaSector Premium
strategy from April 2001 through September 2008. In addition, F-Squared miscalculated the
historical performance of the AlphaSector Premium strategy from April 2001 to September
2008 by incorrectly implementing signals in advance of when such signals actually could have
occurred.
4.
AssetMark’s own advertising for the Allocator strategy reflected that the reported
performance for that strategy was hypothetical and back-tested and did not reflect the
performance of actual assets. However, AssetMark also advertised its Allocator strategy by
sending its clients F-Squared’s false AlphaSector Premium advertisements. While AssetMark
sought to confirm the accuracy of F-Squared’s historical data and other information contained
in F-Squared’s false AlphaSector Premium advertisements, AssetMark did not obtain sufficient
documentation that substantiated F-Squared’s advertising claims in the F-Squared materials. As
a result of this inaccurate compilation of historical data by F-Squared, AssetMark advertised the
AlphaSector Premium strategy, which AssetMark did not offer to clients, by using hypothetical
and back-tested historical performance that was inflated substantially over what performance
would have been if F-Squared had applied the signals accurately.
5.
As a result, AssetMark violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule
206(4)-1(a)(5) thereunder by publishing, circulating, and distributing advertisements that
contained untrue statements of material fact. AssetMark likewise did not make and keep true,
2

accurate and current records or documents necessary to form the basis for or demonstrate the
calculation of the performance or rate of returns that it circulated and distributed, as required by
Section 204(a) of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2(a)(16) thereunder.

F-Squared Investments, Inc. (SEC File No. 801-69937) is an investment adviser
that was registered with the Commission from March 2009 until January 2016, and is
headquartered in Wellesley, Massachusetts. In October 2008, F-Squared launched its first
AlphaSector index. F-Squared sub-licensed its approximately 75 AlphaSector indexes to
unaffiliated third parties who managed assets pursuant to these indexes. On December 22, 2014,
the Commission instituted a settled fraud action against F-Squared in which F-Squared admitted,
among other things, to making the materially false claims that (a) the signals that formed the
basis of the AlphaSector Premium index returns had been used to manage client assets from
April 2001 to September 2008; and (b) the signals resulted in a track record that significantly
outperformed the S&P 500 Index from April 2001 to September 2008. See In the Matter of FSquared Investments, Inc., Admin. Proceeding No. 3-16325 (Dec. 22, 2014).

In 2006, Present co-founded F-Squared and was the President and CEO until his separation in
2014. On December 22, 2014, the Commission filed a civil complaint alleging fraud charges
against Present in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which is
pending. See SEC v. Present, No. 1:14-cv-14692 (D. Mass. filed Dec. 22, 2014).
Facts
AssetMark’s Relationship With F-Squared
9.
In late 2011, F-Squared introduced AssetMark to its AlphaSector strategies.
AssetMark began considering whether it would enter into an agreement with F-Squared whereby
F-Squared would become a Portfolio Strategist on the AssetMark wrap platform providing model
accounts to end clients using a strategy based in part on F-Squared’s AlphaSector Premium
strategy. F-Squared marketed the AlphaSector Premium strategy to AssetMark as an ETF sector
rotation strategy that was based on an algorithm that yields a “signal” indicating whether to buy
or sell nine U.S. equity industry ETFs. 3 If the algorithm produced buy signals for three or fewer
2

Regulatory assets under management include the securities portfolios for which AssetMark provides
continuous and regular supervisory or management services.
3
F-Squared created several AlphaSector strategies and sub-licensed approximately 75 AlphaSector
indexes. The AlphaSector indexes that are the subject of this matter, including the AlphaSector Premium
Index and the AlphaSector Rotation Index, are based on investments in U.S. equity ETFs. AssetMark

3

sector ETFs, the AlphaSector Premium strategy provided for some or all of the assets to be
invested in cash equivalents.
10.
F-Squared described the AlphaSector Premium strategy falsely to AssetMark by,
among other things, representing that: (a) the AlphaSector Premium strategy had been used to
manage client assets from April 2001 to September 2008, often calling it a “live” track record;
and (b) the track record had significantly outperformed the S&P 500 Index from April 2001 to
September 2008. In reality, no assets tracked the strategy until 2008 and the back-tested track
record was substantially overstated. F-Squared’s AlphaSector Premium sales and marketing
materials shared with AssetMark claimed that clients actually achieved these performance
returns for the April 2001 to September 2008 time period. AssetMark’s advertising for the
Allocator strategy reflected that the reported performance for that strategy was hypothetical and
back-tested and did not reflect the performance of actual client assets. However, AssetMark
allowed its staff members to circulate F-Squared’s advertisements concerning the AlphaSector
Premium strategy, which AssetMark did not offer to clients, including claims concerning the live
nature of the track record and the significant outperformance claim, and disseminated those
advertisements to its clients and prospective clients without having a reasonable basis to
conclude that F-Squared’s exceptional performance claims were true.
F-Squared’s Advertisements Circulated by AssetMark Contained Misstatements
11.
From July 2012 through October 1, 2013, AssetMark, in advertising its own
advisory services for the Allocator strategy, disseminated performance advertisements prepared
by F-Squared concerning the AlphaSector Premium strategy. These advertisements failed to
disclose that the AlphaSector Premium track record for the period April 2001 to September 2008
was hypothetical and back-tested. AssetMark typically distributed these advertisements through
electronic mail to its clients and prospective clients in response to requests for additional
information about F-Squared. As described above, certain of the AlphaSector Premium
advertisements prepared by F-Squared that AssetMark distributed to its clients substantially
overstated the performance of the back-tested track record during this period based on the false
information provided by F-Squared. By November 2013, after F-Squared instructed AssetMark
in October 2013 to remove the April 2001 to September 2008 performance materials, AssetMark
ceased distributing any AlphaSector Premium advertising materials containing references to any
performance information for periods prior to September 2008.

advertised an AlphaSector strategy called Global AlphaSector Allocator Strategy that used the
AlphaSector Premium strategy for the U.S. equity portion of the strategy that also included investments in
foreign equities fixed income products and non-correlated assets, with the proportions among these
categories varying depending on the client’s risk profile. As with all indexes, the performance of the
AlphaSector Premium Index and AlphaSector Rotation Index is inherently hypothetical in the sense that
the indexes do not purport to reflect the performance of any particular client or account. However, the
AlphaSector Premium Index and AlphaSector Rotation Index were advertised as being based on a
strategy that had been in place since 2001 and therefore the performance of these indexes was advertised
as “not backtested” when in fact the performance was back-tested.

AssetMark Failed to Have A Reasonable Basis to Believe the Accuracy of the Performance
and Performance-Related Claims in the Advertisements
12.
AssetMark knew or should have known that it did not have a reasonable basis to
believe that F-Squared’s advertising claims concerning the AlphaSector Premium strategy were
accurate. AssetMark knew or should have known that the purported performance of F-Squared’s
AlphaSector Premium strategy contained in certain advertising materials distributed by
AssetMark was exceptional over the 2001-2008 period in that it significantly outperformed the
S&P 500 Index and purported to involve actual results notwithstanding that, despite the
representations of F-Squared to the contrary, the AlphaSector Premium strategy was not
launched until after September 2008. With regard to the performance claims, the F-Squared
AlphaSector Premium advertisements included a general statement indicating that third parties
were the source of the performance data and that the information had not been independently
verified. With respect to due diligence concerning the accuracy of the April 2001 to September
2008 AlphaSector Premium track record, AssetMark relied solely on documents and information
that came directly or indirectly from F-Squared. For example, while AssetMark reviewed
performance returns calculated by NASDAQ OMX, the input data that NASDAQ OMX used to
calculate the returns also came from F-Squared. Having taken insufficient steps to confirm the
accuracy of the AlphaSector Premium performance data and not having obtained sufficient
documentation that would have substantiated F-Squared’s advertised performance and
performance-related claims in the F-Squared advertising materials distributed by AssetMark,
AssetMark failed to have a reasonable basis to believe that AlphaSector Premium’s performance
was accurate when it distributed advertisements to clients considering the customized Allocator
strategy.
AssetMark Failed to Maintain Adequate Books and Records
13.
AssetMark was required to make and keep true, accurate and current records or
documents necessary to form the basis for or demonstrate the calculation of the performance or
rate of return of the managed accounts or securities recommendations in advertisements that it
circulated or distributed to ten or more persons. In marketing its own advisory services,
AssetMark circulated and distributed the 2001-2008 historical performance of the AlphaSector
Premium strategy in client presentations and marketing materials and other communications to
numerous clients, investors, and potential investors. However, AssetMark never made or kept
sufficient records or documents to form the basis for or demonstrate the calculation of the
historical performance or rate of return of the AlphaSector Premium strategy.
Violations
14.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent violated Section 206(4) of
the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5) thereunder, which make it a fraudulent, deceptive, or
manipulative act, practice, or course of business within the meaning of Section 206(4) of the
Advisers Act to, among other things, directly or indirectly publish, circulate, or distribute an
advertisement which contains any untrue statement of material fact, or which is otherwise false
or misleading. A violation of Section 206(4) and the rules thereunder does not require scienter.
See SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d 636, 647 (D.C. Cir. 1992).

15.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent violated Section 204(a) of
the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2(a)(16) thereunder. Section 204(a) of the Advisers Act requires
investment advisers to make and keep certain records as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe
as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Rule 204-2
under the Advisers Act requires investment advisers registered or required to be registered to
make and keep true, accurate and current various books and records relating to their investment
advisory business, including all accounts, books, internal working papers, and any other records
or documents that are necessary to form the basis for or demonstrate the calculation of the
performance or rate of return of any or all managed accounts or securities recommendations in
any notice, circular, advertisement, newspaper article, investment letter, bulletin or other
communication that the investment adviser circulates or distributes, directly or indirectly, to 10
or more persons.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
A.
Pursuant to Section 203(k) of the Advisers Act, Respondent shall cease and desist
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 204(a) and
206(4) of the Advisers Act, and Rules 204-2(a)(16), and 206(4)-1(a)(5) thereunder.
B.
Respondent shall, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil money
penalty of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) to the Securities and Exchange Commission
for transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section
21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C.
3717. Payment must be made in one of the following ways:
(1)

Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which will
provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2)

AssetMark as the Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a
copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Robert B. Baker, Assistant
Director, Asset Management Unit, Securities and Exchange Commission, 33 Arch Street, 24th
Floor, Boston, MA, 02110.
C.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall
be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor
Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall it benefit by, offset or reduction of any
award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil
penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such
a Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order
granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission’s counsel in this action and pay the amount
of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be
deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil
penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action”
means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more
investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.

By the Commission.
