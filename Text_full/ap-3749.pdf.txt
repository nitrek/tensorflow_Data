In the Matter of
BARRY B. CLARE

ORDER POSTPONING HEARING
AND SCHEDULING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

On March 15, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. A hearing is
currently scheduled for April 25, 2016.
On March 22, 2016, Respondent filed a waiver of service, which states that Respondent’s
counsel received the OIP via email on March 22 and, on behalf of Respondent, waived service
pursuant to Rule of Practice 141(a)(4), 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(4). I find that service was
effective on March 22, 2016, and that the 300-day period for issuing an initial decision in this
matter began to run on that date. Additionally, Respondent’s answer is due April 11, 2016. OIP
at 5; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b).
Also on March 22, the parties filed a joint motion to adjourn the hearing and schedule a
prehearing conference. The motion is GRANTED. I POSTPONE the hearing currently
scheduled for April 25, 2016, and schedule a telephonic prehearing conference for April 21,
2016, at 11:00 a.m. EDT.
Prior to the prehearing conference, the parties must confer and discuss the date for the
hearing in this matter, the most convenient location for the hearing, the prehearing schedule, and
the matters listed in Rule of Practice 221(c). See 17 C.F.R. § 201.221(c). In doing so, the parties
should bear the following in mind. First, 5 U.S.C. § 554(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 201.200(c) provide
guidance regarding the location of the hearing. Second, Respondent has a right to a hearing
between thirty and sixty days after service of the OIP. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-3(b); see OIP at 4-5. If
Respondent exercises that right, the hearing in this matter will commence on a date to be
determined within that time period. Otherwise, given my schedule and Rule of Practice
360(a)(2), the hearing will most likely begin during the latter part of August. See 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.360(a)(2).

By April 18, 2016, the parties must by joint letter, filed consistent with 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.151-52:
a)

notify this office of the results of their discussion;

b)
notify this office if Respondent wishes to exercise his right to begin the hearing
between thirty and sixty days of service of the OIP; and
c)

notify this office of the date they have agreed the hearing should begin.

The parties are asked to e-mail PDF text-searchable courtesy copies of any filings in this
proceeding to alj@sec.gov.
