In the Matter of
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
BREITLING ENERGY CORPORATION

On July 11, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondent has a class of securities registered with the Commission and is delinquent in its
periodic filings. I previously directed the Division of Enforcement to file a declaration of service
and ordered the parties to hold an initial prehearing conference without the hearing officer by
August 5, 2016, in the event that Respondent filed an answer. Breitling Energy Corp., Admin.
Proc. Rulings Release No. 4006, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2501 (ALJ July 20, 2016).
On July 29, 2016, the Division filed a declaration of service establishing that Respondent
was served with the OIP in accordance with Rule of Practice 141(a)(2)(ii), 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.141(a)(2)(ii), on July 15, 2016. Respondent’s answer was due by August 8, 2016. See
OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(a)-(b), .220(b). To date, Respondent has not filed an answer, and
the Division has informed my office that the parties were unable to hold a prehearing conference.
Accordingly, Respondent is ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE by August 19, 2016, why the
registration of its securities should not be revoked by default due to its failure to file an answer or
otherwise defend this proceeding. If Respondent fails to respond to this order, it will be deemed
in default and the registration of its securities will be revoked. OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
