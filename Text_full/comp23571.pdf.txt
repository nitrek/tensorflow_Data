Civil No. 16-cv-

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), for its
Complaint against Defendants Christopher Salis (“Salis”), Douglas Miller, Edward Miller, and
Barrett Biehl (“Biehl”) (collectively, the “Defendants”), alleges as follows:
SUMMARY
1.

This action involves unlawful, coordinated insider trading in the securities of

Concur Technologies, Inc. (“Concur”) during 2014, and similar, prior insider trading in the
securities of Business Objects S.A. (“Business Objects”) during 2007. In both schemes, a
company insider (Salis) tipped his close friend (Douglas Miller) with material, nonpublic
information about an upcoming corporate transaction, and Douglas Miller bought call options in
the target company that generated profits after the transactions became public. In the Concur
scheme, Douglas Miller passed Salis’s tip to his brother (Edward Miller) and another friend
(Biehl). Douglas Miller also tipped his parents and a second friend and, with their knowledge
and consent, placed trades in their accounts. Salis ensured the success of both schemes, and in

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 2 of 40

the Business Objects scheme actually placed the trades, by accessing Douglas Miller’s brokerage
account with Douglas Miller’s knowledge and consent, as alleged below. These tips yielded
illicit trading profits of more than $545,000 for Douglas Miller, Douglas Miller’s family, and
their two mutual friends. The Millers, their parents, and Biehl later paid Salis and his wholly
owned limited liability company for the Concur tip.
2.

In the summer of 2014, Salis learned in the course of his employment at SAP

America, Inc. (“SAP”) of SAP’s confidential and nonpublic plans to acquire Concur. Salis then
tipped Douglas Miller, a close friend and former college classmate who lived in the Indiana
suburbs of Chicago, about the planned acquisition with the understanding that Douglas Miller
would use the information to trade. Douglas Miller then immediately passed on Salis’s tip of
material, nonpublic information to his brother, Edward Miller, and his parents, all of whom were
also close friends with Salis.
3.

Douglas and Edward Miller then rushed to open brokerage accounts and to fund

those accounts so that they could quickly begin trading in securities of Concur based on the tip.
After learning that electronic transfers to their accounts would take several days to clear and that
the brokerage firm would not accept cash, the Millers drove approximately 30 minutes to the
nearest branch office of their brokerage firm to present cashier’s checks for deposit into their
accounts in amounts ranging from $6,000 to $9,800. The Millers’ mother also acted quickly to
reactivate a dormant account that she jointly held with her husband and likewise funded it with a
cashier’s check.
4.

To Douglas and Edward Miller, the amounts deposited into their brokerage

accounts were substantial. Douglas and Edward Miller owned a car wash, and the two were
struggling to keep the business afloat due to its poor financial performance and mounting debt.

2

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 3 of 40

Douglas Miller viewed the Concur trading as their “possible savior.” At the same time, the
Millers chose the amounts of their brokerage deposits carefully; they each deposited under
$10,000 in the belief that their subsequent options trading would escape detection. As Douglas
Miller later recalled in a text message to Edward Miller, “We all tried to fly under the radar of
investing under 10k bro.”
5.

Salis and Douglas Miller subsequently expanded their illegal insider trading

scheme by tipping their two mutual college friends, Biehl and Friend 1, both of whom also lived
in the Chicago metropolitan area. Biehl and Friend 1 opened brokerage accounts and deposited
$7,000 and $7,500, respectively.
6.

Douglas Miller, Edward Miller, and Biehl (collectively, the “Trading

Defendants”), as well as Friend 1 and the Millers’ parents, used their funds to purchase risky and
aggressive Concur call option contracts. Most of these option contracts would expire in weeks,
if not days, unless Concur’s stock price increased substantially. The options purchases included
two September contracts that would expire worthless in just three days if Concur’s stock price
did not increase by $12 per share (over 10% of its share price) during that time.
7.

During August and September, because Salis stood to—and later did—profit from

the scheme, he repeatedly accessed the online brokerage accounts of Douglas and Edward Miller
from his home in California and from a nearby donut shop. Likewise, during this time, Douglas
Miller frequently accessed the online brokerage accounts of his other friends and family who
traded. As alleged below, Douglas Miller placed nearly all of the trades in their accounts with
their knowledge and consent. These trades were placed on the basis of the material, nonpublic
information regarding the SAP-Concur merger provided by Salis. Douglas Miller and the
Trading Defendants each knew, consciously avoided knowing, were reckless in not knowing, or

3

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 4 of 40

should have known that Salis had disclosed the material, nonpublic information in breach of a
duty. They each further knew, consciously avoided knowing, were reckless in not knowing, or
should have known that Salis had done so for a personal benefit or to make a gift of confidential
information.
8.

On the afternoon on September 18, 2014, just hours before the public

announcement of the SAP-Concur merger, Douglas Miller called his brokerage firm and asked
how to sell his options positions because he was “trying to prepare myself if something
happened.” As he knew from Salis’s tip, “something” was about to happen, namely, the public
announcement of SAP’s acquisition. Soon after the close of the markets that day, the two
companies jointly announced their $8.3 billion merger.
9.

After news of the merger became public—less than one month after the Millers’

initial option trades, and just one week after Biehl and Friend 1 purchased Concur call options—
Douglas Miller, Edward Miller, their parents, Biehl, and Friend 1 sold their Concur options for
profits of approximately $119,003, $149,117, $147,021, $52,208, and $37,983, respectively. In
total, the Millers, their parents, Biehl, and Friend 1 reaped illegal trading profits of over
$505,000 from their initial deposits of less than $45,000.
10.

The Trading Defendants paid Salis for his tip of material, nonpublic information

through a series of convoluted transactions. These payments included more than $10,400 in cash
given to Salis just weeks after the announcement, while Salis was in Indiana visiting Douglas
Miller. Concerned about detection, Salis deposited some of this money while he was still in
Indiana and carried the rest home with him on the airplane. As Salis told Douglas Miller in an
email sent from the airport, he split the cash “[h]alf in my bag, half in my pockets.” The Trading
Defendants and the Millers’ parents later funneled additional payments to Salis, including during

4

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 5 of 40

other in-person meetings and by writing checks totaling approximately $80,000 to EndowCloud,
LLC, a startup company owned by Salis.
11.

Salis and Douglas Miller previously engaged in insider trading under strikingly

similar circumstances. In October 2007, Salis tipped Douglas Miller with material, nonpublic
information about a tender offer for Salis’s then-employer, Business Objects. Just five days
before the public announcement of SAP’s tender offer for Business Objects, Douglas Miller
reactivated a dormant brokerage account. With Douglas Miller’s knowledge and consent, Salis
logged into this account and purchased aggressive Business Objects call options on the basis of
his material, nonpublic information about the tender offer for his company. This trading
generated over $42,000 in illegal profits when the price of Business Objects increased after the
tender offer was announced publicly.
12.

By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Defendants Salis,

Douglas Miller, Edward Miller, and Biehl violated, and unless restrained and enjoined will
continue to violate, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)
[15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder.
13.

By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Douglas Miller and Salis

violated, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to violate, Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78n(e)] and Rule 14e-3 [17 C.F.R. §240.14e-3] thereunder.
NATURE OF PROCEEDING AND RELIEF SOUGHT
14.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act

[15 U.S.C. § 78u-1] to enjoin the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in
this Complaint and to seek orders of disgorgement, along with prejudgment interest, civil
penalties, and such other and further relief that the Court may deem appropriate.

25.

Business Objects S.A. was a French software company that developed business

intelligence applications. The company maintained dual headquarters in Levallois-Perret, France
and in San Jose, California, where Salis was employed. Until February 19, 2008, American
Depository Receipts representing ADSs of Business Objects’s common stock were registered
with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78l(b)] and
traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol BOBJ. On October 7,
2007, Business Objects and SAP SE, then known as SAP AG, jointly announced that they had
entered into a tender offer agreement whereby SAP AG would offer €42 per ordinary share and

8

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 9 of 40

the United States dollar-equivalent amount per ADS ($59.35) in a total transaction for slightly
above €4.8 million ($6.8 billion).
TRADING TERMINOLOGY
26.

An option contract gives the purchaser the right to buy or sell 100 shares of the

underlying stock before a specified deadline, known as the expiration date, for a predetermined
price per share, known as the strike price.
27.

A call option gives an investor the right, but not the obligation, to buy stock.

Therefore, a call option generally will increase in value as the value of the underlying stock
increases. Unlike stock, which retains some value even if the price falls, a call option loses all
value once it expires. A call option with a strike price that is greater than the stock’s market
price is referred to as being “out-of-the-money” because there is little to no value in the right to
buy a stock at a price greater than its current market price.
28.

A purchase of call options with expiration dates in the near future is an expression

of confidence that the underlying stock price will increase quickly.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
SAP-Concur Merger Negotiations and Announcement
29.

On May 20, 2014, a senior executive at SAP contacted Concur’s chief executive

officer to discuss Concur’s business and to explore a possible business combination. Merger
discussions between SAP and Concur personnel and their legal and financial advisors continued,
on and off, into July 2014.
30.

On July 23, 2014, SAP SE and Concur executed a mutual non-disclosure

agreement. That same day, SAP proposed an all-cash acquisition of Concur for $110 per share,
when Concur’s stock was trading at approximately $90.98 per share. Concur’s board of directors
rejected this offer.
9

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 10 of 40

31.

After this rejection, SAP and Concur executives met in San Francisco. The

parties’ financial advisors then held a follow-up meeting, also in San Francisco.
32.

After these meetings, on August 6, 2014, SAP increased its offer to $120 per

share, which Concur again rejected. At the time, Concur’s stock was trading at approximately
$93.65 per share. The parties returned to negotiations. On August 14, 2014, SAP asked Concur
to provide additional financial information.
33.

On August 19, 2014, SAP presented its final offer to purchase all outstanding

Concur shares for $129 per share. At the time, Concur’s stock was trading at approximately
$100.46 per share.
34.

On August 23, 2014, Concur’s board of directors determined to accept SAP’s

offer and directed Concur’s executives to try to negotiate an agreement at a price of $129 per
share.
35.

On August 25, 2014, SAP began its due diligence process, i.e., its evaluation of

Concur’s business and financial condition, for the potential transaction. That day, Concur
granted SAP representatives and SAP’s legal and financial advisors access to Concur’s online
data room.
36.

On September 3, 2014, at approximately 4:07 p.m. EDT, Bloomberg News

published an online report that Concur was exploring a possible sale of the company. The article
mentioned SAP and another company as possible purchasers, but it did not specifically report on
SAP’s negotiations with Concur or suggest a price or possible timeline for any acquisition.
Other news outlets republished the Bloomberg report. Concur’s stock price increased 7.1% in
after-hours trading that day and an additional 1.4% the following day. The closing price on
September 3, 2014, was $109.60.

10

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 11 of 40

37.

Due diligence by Concur and SAP continued through September 17, 2014. On

September 18, 2014, SAP, SAP SE, and Concur executed a merger agreement and then
announced the transaction at 5:09 p.m. EDT after the markets closed. Until this public
announcement, all information regarding the transaction, including the fact that negotiations with
SAP were ongoing, was nonpublic and confidential.
38.

After the public announcement, Concur’s stock price rose over 18% in after-hours

trading and opened at $127.53 on September 19. Trading volume on September 19 rose 4,197%
from the prior day and 4,199% over Concur’s average daily volume for the prior month, with
Concur’s stock price reaching an intra-day high of $127.55 before closing at $126.82. The
closing price on September 19, 2014 represented a 17.6% gain from the prior day’s close.
Salis’s Access and Responsibilities with Regard to
Material, Nonpublic Information
39.

At all relevant times while at SAP, Salis worked in the Palo Alto, California

office as the Global Vice President and General Manager for Procurement. His supervisor and
most of his team members worked at SAP SE’s headquarters in Walldorf, Germany.
40.

Upon information and belief, as alleged in more detail below, Salis obtained

material, nonpublic information about SAP’s intended acquisition of Concur through
conversations with colleagues and/or by viewing documents located in SAP’s or SAP SE’s
offices or stored on SAP’s or SAP SE’s computer network systems, including email servers and
network drives containing shared folders. Salis obtained this confidential information as early as
August 15, 2014.
41.

Negotiations concerning the Concur acquisition took place in and around the Palo

Alto office where Salis worked. For instance, during May 2014, SAP and Concur executives
held their first meeting about a possible transaction in Palo Alto.

11

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 12 of 40

42.

In addition, work surrounding and preparations for the nonpublic merger involved

personnel in both SAP’s Palo Alto office, where Salis was located, and SAP SE’s headquarters
in Walldorf, where most of Salis’s team members worked. SAP SE policy required personnel
involved in nonpublic merger negotiations to sign agreements prohibiting the disclosure of any
transaction-related information to any third party, entity, or individual. At least 75 SAP SE
employees in Walldorf signed such agreements, and many of these employees became aware of
the potential merger weeks or even months before it was announced.
43.

Employees who did not participate in the SAP-Concur negotiations nevertheless

learned about the negotiations without having signed non-disclosure agreements. These
employees included (1) Salis’s direct supervisor and (2) another employee who reported to the
same supervisor. Specifically, at some time before August 30, 2014, an SAP executive told
Salis’s supervisor about the nonpublic negotiations to prepare her group for the anticipated
merger. The supervisor then told one of her subordinates, whom she tasked with gathering
information internally so that her group would be prepared. Neither Salis’s supervisor nor
Salis’s fellow subordinate signed a non-disclosure agreement.
44.

Within SAP’s Walldorf headquarters office, rumors of the Concur acquisition

circulated. Upon information and belief, employees not otherwise involved in the transaction
learned of it in this manner. Salis communicated regularly with employees in Walldorf
throughout the nonpublic merger negotiations. Specifically, Salis traveled to Walldorf in
July 2014, and he had at least 17 telephone calls or text messages with multiple employees there
from August 1 through August 25, 2014.
45.

While negotiations remained nonpublic and confidential, Salis sought information

about the merger from his direct supervisor. Specifically, he revealed to his direct supervisor at a

12

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 13 of 40

time when the negotiations were nonpublic and confidential that he had heard SAP was going to
acquire Concur and asked her to confirm this information. The supervisor declined to do so.
46.

Salis’s workstation in the Palo Alto office was located in the same building as at

least six SAP employees and executives who knew of the pending merger. Four of these
individuals sat in offices on the same floor as Salis.
47.

An SAP executive in Palo Alto, who had been informed of the nonpublic merger

negotiations no later than August 7, 2014, as well as his assistant, sat steps away from Salis’s
cubicle and shared a common printer and mailroom with him.
48.

Salis had access to over 30 shared folders on SAP network drives located in

Walldorf, Palo Alto, and Newtown Square. Other SAP employees and executives who knew of
the pending merger before it was announced publicly, including other members of Salis’s group,
also had access to many of these shared folders.
49.

As an employee of SAP who gained access to confidential information, Salis

owed a duty to SAP to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Salis, moreover, was
well aware of this duty. Salis’s group had prior experience with and certain responsibilities for
the integration of personnel and other resources obtained through acquisitions. Furthermore,
through Salis’s experience with one particular acquisition, he knew that insider trading around
the time of such a transaction would be subject to close scrutiny.
50.

During October 2013, Salis certified that he had received SAP’s Code of Business

Conduct for Employees and SAP’s Insider Regulations Global Policy prohibiting disclosure of
inside information and trading or recommending trading based upon such information. SAP’s
Code of Business Conduct contained four pages addressing insider trading alone, including a
Q&A section relating to the insider trading policy. The Code states that “It is the policy of SAP

13

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 14 of 40

that an . . . employee who has material, nonpublic information relating to SAP may not . . .
engage in any . . . action to take advantage of, or pass on to others, that information. This policy
also applies to non-public information about any other company that is obtained in the course of
your employment.”
Salis’s Tip of Material, Nonpublic Information to
Douglas Miller and the Millers’ Trades
51.

Salis and Douglas Miller have been friends since at least 1999, when they

attended college together in Indiana. Since college, Salis and the Miller family have remained
close. Salis served as the best man at Douglas Miller’s wedding and as a groomsman at Edward
Miller’s wedding. Douglas and Edward Miller’s mother referred to Salis as a “son.” Salis and
Douglas Miller communicated through periodic telephone calls, emails, and text messages.
52.

The frequency of these contacts increased dramatically in the days preceding the

Millers’ initial purchases of Concur options and continued through the September 18, 2014
merger announcement. Indeed, whereas Salis and Douglas Miller spoke by telephone six times
during the 14-week period from May 1 to August 14, 2014, they exchanged over 60 calls during
the five weeks between August 15 and September 26, 2014.
53.

During these calls in August and September 2014, Salis shared material,

nonpublic information with Douglas Miller regarding SAP’s acquisition of Concur. Salis
disclosed this information to Douglas Miller with the understanding and expectation that
Douglas Miller would use it to trade Concur securities.
54.

Douglas Miller then tipped other longtime friends of Salis, namely, Edward

Miller, his parents, Biehl, and Friend 1, each of whom quickly joined the scheme to profit from
Salis’s inside information.

14

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 15 of 40

55.

During the evening on Friday, August 15, 2014, Salis called Douglas Miller. By

this time, as alleged above, Concur had rejected SAP’s $120 per share offer, which represented a
28% premium over Concur’s share price, and SAP had asked Concur to provide additional
financial information.
56.

That night, Douglas Miller sent his father a text message suggesting that Douglas

Miller was aware he had just received nonpublic information from Salis in breach of a duty.
Douglas Miller wrote, “I usually tell nobody Dad . . . But I figured you and Mells [Edward
Miller] could use a little taste but you’ll know nothing about the name . . . to keep in dark.”
57.

The very next business day, Monday, August 18, 2014, Douglas and Edward

Miller each opened new Scottrade brokerage accounts.
58.

Two days later, on August 20, 2014, the Millers’ mother reactivated an existing

but long-dormant Scottrade account she held jointly with her husband (Douglas and Edward
Miller’s father).
59.

On the evening of August 24, 2014, after Concur’s board of directors had directed

Concur’s executives to try to negotiate an agreement at a price of $129 per share, Salis again
telephoned Douglas Miller. The two spoke for approximately 22 minutes. Immediately
afterward, Douglas Miller called Edward Miller, spoke to him for more than 17 minutes, and
then called his mother and spoke to her for more than nine minutes.
60.

The next morning, August 25, 2014, Douglas Miller attempted an electronic funds

transfer from his checking account into his Scottrade account and requested authorization from
Scottrade to trade options. He then placed telephone calls to Edward Miller and his mother, who
both then also called Scottrade to request authorization to trade options in their accounts.

15

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 16 of 40

61.

Between the two calls placed to Edward Miller and his mother, Douglas Miller

called Salis, notwithstanding that it was before 6:30 a.m. for Salis. Later that morning, Salis
placed numerous telephone calls to Douglas Miller, each lasting less than three minutes.
62.

Although Douglas Miller had attempted to transfer funds into his Scottrade

account, the funds were not yet available for options trades. After a telephone conversation with
Salis, Douglas Miller called Scottrade and learned that he would be unable to trade options until
his deposit cleared, which would take three business days. Douglas Miller again called Salis and
immediately thereafter called Edward Miller and then his mother.
63.

Meanwhile, Salis logged into Douglas Miller’s Scottrade account from a donut

shop in Palo Alto, California, just three miles from the SAP office where Salis worked. Upon
information and belief, Salis was monitoring Douglas Miller’s account because of his personal
financial interest in the success of Douglas Miller’s trades.
64.

Neither the Millers nor their parents had traded securities for years. Upon

information and belief, Edward Miller had never had a brokerage account. Douglas Miller’s
Scottrade account had been closed since 2011 for lack of activity. Their parents’ account had
been dormant since at least 2006 and had a value of only $0.01 in cash.
65.

Concerned that they would miss the opportunity to profit from Salis’s tip, within

three days, the Millers and their parents sought alternate ways to fund their accounts. On August
25, 2014, the Millers and their mother spoke by telephone with Scottrade representatives at least
eleven times. Douglas Miller urgently explained to a Scottrade representative on a recorded line
that his family wanted to trade that day: “I have me and a couple of people. . . . Me, my brother,
and my mom opened up Scottrade accounts. We were trying to do options. We got approved for
options. . . . We were trying to do something today.” Douglas and Edward Miller spoke with

16

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 17 of 40

multiple Scottrade representatives about the fastest way to fund their accounts. Douglas Miller
stated that he was willing to bring cash to his local Scottrade branch office, but was informed
that cash could not be accepted.
66.

Having learned that Scottrade would not accept cash, Douglas and Edward Miller

and their mother drove approximately 30 minutes to their nearest Scottrade branch office and
presented cashier’s checks for deposit, which they had purchased earlier that day in amounts of
$9,800, $6,000 and $8,000, respectively. They chose these amounts in an attempt to avoid
detection of their scheme. As Douglas Miller later recalled in a text message to Edward Miller in
which they discussed their Concur trades, “We all tried to fly under the radar of investing under
10k bro.”
67.

Ultimately, the Millers’ checks did not clear until after the markets closed on

August 25, 2014. That evening, Salis called Douglas Miller, and they spoke for approximately
21 minutes, at which point they dialed Edward Miller into the call. The call lasted for
approximately 14 more minutes with Salis, Douglas Miller, and Edward Miller all on the line
together. By the end of the call, Douglas Miller had logged into his Scottrade account at least
14 times that day.
68.

Shortly after the call with Salis and Edward Miller, Douglas Miller logged into his

Scottrade account again and placed an order to purchase 69 Concur call options with a strike
price of $110 and an expiration date of October 18, 2014 for $9,660. He also placed an order
purchase eight Concur call options with a strike price of $115 and an expiration date of
September 20, 2014, for $56.
69.

Douglas Miller placed these trades on the basis of material, nonpublic information

about SAP’s acquisition of Concur, which Salis disclosed to Douglas Miller in breach of a duty.

17

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 18 of 40

70.

Salis knew or was reckless in not knowing that Douglas Miller would trade on the

basis of the material, nonpublic information disclosed by Salis.
71.

Douglas Miller knew, consciously avoided knowing, was reckless in not knowing,

or should have known that Salis had disclosed material, nonpublic information about the Concur
acquisition in breach of a duty. Douglas Miller further knew, consciously avoided knowing, was
reckless in not knowing, or should have known that Salis had done so for a personal benefit or to
make a gift of confidential information.
72.

Immediately thereafter, Douglas Miller entered a similar order for Concur call

options costing $5,703 in Edward Miller’s account. Upon information and belief, Douglas
Miller placed the trades in Edward Miller’s account with Edward Miller’s knowledge and
consent. The order occurred just seconds after Edward Miller had signed out of the account.
Upon information and belief, Edward Miller had logged out of his account so that his brother
could place the trade.
73.

The trades in Edward Miller’s account were made on the basis of material,

nonpublic information about SAP’s acquisition of Concur, which Salis disclosed to Douglas
Miller in breach of a duty and which Douglas Miller in turn disclosed to Edward Miller.
Douglas and Edward Miller knew, consciously avoided knowing, were reckless in not knowing,
or should have known that Salis had disclosed the material, nonpublic information in breach of a
duty. Douglas and Edward Miller further knew, consciously avoided knowing, were reckless in
not knowing, or should have known that Salis had done so for a personal benefit or to make a gift
of confidential information.
74.

The next day, on August 26, 2014, Douglas Miller telephoned his mother. Then,

Douglas Miller placed orders in his parents’ account to purchase 79 call options in the same

18

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 19 of 40

October series as those purchased in Douglas Miller’s own account. These purchases cost
$7,867.
75.

Upon information and belief, Douglas Miller placed these trades in his parents’

account with at least his mother’s knowledge and consent. These trades were made on the basis
of material, nonpublic information about SAP’s acquisition of Concur, which Salis provided to
Douglas Miller in breach of a duty. Douglas Miller knew, consciously avoided knowing, was
reckless in not knowing, or should have known that Salis had disclosed the material, nonpublic
information in breach of a duty. He further knew, consciously avoided knowing, was reckless in
not knowing, or should have known that Salis had done so for a personal benefit or to make a gift
of confidential information. Also on August 26, 2014, Edward Miller deposited a second
cashier’s check for $3,700 into his Scottrade account.
76.

The following day, on August 27, 2014, Douglas Miller placed orders in Edward

Miller’s account to purchase 40 call options in the same October series and 12 call options in the
same September series as those purchased in Douglas Miller’s own account. These purchases
cost $3,847. Upon information and belief, Douglas Miller placed these trades in Edward
Miller’s account with Edward Miller’s knowledge and consent. These trades were made on the
basis of material, nonpublic information about SAP’s acquisition of Concur, which Salis
provided to Douglas Miller in breach of a duty and which Douglas Miller in turn disclosed to
Edward Miller. Douglas and Edward Miller knew, consciously avoided knowing, were reckless
in not knowing, or should have known that Salis had disclosed the material, nonpublic
information in breach of a duty. They further knew, consciously avoided knowing, were reckless
in not knowing, or should have known that Salis had done so for a personal benefit or to make a
gift of confidential information.

19

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 20 of 40

77.

That same day, Douglas Miller placed an additional order in his parents’ account

to purchase one more call option in the same October series as those purchased in Douglas
Miller’s own account. This purchase cost $98. Upon information and belief, Douglas Miller
placed this trade in his parents’ account with at least his mother’s knowledge and consent. This
trade was made on the basis of material, nonpublic information about SAP’s acquisition of
Concur, which Salis provided to Douglas Miller in breach of a duty. Douglas Miller knew,
consciously avoided knowing, was reckless in not knowing, or should have known that Salis had
disclosed the material, nonpublic information in breach of a duty. He further knew, consciously
avoided knowing, was reckless in not knowing, or should have known that Salis had done so for
a personal benefit or to make a gift of confidential information.
78.

The Millers’ options purchases were extremely aggressive and risky. Moreover,

the Millers used the entirety of their available funds in their accounts to purchase these options.
As alleged above, the September 20, 2014 contracts had a strike price of $115, and the October
18, 2014 contracts had a strike price of $110. When the Millers made their purchases, Concur’s
stock was trading at approximately $99.86 per share. Therefore, if Concur’s share price failed to
increase by more than $15 in the next 26 days or more than $10 in the next 54 days, the options
would expire worthless, and each of them would lose almost $10,000.
79.

The trading also was aberrant for the Millers. Upon information and belief, none

of them had placed any securities trades recently. Indeed, to place their trades, they needed to
open new accounts or, in the case of the Millers’ parents, to activate a dormant account. They
also did not have a history of trading options, other than the Business Objects trades by Douglas
Miller described below. Moreover, as further alleged below, Douglas Miller lacked a basic

20

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 21 of 40

understanding of options trading and options terminology as shown by his conversation with a
Scottrade representative on September 18, 2014.
80.

At the time the Millers purchased these Concur call options, they were facing

financial hardships caused by the poor performance of their car wash business.
81.

In a September 2014 email to Edward Miller, Douglas Miller lamented the recent

performance of their business. Douglas Miller stated that business had been “absolutely Terrible
for a Year now since Last Oct[ober].” Douglas Miller explained to his brother that “[o]ur Bills
have increased . . . $1,000 a Month,” “Moms loaned burred [sic] us for the Past 18 months at
$4,100,” and
if that happens again it will FINISH all our reserves! Thats not a
joke…. If it happens again it will Finish our reserves!!! . . . We
pray at this pt we can make it through winter with breaking even or
at least not suffering Massive Loses [sic]… If same as last year I’m
not sure what we can do… It would be me borrowing on my
personal Credit Cards at that pt…
82.

Douglas Miller further explained that “The Stock Market is at an All Time

High . . . IF, the DOW takes affect (Which it Will) and Drops 25% then its all over.”
83.

Despite their strained financial circumstances and Douglas Miller’s prediction of

a stock market decline, Douglas and Edward Miller together bet over $19,330 on risky short-term
Concur call options, which Douglas Miller referred to as “Our Possible Savior: Cali’s Stock.”
84.

Referring to their Concur trades, Douglas Miller added,
This is what we all need to weather any storm and put us on top
bro! Just make sure your [sic] a squirrel and sock it away… 1
thing I’m sure of is this business will be taking MASSIVE losses
to Cancel out Allot [sic] of Capital Gains… Thats [sic] the
Accountants [sic] Job but the [car] Wash is WAY upside down
besides all the basic Deductions… I hope were [sic] dancing in the
streets in the next 4 – 5 Weeks!

Biehl and Friend 1 Join the Insider Trading Scheme
85.

On August 27, 2014, the insider trading scheme expanded. After having

purchased Concur options in the prior days and after multiple calls with Salis that day, Douglas
Miller spoke to Biehl by telephone for more than 10 minutes. Upon information and belief,
Douglas Miller told Biehl about SAP’s impending, nonpublic acquisition of Concur.
86.

Douglas Miller again spoke to Biehl and Friend 1 multiple times on September 9,

2014. Following those calls, Biehl and Friend 1 both opened Scottrade brokerage accounts,
which they funded with cashier’s checks for $7,000 and $7,500, respectively. Upon information
and belief, this was a substantial amount of money for Biehl and Friend 1. Biehl did not have
$7,000 in his bank account at the time he purchased his cashier’s check, and the $7,500 that
Friend 1 used for his cashier’s check amounted to more than 78% of the available funds in his
account. Between September 11 and 16, 2014, these funds in Biehl’s and Friend 1’s accounts
were used to purchase risky, short-term, out-of-the-money Concur call options with strike prices
ranging from $115 to $125 and expiration dates of September 20 and October 18, 2014.
87.

The trades in Biehl’s and Friend 1’s accounts were made on the basis of material,

nonpublic information about SAP’s acquisition of Concur, which Salis disclosed to Douglas
Miller in breach of a duty and which Douglas Miller in turn disclosed to Biehl and Friend 1.
Biehl knew, consciously avoided knowing, was reckless in not knowing, or should have known
that the information received from Douglas Miller about the Concur acquisition constituted
material, nonpublic information that Salis had disclosed in breach of a duty. Biehl further knew,
consciously avoided knowing, was reckless in not knowing, or should have known that Salis had
done so for a personal benefit or to make a gift of confidential information.
88.

All of the trades in Biehl’s account, and all but one set of trades in Friend 1’s

account, were made online by Douglas Miller. Upon information and belief, Douglas Miller
22

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 23 of 40

placed these trades with the knowledge and consent of Biehl and Friend 1. These trades often
occurred during or shortly after telephone calls between Douglas Miller and the respective
account holders. Biehl and Friend 1 also frequently accessed their own accounts.
89.

Biehl’s and Friend 1’s positions in Concur call options were risky and aggressive.

Their trades implied that they anticipated a share price increase from approximately $110 to
$115 within the next week and from $110 to $120 within the next month. Biehl and Friend 1
would lose approximately $1,150 and $530, respectively, if a $5 price increase did not occur by
September 20, 2014. Moreover, they stood to lose the remaining value of their options positions
if Concur’s share price did not increase by more than $10 by October 18, 2014.
90.

Demonstrating Salis’s continued interest in Douglas and Edward Miller’s trades,

Salis logged into their brokerage accounts multiple times during this same approximate time
period, both from his home and from a donut shop near his office in Palo Alto. Upon
information and belief, Salis was monitoring the Millers’ options trades. Salis checked the
account balances and obtained details on the accounts’ trading activities and open positions.
Salis also spoke to Douglas Miller at least once on each of these days, including one
conversation lasting more than 43 minutes.
91.

Over the next several days, Edward Miller and his parents added to their

aggressive Concur options positions. On September 12, 15, and 17, Douglas Miller purchased
additional September and October call options with strike prices of $115 and $120 in Edward
Miller’s and his parents’ account. Upon information and belief, Douglas Miller placed these
trades in Edward Miller’s and his parents’ accounts with Edward Miller’s and his mother’s
knowledge and consent. Concur’s stock was trading between $107 and $108 per share. Each
purchase was preceded by a call from Salis to Douglas Miller. Each trade was made on the basis

23

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 24 of 40

of material, nonpublic information about SAP’s acquisition of Concur, which Salis disclosed to
Douglas Miller and which Douglas Miller in turn disclosed to Edward Miller. Douglas and
Edward Miller knew, consciously avoided knowing, were reckless in not knowing, or should
have known that Salis had disclosed the material, nonpublic information in breach of a duty.
They each further knew, consciously avoided knowing, were reckless in not knowing, or should
have known that Salis had done so for a personal benefit or to make a gift of confidential
information.
92.

On September 17, 2014, the day on which SAP and Concur executed a final

merger agreement, Salis called Douglas Miller. Salis placed the call from Germany at
approximately 2:12 p.m. CDT (9:12 p.m. local Germany time), and the two spoke for
approximately six minutes. At 2:19 p.m. CDT, Douglas Miller called his mother, and they spoke
for approximately eight minutes. At 2:35 p.m. CDT, Douglas Miller called Edward Miller, and
they spoke for approximately 11 minutes and 30 seconds. Over the next hour, Douglas Miller
accessed both his parents’ and Edward Miller’s online brokerage accounts and purchased Concur
call options set to expire in three days, including one $120 call option that would expire
worthless unless Concur’s share price rose more than $12. Upon information and belief,
Douglas Miller placed these trades in Edward Miller’s and his parents’ accounts with Edward
Miller’s and his mother’s knowledge and consent. These trades were made on the basis of
material, nonpublic information about SAP’s acquisition of Concur, which Salis disclosed to
Douglas Miller and which Douglas Miller in turn disclosed to Edward Miller and his parents.
Douglas and Edward Miller each knew, consciously avoided knowing, were reckless in not
knowing, or should have known that Salis had disclosed the material, nonpublic information in
breach of a duty. They each further knew, consciously avoided knowing, were reckless in not

24

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 25 of 40

knowing, or should have known that Salis had done so for a personal benefit or to make a gift of
confidential information.
The Public Announcement and the Defendants’ Acts of Concealment
93.

On Thursday, September 18, 2014, SAP and Concur executed the final merger

agreement. At 5:09 p.m. EDT that day, the companies publicly announced the merger.
94.

Hours before the announcement, revealing his knowledge of the upcoming but

still secret merger announcement, Douglas Miller called Scottrade on a recorded line and asked
for advice on how to sell his options positions. He asked, “I was just trying to prepare myself if
something happened, how you would actually sell [options] in your account, like how you
would actually go about doing that?” (Emphasis added.) He asked the Scottrade representative
to explain certain options terminology, such as “sell to open” and “sell to close.”
95.

After the call to Scottrade and before the merger announcement, Douglas Miller

and Salis spoke at least four more times.
96.

Before the merger announcement, Concur’s stock closed at $107.08 per share.

After the announcement, Concur’s stock price rose over 18% in after-hours trading. On
September 19, 2014, the opening price was $127.53, and trading volume rose 4,197% from the
prior day. The price reached an intra-day high of $127.55 and closed at $126.82, which was an
18.4% gain from the prior day’s close.
97.

Immediately after the merger announcement, Salis, who was still in Germany,

called the Millers at their carwash. Douglas Miller then called his mother, Biehl, and Friend 1,
as he had done numerous times after previous calls with Salis.
98.

On September 20, 2014, Salis logged into Edward Miller’s brokerage account

twice and spoke to Douglas Miller in between those two logins.

25

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 26 of 40

99.

Within the next few days, each of the Trading Defendants, the Millers’ parents,

and Friend 1 closed their Concur positions, collectively realizing approximately $505,332 in
illegal trading profits.
100.

Each of the traders then began to withdraw their illegal proceeds. Douglas Miller,

Edward Miller, Biehl, and Friend 1 initially withdrew amounts ranging from $7,500 to $9,985
via checks or wire transfers and then withdrew the remaining proceeds in lump sums. The
Millers’ parents withdrew $156,814.48, the entirety of their proceeds, by check dated September
22, 2014. By the end of the day on October 16, 2014, the Trading Defendants had withdrawn all
of their proceeds.
101.

Upon information and belief, from September 26, 2014, through the filing of this

Complaint, the Trading Defendants have not placed any additional trades in their brokerage
accounts. Indeed, the Concur trades were the only trades ever placed in these brokerage
accounts.
Salis’s Payoff
102.

Through Salis’s breach of duty to SAP, he enriched himself and his friends. As

discussed below, Salis shared in their profits through a convoluted series of cash and noncash
transactions made by and with the Trading Defendants and the Millers’ parents.
103.

On September 25, 2014, Douglas Miller, Friend 1, and Biehl traveled to San

Francisco, less than 25 miles from Salis’s home in San Mateo. That day, Douglas Miller
telephoned Salis, who had returned from Germany.
104.

While in San Francisco, Biehl withdrew $1,200, and Friend 1 withdrew $800,

from ATMs. On September 26, while his friends were still in town, Salis made three ATM cash
deposits totaling $4,900 at his Wells Fargo Bank branch in San Mateo. Upon information and

26

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 27 of 40

belief, Douglas Miller and Biehl compensated Salis during that trip for the illicit tip about the
Concur acquisition.
105.

Before returning to Indiana on September 29, 2014, from his trip to San

Francisco, Douglas Miller sent a text message to his father stating that “Chris [Salis] is coming
to my house in Indiana in 3 weeks for some money and to go over more… Chris is excited...
Very... Almost half of his time is spent on this not his job... I'll know allot [sic] more by the time
I get home.” Upon information and belief, Salis’s “time” was being spent on his early-stage
start-up company, EndowCloud.
106.

Consistent with Douglas Miller’s text message to his father, Salis travelled to

Dyer, Indiana on October 19, 2014.
107.

During or in connection with Salis’s trip to Indiana, Douglas Miller, his mother,

and Biehl engaged in a series of financial transactions that, upon information and belief, were
designed wholly or partially for Salis’s benefit. Specifically:
a.

Douglas Miller signed a $9,700 check he had received from Scottrade over
to his wife, and then his wife deposited the check into a bank account held
in her name on October 14, 2014. Douglas Miller’s wife then withdrew
$6,000 cash in $100 bills.

b.

Biehl withdrew from his personal checking account $4,700 in cash and
also purchased two $9,500 cashier’s checks, one payable to Douglas
Miller and the other payable to Douglas Miller’s wife, on October 15,
2014.

c.

Douglas Miller took one of the cashier’s checks from Biehl, deposited it
the same day, and then withdrew $9,300 in $100 bills.

27

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 28 of 40

d.

Biehl also withdrew $7,800 in cash from his personal checking account on
October 20, 2014.

e.

Douglas Miller’s mother withdrew $9,200 in cash from her personal
checking account on October 18, 2014.

108.

Upon information and belief, Salis received some or all of this cash as a payoff

for the illicit Concur stock tip. Salis later told representatives of SAP that while he was in
Indiana, Douglas Miller handed him $10,000 in cash and Salis understood this money to serve as
a thank you.
109.

At the end of his visit to Indiana, on the way to Chicago O’Hare International

Airport for his return flight to California on October 21, Salis stopped at a branch office of his
bank. Salis deposited approximately $10,400 into his personal checking account, which, upon
information and belief, represented funds received from Douglas Miller, Douglas Miller’s
mother, and Biehl.
110.

Salis’s deposit of $10,400 consisted of $7,500 in cash and $2,900 in United

States Postal Service money orders. The money orders deposited by Salis were purchased the
day before by two men at the post office in Munster, Indiana. The men first sought to purchase
$6,000 worth of money orders using cash but, when told that any amount over $3,000 would
require the completion of forms that would make a record of the transaction, they changed their
request to an amount less than the $3,000 documentation threshold, specifically, $2,900. The
two men told the postal clerk that the money represented gambling winnings from a riverboat.
Upon information and belief, this was false, and the cash was derived from the illegal insider
trading scheme described in this Complaint.

28

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 29 of 40

111.

Upon information and belief, Salis received additional cash from Douglas Miller,

Douglas Miller’s mother, and Biehl, and carried it with him when he returned to San Francisco
on October 21, 2014. In an email to Douglas Miller from the airport, Salis wrote, “I am through
security . . . . Ps. Half in my bag, half in my pockets…no problem.” Upon information and
belief, Salis’s email referred to his possession of cash received from Douglas Miller. Douglas
Miller replied, “Love it! I miss you already . . . Please, let me know how and when your [sic]
using the money.”
112.

Upon information and belief, Salis deposited a portion of this cash and other

funds that he received from the Trading Defendants and the Millers’ mother into his bank
account. Specifically, between November 25, 2014, and March 9, 2015, Salis deposited $32,500
in cash into his personal checking account via a series of ATM and counter deposits ranging in
size from $200 to $6,800.
113.

In March 2015, in a series of text messages, Douglas Miller and Edward Miller

discussed their Concur trading and their resulting tax liabilities from the illegal profits. Douglas
Miller wrote, “I’ll explain to Salis and we’ll cover the difference . . . You still made like 45k
after all this take home . . . We just wanted to get greedy and not give to govt . . . It’s still a
massive win for all.” Douglas Miller later added, “Our parents find out they pay nothing and
your acct with us owes 40k . . . Which effects [sic] you but also Salis and me . . . Then again we
all were trying to make 20 – 30k each not the craziness that happened.”
114.

Douglas Miller then described a conversation that he had with Salis about the

payments to Salis in exchange for the Concur tip, writing: “I told Salis about taxes . . . He didn’t
even bat an eye . . . He said take it out of our money and pay eddie . . . I said figured and already
done.”

29

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 30 of 40

115.

Following these texts, Douglas Miller and Biehl traveled to California again, upon

information and belief, at least in part to give Salis more cash. On April 7, 2015, Douglas Miller
checked into a hotel in San Francisco. On April 10, 2015, Douglas Miller texted his brother,
“Saying goodby [sic] to Salis now.” Four days later, on April 14, 2015, Salis deposited $8,900
in cash into an ATM.
116.

Including this $8,900 deposit, Salis deposited a total of $56,700 cash into his

personal checking account from September 26, 2014, through April 14, 2015, via a series of
22 ATM and counter deposits ranging in size from $200 to $8,900, sometimes making up to five
separate deposits in a single day. During the same period, the Trading Defendants and the
Millers’ mother withdrew more than $70,000 in cash from their respective bank accounts. Upon
information and belief, some or all of the cash deposits made by Salis represented funds received
from the Trading Defendants and the Millers’ mother in connection with the illegal insider
trading scheme.
117.

Shortly after these deposits, on April 17, 2015, Salis recertified that he had read

and understood SAP’s Code of Business Conduct, which included SAP’s Insider Regulations
Global Policy, and would comply with the same.
118.

In addition to the cash payments to Salis, the Millers and their mother each made

substantial payments to Salis’s early-stage startup company, EndowCloud. In May 2015,
Douglas Miller wrote a $45,000 check, and his parents wrote a $35,000 check to EndowCloud.
Salis deposited these funds into EndowCloud’s bank account, which Salis opened on June 5,
2015. Edward Miller subsequently paid Douglas Miller two separate cashier’s checks totaling
$8,000, both of which included the notation, “Endow Cloud Investment.” That same day,
Edward Miller also obtained a cashier’s check for $7,000 payable to Douglas Miller’s wife, with

30

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 31 of 40

the notation that it was for Edward Miller and his wife’s “investment.” Upon information and
belief, these payments in whole or in part were compensation to Salis in exchange for the Concur
tip.
Deception when Confronted about the Trading
119.

On September 18, 2014, while discussing the withdrawal of his illegal profits with

a Scottrade representative, Douglas Miller stated:
I was following that forever; I thought I was going to lose that in
September for sure. . . . It’s kind of like a long shot that came in. I
worked with EMC and all those companies for all these years and
everything like that so I’m pretty familiar with all the technology
world and everything like that. I worked at SAP, I even worked
back in the day with WorldCom when it went under, you know, the
bankruptcy 8 to 12 years ago. It was a good run, you know, it was
fun. . . . My brother has an account with you too, he was a part of
this too. We’re looking at this tech startup with a few of our
buddies out in California. This could be some funding toward that.
. . . We’re doing some more transactions over there and trying
some other crazy stuff.
120.

Upon information and belief, and contrary to the statements made to Scottrade,

Douglas Miller never worked for SAP and had not previously followed Concur’s stock
performance. By this deception, Douglas Miller sought to prevent detection of the insider
trading scheme.
121.

On July 15, 2015, two U.S. Postal Inspectors confronted Douglas Miller and

asked him about his Concur trades and his familiarity with Salis. Douglas Miller lied and said
(1) he had independently been following Concur; (2) he bought the Concur options without Salis;
(3) he only spoke to Salis a few times a year; (4) he did not know if he spoke to Salis when he
purchased the Concur options in August 2014; and (5) he did not know that he, his family, and
his friends had made over $500,000 by trading Concur options. In truth, Douglas Miller learned
of the Concur acquisition from Salis, spoke with Salis at least 10 times the day he placed his first

31

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 32 of 40

Concur trades, spoke with Salis more than 60 times in August and September 2014, met with
Salis at least three times in-person in the eight months following the Concur trades, and
exchanged over 3,500 text messages with Salis that year. Further, Douglas Miller placed nearly
all of the trades of the Trading Defendants, his parents, and Friend 1 and sent text messages
regarding their profits.
122.

On July 29, 2015, SAP representatives asked Salis about an investigation by the

Securities and Exchange Commission into insider trading. Salis falsely stated that he did not
know whether Douglas Miller had traded. Salis also falsely told SAP representatives that he first
learned that SAP intended to acquire Concur the day before the public announcement, when, in
fact, before that date Salis had told his supervisor that he had heard that SAP was going to
acquire Concur.
123.

When SAP representatives again confronted Salis a few weeks later, Salis

admitted that he had lied about his knowledge of Douglas Miller’s trading in Concur securities.
Salis stated that (1) he had in fact known Douglas Miller and his family and friends had traded in
advance of the merger announcement, and (2) he had helped Douglas Miller to place the Concur
trades by logging into Douglas Miller’s account and counseling him regarding the trades.
Prior Insider Trading Involving Salis and Douglas Miller
124.

Almost seven years before the scheme to profit from illegal trades in Concur call

options, in October 2007, Salis and Douglas Miller carried out a similar scheme to profit from
material, nonpublic information concerning Salis’s then-employer.
125.

Throughout 2007, Salis’s employer was Business Objects, where he worked as a

marketing director in the company’s San Jose office. On July 17, 2007, SAP AG, now known as
SAP SE, contacted Business Objects to explore a possible business combination between the two

32

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 33 of 40

companies. Discussions and negotiations between the two companies progressed throughout the
summer, and Business Objects also pursued a possible combination with a second suitor.
126.

During September 2007, substantial steps were taken to commence a tender offer

for the securities of Business Objects. On September 8, 2007, Business Objects and SAP AG
entered into a confidentiality agreement. On September 21, 2007, a special committee of
Business Objects’s board of directors instructed Business Objects’s representatives to request
that SAP AG and the other suitor submit final proposals no later than October 1, 2007. On
September 23, 2007, two days after the special committee’s instruction, Business Objects
granted SAP AG access to an electronic data room to continue its due diligence of Business
Objects.
127.

By the time that SAP AG and Business Objects undertook these substantial steps

toward a tender offer, Salis had moved his office to the same floor as the Business Objects
executives involved in negotiating the deal. He sat just a few cubicles down from his
supervisor’s office, who herself sat a few offices away from the CEO. No later than
September 9, 2007, one day after the date of the confidentiality agreement between SAP and
Business Objects, Salis’s supervisor learned of the advanced negotiations taking place.
128.

Upon information and belief, Salis learned, through his employment at Business

Objects, material, nonpublic information regarding the Business Objects tender offer
negotiations. Salis had a duty to his employer and its shareholders to keep this information
confidential, not to use this information for personal gain, not to trade on the basis of the
information, and not to disclose it to anyone else in circumstances in which he could reasonably
expect that the information would be used as the basis for securities transactions.

33

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 34 of 40

129.

On October 1, 2007, Business Objects received nonbinding indications of interest

from SAP AG and the other suitor to acquire Business Objects in a tender offer.
130.

Also on October 1, 2007, Douglas Miller reopened a dormant Scottrade account,

which had been closed earlier that year for lack of activity, and applied for authorization to trade
options.
131.

On October 2, 2007, Business Objects determined to pursue discussions

exclusively with SAP AG.
132.

Also on October 2, 2007, Douglas Miller deposited a $9,900 check into his

Scottrade account.
133.

On October 3 and 4, 2007, Salis accessed Douglas Miller’s online Scottrade

account from California and used all of the available funds to purchase 52 Business Objects call
options with strike prices of $45 and $50 and an October 20, 2007 expiration date. At the time,
Business Objects was trading between $46.77 and $47.56 per share. Upon information and
belief, Salis accessed Douglas Miller’s account and executed the trades with Douglas Miller’s
knowledge and consent.
134.

Douglas Miller knew, consciously avoided knowing, was reckless in not knowing,

or should have known that Salis placed these trades on the basis of material, nonpublic
information and in breach of a duty. Douglas Miller knew, consciously avoided knowing, was
reckless in not knowing, or should have known that Salis had done so for a personal benefit or to
make a gift of confidential information.
135.

When Salis purchased the Business Objects call options in Douglas Miller’s

account, Salis knew of material, nonpublic information regarding the tender offer for Business
Objects through his employment at Business Objects.

34

USDC IN/ND case 2:16-cv-00231 document 1 filed 06/16/16 page 35 of 40

136.

Salis communicated the material, nonpublic information to Douglas Miller with

the understanding and expectation that it would be used as the basis for securities transactions.
137.

Days after Salis executed the trades in Douglas Miller’s brokerage account, from

October 4 through October 6, 2007, representatives of SAP AG and Business Objects met in
London to negotiate the tender offer agreement. These representatives flew to London in
advance of these negotiations, and the representatives included Salis’s supervisor and other
Business Objects executives who had offices on the same floor as Salis.
138.

On Sunday, October 7, 2007, SAP AG and Business Objects executed a Tender

Offer Agreement and jointly announced SAP AG’s $6.8 billion tender offer to acquire Business
Objects for approximately $59 per share.
139.

On Monday, October 8, 2007, Business Objects’s share price increased on news

of SAP AG’s tender offer. During the afternoon that day, Salis again accessed Douglas Miller’s
Scottrade account and closed all of the open Business Objects options positions, realizing
approximately $42,296 in profits. The closing price of Business Objects shares was $57.83.
140.

Over the next month, Douglas Miller withdrew nearly all of the illicit profits via

five separate checks in amounts between $8,500 and $9,900. Upon information and belief,
Douglas Miller withdrew the profits using multiple checks under $10,000 in an effort to avoid
detection of his and Salis’s insider trading scheme.

possession of material, nonpublic information relating to the tender offer, which information he
knew or had reason to know was nonpublic and had been acquired directly or indirectly from the

acting on behalf of the offering company or issuer, purchased or sold or caused to be purchased
or sold securities of Business Objects.
149.

Objects tender offer to Douglas Miller under circumstances in which it was reasonably
foreseeable that the communication was likely to result in the purchase or sale of securities of
Business Objects.
