ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
AS TO CEYONIQ AG

On February 17, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. This proceeding has already ended with respect to all respondents but Ceyoniq AG
(n/k/a Ceyoniq, Inc.). See Ceyoniq AG, Initial Decision Release No. 999, 2016 SEC
LEXIS 1346 (ALJ Apr. 12, 2016), finality order, Exchange Act Release No. 77986, 2016
SEC LEXIS 1969 (June 3, 2016). A telephonic prehearing conference is scheduled for
October 31, 2016, at 11:00 a.m. EDT.
I previously granted the Division of Enforcement leave to serve Ceyoniq AG with
the OIP by publication in the International New York Times newspaper. Ceyoniq AG,
Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4097, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3048 (ALJ Aug. 26, 2016). On
October 6, 2016, an affidavit from the International New York Times was filed, attaching a
legal notice addressed to Ceyoniq AG. The affidavit states that the notice was published in
the International New York Times on September 9, 16, 23, and 30, 2016. I find that
Ceyoniq AG was served with the OIP by September 30, 2016, in accordance with 17
C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(iv), and its answer was due by October 11, 2016. See OIP at 3; 17
C.F.R. §§ 201.160(a), .220(b). To date, Ceyoniq AG has not filed an answer.
Accordingly, I ORDER that by October 24, 2016, Ceyoniq AG shall SHOW
CAUSE why the registration of its securities should not be revoked by default due to its
failure to file an answer or otherwise defend this proceeding. If Ceyoniq AG fails to
respond to this order, it will be deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined agaist

it, and the registration of its securities will be revoked.
§§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).

OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R.
