In the Matter of

NOTICE OF PROPOSED
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
AND OPPORTUNITY
FOR COMMENT

Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission’s (“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans
(“Rules”), 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103, that the Division of Enforcement has submitted to the
Commission a proposed plan (the “Plan”) for the distribution of monies paid in the abovecaptioned matter.
On August 14, 2014 the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist
Order (“Order”) against Linkbrokers Derivatives LLC (“Linkbrokers” or “Respondent”).1
The Order found, among other things, that certain employees of Linkbrokers working at the
firm’s “Cash Desk” perpetrated a scheme by charging certain firm customers false prices on
over 36,000 transactions from at least 2005 through at least February 2009 (“Relevant
Period”). In these transactions, Linkbrokers embedded hidden profits in the form of price
markups or markdowns into the execution price reported to the customer. The scheme was
devious and difficult for Linkbrokers’ customers to detect, in part because the employees at
Linkbrokers selectively engaged in the scheme when the volatility in the market was sufficient
to conceal the fraud from the customer. The Order found Linkbrokers willfully violated
Section 15(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), which prohibits
fraudulent conduct by a broker or dealer when effecting any transaction in, or inducing or
attempting to induce the purchase or sale of, any security. As a result of the scheme, the
Commission found that Linkbrokers fraudulently charged customers over $18 million.2 The
Order required Respondent to pay disgorgement of $14,000,000.

The staff calculated the specific amount as $18,651,678.

On December 11, 2015, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative
and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933,
Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 9(b) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-andDesist Order (“Nowak Order”) against Aaron Nowak, a registered representative associated
with Linkbrokers during the Relevant Period.3 Nowak worked as a sales trader and middleoffice assistant entering orders he received from sales brokers on the Cash Desk. The
Commission found that Nowak and other Linkbrokers personnel communicated false and/or
misleading information to Linkbrokers customers in connection with the scheme. The
Commission also found that Nowak willfully violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the
Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) which prohibits fraudulent conduct in the offer or
sale of securities. The Nowak Order ordered Nowak to pay a civil penalty of $5,000 and
created a Fair Fund for the penalty. The Nowak Order further ordered that the Fair Fund
created for Nowak’s penalty be transferred to this administrative proceeding and combined
with the funds collected in this matter.
Linkbrokers and Nowak have paid the funds as ordered by the Commission, totaling
$14,005,000 (the “Distribution Fund”). The Distribution Fund is subject to the continuing
jurisdiction and control of the Commission and the Distribution Fund has been deposited at
the United States Department of Treasury’s Bureau of Fiscal Service (“BFS”) for investment.

THE PLAN
The Distribution Fund is comprised of the amounts of disgorgement ($14,000,000) and
civil penalties ($5,000) paid by Linkbrokers and Nowak, respectively, to the Commission. As
set forth in the Plan, the proposed methodology allocates the Distribution Fund, less any
reserve for taxes, fees or other expenses of administering the Distribution Fund (“Net
Distribution Fund”), by dividing the total harm for each eligible customer’s account by the
aggregate total harm of all eligible customers’ accounts multiplied by the Net Distribution
Fund. An eligible customer account’s distribution from the Net Distribution Fund will be
adjusted by any money received from restitution funds in any related criminal proceeding.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary
