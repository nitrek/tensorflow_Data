Former Morgan Stanley RMBS Trader Settles Charges
September 26, 2016 – The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Nicholas
Bonacci has agreed to settle charges relating to misstatements he made to customers while a
trader in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) at Morgan Stanley.
An SEC investigation found that Bonacci misled Morgan Stanley customers who were seeking to
buy RMBS about the price at which Morgan Stanley had bought the RMBS and the amount of
Morgan Stanley’s compensation for arranging the trades. The investigation also found that
Bonacci misled purchasers by suggesting he was actively negotiating a transaction between
customers when he was merely selling RMBS out of Morgan Stanley’s inventory.
The SEC’s order finds that Bonacci willfully aided and abetted and caused Morgan Stanley’s
violations of Section 15(c)(1)(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or
denying the findings in the SEC’s order, Bonacci agreed to the entry of a cease-and-desist order
and pay a penalty of $100,000. Bonacci also agreed to a 12 month suspension from the
securities industry.
In determining appropriate relief, the SEC considered several mitigating factors, including
Bonacci’s cooperation with the SEC’s investigation. Bonacci offered significant cooperation by,
among other things, voluntarily providing on multiple occasions truthful, complete and reliable
information about his conduct and that of other market participants. This allowed the SEC to
more efficiently investigate and resolve the charges with him. In addition, Bonacci
acknowledged his misconduct, accepted responsibility and provided SEC staff with credible
assurances against future misconduct.
The SEC’s investigation was conducted by William Finkel with assistance from Kapil Agrawal
and Michael Birnbaum and supervised by Daniel Michael and Michael Osnato.
