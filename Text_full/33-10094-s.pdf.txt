ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-16978
Options Traders Fined and Barred for Spoofing and Order Mismarking
June 13, 2016 – The Securities and Exchange Commission today sanctioned Behruz Afshar and
his twin brother, Shahryar Afshar, and their close friend and former broker, Richard F. Kenny,
IV, all residents of Chicago, for two fraudulent options trading schemes involving the
mismarking of option orders to obtain execution priority and avoid transaction fees charged by
options exchanges and “spoofing” to generate liquidity rebates from an options exchange.
The Afshar brothers and Kenny conducted the schemes through brokerage accounts in the name
of Fineline Trading Group LLC and Makino Capital LLC, companies which the Afshar brothers
owned.
The SEC’s order stems from proceedings instituted against the Afshar brothers, Kenny, Fineline,
and Makino on December 3, 2015. The Afshar brothers, Kenny, Fineline, and Makino, without
admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, consented to the entry of an order finding that each of
them violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) of the Exchange
Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering each of them to cease-and-desist from violating these
provisions, ordering the Afshar brothers and Kenny to pay disgorgement and civil penalties
totaling over $1.89 million, and barring Behruz Afshar and Kenny from the securities industry.
The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Paul E. Kim and Deborah A. Tarasevich of the
Market Abuse Unit with assistance from Mandy B. Sturmfelz and Ainsley Kerr and Division of
Economic and Risk Analysis economists Michael Barnes and Carmen Taveras. The case was
supervised by Robert A. Cohen, Co-Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation was led by
Melissa Armstrong, Frederick L. Block, Mr. Kim, and Rami Sibay with the assistance of Jeffrey
Anderson and Dan Furlano.
