ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on March 30, 2015. The OIP alleges that Respondents violated the
antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 in their operation of three collateral
loan obligation funds (known as the Zohar Funds) by reporting misleading values for the assets
held by the funds and failing to disclose a conflict of interest arising from Lynn Tilton’s
undisclosed approach to categorization of assets. The proceeding was stayed by order of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit between September 17, 2015, and June 2016. See
Tilton v. SEC, 824 F.3d 276, 291 (2d Cir. 2016); Tilton v. SEC, No. 15-2103 (2d Cir.), ECF Nos.
76, 125. The hearing is currently scheduled to commence on October 24, 2016.
Subpoenas directed to MBIA were issued on May 27, 2015, and September 16, 2016, at
Respondents’ request. Under consideration are: (1) Respondents’ October 5, 2016, motion to
compel MBIA to produce documents responsive to the September 16, 2016, subpoena; and (2)
October 20 and 21, 2016, correspondence concerning the service, or lack thereof, of the motion
on MBIA. Whether, or when, service of the motion on MBIA occurred, counsel for MBIA 1 is
now aware of the motion. MBIA will be ordered to respond to the motion by October 28, 2016.
This order shall be served on: Jonathan Hoff and Joshua P. Arnold, Cadwalader, 200
Liberty St., New York, NY 10281.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
