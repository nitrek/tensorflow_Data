ORDER TO SUBMIT
EXHIBIT LIST

I held a sealed hearing in this matter on February 11, 2016, during which a number of
exhibits were admitted into evidence. The Division of Enforcement then filed those exhibits
under seal with the Office of the Secretary on February 12.
To facilitate preparation of a record index, I ORDER the Division by April 15, 2016, to
e-mail my office (but not file) a list of exhibits admitted into evidence during the February 11
hearing.1 The exhibit list should be in MS Excel or Word format and contain columns with the
following information: the exhibit number; a description of the exhibit; the Bates-stamp
numbers, if any; and page(s) in the hearing transcript in which the exhibit was offered and
admitted.
