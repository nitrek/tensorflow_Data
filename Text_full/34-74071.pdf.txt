Respondents.

On October 7, 2010, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment (“Notice”) in connection with this proceeding
(Exchange Act Release No. 63059) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on
Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103. No comments were received
by the Commission in response to the Notice and on December 10, 2010, the Secretary of
the Commission, pursuant to delegated authority, approved the proposed plan of
distribution (“Plan”) (Exchange Act Release No. 63518).
The Fair Fund in this proceeding totaled $55,479,005, consisting of disgorgement,
civil penalties, and accrued interest. The Plan provides that $23,417,366 of the Fair
Fund, representing the total harm to investors in the PIMCO mutual funds, be transferred
to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (“Deutsche Bank’) to be disbursed by the
Fund Administrator to eligible investors according to the methodology set forth in the
Plan. The Plan provides that the Commission will arrange for distribution of the Fair
Fund when a validated payment file listing the payees with the identification information
required to make the distribution has been received and accepted. A total amount of
$20,015,287.98 was distributed directly to investors beginning on May 12, 2011
(Exchange Act Release No. 64477).

The Plan further provides that any monies not distributed to investors may be
distributed to the PIMCO mutual funds, or their successors, harmed by market timing
activity in proportion to the portion of overall harm each fund suffered.1 The Fund
Administrator was unable to distribute a total of $3,404,162.72, which is currently held
by the Commission.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff shall disburse the amount
stated in the validated payment file of $3,404,162.72 as provided for in the Plan.
By the Commission.
Brent J. Fields
Secretary
