Introduction

Proposed Rules Governing the SDR Registration Process, Duties, and Core
Principles, and Form SDR

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a comprehensive new regulatory framework
for security-based swaps (“SBSs”), including the regulation of SDRs. 1 SDRs are required to
collect and maintain accurate SBS transaction data so that relevant authorities can access and
analyze the data from secure, central locations, thereby putting them in a better position to
monitor for potential market abuse and risks to financial stability. On November 19, 2010, the
Commission proposed new Rules 13n-1 to 13n-11 under the Exchange Act governing the SDR
registration process, duties, and core principles, and new Form SDR, through which applicants
would seek to register as SDRs. 2
Subsequently, on May 1, 2013, the Commission issued a proposing release discussing
cross-border SBS activities, including activities involving SDRs. 3 In that release, the

1

Pub. L. No. 111-203, section 761(a) (adding Exchange Act Section 3(a)(75) (defining
SDR)) and section 763(i) (adding Exchange Act Section 13(n) (establishing a regulatory
regime for SDRs)).

Release”).

Commission proposed guidance regarding the application of certain SDR requirements in the
cross-border context; 4 new Rule 13n-12 under the Exchange Act, which would provide certain
SDRs with an exemption from Exchange Act Section 13(n) and the rules and regulations
thereunder; 5 and guidance to specify how SDRs may comply with the notification requirement in
the Exchange Act and how the Commission proposes to determine whether a relevant authority
is appropriate for purposes of receiving SBS data from an SDR. 6 In addition, the Commission
proposed an exemption from the indemnification requirement in the Exchange Act. 7
B.

Related Commission Actions

In conjunction with issuing the Proposing Release on November 19, 2010, the
Commission also proposed Regulation SBSR to implement the Dodd-Frank Act’s provisions
relating to reporting SBS information to SDRs, including standards for the data elements that
must be provided to SDRs. 8 Subsequently, on June 15, 2011, the Commission issued an
exemptive order, which provided guidance and certain exemptions with respect to the
requirements under Title VII, including requirements governing SDRs, which would have had to
be complied with as of July 16, 2011 (i.e., the effective date of Title VII). 9 Later, on June 11,
and Major Security-Based Swap Participants, Exchange Act Release No. 69490 (May 1,
2013), 78 FR 30968 (May 23, 2013) (“Cross-Border Proposing Release”).

10

2012, the Commission issued a statement of general policy on the anticipated sequencing of
compliance dates of final rules to be adopted under Title VII. 10 On May 1, 2013, the
Commission re-proposed Regulation SBSR in the Cross-Border Proposing Release. 11 At the
same time, the Commission reopened the comment period for certain rules proposed under Title
VII, including the SDR Rules and Form SDR, and the Implementation Policy Statement. 12
to Security-Based Swaps, Exchange Act Release No. 64678 (June 15, 2011), 76 FR
36287 (June 22, 2011) (“Effective Date Order”). The Effective Date Order included
temporary exemptions from Exchange Act Sections 13(n)(5)(D)(i), 13(n)(5)(F),
13(n)(5)(G), 13(n)(5)(H), 13(n)(7)(A), 13(n)(7)(B), and 13(n)(7)(C), each of which will
expire on the earlier of (1) the date the Commission grants registration to the SDR and (2)
the earliest compliance date set forth in any of the final rules regarding the registration of
SDRs. Id. at 36306. In addition, the Commission granted temporary exemptions from
Exchange Act Section 29(b) in connection with the above listed provisions of the
Exchange Act until such date as the Commission specifies. Id. at 36307. Section 29(b)
generally provides that contracts made in violation of any provision of the Exchange Act,
or the rules thereunder, shall be void “(1) as regards the rights of any person who, in
violation of any such provision . . . shall have made or engaged in the performance of any
such contract, and (2) as regards the rights of any person who, not being a party to such
contract, shall have acquired any right thereunder with actual knowledge of the facts by
reason of which the making or performance of such contract was in violation of any such
provision . . . .” 15 U.S.C. 78cc(b).

discussed below, has implications on this release. See Application of “Security-Based
Swap Dealer” and “Major Security-Based Swap Participant” Definitions to Cross-Border

(“Reopening Release”).
11

The Commission is concurrently adopting Regulation SBSR in a separate release. 13 The
Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commission to engage in rulemaking for the public dissemination
of SBS transaction, volume, and pricing data, 14 and provides the Commission with discretion to
determine an appropriate approach to implement this important function. Regulation SBSR
requires SDRs to undertake this role. 15
As discussed in the Proposing Release, when considered in conjunction with Regulation
SBSR, the rules that the Commission adopts in this release seek to provide improved
transparency to regulators and the markets through comprehensive regulations for SBS
transaction data and SDRs. 16 In combination, these rules represent a significant step forward in
providing a regulatory framework that promotes transparency and efficiency in the OTC
derivatives markets and creates important infrastructure to assist relevant authorities in
performing their market oversight functions.

One commenter recommended that the Commission “encourage the formation of a

participants have had sufficient opportunities to comment on the Proposing Release and
market participants have taken advantage of these opportunities. Therefore, the
Commission does not believe that a planning group composed of market participants is
necessary.

See, e.g., Barnard, supra note 19 (generally supporting the proposed SDR Rules and
agreeing that establishing SDRs will enhance transparency and promote standardization
in the SBS market); MFA 1, supra note 19 (fully supporting the objectives of the DoddFrank Act and the proposed rules to enhance transparency in the SBS market); Markit,
supra note 19 (supporting the Commission’s objectives of increasing transparency and
efficiency in the OTC derivatives markets and of reducing both systemic and
counterparty risk); DTCC 2, supra note 19 (supporting the Commission’s efforts to
establish a comprehensive new framework for the regulation of SDRs and noting that
“[i]mposing requirements on [SDRs] would promote safety and soundness for all U.S.
markets by bringing increased transparency and oversight to [the SBS market]”); IIB CB,
supra note 26 (believing that “the Commission has appropriately sought to take into
account the greater extent to which the SBS markets are globally interconnected, as well
as the role that foreign regulators therefore must play as the primary supervisors of SBS
market participants based abroad”).

of the comments that it received relating to the proposed rules. 31 As adopted, the SDR Rules and
new Form SDR have been modified from the proposal, in part to respond to these comments. 32
The revisions to each proposed rule are described in more detail throughout this release. The
following are among the most significant changes from the Commission’s proposed rules:
•

Form SDR: In the Proposing Release, the Commission asked whether it should
combine Form SDR and Form SIP such that an SDR would register as an SDR
and a securities information processer (“SIP”) using only one form. 33 After
further consideration and in response to comments received, the Commission has
determined that Form SDR should be modified from the proposal to allow an
SDR to register as both an SDR and SIP on one form. 34

•

Access by Relevant Authorities: The Commission proposed Rules 13n-4(b)(9)
and (10) and Rule 13n-4(d) relating to relevant authorities’ access to SBS data
maintained by SDRs. The Commission has determined not to adopt these rules at
this time and anticipates soliciting additional public comment regarding such
relevant authorities’ access.

•

Automated Systems: The Commission proposed Rule 13n-6 to provide
standards for SDRs with regard to their automated systems’ capacity, resiliency,

31

The Commission also considered certain comments submitted with respect to other
proposed Commission rulemakings, related CFTC rulemakings, and international
initiatives. See Sections I.C and I.D discussing other comments and initiatives
considered in this rulemaking.

As discussed below, comments relating to relevant authorities’ access to SBS data will be
addressed in a separate release.

17

and security. After further consideration, and as explained more fully below, the
Commission has determined to adopt an abbreviated version of proposed Rule
13n-6. 35
•

CCO: In the Proposing Release, the Commission asked whether it should
prohibit officers, directors, or employees of an SDR from, directly or indirectly,
taking any action to coerce, manipulate, mislead, or fraudulently influence the
SDR’s CCO in the performance of his responsibilities. The Commission has
decided to adopt new Rule 13n-11(h).

D.

Other Initiatives Considered in this Rulemaking

The Commission also recognizes the CFTC’s companion efforts in promulgating rules
governing swap data repositories pursuant to Dodd-Frank Act Section 728. The CFTC adopted
final rules on swap data repositories on August 4, 2011. 36 The CFTC also adopted rules
regarding swap data recordkeeping and reporting requirements, some of which pertain to
subjects covered in this release. 37 Commission staff consulted with CFTC staff with respect to
the rules applicable to swap data repositories and SDRs, as well as with prudential regulators, 38

See Dodd-Frank Act Section 712(a)(2) (requiring the Commission to consult and
coordinate to the extent possible with the CFTC and prudential regulators for “the
purposes of assuring regulatory consistency and comparability, to the extent possible”).
18

and the Commission has taken into consideration comments received supporting harmonization
of the CFTC’s rules for swap data repositories with the SDR Rules. 39 The Commission believes
that the final SDR Rules are largely consistent with the rules adopted by the CFTC. 40 While one
commenter recommended adopting joint rules with the CFTC, 41 the Commission has not done

39

See DTCC 2, supra note 19 (recommending that to the extent that there are any
differences, “the Commission and the CFTC should harmonize the regimes that oversee
SDRs” and noting that “harmonization is a more important priority than the exact nature
of the consistent standard, as SDRs can adjust to meet a single standard but not multiple,
inconsistent standards”); DTCC 5, supra note 19 (urging the Commission to harmonize
its rules with the CFTC’s rules by working, to the extent possible, with the CFTC to
minimize the number of regulatory inconsistencies between the two agencies); DTCC
CB, supra note 26 (“Given the significant number of registered entities (execution
platforms, clearinghouses, SDRs, dealers, and major swap participants) that will face dual
oversight, unnecessary distinctions in the registration and regulation of these entities risk
jeopardizing regulatory compliance, add confusion to Dodd-Frank Act implementation,
and ultimately impose unnecessary costs.”); Better Markets CB, supra note 26
(recommending that the Commission “promote harmony with the CFTC’s cross-border
guidance, subject to its primary duty and recognizing that its statutory authority and
jurisdiction is distinct from that of the CFTC” and that the Commission “adopt rules that
are at least as strong as the CFTC’s guidance, consistent with its statutory authority, but
should go further than the CFTC wherever necessary, and again consistent with its
statutory authority, to better fulfill the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act”). But see Better
Markets 2, supra note 19 (recommending that “all of the substantive rule provisions
proposed [as of July 22, 2013] must remain as strong as possible, irrespective of . . . the
CFTC’s approach to the implementation of Title VII”).

40

See DTCC 2, supra note 19 (observing that, with respect to the Commission’s proposed
rules and the CFTC’s proposed rules for swap data repositories, “[t]here appear to be
relatively narrow differences between the Commission’s and the CFTC’s approaches to
the regulation of SDRs”).

41

FSR Implementation, supra note 23 (supporting a Title VII-wide harmonization process
and recommending adopting joint SEC-CFTC rules in areas, such as SDRs, where they
are not required to do so). The commenter stated that the “process of jointly adopting
final rules would ensure consistency on the most critical points. It would also ensure that
final rules are adopted at the same time, so that market participants do not have to bear
the cost of complying with one set of rules before they know whether their actions will be
consistent with the other rules to which they will be subject.” Id.
19

so. Congress did not require the two agencies to engage in joint rulemakings on this topic. 42 In
addition, the CFTC has already adopted its final rules for swap data repositories. 43 The
Commission does not believe that the differences between the rules adopted herein and the
CFTC’s rules regarding swap data repositories will place undue burdens on persons that register
as both SDRs and swap data repositories. 44
Finally, Commission staff has consulted and coordinated with foreign regulators through
bilateral and multilateral discussions, including in groups that have prepared reports related to
SDRs. 45 For example, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (“CPMI”),
formerly known as the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (“CPSS”), 46 and the
International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO,” 47 jointly, “CPSS-IOSCO”)
have issued several reports applicable to SDRs. First, in May 2010, CPSS and the Technical
Committee of IOSCO issued a consultative report that presented a set of factors for trade

definitions).

requirements. 49 Third, in April 2012, CPSS-IOSCO issued a final report that sets forth risk
management and related standards applicable to financial market infrastructures, including trade
repositories (“PFMI Report”). 50 Fourth, in August 2013, CPSS and the Board of IOSCO issued
a report on authorities’ access to trade repository data (“CPSS-IOSCO Access Report”). 51 The
Commission has taken these discussions and reports into consideration in developing the final
SDR Rules and Form SDR. 52

II.

Broad Economic Considerations and Baseline
This section describes the most significant economic considerations that the Commission

has taken into account in adopting Form SDR and the SDR Rules, as well as the baseline for
evaluating the economic effects of the final SDR Rules. The Commission is sensitive to the
economic consequences and effects, including the costs and benefits, of Form SDR and the SDR
Rules. A detailed analysis of the particular economic effects – including the costs and benefits
and the impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation – that may result from Form
SDR and the final SDR Rules is discussed in Section VIII of this release.
A.

Broad Economic Considerations

The SBS market prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act has been described as being
opaque, 53 in part because price and volume data for SBS transactions were not publicly
available. In opaque markets, price and volume information is difficult or impossible to obtain,
and access to price and volume information confers a competitive advantage on market
participants with such access. In the SBS market, for example, SBS dealers currently gain access
to proprietary transaction-level price and volume information by observing order flow. Large

53

With respect to one type of SBS, credit default swaps (“CDSs”), the Government
Accountability Office found that “comprehensive and consistent data on the overall
market have not been readily available,” “authoritative information about the actual size
of the [CDS] market is generally not available,” and regulators currently are unable “to
monitor activities across the market.” Government Accountability Office, GAO-09397T, Systemic Risk: Regulatory Oversight and Recent Initiatives to Address Risk Posed
by Credit Default Swaps, at 2, 5, 27, (2009) available at
http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09397t.pdf; see also Robert E. Litan, The Derivatives
Dealers’ Club and Derivatives Market Reform: A Guide for Policy Makers, Citizens and
Other Interested Parties, Brookings Institution (Apr. 7, 2010),

an/0407_derivatives_litan.pdf; Michael Mackenzie, Era of an Opaque Swaps Market
Ends, Financial Times, June 25, 2010, http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/f49f635c-808111df-be5a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3HLUjYNI7.
22

SBS dealers and other large market participants with a large share of order flow have an
informational advantage over smaller SBS dealers and non-dealers who, in the absence of pretrade transparency, observe a smaller subset of the market. As the Commission highlights in
Section II.B below, the majority of SBS market activity, and therefore information about market
activity, is concentrated in a small number of SBS dealers and widely dispersed among other
market participants. Greater access by SBS dealers to non-public information about order flow
enables better assessment of current market values by SBS dealers, permitting them to extract
economic rents from counterparties who are less informed. 54 Non-dealers are aware of this
information asymmetry, and certain non-dealers – particularly larger entities who transact with
many dealers – may be able to obtain access to competitive pricing or otherwise demand a price
discount that reflects the information asymmetry. Typically, however, the market participants
with an information advantage will earn economic rents from their non-public information. In
the SBS market, it is predominantly SBS dealers who observe the greatest order flow and benefit
from market opacity.
The Commission expects that SDRs will play a critical role in enhancing transparency
and competitive access to information in the SBS market. In order to increase the transparency
of the OTC derivatives market, Title VII requires the Commission to undertake a number of
rulemakings, including the SDR Rules and Regulation SBSR, 55 to establish a framework for the
regulatory reporting of SBS transaction information to SDRs, public dissemination of
54

In this situation, economic rents are the profits that SBS dealers earn by trading with
counterparties who are less informed. In a market with competitive access to
information, there is no informational premium; SBS dealers only earn a liquidity
premium. The difference between the competitive liquidity premium and the actual
profits that SBS dealers earn is the economic rent.

55

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13.
23

transaction-level information, and a framework for SDRs to provide access to the information to
the Commission. Persons that meet the definition of an SDR will be required, absent an
exemption, to comply with all SDR obligations, including the SDR Rules requiring SDRs to
collect and maintain accurate data and the requirements under Regulation SBSR to publicly
disseminate transaction-level information. Reporting of SBS transaction information and public
dissemination of accurate transaction price and volume information should promote price
discovery and lessen the informational advantage enjoyed by SBS dealers with access to order
flow. 56 By requiring SDRs to collect SBS transaction, volume, and pricing information and
publicly disseminate information, the SDR Rules and Regulation SBSR may promote
transparency in the SBS market. 57
In addition to lessening the informational advantage currently available to SBS dealers,
increased transparency of the SBS market could have other widespread benefits. Public
availability of SBS price and volume information could lower the costs of SBS trading by
reducing implicit trading costs. 58 To the extent that implicit costs of SBS trading are reduced

56

Price discovery refers to the process by which buyers seek the lowest available prices and
sellers seek the highest available prices. This process reveals the prices that best match
buyers to sellers. See Larry Harris, Trading & Exchanges: Market Microstructure for
Practitioners 94 (2003). Price discovery may be hindered by such things as a scarcity of
buyers or sellers or an asymmetry of information between potential buyers and sellers.
For example, when traders are asymmetrically informed, liquidity suppliers set their
prices far from the market to recover from uninformed traders what they lose to wellinformed traders. See id. at 312.

57

Regulation SBSR requires that the economic terms of the transaction, with the exception
of the identities of the counterparties, be publicly disseminated. These terms include the
product ID, date and time of execution, price, and notional amount of an SBS. See
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rules 901(c) and 902).

58

Implicit trading cost is the difference between the price at which a market participant can
enter into an SBS and the theoretical fundamental value of that SBS. Post-trade
transparency has been shown to lower implicit trading costs in US corporate bond
24

and the availability of the data necessary to evaluate the performance of a market participant’s
SBS dealer using transaction cost analysis, more market participants may be inclined to trade in
the SBS market. 59
Allowing competitive, impartial access to the most recent transaction price and volume
information may promote the efficiency of SBS trading and increase opportunities for risksharing in other ways. In particular, as in other securities markets, quoted bids and offers should
form and adjust according to the reporting of executed trades, attracting liquidity from hedgers
and other market participants that do not observe customer order flow and do not benefit from
opacity.
Separately, the SDR Rules are designed to, among other things, make available to the
Commission SBS data that will provide a broad view of the SBS market and help monitor for
pockets of risk that might not otherwise be observed by financial market regulators. 60 Unlike
most other securities transactions, SBSs involve ongoing financial obligations between
markets, which, prior to the introduction of FINRA’s Trade Reporting and Compliance
Engine (TRACE), was a dealer-centric over-the-counter (“OTC”) market characterized
by limited transparency, similar to the SBS market. See, e.g., Amy K. Edwards,
Lawrence Harris, & Michael S. Piwowar, Corporate Bond Market Transparency and
Transaction Costs, 62 Journal of Finance 1421 (2007); Hendrik Bessembinder, William
F. Maxwell, & Kumar Venkataraman, Market Transparency, Liquidity, Externalities and
Institutional Trading Costs in Corporate Bonds, 82 Journal of Financial Economics 251
(2006).
59

Transaction cost analysis refers to an evaluation of the price received by a market
participant relative to prevailing market prices at the time the decision to transact was
made as well as transaction prices received by other market participants just before and
just after the transaction.

60

See Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5)(D), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(D), and Rule 13n-4(b)(5)
(requiring SDRs to provide direct electronic access to the Commission). See also 156
Cong. Rec. S5920 (daily ed. July 15, 2010) (statement of Sen. Lincoln) (“These new
‘data repositories’ will be required to register with the CFTC and the SEC and be subject
to the statutory duties and core principles which will assist the CFTC and the SEC in their
oversight and market regulation responsibilities.”).
25

counterparties during the life of transactions that typically span several years. Counterparties to
an SBS rely on each other’s creditworthiness and bear this credit risk and market risk until the
SBS terminates or expires. This can lead to market instability when a large market participant,
such as an SBS dealer, major SBS market participant, or central counterparty (“CCP”), becomes
financially distressed. The default of a large market participant could introduce the potential for
sequential counterparty failure; the resulting uncertainty could reduce the willingness of market
participants to extend credit, and substantially reduce liquidity and valuations for particular types
of financial instruments. 61 A broad view of the SBS market, including aggregate market
exposures to referenced entities (instruments), positions taken by individual entities or groups,
and data elements necessary for a person to determine the market value of the transaction could
provide the Commission with a better understanding of the actual and potential risks in the SBS
market and promote better risk monitoring efforts. The information provided by SDRs could
also help the Commission detect market manipulation, fraud, and other market abuses.

61

See, e.g., Markus K. Brunnermeier and Lasse Heje Pedersen, Market Liquidity and
Funding Liquidity, 22 Review of Financial Studies 2201 (2009); Denis Gromb and
Dimitri Vayanos, A Model of Financial Market Liquidity Based on Intermediary Capital,
8 Journal of the European Economic Association 456 (2010).
26

The extent of the benefits discussed above may be limited by the inaccuracy or
incompleteness of SBS data maintained by SDRs. 62 The Commission believes, however, that the
SDR Rules relating to data accuracy 63 and maintenance 64 will help minimize the inaccuracy or
incompleteness of SBS data maintained by SDRs. The benefits discussed above may have
associated costs for compliance with the SDR Rules and Regulation SBSR. Persons that meet
the definition of an SDR will be required to invest in infrastructure necessary to comply with
rules for collecting, maintaining, and disseminating accurate data. Such infrastructure costs may
ultimately be reflected in the prices that SBS dealers charge to customers, mitigating the
reduction in indirect trading costs that may accrue from reducing SBS dealers’ information
advantage.

62

The CFTC’s experience with collecting swap data suggests that the benefits of receiving
information from trade repositories may be reduced by inaccuracies or inconsistencies in
information maintained by trade repositories. See, e.g., Andrew Ackerman, CFTC Seeks
Comment on Improving Swaps Data Stream; Data Problems Have Hobbled Efforts to See
More Clearly Into Swaps Market, Wall Street Journal Mar. 19, 2014,
http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304026304579449552899867592
(noting that “a series of data problems . . . have hobbled efforts to see more clearly into
the multitrillion-dollar swaps market”). The CFTC has published a request for comment
on specific swap data reporting and recordkeeping rules to determine how these rules
were being applied and whether or what clarifications, enhancements, or guidance may
be appropriate. See Review of Swap Data Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements,
79 FR 16689 (Mar. 26, 2014).

63

See, e.g., Rule 13n-5(b)(3) (requiring an SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the transaction data and
positions that it maintains are complete and accurate).

64

See, e.g., Rule 13n-5(b)(4) (requiring an SDR to maintain transaction data and related
identifying information for not less than five years after the applicable SBS expires and
historical positions for not less than five years); Rule 13n-5(b)(5) (requiring an SDR to
establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
prevent any provision in a valid SBS from being invalidated or modified through the
procedures or operations of the SDR).
27

The SDR Rules permit the possibility of multiple SDRs within an asset class. 65 If there
are multiple SDRs in any given asset class, then differences in how each SDR accepts, stores,
and disseminates SBS data may cause fragmentation in the SBS data, thereby making it more
difficult for the Commission and the public to compile, compare, and analyze market
information. As discussed below, the Commission anticipates that it will propose for public
comment detailed specifications of acceptable formats and taxonomies that would facilitate an
accurate interpretation, aggregation, and analysis of SBS data by the Commission.66 The
Commission believes that these specifications may help reduce any difficulties resulting from the
fragmentation of data among multiple SDRs by facilitating the clear, uniform reporting of SBS
data to the Commission.
B.

Baseline

To assess the economic impact of the SDR Rules described in this release, the
Commission is using as a baseline the SBS market as it exists today, including applicable rules
that have already been adopted and excluding rules that have been proposed, but not yet
finalized. The Commission acknowledges limitations in the degree to which the Commission
can quantitatively characterize the current state of the SBS market. As described in more detail
below, because the available data on SBS transactions do not cover the entire market, the
Commission has developed an understanding of market activity using a sample that includes
only certain portions of the market.

1.

Transparency in the SBS Market

There currently is no robust, widely accessible source of information about individual
SBS transactions. Nevertheless, market participants can gather certain limited information for
the single-name CDS market from a variety of sources. For example, some vendors provide
indicative quotes. Indicative quotes are not based on actual transactions and, as such, they may
not reflect the true value. Moreover, these quotes do not represent firm commitments to buy or
sell protection on particular reference entities. However, market participants can gather
information from indicative quotes that may inform their trading. In addition, one entity as part
of its single-name CDS clearing, makes its daily settlement prices on 5 year single-name CDSs
available to the public on its website. 67 A more complete database of current and historical
settlement prices is available by subscription.
In addition to the pricing data discussed above, there is limited, publicly-disseminated
information about aggregate SBS market activity. The Depository Trust and Clearing
Corporation – Trade Information Warehouse (“DTCC-TIW”) publishes weekly transaction and
position reports for single-name CDSs. ICE Clear Credit also provides aggregated volumes of
clearing activity. Additionally, large multilateral organizations periodically report measures of
market activity. For example, the Bank for International Settlements (“BIS”) reports gross
notional outstanding for single-name CDSs and equity forwards and swaps semiannually.

67

See https://www.theice.com/cds/MarkitSingleNames.shtml. End-of-Day (“EOD”) prices
are established for all cleared CDS single name and index instruments using a price
discovery process developed for the CDS market. Clearing participants are required to
submit prices every business day, and the clearing house conducts a daily auction-like
process resulting in periodic trade executions among clearing participants. This process
determines the clearing house EOD prices, which are used for daily mark-to-market
purposes.
29

Market participants that are SBS dealers can also draw inferences about SBS market
activity by observing order flow. This source of proprietary information is most useful for SBS
dealers with large market shares.
Finally, DTCC-TIW voluntarily provides to the Commission data on individual CDS
transactions. This information is made available to the Commission in accordance with an
agreement between the DTCC-TIW and the OTC Derivatives Regulators’ Forum (“ODRF”), of
which the Commission is a member. While DTCC-TIW generally provides this information to
regulators that are members of the ODRF, DTCC-TIW does not make the information available
to the public.
2.

Current Security-Based Swap Market

The Commission’s analysis of the current state of the SBS market is based on data
obtained from DTCC-TIW, particularly data regarding the activity of market participants for
single-name CDSs from 2008 to 2013. While other repositories may collect data on transactions
in total return swaps on equity and debt, the Commission does not currently have access to such
data for these products (or other products that are SBSs). Although the Commission has
previously noted that the definition of SBS is not limited to single-name CDSs, the Commission
believes that the single-name CDS data is sufficiently representative of the SBS market and
therefore can directly inform the analysis of the state of the current SBS market. 68 The

68

According to data published by BIS, the global notional amount outstanding in equity
forwards and swaps as of December 2013 was $2.28 trillion. The notional amount
outstanding was approximately $11.32 trillion for single-name CDSs, approximately
$9.70 trillion for multi-name index CDSs, and approximately $0.95 trillion for multiname, non-index CDSs. See Bank of International Settlement, BIS Quarterly Review,
Statistical Annex, Table 19 (June 2014), available at
http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1406.htm. For purposes of this analysis, the
Commission assumes that multi-name index CDSs are not narrow-based index CDSs, and
30

Commission believes that DTCC-TIW’s data for single-name CDSs is reasonably
comprehensive because it includes data on almost all single-name CDS transactions and market
participants trading in single-name CDSs. 69 The Commission notes that the data that it receives
from DTCC-TIW does not encompass CDS transactions that both: (i) do not involve any U.S.
counterparty, 70 and (ii) are not based on a U.S. reference entity. Notwithstanding this limitation,
the Commission believes that DTCC-TIW data provides sufficient information to identify the
types of market participants active in the SBS market and the general pattern of dealing within
that market. 71

therefore do not fall within the definition of SBS. See Exchange Act Section 3(a)(68)(A),
15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(68)(A); see also Further Definition of “Swap,” “Security-Based Swap,”
and “Security-Based Swap Agreement”; Mixed Swaps; Security-Based Swap Agreement
Recordkeeping, Exchange Act Release No. 67453 (July 18, 2012), 77 FR 48207 (Aug.
13, 2012). The Commission also assumes that instruments reported as equity forwards
and swaps include instruments such as total return swaps on individual equities that fall
with the definition of SBS, potentially resulting in underestimation of the proportion of
the SBS market represented by single-name CDSs. Although the BIS data reflects the
global OTC derivatives market, and not only the U.S. market, the Commission is not
aware of any reason to believe that these ratios differ significantly in the U.S. market.
69

See ISDA, CDS Marketplace, Exposures & Activity,
http://www.isdacdsmarketplace.com/exposures_and_activity (“DTCC Deriv/SERV’s
Trade Information Warehouse is the only comprehensive trade repository and post-trade
processing infrastructure for OTC credit derivatives in the world. Its Deriv/SERV
matching and confirmation service electronically matches and confirms more than 98%
of credit default swaps transactions globally.”).

70

The Commission notes that DTCC-TIW’s entity domicile determinations may not reflect
the Commission’s definition of “U.S. person” in all cases.

71

In 2013, DTCC-TIW reported on its website new trades in single-name CDSs with gross
notional of $12.0 trillion. DTCC-TIW provided to the Commission data that included
only transactions with a U.S. counterparty or a U.S. reference entity. During the same
period, this data included new trades with gross notional equaling $9.3 trillion, or 77% of
the total reported by DTCC-TIW.
31

a.

Security-Based Swap Market Participants

A key characteristic of SBS activity is that it is concentrated among a relatively small
number of entities that engage in dealing activities. 72 Based on DTCC-TIW data that the
Commission has received, thousands of other market participants appear as counterparties to
SBS transactions, including, but not limited to, investment companies, pension funds, private
(hedge) funds, sovereign entities, and industrial companies. The Commission observes that most
end users of SBSs do not directly trade SBSs, but instead use dealers, banks, or investment
advisers as agents to establish the end users’ positions. Based on the Commission’s analysis of
DTCC-TIW data, there were 1,800 entities engaged directly in trading CDSs between November
2006 and December 2013. 73 Table 1 below highlights that of these entities, there were 17, or
approximately 0.9%, that were ISDA-recognized dealers. 74 The vast majority of transactions
(84.1%) measured by the number of counterparties (each transaction has two counterparties or
transaction sides) were executed by ISDA-recognized dealers. Thus, a small set of dealers
observe the largest share of the market and potentially benefit the most from opacity.
72

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47293, supra note 11. All data in this
section cites updated data from this release and the accompanying discussion.

73

These 1,800 transacting agents represent over 10,000 accounts representing principal risk
holders. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 and Cross Border
Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47293-4, supra note 11 (discussing the number of transacting
agents and accounts of principal risk holders).

74

For the purpose of this analysis, the ISDA-recognized dealers are those identified by
ISDA as a recognized dealer in any year during the relevant period. Dealers are only
included in the ISDA-recognized dealer category during the calendar year in which they
are so identified. The complete list of ISDA recognized dealers is: JP Morgan Chase NA
(and Bear Stearns), Morgan Stanley, Bank of America NA (and Merrill Lynch), Goldman
Sachs, Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays Capital, Citigroup, UBS, Credit Suisse AG, RBS
Group, BNP Paribas, HSBC Bank, Lehman Brothers, Société Générale, Credit Agricole,
Wells Fargo, and Nomura. See ISDA, Operations Benchmarking Surveys, available at

Principal holders of CDS risk exposure are represented by accounts in DTCC-TIW. 75 As
highlighted in Table 2 below, Commission staff’s analysis of these accounts in DTCC-TIW
shows that the 1,800 transacting agents (entities directly engaged in trading) described above
represented 10,054 principal risk holders (entities bearing the risk of the CDS). In some cases,
the principal risk holder may have been represented by an investment adviser that served as the
transacting agent. In other cases, the principal risk holder may have participated directly as the
transacting agent. Each account does not necessarily represent a separate legal person; one legal
person may allocate transactions across multiple accounts. For example, the 17 ISDArecognized dealers described above allocated transactions across 69 accounts.
75

“Accounts” as defined in the DTCC-TIW context are not equivalent to “accounts” in the
definition of “U.S. person” provided by Exchange Act Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i)(C). They
also do not necessarily represent separate legal persons. One entity or legal person may
have multiple accounts. For example, a bank may have one DTCC account for its U.S.
headquarters and one DTCC account for one of its foreign branches.
33

Among the accounts, there are 1,086 Dodd-Frank Act-defined special entities and 636
investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 76 Private funds
comprise the largest type of account holders that the Commission was able to classify, and
although not verified through a recognized database, most of the funds the Commission was not
able to classify appear to be private funds. 77 While the Commission anticipates that some of
these accounts may prefer to operate in an opaque market (if, for example, they are relying on a
proprietary trading strategy and wish to keep their transactions anonymous), the data suggest that
the vast majority of principal risk holders in CDS may benefit from the Dodd-Frank Act’s
transparency requirements. As discussed above and in Section VIII below, dealers are the
category of market participants most likely to benefit from opaqueness. As shown in Table 1, of
the 1,800 transacting agents in the 2006-2013 sample, 17 (or 0.9%) are ISDA-recognized
dealers. Similarly, as shown in Table 2, of the 10,054 accounts with CDS transactions, 69 (or
0.7%) are accounts held by ISDA-recognized dealers. As many as 99% of market participants
may benefit from increasing transparency.

76

There remain over 4,600 DTCC “accounts” unclassified by type. Although unclassified,
each was manually reviewed to verify that it was not likely to be a special entity within
the meaning of the Dodd-Frank Act and instead was likely to be an entity such as a
corporation, an insurance company, or a bank.

77

“Private funds” encompass various unregistered pooled investment vehicles, including
hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds.

The domicile classifications in DTCC-TIW are based on the market participants’ own
reporting and have not been verified by Commission staff. Prior to enactment of the
Dodd-Frank Act, account holders did not formally report their domicile to DTCC-TIW
because there was no systematic requirement to do so. After enactment of the DoddFrank Act, the DTCC-TIW has collected the registered office location of the account.
This information is self-reported on a voluntary basis. It is possible that some market
participants may misclassify their domicile status because the databases in DTCC-TIW
do not assign a unique legal entity identifier to each separate entity. It is also possible
that the domicile classifications may not correspond precisely to the definition of U.S.

new accounts outside the United States, but managed by a U.S. entity, foreign accounts that
include new accounts of a foreign branch of a U.S. bank, and new accounts of a foreign
subsidiary of a U.S. entity. Over time, a greater share of accounts entering the DTCC-TIW data
either have a foreign domicile or have a foreign domicile while being managed by a U.S. person.
The increase in foreign accounts may reflect an increase in participation by foreign
accountholders and the increase in foreign accounts managed by U.S. persons may reflect the
flexibility with which market participants can restructure their market participation in response to
regulatory intervention, competitive pressures, and other factors. There are, however, alternative
explanations for the shifts in new account domicile in Figure 2. Changes in the domicile of new
accounts through time may reflect improvements in reporting by market participants to DTCCTIW. Additionally, because the data includes only accounts that are domiciled in the United
States, transact with U.S.-domiciled counterparties, or transact in single-name CDSs with U.S.
reference entities, changes in the domicile of new accounts may reflect increased transaction
activity between U.S. and non-U.S. counterparties.

3(a)(4). Notwithstanding these limitations, the Commission believes that the crossborder and foreign activity demonstrates the nature of the single-name CDS market.

Security-Based Swap Data Repositories

No SDRs are currently registered with the Commission. The Commission is aware of
one entity in the market (i.e., the DTCC-TIW) that has been accepting voluntary reporting of

38

single-name and index CDS transactions. In 2013, DTCC-TIW received approximately 3.1
million records of CDS transactions, of which approximately 800,000 were price forming. 80
The CFTC has provisionally registered four swap data repositories. 81 These swap data
repositories are: BSDR LLC, Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc., DTCC Data Repository LLC,
and ICE Trade Vault, LLC. The Commission believes that most of these entities will likely
register with the Commission as SDRs and that other persons may seek to register with both the
CFTC and the Commission as swap data repositories and SDRs, respectively. As stated above,
the Commission believes that the final SDR Rules are largely consistent with the CFTC’s rules
governing swap data repositories
Efforts to regulate the swap and SBS market are underway not only in the United States,
but also abroad. In 2009, leaders of the G20—whose members include the United States, 18
other countries, and the European Union—called for global improvements in the functioning,
transparency, and regulatory oversight of OTC derivatives markets and agreed, among other
things, that OTC derivatives contracts should be reported to trade repositories. 82 Substantial
progress has been made in establishing the trade repository infrastructure to support the reporting

80

Price-forming CDS transactions include all new transactions, assignments, modifications
to increase the notional amounts of previously executed transactions, and terminations of
previously executed transactions. Transactions terminated or entered into in connection
with a compression exercise, and expiration of contracts at maturity are not considered
price-forming and are therefore excluded, as are replacement trades and all bookkeepingrelated trades.

81

CFTC Rule 49.3(b) provides for provisional registration of a swap data repository. 17
CFR 49.3(b).

of all contracts. 83 Currently, multiple trade repositories operate, or are undergoing approval
processes to do so, in a number of different jurisdictions. 84 The requirements for trade reporting
differ across jurisdictions. The result is that trade repository data is fragmented across many
locations, stored in a variety of formats, and subject to many different rules for authorities’
access. The data in these trade repositories will need to be aggregated in various ways if
authorities are to obtain a comprehensive and accurate view of the global OTC derivatives
markets and to meet the original financial stability objectives of the G20 in calling for
comprehensive use of trade repositories.

Definition, Scope of Registration, Services, and Business Models of SDRs
The Proposing Release generally discussed the role, regulation, and business models of

SDRs, 85 but it did not specifically address the applicability of the statutory definition of an
SDR. 86 The Commission received several comments that addressed broad issues regarding what
persons fall within the statutory definition of an SDR, what services can or must be provided by
SDRs, and what business models are appropriate for SDRs. In light of these comments, the
Commission believes that it is useful to provide clarity on the definition of an SDR and the
services that are required or permitted to be provided by SDRs. For purposes of this release, the
Commission will refer to services that are specifically included in the statutory definition of an

SDR 87 as “core” services. All other services – both those required by the Dodd-Frank Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder, and those not required, but which the Commission believes
are permissible for SDRs to perform – will be referred to as “ancillary” services.
A.

Definition of SDR: Core Services

Exchange Act Section 3(a)(75), enacted by Dodd-Frank Act Section 761, defines a
“security-based swap data repository” to mean “any person that collects and maintains
information or records with respect to transactions or positions in, or the terms and conditions of,
security-based swaps entered into by third parties for the purpose of providing a centralized
recordkeeping facility for security-based swaps.” 88
One commenter requested that “the Commission provide clear guidance as to the scope
of the entities covered within the [statutory] definition of SDR in the Dodd-Frank Act.” 89 The
commenter stated as follows: “The statutory duties required of an SDR are extensive and can
form a business in their own right. The requirements of an SDR should not be imposed upon
service providers looking to provide targeted solutions to specific processes, as opposed to
providers looking more broadly to fulfill the role of an SDR. All third party service providers
have to perform a level of recordkeeping and often retain data previously submitted by customers
to offer services efficiently. This should not transform them into an SDR unless there is a
corresponding policy reason for doing so. In fact, there is a strong policy reason to exclude
them, the goal of countering the risk of fragmentation in data collection and dissemination on a

global basis.” 90 Another commenter described an SDR’s core functions as “basic receipt and
storage of [SBS] data.” 91
The Commission believes that the statutory definition in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(75)
describes the core services or functions of an SDR. Whether a person falls within the statutory
definition of an SDR is fact-specific. An example of a person that would likely meet the
statutory definition of an SDR is a person that provides the service of maintaining a centralized
repository of records of SBSs for counterparties to SBS transactions that are intended to be relied
on by counterparties for legal purposes. Providing this service would cause the person to meet
the statutory definition of an SDR because the person is “collect[ing] and maintain[ing]
information or records with respect to transactions or positions in, or the terms and conditions of,
[SBSs] entered into by third parties for the purpose of providing a centralized recordkeeping
facility for [SBSs].” 92 In contrast, a law firm, trustee, custodian, or broker-dealer that holds SBS
records likely would not meet the statutory definition of an SDR because those persons would
not be doing so “for the purpose of providing a centralized recordkeeping facility for [SBSs].” 93
One commenter identified countering the risk of fragmentation in data collection and
dissemination as a policy reason to exclude certain persons, such as certain third party service
providers, from the definition of an SDR. 94 The Commission believes that while third party
service providers may collect and maintain SBS data, they generally do not do so “for the
purpose of providing a centralized recordkeeping facility.” As such, third party service providers

generally would not fall within the statutory definition of an SDR. Thus, they do not need to be
excluded from the definition of an SDR, as the commenter suggested. If, however, the third
party service provider collects and maintains the SBS data “for the purpose of providing a
centralized recordkeeping facility,” 95 it would likely fall within the definition of an SDR. The
Commission does not believe that there are any policy reasons, including countering the risk of
fragmentation, to warrant a broad-based exemption from registration for third party service
providers that collect and maintain SBS data “for the purpose of providing a centralized
recordkeeping facility.”
B.

SDRs Required to Register With The Commission

To the extent that a person falls within the statutory definition of an SDR, and makes use
of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the functions of
an SDR, then that person is required to register with the Commission,96 absent an exemption. 97
As discussed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, 98 the Commission believes that U.S.
persons 99 that perform the functions of an SDR are required to register with the Commission and

3a71-3(a)(4)(i), 17 CFR 240.3a71-3(a)(4)(i). See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR
at 47371, supra note 11. Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i) defines “U.S. person” to mean “any person
that is: (A) A natural person resident in the United States; (B) A partnership, corporation,
trust, investment vehicle, or other legal person organized, incorporated, or established
under the laws of the United States or having its principal place of business in the United
States; (C) An account (whether discretionary or non-discretionary) of a U.S. person; or
(D) An estate of a decedent who was a resident of the United States at the time of death.”
Id. at 47371. As the Commission noted in the Cross-Border Adopting Release, the
definition of “U.S. person” in Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i) “reflect[s] a territorial approach to the

comply with Exchange Act Section 13(n) 100 and the rules and regulations thereunder, as well as
other requirements applicable to SDRs registered with the Commission.101 Requiring U.S.
persons that perform the functions of an SDR to be operated in a manner consistent with the Title
VII regulatory framework and subject to the Commission’s oversight, among other things, helps
ensure that relevant authorities are able to monitor the build-up and concentration of risk
exposure in the SBS market, reduce operational risk in that market, and increase operational
efficiency. 102 SDRs themselves are subject to certain operational risks that may impede the
ability of SDRs to meet these goals, 103 and the Title VII regulatory framework is intended to
address these risks.
application of Title VII.” Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47306, supra note
11. The Commission believes that the territorial focus of the definition is appropriate in
the context of the SDR Rules because it will enable the Commission to identify those
SDRs that should be required to register with the Commission by virtue of the location of
a significant portion of their commercial and legal relationships within the United States.

101

In addition to the SDR Rules, the Commission is adopting Regulation SBSR, which
imposes certain obligations on SDRs registered with the Commission. See Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13. In a separate proposal relating to
implementation of Dodd-Frank Act Section 763(i) (adding Exchange Act Section
13(n)(5)(E), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(E)), the Commission proposed rules that would require
SDRs registered with the Commission to collect data related to monitoring the
compliance and frequency of end-user clearing exemption claims. See End-User
Exception Proposing Release, supra note 15.

102

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77307, supra note 2 (“The enhanced transparency
provided by an SDR is important to help regulators and others monitor the build-up and
concentration of risk exposures in the SBS market . . . . In addition, SDRs have the
potential to reduce operational risk and enhance operational efficiency in the SBS
market.”).

103

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77307, supra note 2 (“The inability of an SDR to protect
the accuracy and integrity of the data that it maintains or the inability of an SDR to make
such data available to regulators, market participants, and others in a timely manner could
have a significant negative impact on the SBS market. Failure to maintain privacy of
such data could lead to market abuse and subsequent loss of liquidity.”).
44

Also, as stated in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission believes that a
non-U.S. person 104 that performs the functions of an SDR within the United States would be
required to register with the Commission, absent an exemption.105 The Commission’s
interpretation of the scope of SDR registration is consistent with the Commission’s territorial
approach to the application of Title VII, as discussed in the Cross-Border Adopting Release. 106
As noted in that release, the Commission takes the view that a territorial approach to the
application of Title VII is grounded in the text of the relevant statutory provisions and is
designed to help ensure that the Commission’s application of the relevant provisions is consistent
with the goals that the statute was intended to achieve. 107 Once the focus of the statute has been
identified using this analysis, determining whether a particular application of the statute is
territorial turns on whether any relevant conduct that is the focus of the statute has a sufficient
territorial nexus with the United States. 108

104

Under this interpretation, the term “non-U.S. person” would have the same meaning as
set forth in Rule 13n-12(a), as discussed in Section VI.K.3 of this release.

105

Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31042, supra note 3. See also Exchange Act
Section 13(n)(1), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(1) (requiring persons that, directly or indirectly,
make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform
the functions of an SDR to register with the Commission). The Commission recognizes
that some non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR may do so entirely
outside the United States, and thus, are not required to register with the Commission. See

As stated in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission believes that “a nonU.S. person would be performing ‘the functions of a security-based swap data repository within
the United States’ if, for example, it enters into contracts, such as user or technical agreements,
with a U.S. person to enable the U.S. person to report [SBS] data to such non-U.S. person.” 109
As another example, “a non-U.S. person would be performing ‘the functions of a security-based
swap data repository within the United States’ if it has operations in the United States, such as
maintaining [SBS] data on servers physically located in the United States, even if its principal
place of business is not in the United States.” 110
One commenter submitted a comment relating to the Commission’s guidance on SDR
registration in the cross-border context. 111 This commenter suggested that “[t]he SDR
registration requirement should apply to any entity, regardless of physical location of servers,
that receives [SBS] transaction data from reporting sides who are U.S. persons for the purpose of
complying with the Commission’s reporting regulations.” 112 The commenter also suggested that
if an SDR “collects and maintains [SBS] transaction information or records in furtherance of
these obligations, then it should be deemed to ‘function’ as an SDR in the United States and face
109

Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31042, supra note 3.

110

Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31042, supra note 3. The Commission notes
that if a person performing the functions of an SDR has operations in the United States to
the extent that such operations constitute a principal place of business, then the person
would fall within the definition of “U.S. person” in Rule 13n-12, which cross-references
to Exchange Act Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i), 17 CFR 240.3a71-3(a)(4)(i). As adopted, the term
“U.S. person” includes a partnership, corporation, trust, investment vehicle, or other legal
person having its principal place of business in the United States. See Cross-Border
Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47371, supra note 11. As a result of being a “U.S. person,”
the person with its principal place of business in the United States would be required to
register as an SDR with the Commission.

the registration requirements.” 113 The Commission agrees generally with the commenter, but
notes that determination of whether or not an SDR is required to register with the Commission is
based on relevant facts and circumstances, including, for example, whether the SDR performs
the functions of an SDR within the United States, such as having operations within the United
States, as discussed above. Thus, an SDR’s registration requirements should be analyzed
separately from the reporting requirements of Title VII and Regulation SBSR.
The commenter stated that “an entity that (i) collects and maintains [non-SBS]
transaction information, (ii) collects and maintains [SBS] transaction information from activity
between non-U.S. persons, or (iii) collects and maintains [SBS] transaction information reported
to the entity pursuant to regulatory requirements or commitments unrelated to those imposed by
the Commission . . . should not be considered to function in the United States,” and
“[a]ccordingly, such an entity would not be required to register with the Commission as an
SDR.” 114 The Commission believes that this position is overly broad. The Commission agrees
that a person that collects and maintains only non-SBS transaction information would not have to
register with the Commission because it would not fall within the statutory definition of an
SDR. 115 However, consistent with the Commission’s territorial approach to the application of
Title VII, an SDR that collects and maintains data relating to SBS transactions between non-U.S.
persons may still be required to register with the Commission if the SDR makes use of the mails
or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the functions of an SDR – for
example by maintaining SBS data on servers physically located in the United States. Similarly,

an SDR that collects and maintains SBS transaction information reported to the SDR pursuant to
requirements or commitments unrelated to those imposed by the Commission may still be
required to register with the Commission if the SDR makes use of the mails or any means or
instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the functions of an SDR.
Determination of whether or not an SDR is required to register with the Commission is
fact-specific. As stated in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, given the constant innovation in
the market and the fact-specific nature of the determination, it is not possible to provide a
comprehensive discussion of every activity that would constitute a non-U.S. person performing
“the functions of a security-based swap data repository within the United States.” 116 In order to
provide legal certainty to market participants and to address commenters’ concerns regarding the
potential for duplicative regulatory requirements, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-12,
which exempts certain non-U.S. persons performing “the functions of a security-based swap data
repository within the United States” from the registration and other requirements set forth in
Exchange Act Section 13(n) and the rules and regulations thereunder. Rule 13n-12 is discussed
in Section VI.K of this release.
C.

Ancillary Services

As stated above, the Commission believes that the statutory definition of an SDR
describes the core services or functions of an SDR. This release will refer to all other services or
functions provided by an SDR as “ancillary services.” SDRs are required to provide some
ancillary services under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (“required
ancillary services”). These required ancillary services include certain duties of SDRs that are set

116

Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31042-3, supra note 3.
48

forth in Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5) 117 and the duties imposed by the SDR Rules. SDRs also
may voluntarily choose to provide other ancillary services (“voluntary ancillary services”).
Five commenters submitted comments relating to “ancillary services.” 118 Three
commenters recommended that SDRs be allowed (but not be required) to offer ancillary services
to SBS counterparties. 119 One of these commenters recommended that SDRs be allowed (but not
be required) to offer “ancillary services,” which, according to that commenter, “may include:
asset servicing, confirmation, verification and affirmation facilities, collateral management,
settlement, trade compression and netting services, valuation, pricing and reconciliation
functionalities, position limits management, dispute resolution, counterparty identity verification
and others.” 120 The commenter noted that allowing SDRs to offer such services would “promote
greater efficiencies and greater accuracy of data.” 121 The commenter also recommended
allowing an SDR’s affiliates, which may not be registered with the Commission, to perform such
“ancillary services.” 122 The second commenter recommended that life cycle event processing

DTCC 3, supra note 19. These commenters generally did not define “ancillary services.”
But see MarkitSERV, supra note 19 (referring to “an array of services that are ancillary . .

data.)”).

provided).

and legal recordkeeping services be treated as “ancillary” services. 123 The second commenter
also recommended allowing SDRs to offer “an asset servicing function,” which would allow
SDRs to “assist in systemic risk monitoring by providing regulators with regular reports
analyzing the data (such as position limit violations or certain identified manipulative trading
practices).” 124 With respect to bundling, both commenters agreed that an SDR should not be
allowed to require counterparties to use “ancillary services” in order to gain access to the
SDR. 125 The third commenter believed that SDRs should be able to offer “ancillary services,”
but did not support the bundling of such services with mandatory or regulatory services. 126 The
fourth commenter believed that if SDRs provide “ancillary services,” then the SDRs should not
have advantages in providing these services over competitors offering the same services. 127 This
commenter noted, for example, that SDRs will maintain granular trade data that is valuable in
providing post-trade services, and that other post-trade service providers should have the same
access to the granular trade data as the SDR and its affiliates when providing post-trade
services. 128 The fifth commenter suggested that certain functions that an SDR may perform
(e.g., confirmation of trades, reconciliation, valuation of transactions, life-cycle management,
collateral management) should not be considered as “processing of [SBSs]” for the purposes of

SB SEF registration. 129
It appears that the commenters generally used the term “ancillary services” to mean
voluntary ancillary services. The Commission, however, notes that at least two services
identified by a commenter as “ancillary services” are considered by the Commission to be
required ancillary services for an SDR. This commenter suggested that “confirmation” and
“dispute resolution” are ancillary to “those [services] narrowly outlined in the SBS SDR
Regulation (i.e., basic receipt and storage of swaps data).” 130 The Commission agrees with the
commenter’s suggestion that these two services are not “core” SDR services, which would cause
a person providing such core services to meet the definition of an SDR, and thus, require the
person to register with the Commission as an SDR. However, SDRs are required to perform
these two services or functions, and thus, they are required ancillary services; as discussed in
Sections VI.E.1.c and VI.E.6.c of this release, the Exchange Act requires SDRs to “confirm” the
accuracy of the data submitted, 131 and the final SDR Rules include a dispute resolution

129

BNY Mellon, supra note 19. See also Exchange Act Section 3D(a)(1), 15 U.S.C. 78c4(a)(1) (stating that “[n]o person may operate a facility for the trading or processing of
security-based swaps, unless the facility is registered as a security-based swap execution
facility or as a national securities exchange under this section”). Subsequent to receiving
this comment, the Commission issued a proposing release on the registration and
regulation of SB SEFs, interpreting the Dodd-Frank Act to key the SB SEF registration
obligation on the definition of an SB SEF in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(77). See 15
U.S.C. 78c(a)(77), as added by Dodd-Frank Act Section 761(a). See SB SEF Proposing
Release, 76 FR at 10959 n.62, supra note 29. The Commission expects to address the
scope of SB SEF registration when it adopts final rules relating to the registration and
regulation of SB SEFs.

See Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5)(B), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(B); Rule 13n-4(b)(3)

An SDR may delegate some of these required ancillary services to third party service
providers, who do not need to register as SDRs to provide such services. The SDR will remain
legally responsible for the third party service providers’ activities relating to the required
ancillary services and their compliance with applicable rules under the Exchange Act. For
example, as discussed above, the Exchange Act requires SDRs to “confirm” the accuracy of the
data submitted. 133 If an SDR delegates its confirmation obligation to a third party service
provider, then the third party service provider that provides this required ancillary service would
not need to register as an SDR, unless it otherwise falls within the definition of an SDR;
however, the SDR that delegates its obligation to the third party service provider would remain
responsible for compliance with the statutory requirement. 134

133

See Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5)(B), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(B). In a separate release,
the Commission proposed rules under Exchange Act Section 15F(i)(1), which provides
that SBS dealers and major SBS participants must “conform with such standards as may
be prescribed by the Commission, by rule or regulation, that relate to timely and accurate
confirmation . . . of all security-based swaps.” See Trade Acknowledgment and
Verification of Security-Based Swap Transactions, Exchange Act Release No. 63727
(Jan. 14, 2011), 76 FR 3859 (Jan. 21, 2011) (“Trade Acknowledgment Release”). SDRs
are not required to perform confirmations under Exchange Act Section 15F(i)(1) and the
rules and regulations thereunder, but, in certain circumstances, SDRs may be able to rely
on confirmations that are provided pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15F(i)(1). See
Section VI.E.1.c of this release discussing the circumstances where a single confirmation
could fulfill both requirements.

134

An SDR that delegates required ancillary services to a third party service provider must
have a reasonable basis for relying on the third party service provider. See Section
VI.E.1.c of this release discussing reasonable reliance in the context of confirmations.

outside entity to maintain and preserve records for a member, broker, or dealer will not

The Commission agrees with the commenters’ view that SDRs should be allowed to offer
voluntary ancillary services. 135 The Commission believes that use of such services by market
participants and market infrastructures will likely improve the quality of the data held by the
SDRs. 136 The Commission believes that when the data held at an SDR is used by counterparties
for their own business purposes, rather than solely for regulatory purposes, the counterparties
will have additional opportunities to identify errors in the data and will likely have incentives to
ensure the accuracy of the data held by the SDR. 137 Such voluntary ancillary services that an
SDR could provide include, for example, collateral management, clearing and settlement, trade
compression and netting services, and pricing and reconciliation functionalities. These services
could also be provided by persons that are not SDRs and would not, in and of themselves,
require the providers to register as SDRs. 138

136

See MarkitSERV, supra note 19 (recommending allowing SDRs to offer “ancillary
services” because it would “promote greater efficiencies and greater accuracy of data”).

137

For example, counterparties might use the data maintained by the SDR as part of their
risk management activities. See MarkitSERV, supra note 19 (“[O]ne of the critical
components in ensuring the accuracy of swaps data is the degree to which such data is
utilized by industry participants in other processes. The existence of a number of
feedback loops and distribution channels through which data will flow will enable
participants to identify, test and correct inaccuracies and errors.”).

138

The performance of some of these services, such as clearing and settlement and netting
services, may cause a person to be a “clearing agency,” as defined in Exchange Act
Section 3(a)(23), 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(23); see also Clearing Agency Standards, Exchange
Act Release No. 68080 (Oct. 22, 2012), 77 FR 66220, 66227–28 (Nov. 2, 2012)
(“Clearing Agency Standards Release”) ([T]he definition of clearing agency in Section
3(a)(23)(A) of the Exchange Act covers any person who acts as an intermediary in
making payments or deliveries or both in connection with transactions in securities and

securities transactions, to reduce the number of settlements of securities transactions, or
53

The Commission also agrees with the commenters’ view that market participants should
not be required to use voluntary ancillary services offered by an SDR as a condition to use the
SDR’s repository services, 139 and that SDRs should not be permitted to use their repository
function to gain advantages in providing voluntary ancillary services over competitors offering
the same services. 140 As discussed further below, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-4(c)(1),
which should address commenters’ concerns. 141
D.

Business Models of SDRs

The Commission understands that SDRs might operate under a number of business
models and did not intend for the proposed SDR Rules to mandate any particular business
model. 142 In the Proposing Release, the Commission solicited comments on whether the SDR
Rules should favor or discourage one business model over another. 143 Three commenters,
including one comment submitted prior to the Proposing Release, suggested that SDRs should be
required to operate on an at-cost utility model. 144
for the allocation of securities settlement responsibilities. . . . The determination of
whether particular activities meet the definition of a clearing agency depends on the
totality of the facts and circumstances involved.”). It is unlawful for a clearing agency to
make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform
the functions of a clearing agency with respect to any security (other than exempted
securities) unless it is registered with the Commission, or exempted from registration,
pursuant to Exchange Act Sections 17A(b) and 19(a), and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

See DTCC 2, supra note 19 (stating that “there is a significant advantage to the market if
SDRs are required to provide basic services on an at-cost or utility model basis, as it
avoids the potential abuse or conflict of interest related to a relatively small number of
54

Consistent with commenters’ views, the Commission understands that an SDR operating
on a for-profit, non-utility model, or commercial basis, may be presented with more conflicts of
interest, including economic self-interest in pricing or bundling its services, than an SDR
operating on an at-cost utility model, or non-profit basis. 145 The Commission believes, however,
that if an SDR operating on an at-cost utility model has an affiliate that provides ancillary
services for SBSs for profit, then that SDR may be presented with conflicts of interest similar to
conflicts at an SDR operating on a for-profit, non-utility model. 146 For example, an SDR that
has an affiliate that provides asset servicing for profit would most likely face similar conflicts as
a for-profit SDR that provides asset servicing itself.
The Commission believes that the final SDR Rules, including rules pertaining to conflicts
of interest, are sufficiently broad to address the range of conflicts of interest inherent in different
SDR business models. For instance, under Rule 13n-4(c)(3), each SDR is required to identify
conflicts of interest applicable to it and establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures to mitigate these conflicts. 147 In addition, the Commission believes that allowing
SDRs to pursue different business models will increase competition, efficiency, and innovation
among SDRs. For example, by not prescribing one particular business model, new entrants may
service providers in the SDR industry” and that “SDR fee structures should reflect an atcost operating budget”); Benchmark*, supra note 20 (stating that a non-profit utility
structure “helps promote innovative uses” of SBS data “to maximize its value to market
participants”); Saul, supra note 19 (stating that SDRs should “serve the entire industry as
a utility” and that “[t]reating an SDR as a utility would also make it easier for the
industry to provide the manpower and the capital to form an SDR”); see also DTCC 3,
supra note 19 (“SDRs should serve an impartial, utility function.”).

have an incentive to develop business models for SDRs that efficiently provide core services to
the industry and effectively mitigate conflicts. 148 Therefore, after considering the comments, the
Commission continues to believe that it is not necessary to mandate any particular business
model for SDRs.
IV.

Number of SDRs and Consolidation of SBS Data
The Commission received several comments relating to the issue of data fragmentation

among SDRs. The Commission believes that if there are multiple SDRs in any given asset class,
then it may be more difficult for regulators to monitor the SBS market because of the challenges
in aggregating SBS data from multiple SDRs.149 Some commenters suggested limiting the
number of SDRs to one per asset class in order to address these concerns. 150 While such a
limitation would resolve many of the challenges involved in aggregating SBS data, the
Commission believes that imposing such a limitation would stymie competition among SDRs,
148

See Section VIII of this release discussing the costs and benefits of different business
models.

149

See FINRA SBSR, supra note 27 (recognizing “the Commission’s acknowledgement of
‘the possibility that there could emerge multiple registered SDRs in an asset class,’ and,
in the event this should occur that ‘the Commission and the markets would be confronted
with the possibility that different registered SDRs could adopt different dissemination
protocols, potentially creating fragmentation in SBS market data’”) (citations omitted);
DTCC 3, supra note 19 (“When there are multiple SDRs in any particular asset class, the
[Commission] should take such action as is necessary to eliminate any overstatements of
open interest or other inaccuracies that may result from having broader market data
published from separate SDRs.”).

150

See ISDA Temp Rule, supra note 28 (“[T]he designation of a single [SDR] per class of
security-based swap would provide the Commission and market participants with
valuable efficiencies. In particular, there would be no redundancy of platforms, no need
for additional levels of data aggregation for each asset class and reduced risk of errors
and greater transparency (because a single [SDR] per asset class would avoid the risk of
errors associated with transmitting, aggregating and analyzing multiple sources of
potentially incompatible and duplicative trade data).”); see also Saul, supra note 19
(suggesting that the Commission should seek to have only one or two SDRs to service the
SBS market).

and, consequently, may lead to increased costs to market participants. 151 The Commission
believes that the better avenue at this point is to refrain from regulating the number of SDRs in
an asset class to permit market forces to determine an efficient outcome. Therefore, the
Commission is not adopting the commenters’ suggestions to limit the number of SDRs in each
asset class.
In the Proposing Release, the Commission requested comment on whether the
Commission should designate one SDR as the recipient of the information from all other SDRs
in order to provide the Commission and relevant authorities with a consolidated location from
which to access SBS data for regulatory monitoring and oversight purposes. 152 Some
commenters suggested that an SDR’s duties should include reporting SBS data to a single SDR
that would consolidate the data for relevant authorities or otherwise mandating the consolidation
of SBS data. 153 Specifically, one commenter recommended that the Commission “designate one
SDR as the recipient of the information of other SDRs to ensure the efficient consolidation of
data.” 154 The commenter further stated that the designated SDR would need to have “the

See Section VIII.C.3.b of this release discussing the SDR Rules’ potential effects on
competition (“The Commission believes that by allowing multiple SDRs to provide data
collection, maintenance, and recordkeeping services, the SDR Rules should promote
competition among SDRs . . . . Increased competition may lower costs for users of SDR
services.”). Accord PFMI Report, supra note 50 (“Competition can be an important
mechanism for promoting efficiency. Where there is effective competition and
participants have meaningful choices among FMIs[, including SDRs], such competition
may help to ensure that FMIs are efficient.”).

serving a vital function to the entire marketplace.” 155
The Commission does not dispute the commenter’s assertion that fragmentation of data
among SDRs would “leave to regulators the time consuming, complicated and expensive task of
rebuilding complex data aggregation and reporting mechanisms.” 156 However, if the
Commission were to designate one SDR as the data consolidator, such an action could be
deemed as the Commission’s endorsement of one regulated person over another, discourage new
market entrants, and interfere with competition, resulting in a perceived government-sponsored
monopoly. 157 In addition, such a requirement would likely impose an additional cost on market
participants to cover the SDR’s cost for acting as the data consolidator.
In addition, any consolidation required by the Commission would be limited to SBS data
and may not necessarily include data not required to be reported under Title VII and Regulation
SBSR, such as swap data. For example, consolidated SBS data may show that a person entered
into several SBSs based on individual equity securities. If the person also entered into swaps
based on a broad-based security index made up of the individual equity securities, then the
consolidated data would not necessarily include that information. Therefore, commenters’
suggestion to designate one SDR as the data consolidator may not fully address their data
fragmentation concerns unless the same SDR also consolidates swap data, which the CFTC
regulates.

Therefore, after considering the comments, the Commission is not designating, at this
time, one SDR as the recipient of information from other SDRs in order to provide relevant
authorities with consolidated data. The Commission may revisit this issue if there is data
fragmentation among SDRs that is creating substantial difficulties for relevant authorities to get a
complete and accurate view of the market. 158

Implementation of the SDR Rules
A.

Prior Commission Action

The Commission solicited comment in the Proposing Release on whether it should adopt
an incremental, phase-in approach with respect to Exchange Act Section 13(n) and the rules
thereunder. 159 The Commission further sought and received comments on similar
implementation issues relating to Title VII in other rulemakings and through solicitations for
comments. 160
1.

Effective Date Order

In addition, as discussed above, on June 15, 2011, the Commission issued the Effective
Date Order, which provided guidance on the provisions of the Exchange Act added by Title VII
with which compliance would have been required as of July 16, 2011 (i.e., the effective date of
the provisions of Title VII). The Effective Date Order provided exemptions to SDRs from
Exchange Act Sections 13(n)(5)(D)(i), 13(n)(5)(F), 13(n)(5)(G), 13(n)(5)(H), 13(n)(7)(A),
13(n)(7)(B), and 13(n)(7)(C), each of which will expire on the earlier of (1) the date the

Commission grants registration to the SDR and (2) the earliest compliance date set forth in any
of the final rules regarding the registration of SDRs. 161 Absent further Commission action, these
exemptions will expire as of the Compliance Date (as defined below), unless the Commission
has granted an SDR’s registration before the Compliance Date, in which case these exemptions
will expire, with respect to that SDR, as of the date the Commission grants the SDR’s
registration.
In addition, the Effective Date Order also provided exemptive relief from the rescission
provisions of Exchange Act Section 29(b) in connection with Exchange Act Sections
13(n)(5)(D)(i), 13(n)(5)(F), 13(n)(5)(G), 13(n)(5)(H), 13(n)(7)(A), 13(n)(7)(B), and
13(n)(7)(C). 162 That relief does not expire automatically, but rather when the Commission
specifies. 163 The Commission is now specifying that this exemption from Section 29(b) will
expire on the Compliance Date, or for those SDRs that are registered prior to the Compliance
Date, the date that the Commission grants each SDR’s registration.

Implementation Policy Statement

As discussed above, on June 11, 2012, the Commission issued a statement of general
policy on the anticipated sequencing of compliance dates of final rules to be adopted under Title
VII. The Implementation Policy Statement stated that compliance with the SDR Rules “earlier
in the implementation process should facilitate the development and utilization of SDRs in a
regulated manner.” 164 Among other things, the Implementation Policy Statement requested
comment on whether the Commission should adopt a phase-in of the SDR Rules and whether

Summary of Comments

While only two commenters on implementation referred specifically to the SDR Rules,
the Commission believes that other comments, particularly those related to timing with respect to
implementing rules on SBS reporting, are relevant to the implementation of the SDR Rules as
well. Eight commenters suggested that a phase-in approach to the SDR Rules or SBS reporting
generally may be appropriate. 166 The commenters generally indicated that a phase-in would be
necessary to enable existing SDRs and other market participants to make the necessary changes

repositories who intend to register as SDRs. This can be achieved as a phase-in for
existing SDRs where services will need to be amended to conform with the final rules

See, e.g., Barclays*, supra note 21 (“Changes envisioned by Title VII require very
significant investment into operational, IT and other infrastructure - infrastructure that
will take time and resources to build, test and optimize. The ability to fund and execute
the necessary infrastructure build, as well as put in place the risk management and
operational processes needed to conduct business under the new regulatory regime, will
vary significantly by asset class and type of market participant.”); DTCC 2, supra note 19
(stating that “the final rules [should] be subject to a phase-in period to allow an adequate
period for existing service providers . . . to make necessary changes to their service
offerings,” requesting that the Commission alternatively “provide specific transitional
arrangements for existing infrastructures,” and noting that the continuation of
counterparty reporting and the ability of SDRs to receive and maintain current trade
information on an ongoing basis is “imperative for effective oversight of systemic risk
and the continuance of the operational services to market participants”); FSF*, supra note
21 (“New market infrastructure and technologies, including central clearing services, data
reporting services and trading platforms, will be required to give effect to the new Swap
regulatory regime. Unless sufficient time is allotted for these components of market
infrastructure and technologies to adequately develop, all market participants (and
particularly end users) will face interruptions in their ability to enter into Swaps to hedge
their business risks or manage investments to meet client objectives.”).

168

See MFA 2, supra note 19 (“[W]e believe the first two priorities should be: (i) expanding
the use of central clearing for liquid (‘clearable’) contracts; and (ii) having trade
repositories receive data on both cleared and bilateral swaps. These changes would
provide substantial benefits to the markets by enhancing price transparency and
competition for the most liquid swap transactions . . . . Comprehensive reporting to SDRs
and regulators . . . will allow regulators to monitor systemic risk and individual risk
concentrations much more effectively, and intervene specifically as necessary.”); see also
FSF*, supra note 21 (The Commission “should prioritize implementation of data

essential in developing rules that meet Dodd-Frank’s requirements while still allowing
for active and liquid Swap markets.”).

See Morgan Stanley*, supra note 20 (“In addition to phase in based on asset class and
reporting times, reporting could also be phased in based on how a product trades [e.g.,
whether the SBS is cleared].”); FSR Implementation, supra note 23 (stating that “it may
be prudent to have different portions of a single rulemaking proposal take effect at
different times and with due consideration of steps that are preconditions to other steps”;
suggesting, as an example, that a requirement to designate a CCO should be implemented
quickly, but that the CCO be given time to design, implement, and test the compliance
system before any requirement to certify as to the compliance system becomes effective;
and supporting a phase-in approach “that recognizes the varying levels of sophistication,
resources and scale of operations within a particular category of market participant”).
But see Barclays*, supra note 21 (“Phasing by type of market participant would not be
useful for reporting obligations, in [the commenter’s] view, as the reported information
needs to reflect the entirety of the market to be useful for the market participants and
regulators.”).

other market infrastructures to establish connectivity, 172 another commenter cautioned that
market connectivity will take time to establish and test. 173 None of the commenters provided
specific timeframes for a phase-in approach. 174
In addition to the comments received above, participants in the Implementation Joint
Roundtable provided input regarding the appropriateness of a phase-in period for Title VII
rulemakings. Many of the participants in the Implementation Joint Roundtable advocated for a
phase-in period for the SDR Rules or SBS reporting generally; however, the participants’
specific approaches varied. While some participants at the Implementation Joint Roundtable
advocated a phase-in by asset class, 175 other participants suggested that a phase-in should be

(recommending that the Commission consider resource constraints in evaluating
transition deadlines and stating that “if there are a dozen rules that would each take about
a month to implement in isolation under normal circumstances, it is unrealistic to expect
all twelve rules to be implemented one month from passage of final rules”).

SDRs, is easy to establish (and, in many instances, already exists) and should not be the

Because the timeframe suggested by this commenter has passed, this aspect of the
comment is now moot.

implemented in a prioritized manner, with daily batch snapshots provided until more real-time
solutions are developed. 179 None of the Implementation Joint Roundtable participants provided

a sequenced effective date and compliance date for the SDR Rules 180 that recognizes the
practical constraints arising from the time necessary for persons to analyze and understand the
final rules adopted by the Commission, to develop and test new systems required as a result of
the Dodd-Frank Act’s regulation of SDRs and the SDR Rules, to prepare and file a completed
Form SDR, to be in a position to demonstrate their ability to meet the criteria for registration set
forth in Rule 13n-1(c)(3), 181 and to register with the Commission. The Commission agrees with
commenters who have suggested that the Commission require the reporting of SBS transaction
information to registered SDRs early in the implementation process because the Commission
will then be able to utilize the information reported to registered SDRs to inform other aspects of
its Title VII rulemaking. 182 Adopting and implementing a regulatory framework for SDRs will
facilitate access by the Commission and market participants to SBS information collected by
180

Title VII provides the Commission with the flexibility to establish effective dates beyond
the minimum 60 days specified therein for Title VII provisions that require a rulemaking.
See Dodd-Frank Act Section 774 (specifying that the effective date for a provision
requiring a rulemaking is “not less than 60 days after publication of the final rule or
regulation implementing such provision”). Furthermore, as with other rulemakings under
the Exchange Act, the Commission may set compliance dates (which may be later than
the effective dates) for rulemakings under the Title VII amendments to the Exchange Act.
Together, this provides the Commission with the ability to sequence the implementation
of the various Title VII requirements in a way that effectuates the policy goals of Title
VII while minimizing unnecessary disruption or costs. See Effective Date Order, 76 FR
at 36289, supra note 9.

181

See Section VI.A.2.c of this release discussing Rule 13n-1(c), which requires that the
Commission make a finding that a “security-based swap data repository is so organized,
and has the capacity, to be able to assure the prompt, accurate, and reliable performance
of its functions as a security-based swap data repository, comply with any applicable
provision of the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and carry
out its functions in a manner consistent with the purposes of section 13(n) of the
[Exchange] Act . . . and the rules and regulations thereunder.”

182

See, e.g., FSF*, supra note 21 (noting that the Commission “will be in a better position to
adopt rules that achieve Dodd-Frank’s goals while maintaining active and viable [SBS]
markets” if SDRs are required to register and data reporting is enabled).

SDRs. 183
All of the SDR Rules will become effective 60 days following publication of the rules in
the Federal Register (“Effective Date”). However, the exemptions to provisions in Exchange
Act Section 13(n) that the Commission provided in the Effective Date Order will continue to be
in effect following the adoption of the SDR Rules. Consistent with the Effective Date Order, the
exemptive relief remains in place and will expire: (1) upon the compliance date for the SDR
Rules, or (2) for those SDRs that are registered prior to such compliance date, the date that the
Commission grants each SDR’s registration. 184
SDRs must be in compliance with the SDR Rules by 365 days after publication of the
rules in the Federal Register (“Compliance Date”). 185 Absent an exemption, SDRs must be
registered with the Commission and in compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder (including the applicable Dodd-Frank Act provisions and all of the
SDR Rules) by the Compliance Date, and all exemptions that the Commission provided in the
Effective Date Order will expire on the Compliance Date. 186 After the Compliance Date,

185

In a separate release, the Commission is proposing a compliance schedule for portions of
Regulation SBSR in which the timeframes for compliance with the reporting and public
dissemination requirements would key off of the registration of SDRs. See Regulation
SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, supra note 13.

186

Any SDR that is registered with the Commission before the Compliance Date will be
required, absent an exemption, to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(n); the SDR
Rules; and Regulation SBSR, as applicable to registered SDRs, as of the date the
Commission grants registration to the SDR. See Effective Date Order, 76 FR at 36306,
67

pursuant to Exchange Act Section 13(n)(1), it will be unlawful, absent exemptive relief, 187 (1)
for a person, unless registered with the Commission as an SDR, directly or indirectly, to make
use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the functions
of an SDR or (2) for an SDR to fail to comply with all applicable statutory provisions and the
SDR Rules.
The Commission believes that setting the Compliance Date for the SDR Rules at 365
days after publication of the rules in the Federal Register adequately addresses commenters’
concerns 188 by providing SDRs with sufficient time to become compliant with the Dodd-Frank
Act and the SDR Rules and for the Commission to act on SDRs’ applications for registration,
while also allowing SDRs to continue performing the functions of an SDR without interruption.
The Commission notes that if an SDR files its Form SDR close to the Compliance Date,
it is possible that the Commission will not have sufficient time to consider the Form SDR and the
SDR may not be registered with the Commission by the Compliance Date. In this case, the SDR
must cease any operations that cause it to meet the statutory definition of an SDR as of the
Compliance Date and not begin or resume such operations until (and unless) the Commission
grants the SDR’s registration or provides the SDR with an exemption. As discussed below, Rule
13n-1(c), as adopted, provides that the Commission will grant registration to an SDR or institute
proceedings to determine whether registration should be granted or denied within 90 days of the

supra note 9 (granting exemptions to certain provisions in Exchange Act Section 13(n)
and indicated that the exemptions will expire on the earlier of (1) the date the
Commission grants registration to an SDR and (2) the earliest compliance date set forth
in any of the final rules regarding the registration of SDRs).

date of the publication of notice of the filing of an application for registration. Accordingly,
SDRs should consider that the Commission may take several months following the publication
of notice of the filing of an application for registration 189 to review an SDR’s application for
registration and assess whether the SDR meets the criteria for registration set forth in Rule 13n1(c)(3). 190
After weighing the practical considerations with respect to SDRs’ preparations for
compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and the SDR Rules, as well as the benefits to investors and
regulators of adopting the SDR Rules in order to facilitate the establishment and utilization of
registered SDRs, the Commission has determined not to adopt a phase-in approach, as suggested

189

The Commission’s review of the application for registration could extend beyond 90
days. Rule 13n-1(c) provides that the Commission will grant registration or institute
proceedings to determine whether registration should be granted or denied within 90 days
of the publication of notice of the filing of an application for registration “or within such
longer period as to which the applicant consents.”

190

As provided in Rule 13n-1(c)(3), in order to grant the registration of an SDR, the
Commission must make a finding that “such security-based swap data repository is so
organized, and has the capacity, to be able to assure the prompt, accurate, and reliable
performance of its functions as a security-based swap data repository, comply with any
applicable provision of the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder, and carry out its functions in a manner consistent with the purposes of section
13(n) of the [Exchange] Act . . . and the rules and regulations thereunder.” In addition to
the application for registration on Form SDR, Rule 13n-1(b) provides that, “[a]s part of
the application process, each [SDR] shall provide additional information to any
representative of the Commission upon request.” In determining whether an applicant
meets the criteria set forth in Rule 13n-1(c), the Commission will consider the application
and any additional information obtained from the SDR, which may include information
obtained in connection with an inspection or examination of the SDR. If the Commission
is unable to determine that the applicant meets the criteria for registration set forth in
Rule 13n-1(c)(3), then the Commission may not grant registration to the applicant. See
also Section VI.A.1 of this release discussing Form SDR and information required for
registration as an SDR.

by some commenters and Implementation Joint Roundtable participants. 191 Specifically, the
Commission does not believe that it is necessary or appropriate to tailor a phase-in period for the
SDR Rules based on specific asset classes, type of market participant, or other SBS attributes.
While a phase-in approach based on asset class, type of market participant, or other attributes
may have been appropriate had the Commission adopted rules prior to the July 16, 2011 effective
date of the Dodd-Frank Act, 192 the Commission believes that the passage of time has afforded
ample time for the development of SDR infrastructure. This belief is based, in part, on the
existence of four swap data repositories already provisionally registered with the CFTC. 193
These swap data repositories, most of which will likely register as SDRs with the Commission,
have had approximately three years to implement the final swap data repository rules adopted by
the CFTC on August 4, 2011 (Part 49 swap data repository rules) 194 and December 20, 2011
(Part 45 swap data recordkeeping and reporting rules). 195 The Commission believes that the
CFTC’s Part 49 rules 196 and Part 45 rules 197 applicable to swap data repositories are substantially
similar to the final SDR Rules. Because of the substantial similarity between the Commissions’
rules, to the extent that the SDRs are in compliance with the CFTC’s rules, they are likely
already in substantial compliance with the Commission’s SDR Rules.

Discussion of Rules Governing SDRs
Exchange Act Section 13(n), enacted in Dodd-Frank Act Section 763(i), makes it

“unlawful for any person, unless registered with the Commission, directly or indirectly, to make
use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the functions
of a security-based swap data repository.” 198 To be registered and maintain such registration,
each SDR is required (absent an exemption) to comply with the requirements and core principles
described in Exchange Act Section 13(n), as well as with any requirements that the Commission
adopts by rule or regulation. 199 The Exchange Act also requires each SDR to designate an
individual to serve as a CCO and specifies the CCO’s duties. 200 In addition, the Exchange Act
grants the Commission authority to inspect and examine any registered SDR and to prescribe
data standards for SDRs. 201

198

15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(1); see also Section III.A of this release discussing definition of
“security-based swap data repository.” Any person that is required to be registered as an
SDR under Exchange Act Section 13(n) must register with the Commission (absent an
exemption), regardless of whether that person is also registered under the Commodity
Exchange Act (“CEA”) as a swap data repository. Exchange Act Section 13(n)(8), 15
U.S.C. 78m(n)(8); see also CEA Section 21, 7 U.S.C. 24a (regarding swap data
repositories). Under the Exchange Act, a clearing agency may register as an SDR.
Exchange Act Section 13(m)(1)(H), 15 U.S.C. 78m(m)(1)(H). In addition, any person
that is required to register as an SDR pursuant to this section must register with the
Commission (absent an exemption) regardless of whether that person is also registered as
an SB SEF. See SB SEF Proposing Release, supra note 29.

See Exchange Act Section 13(n)(3), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(3).

See Exchange Act Section 13(n)(6), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(6).

201

See Exchange Act Sections 13(n)(2) and 13(n)(4), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(2) and 78m(n)(4).
In a separate release, the Commission proposed rules prescribing the data elements that
an SDR would be required to accept for each SBS in association with requirements under
Dodd-Frank Act Section 763(i), adding Exchange Act Section 13(n)(4)(A) relating to
standard setting and data identification. See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR
at 75284-5, supra note 8 (proposed Rule 901); see also Cross-Border Proposing Release,
78 FR at 31212-3, supra note 3 (re-proposing Rule 901). The Commission is
concurrently adopting Regulation SBSR, including rules prescribing the data elements
71

A.

Registration of SDRs (Rule 13n-1 and Form SDR)

Proposed Rule 13n-1 and proposed Form SDR would establish the procedures by which a
person may apply to the Commission for registration as an SDR. After considering the
comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-1 and Form SDR substantially as proposed,
with certain modifications. 202
1.

New Form SDR; Electronic Filing
a.

Proposed Form SDR

As proposed, Form SDR would require an applicant seeking to register as an SDR and a
registered SDR filing an amendment (including an annual amendment) to indicate the purpose
for which it is filing the form and then to provide several categories of information. As part of
the application process, each SDR would be required to provide additional information to the
Commission upon request. Applicants would be required to file Form SDR electronically in a
tagged data format. As proposed, Form SDR would require all SDRs to provide the same
information, with two related limited exceptions applicable to non-resident SDRs. First, if the
applicant is a non-resident SDR, then Form SDR would require the applicant to attach as an
exhibit to the form an opinion of counsel stating that the SDR can, as a matter of law, provide the
Commission with prompt access to the SDR’s books and records and that the SDR can, as a
matter of law, submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission. Second, Form
that an SDR is required to accept. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note
13 (Rule 901).
202

The Commission did not receive any comments on the definitions in proposed Rule 13n1(a) and is adopting each of them as proposed, other than revising the definition of “tag”
to have the same meaning as set forth in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T and deleting the
definition of “EDGAR Filer Manual,” which is no longer referenced in the revised
definition of “tag.” See Rule 13n-1(a)(2). The Commission is also revising the heading
of paragraph (a) of the rule by changing “Definition” to “Definitions” to reflect that there
is more than one definition in the paragraph.
72

SDR would require an applicant that is a non-resident SDR to certify to this (i.e., the SDR can, as
a matter of law, provide the Commission with prompt access to the SDR’s books and records and
the SDR can, as a matter of law, submit to onsite inspection and examination by the
Commission).203
b.

Comments on Proposed Form SDR

Two commenters submitted comments relating to this proposal. 204 One commenter urged
the Commission to ensure that the registration process does not interfere with the ongoing
operation of existing SDRs. 205 This commenter also addressed the items to be provided on Form
SDR and stressed the importance of gathering information regarding an applicant’s information
technology systems, including its ability to provide direct electronic access to the
Commission.206 In addition, the commenter supported combining new Form SDR with Form
203

See Items 12 and 46 of proposed Form SDR; see also Sections VI.A.1 and VI.A.5 of this
release discussing legal opinion of counsel and certification by non-resident SDRs on
Form SDR.

204

See DTCC 2, supra note 19; ESMA, supra note 19; see also DTCC 3, supra note 19. Five
commenters submitted comments to the Commission regarding registration of nonresident SDRs. See ESMA, supra note 19; DTCC 2, supra note 19; Foreign Banks
SBSR, supra note 27; BofA SBSR, supra note 27; US & Foreign Banks, supra note 24.
With the exception of the certification and legal opinion requirements discussed later in
this section, the Commission discussed cross-border issues applicable to SDRs that were
raised by Title VII in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, and is adopting an exemption
from the SDR requirements for certain non-U.S. persons, as discussed in Section VI.K of
this release.

205

DTCC 2, supra note 19.

206

DTCC 2, supra note 19 (“[I]t is essential that proposed Form SDR request information
related to the SDR’s operating schedule, real-time processing, existence of multiple
redundant infrastructures for continuity, strong information security controls, and robust
reporting operations (including direct electronic access by the Commission). Because an
SDR provides important utility services to regulators and market participants, such
resiliency and redundancy should be evaluated in light of the significant policies and
procedures for establishing such redundancy, including several backup locations in
different geographic regions.”).
73

SIP and further suggested that the Commission and the CFTC publish a joint form for
registration with the Commission as an SDR and SIP and with the CFTC as a swap data
repository. 207 The commenter also suggested that the Commission require applicants to submit
their rulebooks as part of the registration process on Form SDR. 208
One commenter expressed concern that non-resident SDRs would be subject to a stricter
regulatory regime than that applicable to resident SDRs due to the proposed opinion of counsel
requirement, which is applicable only to non-resident SDRs. 209
c.

Final Form SDR

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Form SDR substantially as
proposed with certain modifications. Form SDR includes a set of instructions for its completion
and submission. These instructions are included in this release, together with Form SDR. The
instructions require an SDR to indicate the purpose for which it is filing the form (i.e.,
application for registration, interim or annual amendment to an application or to an effective

207

DTCC 2, supra note 19; DTCC 3, supra note 19 (“Harmonization in the registration
process for SDRs is necessary. Requiring one SDR to complete three sets of registration
forms – an SDR application to the CFTC, an SDR application to the SEC and Form SIP
to the SEC – demonstrates a specific instance where the regulatory agencies should come
together, determine the information necessary for registration and jointly publish a
common registration application.”).

208

DTCC 3, supra note 19 (“The [Commission] should require rulebooks for SDRs prior to
operation and as part of the registration process. SDRs will need to complete legal
agreements with clearing-houses and among the users of an SDR. These agreements
generally constitute the agreement of the user to abide by published rules and/or
procedures of the SDR and generally have a notice of change to permit amendments
without having to re-execute with all users. These agreements should be in place before
SDRs operate under the new regulatory regime.”).

209

ESMA, supra note 19 (“[N]on-resident SDRs are actually subject to a stricter regime than
the resident ones, as they need to provide a legal opinion certifying that they can provide
the SEC with prompt access to their books and records and that they can be subject to
onsite inspections and examinations by the SEC.”).

registration, 210 or withdrawal from registration 211) and to provide information in seven
categories: (1) general information, (2) business organization, (3) financial information, (4)
operational capability, (5) access to services and data, (6) other policies and procedures, and (7)
legal opinion. As part of the application process, each SDR will be required to provide
additional information to any representative of the Commission upon request. 212
As noted in the Proposing Release, the Commission believes that permitting an SDR to
provide information in narrative form in Form SDR will allow the SDR greater flexibility and
opportunity for meaningful disclosure of relevant information. 213 The Commission believes that
it is necessary to obtain the information requested in Form SDR to enable the Commission to
determine whether to grant or deny an application for registration. Specifically, the information
will assist the Commission in understanding the basis for registration as well as an SDR’s overall
business structure, financial condition, track record in providing access to its services and data,
technological reliability, and policies and procedures to comply with its statutory and regulatory
obligations. The information will also be useful to the Commission in tailoring any requests for
additional information that it may ask an SDR to provide. Furthermore, the required information
will assist Commission representatives in the preparation of their inspection and examination of

See Section VI.A.4 of this release discussing amendments on Form SDR.

211

See Section VI.B of this release discussing withdrawal from registration as an SDR.

212

See Rule 13n-1(b). The Commission is revising the last sentence of proposed Rule 13n1(b) to use the statutorily defined term “security-based swap data repository” rather than
“SDR” to be consistent with the rest of the SDR Rules. The Commission is also revising
the last sentence of proposed Rule 13n-1(b) to require SDRs to provide additional
information upon request to “any representative of the Commission,” rather than “the
Commission.” This revision is intended to clarify that such requests will be made by
Commission staff.

an SDR. 214
Form SIP. 215 In the Proposing Release, the Commission noted that proposed Regulation
SBSR would require each registered SDR to register with the Commission as a SIP on Form SIP,
and requested comment on whether the Commission should combine Form SDR and Form SIP,
such that an SDR would register as an SDR and SIP using only one form. 216 One commenter
supported combining Form SDR with Form SIP. 217 Taking into consideration this commenter’s
view and in an effort to minimize the burden of filing multiple registration forms, the
Commission has decided to amend proposed Form SDR to accommodate SIP registration; thus,
an SDR will register and amend such registration as an SDR and as a SIP using one combined
form. 218 An amendment or withdrawal on Form SDR will also constitute an amendment or
withdrawal of SIP registration pursuant to Exchange Act Section 11A and the rules and
regulations thereunder. 219 The Commission has made certain changes to proposed Form SDR to
incorporate the additional information requested on Form SIP of applicants for registration as a
214

The Commission is revising Form SDR from proposed Form SDR to include disclosure
relating to the Paperwork Reduction Act. See Section VII of this release regarding the
Paperwork Reduction Act.

215

Today, the Commission is adopting Regulation SBSR, which includes a requirement for
each registered SDR to register as a SIP, as defined in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(22), 15
U.S.C. 78c(a)(22). See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rule 909).

Release, 75 FR at 75287, supra note 8 (proposed Rule 909); Cross-Border Proposing

217

DTCC 2, supra note 19; see also DTCC 3, supra note 19.

218

Form SDR will be used only by SIPs that also register as SDRs; Form SIP will continue
to be used by applicants for registration as SIPs not seeking to become dually-registered
as an SDR and SIP, and for interim amendments or annual amendments by registered
SIPs that are not dually-registered as an SDR and SIP. In discussing Form SDR as
adopted in this release, references to SDRs may, where applicable, refer to SDRs and
SIPs, collectively.

See General Instruction 2 to Form SDR.

SIP. 220 However, there are some disclosures required in Form SIP that have not been
incorporated into Form SDR because they do not appear to be relevant to SDRs. 221 The
Commission notes that by requiring a registered SDR to register as a SIP, the requirements of
SIP registration provided in Exchange Act Section 11A, including publication of notice of the
filing of an application for registration, will apply to applications filed on Form SDR 222 and,
accordingly, the Commission will publish notice of the filing of applications for registration on
Form SDR in the Federal Register. 223 In addition, the Commission expects that it will make the
filed applications available on its website, except for information where confidential treatment is

of inquiries from remote terminals)”), Item 32(a)(2) (adding “(or disseminate for display

involves the supply of information to a quotation board, ticker device, electronic
information terminal, or other such device, [the applicant must] state the total number of
devices to which information is, or will be supplied (‘serviced’) and any minimum and or
maximum number of devices required or permitted by agreement or otherwise to be
serviced by the applicant. In addition, [an applicant must] define the data elements for
each service.”); and Item 36 of Form SDR (adding “processing, preparing for
distribution, and publication”); see also new General Instructions 2 and 3 and conforming
revisions to General Instructions 7 and 9 to Form SDR and Items 16, 19, 20, 23, 25 - 35,
and 39 of Form SDR.

certain specifications or qualifications are imposed at the direction of a national securities
exchange or a registered securities association).

15 U.S.C. 78k-1(b).

223

As discussed below, the Commission is revising Rule 13n-1(c) from the proposal to
reflect this publication requirement with respect to the registration process for Form
SDR. See Section VI.A.2.c of this release discussing revision to Rule 13n-1(c) to provide
that: (1) within 90 days of the date of the publication of notice of the filing of an
application for registration (or within such longer period as to which the SDR consents),
the Commission shall either grant the registration by order or institute proceedings to
determine whether registration should be granted or denied and (2) proceedings instituted
pursuant to Rule 13n-1(c) shall be concluded not later than 180 days after the date of the
publication of notice of the filing of the application for registration, absent an extension.
77

requested by the applicant 224 and granted by the Commission.225
The Commission has determined not to adopt a joint form for registration with the
Commission as an SDR and SIP and with the CFTC as a swap data repository, as suggested by
one commenter. 226 First, the CFTC has already adopted the final registration rules and form for
swap data repositories to use. 227 Adopting a joint form for registration would require the CFTC
to amend its adopted Form SDR while the industry is still in the implementation phase and swap
data repositories are already provisionally registered with the CFTC. 228 Second, the CFTC’s
registration form for swap data repositories is substantially similar to the Commission’s Form
SDR. Thus, the Commission does not anticipate that filing with each Commission separately
will entail a significant cost for dual registrants even though the Commission and the CFTC have

224

As discussed below, the Commission is adopting technical amendments to Exchange Act
Rule 24b-2 to clarify that the confidential portion of electronic filings by SDRs must be
filed electronically and to require SDRs to request confidential treatment electronically.
The Commission is also adopting technical amendments to Rule 101 of Regulation S-T to
provide that, except as otherwise provided, all filings by SDRs, including any
information with respect to which confidential treatment is requested, must be filed
electronically.

225

The instructions to Form SDR have been modified from the proposal to clarify that
information supplied on the form may be made available on the Commission’s website.
See General Instruction 7 to Form SDR (stating that “[e]xcept in cases where confidential
treatment is requested by the applicant and granted by the Commission pursuant to the
Freedom of Information Act and the rules of the Commission thereunder, information
supplied on this form may be made available on the Commission’s website, will be
included routinely in the public files of the Commission, and will be available for
inspection by any interested person”). The Commission expects that non-confidential
information supplied on an SDR’s completed application for registration will be made
available on the Commission’s website; other filings on Form SDR may be made
available on the Commission’s website.

226

See DTCC 3, supra note 19.

227

See CFTC Part 49 Adopting Release, supra note 36.

As noted above, CFTC Rule 49.3(b) provides for provisional registration of a swap data
repository. 17 CFR 49.3(b).
78

tailored their respective forms in order to meet the specific needs of each agency and their
respective statutory mandates. For example, the Commission is revising proposed Form SDR to
require an SDR to provide certain information to address Exchange Act requirements applicable
to SIPs. The CFTC’s Form SDR does not require information to address some of these
requirements.
General Information. 229 Form SDR requires an applicant to provide contact information,
information concerning any predecessor SDR (if applicable), a list of asset classes of SBSs for
which the applicant is collecting and maintaining data or for which it proposes to collect and
maintain data, 230 a description of the functions that it performs or proposes to perform, and
general information regarding its business organization. 231 This information will assist the
Commission and its staff in evaluating applications for registration and overseeing registered
SDRs for purposes of determining whether the SDRs are able to comply with the federal
229

In the General Information section of Form SDR, the Commission is adding a new item
(Item 12) to implement the requirement in Rule 13n-2(b) for a registered SDR seeking to
withdraw from registration to identify a custodian of its books and records, and the
address(es) where the books and records will be located. See Section VI.B of this release
discussing Rule 13n-2(b).

230

As proposed, Item 6 of Form SDR implicitly pertained to the data that an applicant is
collecting and maintaining or proposes to collect and maintain. The Commission is
revising Item 6 of Form SDR from the proposal to make this explicit by adding
references to “data.”

231

See Items 1 – 10 of Form SDR. The Commission is revising Form SDR from the
proposal to remove the heading “Business Organization” in the “General Information”
section because the heading is superfluous and may lead to confusion with another
section entitled “Exhibits – Business Organization.” General information regarding
business organization is requested in the “General Information” section, whereas detailed
information regarding business organization is requested in the “Exhibits – Business
Organization” section. As proposed, Item 10 of Form SDR requested information
regarding the filing date of “partnership articles” and “place where partnership agreement
was filed.” For consistency, the Commission is revising Item 10 of Form SDR from the
proposal to request the filing date of the “partnership agreement” rather than “partnership
articles.”
79

securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.
An applicant is required to acknowledge and consent that any notice or service of
process, pleadings, or other documents in connection with any action or proceeding against the
applicant may be effectuated by certified mail to an officer or person specified by the SDR at a
given U.S. address. 232 The Commission believes that such consent is important to minimize any
logistical obstacles (e.g., locating defendants or respondents abroad) that the Commission may
encounter when attempting to provide notice to an applicant or to effect service, including
service overseas.
Form SDR must be signed by a person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the
applicant. 233 The signer is required to certify that all information contained in the application,
including the required items and exhibits, is true, current, and complete. 234 The Commission

232

See Item 11 of Form SDR.

233

See Item 13 of Form SDR.

234

See Item 13 of Form SDR. The Commission is revising the signature block from the
proposal to be consistent with an SDR’s filing requirements for interim amendments on
Form SDR. See note infra 356 (discussing amendment of signature block). The
Commission is also revising the signature block to state that “[i]ntentional misstatements
or omissions of fact constitute federal criminal violations (see 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 15
U.S.C. 78ff(a)).” This statement was included in Instruction 5 of proposed Form SDR,
and is included in Instruction 7 of Form SDR, as adopted. This statement has been added
to the signature block to remind the signer of the consequences of intentional
misstatements or omissions of fact. See 18 U.S.C. 1001 (applying to “whoever, in any
matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the
Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully — (1) falsifies, conceals, or
covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; (2) makes any materially false,
fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3) makes or uses any false writing
or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent
statement or entry”); 15 U.S.C. 78ff(a) (applying to, among other persons, “any person
who willfully and knowingly makes, or causes to be made, any statement in any
application, report, or document required to be filed under [the Exchange Act] or any rule
or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a registration statement as
provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of [Title 15 of the U.S. Code], or by any self80

believes that this certification requirement will serve as an effective means to assure that the
information filed on Form SDR with the Commission is reliable. 235 The Commission notes that
this certification is consistent with the certification provisions in the registration forms for SIPs,
broker-dealers, and investment advisers (i.e., Forms SIP, BD, and ADV). 236
If an applicant is a non-resident SDR, then the signer of Form SDR is also required to
certify that the applicant can, as a matter of law, and will provide the Commission with prompt
access to the applicant’s books and records and that the applicant can, as a matter of law, and
will submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission. 237 For purposes of the
certification, Form SDR defines “non-resident security-based swap data repository” as (i) in the
case of an individual, one who resides in or has his principal place of business in any place not in
the United States; (ii) in the case of a corporation, one incorporated in or having its principal

regulatory organization in connection with an application for membership or participation
therein or to become associated with a member thereof, which statement was false or
misleading with respect to any material fact”).

See Item 13 of Form SDR. Under Exchange Act Section 13(n)(2), an SDR is subject to
inspection and examination by any representative of the Commission. See 15 U.S.C.
78m(n)(2); see also Section VI.D.2 of this release discussing Rule 13n-4(b)(1). The
Commission is revising “can, as a matter of law” (referring to the certification regarding
access to the SDR’s books and records) and “can” (referring to the certification regarding
inspection and examination) in the signature block of proposed Form SDR to “can, as a
matter of law, and will” to track the language of Rule 13n-1(f), as discussed in Section
VI.A.5 of this release.

place of business in any place not in the United States; or (iii) in the case of a partnership or
other unincorporated organization or association, one having its principal place of business in
any place not in the United States. 238 Certain foreign jurisdictions may have laws that
complicate the ability of regulated persons such as SDRs located in their jurisdictions from
sharing certain information, including personal information of individuals that the regulated
persons come to possess from third persons (e.g., personal data relating to the identity of market
participants or their customers), with the Commission. 239 In order for the Commission to fulfill
its oversight responsibilities with respect to registered SDRs, it is important that Commission
representatives have prompt access to the SDRs’ books and records and have the ability to
conduct onsite inspections and examinations. 240 As noted above, one commenter was concerned
that non-resident SDRs are subject to a stricter regime than resident SDRs. 241 To the extent that

238

See Item 13 of Form SDR; see also Rule 13n-1(a)(1) (defining “non-resident securitybased swap data repository”). This definition is substantially similar to the definition of
“non-resident broker or dealer” in Exchange Act Rule 17a-7(d)(3). See 17 CFR 240.17a7(d)(3). Although there may be instances in which a non-resident SDR can fall within
the definition of a “U.S. person,” the Commission believes that, as a practical matter, all
non-resident SDRs would likely be non-U.S. persons given the similar distinguishing
factors in the definitions of “non-resident security-based swap data repository” and “nonU.S. person.” See supra note 99 (discussing definition of “U.S. person”) and Section
VI.A.5 of this release discussing non-resident SDRs.

See, e.g., Dagong Global Credit Rating Agency, Exchange Act Release No. 62968 (Sept.

the commenter’s concerns pertain to the certification requirement, the Commission notes that it
continues to believe that if a non-resident SDR is registered with the Commission, the SDR’s
certification is important to confirm that it has taken the necessary steps to be in the position to
provide the Commission with prompt access to the SDR’s books and records and to be subject to
onsite inspection and examination by the Commission. Failure to make this certification may be
a basis for the Commission to institute proceedings to consider denying an application for
registration. If a registered non-resident SDR becomes unable to provide this certification, then
this may be a basis for the Commission to institute proceedings to consider revoking the SDR’s
registration.
Business Organization. Form SDR requires each applicant to provide as exhibits detailed
information regarding its business organization, including information about (1) any person that
owns 10 percent or more of the applicant’s stock or that, either directly or indirectly, through
agreement or otherwise, in any other manner, may control or direct the applicant’s management
or policies; 242 (2) the business experience, qualifications, and disciplinary history of its
designated CCO, officers, directors, governors, and persons performing functions similar to any
of the foregoing, and the members of all standing committees; 243 (3) its governance

See Items 15 and 16 of Form SDR. More specifically, Form SDR requires an applicant
to disclose the following information regarding its designated CCO, officers, directors,
governors, and persons performing functions similar to any of the foregoing, and the
members of all standing committees: (a) name; (b) title; (c) date of commencement and,
if appropriate, termination of present term of position; (d) length of time such person has
held the same position; (e) brief account of the business experience of such person over
the last five years; (f) any other business affiliations in the securities industry or
derivatives industry; and (g) details of: (1) any order of the Commission with respect to
such person pursuant to Sections 15(b)(4), 15(b)(6), 19(h)(2), or 19(h)(3) of the
Exchange Act, (2) any conviction or injunction of a type described in Sections
l5(b)(4)(B) or (C) of the Exchange Act within the past ten years, (3) any action of an
83

arrangements; 244 (4) the applicant’s constitution, articles of incorporation or association with all
amendments to them, existing by-laws, rules, procedures, and instruments corresponding to
them; 245 (5) the applicant’s organizational structure; 246 (6) its affiliates; 247 (7) any material

SRO with respect to such person imposing a final disciplinary sanction pursuant to
Exchange Act Sections 6(b)(6), l5A(b)(7), or 17A(b)(3)(G), (4) any final action by an
SRO with respect to such person constituting a denial, bar, prohibition, or limitation of
membership, participation, or association with a member, or of access to services offered
by such organization or a member thereof, and (5) any final action by another federal
regulatory agency, including the CFTC, any state regulatory agency, or any foreign
financial regulatory authority resulting in: (i) a finding that such person has made a false
statement or omission, or has been dishonest, unfair, or unethical; (ii) a finding that such
person has been involved in a violation of any securities-related regulations or statutes;
(iii) a finding that such person has been a cause of a business having its authorization to
do business denied, suspended, revoked, or restricted; (iv) an order entered, in the past
ten years, against such person in connection with a securities-related activity; or (v) any
disciplinary sanction, including a denial, suspension, or revocation of such person’s
registration or license or otherwise, by order, a prevention from associating with a
securities-related or a restriction of such person’s activities. The Commission is
correcting a typographical error in proposed Items 14(g)(4) and 15(g)(4). As proposed,
the items stated “. . . such organization of a member thereof.” As adopted, Items 15(g)(4)
and 16(g)(4) state “. . . such organization or a member thereof.”
244

See Item 17 of Form SDR. The Commission has made minor revisions to Form SDR
from the proposal with regard to the disclosure of governance arrangements for the sake
of clarity. Compare Item 16 of Form SDR, as proposed (requiring disclosure of the
responsibilities “of each of the board and such committee” and the composition “of each
board and such committee”), with Item 17 of Form SDR, as adopted (requiring disclosure
of the responsibilities and composition “of the board and each such committee”).

245

See Item 18 of Form SDR.

246

See Item 19 of Form SDR.

247

See Item 20 of Form SDR. For purposes of Form SDR, an “affiliate” of an SDR is
defined as a person that, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with the SDR. See also Rule 13n-4(a)(1); Rule 13n-9(a)(1). This
definition of “affiliate” is designed to allow the Commission to collect comprehensive
identifying information relating to an SDR. This definition is substantially similar to the
definition of “affiliate” in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. See 17 CFR 240.12b-2. See also
infra note 621 (defining “control” (including the terms “controlled by” and “under
common control with”)). The Commission notes that it received a comment letter after
the Proposing Release through the Commission’s general solicitation for comments that
addressed the definition of “affiliate” for all of Title VII. See letter from ABA Securities
84

pending legal proceedings to which the applicant or its affiliate(s) is a party or to which any of its
property is the subject; 248 (8) the applicant’s material contracts with any SB SEF, clearing
agency, central counterparty, and third party service provider; 249 and (9) the applicant’s policies
and procedures to minimize conflicts of interest in its decision-making process and to resolve
any such conflicts of interest. 250 Obtaining this information will assist the Commission in,
among other things, understanding an SDR’s overall business structure, governance
arrangements, and operations, all of which will assist the Commission in its inspection and
examination of the SDR and the Commission’s decision on whether to grant the SDR’s
registration.
Association, American Council of Life Insurers, Financial Services Roundtable, Futures
Industry Association, Institute of International Bankers, International Swaps and
Derivatives Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association,
available on the Commission’s website at http://www.sec.gov/comments/df-titlevii/swap-data-repositories/swap-data-repositories.shtml (suggesting defining “affiliate”
for the purposes of Title VII rulemaking generally as “any group of entities that is under
common control and that reports information or prepares its financial statements on a
consolidated basis”). The commenter focused on the effect of the definition in the
context of inter-affiliate transactions, such as whether inter-affiliate transactions should
be counted when determining if a person is required to register as an SBS dealer. Among
other things, the commenter addressed the reporting of inter-affiliate transactions to
SDRs. Because Form SDR and the SDR Rules do not pertain to what transactions must
be reported to an SDR, the Commission believes that the letter is not relevant to Form
SDR or the SDR Rules. Additionally, the Commission believes that it is important that
an applicant for registration as an SDR provide information regarding all of its affiliates,
regardless of whether the SDR’s and affiliates’ financial statements are prepared on a
consolidated basis. Among other reasons, the Commission needs to know the identity of
an SDR’s affiliates before it can determine whether the SDR has any material conflicts of
interest based on the services provided by those affiliates or is providing favorable
treatment to affiliates in accessing the SDR’s services or whether the SDR is complying
with other rules and core principles, such as the core principle related to access to
services and data.

The Commission is revising Form SDR from the proposal requiring disclosure of
business affiliations in the “derivatives industry” rather than the “OTC derivatives industry” for
an applicant’s designated CCO, officers, directors, governors, and persons performing functions
similar to any of the foregoing, and the members of all standing committees 251 The Commission
is making this revision to clarify that the disclosure covers derivatives traded on exchanges and
SB SEFs as well as those traded over-the-counter.
Financial Information. Each applicant is required to disclose as exhibits to Form SDR
certain financial and related information, including (1) its statement of financial position, results
of operations, statement of sources and application of revenues, and all notes or schedules
thereto, as of the most recent fiscal year of the applicant, or, alternatively, a financial report, as
discussed further in Section VI.J.5 of this release; 252 (2) a statement of financial position and
results of operations for each affiliate of the applicant as of the end of the most recent fiscal year
of each such affiliate, or, alternatively, identification of the most recently filed annual report on
Form 10-K of the applicant’s affiliate, if available; 253 (3) a list of all dues, fees, and other charges
imposed, or to be imposed, for the applicant’s services, as well as all discounts and rebates
251

Compare Items 14(f) and 15(f) of proposed Form SDR with Items 15(f) and 16(f) of
Form SDR, as adopted.

252

See Item 24 of Form SDR. As proposed, this item referred to a “balance sheet” and a
“statement of income and expenses” rather than a “statement of financial position” and
“results of operations.” The Commission is making this change from the proposal for
consistency with Rule 13n-11(f)(4). See Section VI.J.5 of this release discussing Rule
13n-11(f). This revision is not intended to substantively change the requirements of this
item.

See Item 25 of Form SDR. As proposed, this item referred to a “balance sheet” and a

consistency with Rule 13n-11(f)(4). See Section VI.J.5 of this release discussing Rule
13n-11(f). This revision is not intended to substantively change the requirements of this
item.

offered, or to be offered; 254 (4) a description of the basis and methods used in determining the
level and structure of the applicant’s services as well as its dues, fees, other charges, discounts,
or rebates; 255 and (5) a description of any differentiations in such dues, fees, other charges,
discounts, and rebates. 256 This information will assist the Commission in, among other things,
its decision of whether to grant the SDR’s registration and in its evaluation of the financial
resources available to the SDR to support its operations.
Operational Capability. Form SDR requires each applicant to provide as exhibits
information on its operational capability, including (1) its SDR and SIP functions and
services; 257 (2) the computer hardware that it uses to perform its SDR or SIP functions; 258 (3)
personnel qualifications for each category of professional, non-professional, and supervisory
employees employed by the applicant or the division, subdivision, or other segregable entity
within the applicant; 259 (4) the applicant’s measures or procedures to provide for the security of
any system employed to perform its SDR or SIP functions, including any physical and
operational safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access to the system; 260 (5) any
circumstances within the past year in which such security measures or safeguards failed to
prevent any such unauthorized access to the system and any measures taken to prevent a

reoccurrence; 261 (6) any measures used by the applicant to satisfy itself that the information
received or disseminated by the system is accurate; 262 (7) the applicant’s backup systems or
subsystems that are designed to prevent interruptions in the performance of any SDR or SIP
functions; 263 (8) limitations on the applicant’s capacity to receive (or collect), process, store, or
display (or disseminate for display or other use) its data and factors that account for such
limitations; 264 and (9) the priorities of assignment of capacity between functions of an SDR or
SIP and any other uses and methods used or able to be used to divert capacity between such
functions and other uses. 265 As stated in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, SDRs themselves
are subject to certain operational risks that may impede their ability to fulfill their roles. 266
Obtaining information regarding an SDR’s operational capability will assist the Commission in
determining, among other things, whether an SDR’s automated systems provide adequate levels
of capacity, integrity, resiliency, availability, and security.
As highlighted by one commenter, it is imperative that Form SDR includes “information
related to the SDR’s operating schedule, real-time processing, existence of multiple redundant
infrastructures for continuity, strong information security controls, and robust reporting

privacy of such data could lead to market abuse and subsequent loss of liquidity.”)).

operations.” 267 The Commission believes that the operational capability information requested
on Form SDR sufficiently addresses the commenter’s concern. In addition, Commission
representatives may conduct inspections or examinations to assess a registered SDR’s ongoing
operational capability and compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder. 268
Access to Services and Data. Form SDR requires an applicant to provide as exhibits
information regarding access to its services and data, including (1) the number of persons who
presently subscribe, or who have notified the applicant of their intention to subscribe, to its
services; 269 (2) instances in which the applicant has prohibited or limited any person with respect
to access to services offered or data maintained by the applicant; 270 (3) for each service that
involves the supply of information to a quotation board, ticker device, electronic information
terminal, or other such device, the total number of devices to which information is, or will be
supplied and any minimum and or maximum number of devices required or permitted by
agreement or otherwise to be serviced by the applicant; 271 (4) the storage media of any service
furnished in machine-readable form and the data elements of such service; 272 (5) copies of all

89

contracts governing the terms by which persons may subscribe to the SDR services, SIP services,
and any ancillary services provided by the applicant; 273 (6) any specifications, qualifications, or
other criteria that limit, are interpreted to limit, or have the effect of limiting access to or use of
any SDR or SIP services offered or data maintained by the applicant; 274 (7) any specifications,
qualifications, or other criteria required of persons who supply SBS information to the applicant
for collection, maintenance, processing, preparing for distribution, and publication by the
applicant or of persons who seek to connect to or link with the applicant; 275 (8) any
specifications, qualifications, or other criteria required of any person who requests access to data
maintained by the applicant; 276 and (9) the applicant’s policies and procedures to review any
prohibition or limitation of any person with respect to access to services offered or data
maintained by the applicant and to grant such person access to such services or data if such
person has been discriminated against unfairly. 277
The information regarding access to services and data will assist the Commission in
determining, among other things, whether an SDR can comply with Rule 13n-4(c)(1), which
relates to the core principle for market access to services and data, as discussed further in Section
VI.D.3.a of this release. With respect to Item 33 of Form SDR (requiring an SDR to provide
information regarding access to services and data, including any denials of such access), the

See Item 37 of Form SDR. The Commission is correcting a typographical error in
proposed Item 36 of Form SDR. As proposed, the item stated “any person, including, but
not limited to . . . third party service providers who request access . . . .” As adopted,
Item 37 states “any person, including, but not limited to . . . third party service providers,
who requests access . . . .”

277

See Item 38 of Form SDR.
90

Commission further believes that, due to an SDR’s role as a central recordkeeping facility for
SBSs, upon which the Commission and the public will rely for market-wide SBS data, the
Commission should be informed of persons who have been granted access to an SDR’s services
and data, as well as instances in which an SDR prohibits or limits access to its services. 278 As
part of the process to amend Form SDR from the proposal to accommodate SIP registration,
discussed above, the Commission is adding Item 33(c) to Form SDR so that the Commission can
obtain specific information regarding an SDR’s supply of information for public dissemination
purposes.
Other Policies and Procedures. Form SDR requires each applicant to attach as exhibits:
(1) the applicant’s policies and procedures to protect the privacy of any and all SBS transaction
information that the applicant receives from a market participant or any registered entity; 279 (2) a
description of the applicant’s safeguards, policies, and procedures to prevent the
misappropriation or misuse of (a) any confidential information received by the applicant,
including, but not limited to, trade data, position data, and any nonpublic personal information

278

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 (discussing Rule 909, which
requires a registered SDR to also register as a SIP); Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77311
n.33, supra note 2 (noting that if the Commission adopts proposed Rule 909 of
Regulation SBSR, then Exchange Act Section 11A(b)(5) would govern denials of access
to all SDRs’ services); see also 15 U.S.C. 78k-1(b)(5) (A registered SIP must promptly
file notice with the Commission if it, directly or indirectly, prohibits or limits any person
in respect of access to its services, which may be subject to review by the Commission.
If the Commission finds that (a) such limitation or prohibition is not consistent with
Exchange Act Section 11A and the rules and regulations thereunder and that such person
has been discriminated against unfairly or (b) the prohibition or limitation imposes any
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate, it may set aside the prohibition or
limitation and require the SIP to permit such person access to its services.). The
Commission has made certain changes to Form SDR from the proposal to accommodate
SIP registration. See supra note 220.

279

See Item 39 of Form SDR.
91

about a market participant or any of its customers; (b) material, nonpublic information; and/or (c)
intellectual property by the applicant or any person associated with the applicant for their
personal benefit or for the benefit of others; 280 (3) the applicant’s policies and procedures
regarding its use of the SBS transaction information that it receives from a market participant,
any registered entity, or any other person for non-commercial and/or commercial purposes; 281 (4)
the applicant’s procedures and a description of its facilities for resolving disputes over the
accuracy of the transaction data and positions that are recorded in the SDR; 282 (5) the applicant’s
policies and procedures relating to its calculation of positions; 283 (6) the applicant’s policies and
procedures to prevent any provision in a valid SBS from being invalidated or modified through
the procedures or operations of the applicant; 284 and (7) a plan to ensure that the transaction data
and position data that are recorded in the SDR continue to be maintained after the applicant
withdraws from registration, which shall include procedures for transferring transaction data and
position data to the Commission or its designee (including another registered SDR). 285 This
information will assist the Commission in determining, among other things, whether an SDR can
comply with the requirements to establish, maintain, and enforce these seven policies and
procedures, as discussed further in Sections VI.D, VI.E, VI.G, and VI.I of this release. In
addition, Form SDR requires an applicant to attach as exhibits all of the policies and procedures

set forth in Regulation SBSR. 286
One commenter suggested that the Commission require an applicant to submit its
“rulebook.” 287 The Commission does not believe that such a requirement is necessary, but is
revising Form SDR from the proposal to provide that if an applicant has a rulebook, then it may
attach its rulebook as an exhibit to the form, 288 as a supplement to the policies and procedures
required by Form SDR. The Commission believes that if an applicant has a rulebook, much of
the information that would be contained in the rulebook likely would be filed as part of an SDR’s
policies and procedures. 289 To the extent that an applicant’s rulebook is broader, an applicant
may submit its rulebook to the Commission if, for example, the applicant believes that it would
be useful for the Commission to better understand the context of the applicant’s policies and
procedures or how the policies and procedures relate to one another.
Legal Opinion. Form SDR requires each non-resident SDR to attach as an exhibit an
opinion of counsel that the SDR can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission with prompt
286

See Item 46 of Form SDR; Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rule 907
requiring SDRs to establish and maintain certain written policies and procedures).

287

DTCC 3, supra note 19.

288

See Item 47 of Form SDR.

289

The Commission notes that an SDR that is also registered with the CFTC as a swap data
repository is required under CFTC Rule 49.8 to either submit its rules and amendments
thereto for approval by the CFTC or self-certify that the rulebook complies with the
CFTC’s swap data repository rules and the CEA. See 17 CFR 49.8. The Dodd-Frank
Act did not establish SDRs as self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”) (which, under the
Exchange Act, are required to file their rules with the Commission) or create an express
obligation for SDRs to file their rules with the Commission. As noted above, SDRs must
provide certain policies and procedures on Form SDR. The Commission believes that
this disclosure is sufficient to enable the Commission to determine whether an SDR’s
policies and procedures are in compliance with the Exchange Act, including Section
13(n), and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Commission recognizes, however,
that reviewing a rulebook that is voluntarily submitted to the Commission may assist the
Commission in understanding other items in an applicant’s Form SDR.
93

access to the SDR’s books and records and that the SDR can, as a matter of law, submit to onsite
inspection and examination by the Commission. 290
As discussed above, one commenter suggested that the legal opinion requirement would
subject non-resident SDRs to a stricter regulatory regime than resident SDRs. 291 The
Commission, however, continues to believe that non-resident SDRs that are registered, or seek to
register, with the Commission should be required to provide the opinion of counsel. Each
jurisdiction may have a different legal framework (e.g., privacy laws) that may limit or restrict
the Commission’s ability to access information from an SDR. Rather than create unequal
regulatory obligations, the legal opinion requirement equalizes the regulatory landscape for
SDRs by addressing whether a non-resident SDR is able to comply with the requirements for it
to provide the Commission with prompt access to the SDR’s books and records, 292 and to submit
to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission, 293 similar to SDRs that reside in the
United States. Failure to provide an opinion of counsel may be a basis for the Commission to
institute proceedings to consider denying an application for registration.
Electronic Filing. The Commission is revising Rule 13n-1(b) from the proposal to
conform the rule with General Instruction 1 to Form SDR. As revised, Rule 13n-1(b) provides
that in addition to an application for registration as an SDR, all amendments thereto must be filed

290

See Item 48 of Form SDR.

291

ESMA, supra note 19.

292

See Rule 13n-7(b)(3) (requiring every SDR to, upon request of any representative of the
Commission, promptly furnish requested documents to the representative).

electronically in a tagged 294 data format on Form SDR with the Commission in accordance with
the instructions contained in the form. 295 This modification to also require all amendments on
Form SDR be filed electronically in a tagged data format is intended to conform with General
Instruction 1 to Form SDR, which requires the form and exhibits thereto to be filed electronically
in a tagged data format by an applicant for registration as an SDR and by an SDR amending its
application for registration.
The Commission anticipates developing an electronic filing system through which an
SDR will be able to file and update Form SDR on or about the effective date of Rule 13n-1. 296
If the Commission’s electronic filing system is unavailable at the time an applicant seeks to file
its application for registration on Form SDR, the applicant may file the form, including any
294

The term “tag” (including the term “tagged”) is being revised from the proposal to have
the same meaning as set forth in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T (defining “tag” as “an
identifier that highlights specific information to EDGAR that is in the format required by
the EDGAR Filer Manual”). See Rules 13n-1(a)(2), 13n-2(a), and 13n-11(b)(9); see also
17 CFR 232.11. The Commission is revising this term from the proposal to be consistent
with all the other terms in the SDR Rules that cross-reference to the definitions set forth
in Regulation S-T, where applicable. For example, the term “EDGAR Filer Manual” has
the same meaning as set forth in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T (defining “EDGAR Filer
Manual” as “the current version of the manual prepared by the Commission setting out
the technical format requirements for an electronic submission”). See Rule 13n-11(b)(3);
see also 17 CFR 232.11.

295

See Rule 13n-1(b).

296

This electronic filing system for Form SDR will be through EDGAR, and thus, the
electronic filing requirements of Regulation S-T will apply. See generally 17 CFR 232
(governing the electronic submission of documents filed with the Commission). The
Commission is amending General Instruction 1 to Form SDR to clarify the applicability
of Regulation S-T to Form SDR. To conform with how filings are presently made
through EDGAR, the Commission has made several minor edits to Form SDR from the
proposal. See, e.g., Instruction 10 of Form SDR (providing guidance on filing Form SDR
as an amendment, other than an annual amendment); Item 3 of Form SDR (requesting
mailing address, which includes state/country and mailing zip/postal code); Item 9 of
Form SDR (requesting information regarding an entity’s incorporation or organization);
Item 13 of Form SDR (requesting date of signature in different format).
95

amendments thereto, in paper format with the Commission’s Division of Trading and Markets at
the Commission’s principal office in Washington, DC. However, doing so does not relieve the
SDR from compliance with the requirement in Rule 13n-1(b) to file Form SDR “electronically in
a tagged data format.” Therefore, when the Commission’s electronic filing system is available,
the applicant should file electronically any initial and amended Form SDRs that had been filed
previously in paper format. 297 The Commission expects that the information filed will be made
available on the Commission’s website, except in cases where confidential treatment is requested
by an SDR and granted by the Commission. 298 The Commission acknowledges that SDRs will
likely incur additional costs and burdens, particularly in initial compliance, with the data tagging
requirement, when compared with filing Form SDR in paper format. However, the Commission
believes that such costs will be minimal and that this requirement will facilitate review and
analysis of registration materials by Commission staff and, to the extent such materials are made
public, the public. The Commission believes that the costs of completing Form SDR in tagged
data format are justified by the benefits derived from the ability of investors, analysts, and
Commission staff to be able to more effectively capture, review, and analyze the SDR

297

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77309 n.25, supra note 2 (noting that SDRs might be
required to file Form SDR in paper until such time as an electronic filing system is
operational and capable of receiving the form and the Commission may require each
SDR to promptly re-file electronically Form SDR and any amendments to the form).

298

As discussed below, the Commission is adopting technical amendments to Exchange Act
Rule 24b-2 to clarify that the confidential portion of electronic filings by SDRs must be
filed electronically and to require SDRs to request confidential treatment electronically.
The Commission is also adopting technical amendments to Rule 101 of Regulation S-T to
provide that, except as otherwise provided, all filings by SDRs, including any
information with respect to which confidential treatment is requested, must be filed
electronically.

registration materials if they are in tagged data format. 299
Technical Amendments to Electronic Filing Requirements. The Commission is adopting
technical amendments to Exchange Act Rule 24b-2 300 and Rule 101 of Regulation S-T 301 to
clarify that SDRs’ electronic filings pursuant to Exchange Act Section 13(n) and the rules and
regulations thereunder 302 must include any information with respect to which confidential
treatment is requested (“confidential portion”). Generally speaking, Exchange Act Rule 24b-2
and Rule 101 of Regulation S-T require confidential treatment requests and the confidential
portion to be submitted in paper format only. The Commission’s technical amendments provide

299

As part of the Commission’s longstanding efforts to increase transparency and the
usefulness of information, the Commission has been implementing data tagging of
information contained in electronic filings to improve the accuracy of financial
information and facilitate its analysis. See Regulation S-T, 17 CFR 232; see also

an exception from Rule 24b-2’s and Rule 101’s paper-only filing requirements for all SDR
filings. Under this exception, the confidential portion of all SDR filings must be filed in
electronic format.
The Commission is revising Rule 24b-2 in two ways. First, the Commission is revising
Rule 24b-2(b) to provide an exception for persons providing materials pursuant to Rule 24b-2(h)
from the general requirement to omit the confidential portion from “the material filed.” 303
Second, the Commission is adding Rule 24b-2(h) to provide that an SDR must not omit the
confidential portion from the material filed in electronic format pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 13(n) and the rules and regulations thereunder, and must request confidential treatment
electronically in lieu of the procedures described in Rule 24b-2(b).
The Commission is also revising Rule 101 to add paragraph (a)(1)(xvii) to the list of
mandated electronic submissions. Specifically, paragraph (a)(1)(xvii) adds to this list documents
filed with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 13(n) and the rules and regulations
thereunder, including Form SDR and reports filed pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13n-11(d)
and (f). 304 The Commission is also revising Rule 101(c) to provide that except as otherwise
specified in Rule 101(d), confidential treatment requests and the information with respect to
which confidential treatment is requested must not be submitted in electronic format. The
Commission is further adding Rule 101(d) to provide as an exception to Rule 101(c)’s paperonly filing requirement all documents, including any information with respect to which

303

Rule 24b-2(a) refers to “any registration statement, report, application, statement,
correspondence, notice or other document” as “the material filed.”

and regulations thereunder.
Electronic filing of all materials filed by SDRs, including the confidential portion, will
reduce the burden on SDRs by not requiring a separate paper submission and facilitate the
Commission’s review and analysis of the filings. 305

Factors for Approval of Registration and Procedural Process for Review
(Rule 13n-1(c))
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-1(c) would establish the timeframe for Commission action on
applications for registration as an SDR, as well as the Commission’s procedures for reviewing
applications for registration. In particular, proposed Rule 13n-1(c) provided that, within 90 days
of the date of the filing of an application for registration on Form SDR (or within such longer
period as to which the SDR consents), the Commission will either grant the registration by order
or institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. The proposed rule
set forth the time period for such proceedings. The proposed rule also set forth the standard
applicable to an application for registration as an SDR.
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Although the Commission did not receive any comments directly relating to this
proposed rule, two commenters expressed their views on the SDR registration process
generally. 306
The first commenter recommended sufficient time for an appropriate level of due
305

See Rules 13-1(b); 13n-2(b); 13n-11(d)(2); see also Rule 13n-11(f)(5); General
Instruction 1 to Form SDR.

306

See DTCC 2, supra note 19; ICE CB, supra note 26.
99

diligence with respect to applications for registration. 307 While the commenter expressly
referenced the proposed temporary registration rule, the Commission believes that the
commenter’s concern regarding the operational capability of SDRs is applicable to any applicant
for registration as an SDR. 308 Additionally, the same commenter supported combining new
Form SDR with Form SIP, 309 which would necessitate a revision to Rule 13n-1(c), as described
below. 310
The second commenter requested the Commission’s expedited review of SDR
registration. 311
c.

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-1(c) as proposed,
307

DTCC 2, supra note 19 (“DTCC is concerned that the SEC’s proposed implementation
schedule for reporting to SDRs is heavily compressed and, when coupled with the
temporary registration regime, may lead to compromised solutions, including operational
and security compromises . . . . [P]otential SDRs are unlikely to be able to offer fully
robust or efficient solutions for early registration, given that the final rules will be
available relatively shortly before the effective date. DTCC recommends that appropriate
due diligence is conducted with respect to the temporary registration process and that
those diligence findings are either used to support transition of existing infrastructure or
used for new entrants who can demonstrate that their infrastructure supports key
operational capabilities, including 24/6 operation, real-time processing, multiple
redundancy, and robust information security controls.”); see also DTCC 3, supra note 19
(“SDRs must be able to demonstrate an infrastructure which supports critical operational
capabilities . . . . Assessment of these core capabilities is a critical component of any
registration process, including a temporary registration.”).

308

See Section VI.A.3.c of this release discussing the Commission’s decision not to adopt
the proposed temporary registration rule.

309

DTCC 2, supra note 19 (requesting that the Commission combine Form SDR and Form
SIP such that an SDR would register as an SDR and a SIP using only one form or permit
either Form SDR or Form SIP to be the application for registration as both an SDR and
an SIP); DTCC 3, supra note 19.

310

See Section VI.A.1 of this release discussing combining Form SDR and Form SIP.

311

ICE CB, supra note 26 (suggesting that the Commission take into consideration the
SDR’s provisional registration with the CFTC).
100

with minor modifications. First, the Commission is making minor revisions from the proposal
relating to the event that begins the 90-day period for Commission review and action on the
application for registration as an SDR. The final rule provides that within 90 days of the date of
the publication of notice of the filing of an application for registration (or within such longer
period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission will either grant the registration by
order or institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be granted or denied. 312
The 90-day period will not begin to run until an SDR files a complete Form SDR with the
Commission,313 and the Commission publishes notice of the filing of Form SDR to afford
interested persons an opportunity to submit written comments concerning such application. 314
As discussed above, in light of the Commission’s adoption of the requirement for a registered

312

Rule 13n-1(c).

313

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77313, supra note 2. If a Form SDR is incomplete, then
it may be deemed as not acceptable for filing. General Instruction 7 to Form SDR, as
adopted, provides that “[a] form that is not prepared and executed in compliance with
applicable requirements may be deemed as not acceptable for filing.” Further, the
application must include information sufficient to allow the Commission to assess the
applicant’s ability to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Form SDR consists of instructions, a list of questions, a signature page, and a
list of exhibits that the Commission requires in order to be able to determine whether an
applicant is able to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder. An application on Form SDR may not be considered complete unless the
applicant has filed, at a minimum, responses to all the questions listed, the signature page,
and exhibits as required in Form SDR, and any other materials the Commission may
require, upon request, in order to assess whether an applicant is able to comply with the
federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. If the application is not
complete, then the application will not be deemed to have been filed for the
Commission’s review.

314

If, however, an SDR files an amendment to its application for registration after the
Commission has already published notice of the filing of Form SDR and the Commission
finds that the amendment renders the prior filing materially incomplete, then the 90-day
period will reset from the time that the Commission deems the amended application to be
complete for the Commission’s review.
101

SDR to also register as a SIP in Regulation SBSR, 315 the Commission has decided to consolidate
Form SIP and Form SDR in order to make the registration process for SDRs more efficient; this
approach has been endorsed by one commenter. 316 The Commission’s revision of Rule 13n-1(c)
relating to the publication of notice makes it procedurally consistent with the registration process
applicable to SIPs under Exchange Act Section 11A(b) 317 and stems from the Commission’s
requirement that a registered SDR register as a SIP 318 and the Commission’s revision of Form
SDR to accommodate SIP registration. Exchange Act Section 11A(b)(3) provides that the
Commission will, upon the filing of an application for registration as a SIP, publish notice of the
filing and afford interested persons an opportunity to submit written data, views, and arguments
concerning such application; within 90 days of the date of the publication of such notice (or
within such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission will by order
grant such registration or institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be
denied. 319 The Commission has determined to adopt Rule 13n-1(c) with revised text from the
proposal that conforms the event preceding the period for Commission action, with respect to
applications for registration as an SDR, to the event set forth in Section 11A(b)(3), with respect
to applications for registration as a SIP. 320
Second, the Commission is revising Rule 13n-1(c) from the proposal to clarify that the
purpose of proceedings instituted pursuant to the rule is to determine whether an applicant’s

registration as an SDR should be granted or denied, rather than only denied (as proposed). 321
The Commission is further revising Rule 13n-1(c) from the proposal to provide that proceedings
instituted pursuant to the rule will include notice of the issues under consideration (rather than
grounds for denial under consideration, as proposed) and opportunity for hearing on the record
and will be concluded within 180 days after the date of the publication of notice of the filing of
the application for registration. 322 These revisions from the proposal are intended to make the
rule internally consistent. 323
The Commission is adopting Rule 13n-1(c) as proposed in all other respects. Rule 13n1(c) provides that at the conclusion of proceedings instituted pursuant to the rule, the
Commission, by order, will grant or deny such registration. 324 The Commission may extend the
time for conclusion of such proceedings for up to 90 days if it finds good cause for such
extension and publishes its reasons for so finding or for such longer period as to which the SDR
consents. 325

321

See Rule 13n-1(c)(2).

322

See Rule 13n-1(c)(2). For the reasons provided above, in conjunction with the revision
from the proposal to the event that precedes the 90-day period, and for consistency within
the rule, the Commission is also revising from the proposal the event that precedes the
180-day period for conclusion of Commission action on the application for registration as
an SDR. In making this revision, the Commission is changing “not later than 180 days”
to “within 180 days” for consistency within the rule.

323

Proposed Rule 13n-1(c)(2) stated that the Commission may institute proceedings to
determine whether registration should be “denied,” and that such proceedings include
notice of the “grounds for denial,” but that at the conclusion of such proceedings, the
Commission shall “grant or deny” registration. As adopted, the rule clarifies that the
Commission may institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be
“granted or denied” and that proceedings instituted pursuant to this rule must include
notice of the “issues under consideration.”

As noted in the Proposing Release, the Commission believes that the timeframes for
reviewing applications for registration as an SDR are appropriate to allow Commission staff
sufficient time to ask questions and, as needed, to request amendments or changes by SDRs to
address legal or regulatory concerns before the Commission takes final action on an application
for registration. 326 In addition, the registration process provides a mechanism for an SDR to
demonstrate that it can comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder. 327 One commenter requested that the Commission provide for expedited review of
the commenter’s application for registration as an SDR, in part because of its provisional
registration with the CFTC as a swap data repository. 328 It is unclear what the commenter means
by “expedited review,” but the Commission believes that the procedures for reviewing
applications for registration as an SDR that the Commission is adopting in this release provide
reasonable timeframes for the Commission’s review of the applications and the Compliance Date
for the SDR Rules will address the concerns of existing SDRs operating during the registration
period. 329 Moreover, these procedures are consistent with the procedures for reviewing
applications of other registrants by the Commission (e.g., SIPs, broker-dealers, nationally
recognized statistical ratings organizations, national securities exchanges, registered securities
326

Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77313, supra note 2. In addition to the applicant’s
registration on Form SDR, “[a]s part of the application process, each SDR shall provide
additional information to any representative of the Commission upon request.” See Rule
13n-1(b).

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77313, supra note 2 (discussing Rule 13n-1(c) and

associations, and registered clearing agencies) although the timeframes for review vary. 330
Additionally, the Commission notes that its review of an SDR’s application for registration is
independent of the CFTC’s review of a swap data repository’s application for registration. 331
The Commission will grant the registration of an SDR if the Commission finds that the
SDR is so organized, and has the capacity, to be able to assure the prompt, accurate, and reliable
performance of its functions as an SDR, comply with any applicable provision of the federal
securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and carry out its functions in a manner
consistent with the purposes of Exchange Act Section 13(n) and the rules and regulations
thereunder. 332 The Commission will deny the registration of an SDR if the Commission does not
make such a finding. 333
One commenter indicated that applicants for registration as an SDR should be able to
“demonstrate that their infrastructure supports key operational capabilities, including 24/6
operation, real-time processing, multiple redundancy, and robust information security
controls.” 334 Similarly, the same commenter stated that “SDRs must be able to demonstrate an
infrastructure which supports critical operational capabilities” and “[a]ssessment of these core
capabilities is a critical component of any registration process.” 335 The Commission generally
agrees with this commenter and believes that an SDR’s infrastructure and operational capabilities

are important factors in determining whether to grant an SDR’s application for registration. 336
In the Proposing Release, the Commission asked whether, in order to form a more
complete and informed basis on which to determine whether to grant, deny, or revoke an SDR’s
registration, it should adopt a requirement that an SDR file with the Commission, as a condition
of registration or continued registration, a review relating to the SDR’s operational capacity and
ability to meet its regulatory obligations. 337 The Commission did not receive any comments
directly on this issue, but upon further consideration, the Commission has determined not to
require an SDR to file with the Commission a review of the SDR’s operational capacity and
ability to meet its regulatory obligations because it is not clear that the benefits of such a
requirement would justify the costs. However, in determining whether an applicant meets the
criteria set forth in Rule 13n-1(c), the Commission will consider the application and any
additional information obtained from the SDR, which may include information obtained in
connection with an inspection or examination of the SDR. Additionally, in connection therewith,
the Commission may consider, among other things, whether an applicant can demonstrate its
operational capabilities and conduct its operations in compliance with its statutory and regulatory
obligations. If an applicant (rather than its affiliate) is already registered with the Commission
as, for example, a clearing agency, then Commission representatives may also take into account
any recent examinations in its determination pursuant to Rule 13n-1(c)(3).
336

See Rule 13n-6 (requiring SDRs to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to ensure that its systems provide adequate levels of
capacity, integrity, resiliency, availability, and security); Rule 13n-1(c)(3) (discussing the
standards for the Commission to grant registration of an SDR, including having the
capacity to be able to assure the prompt, accurate, and reliable performance of its
functions as an SDR, and comply with any applicable provision of the federal securities
laws and the rules and regulations thereunder).

337

Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77313, supra note 2.
106

The Commission will consider a registered SDR’s operational capacity and ability to
meet its statutory and regulatory obligations to determine whether the SDR should continue to
operate as such or whether the Commission should take steps to revoke the SDR’s registration.
As provided in Exchange Act Section 13(n)(2), “[e]ach registered security-based swap data
repository shall be subject to inspection and examination by any representative of the
Commission.”338 The results of such inspection and examination will be used to inform the
Commission whether the SDR is complying with the federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder. As discussed further below, under Rule 13n-2(e), if the Commission
finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that any registered SDR has, among
other things, failed to comply with any provision of the federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder, the Commission, by order, may revoke the SDR’s registration. 339
In considering initial applications for registration on Form SDR filed contemporaneously
with the Commission, the Commission intends to process such applications for multiple SDRs
accepting SBS transaction data from the same asset classes within the same period of time so as
to address competition concerns that could arise if such SDRs were granted registration at
different times. 340 Further, in light of the Commission’s adoption of the requirement in
Regulation SBSR for a registered SDR to register as a SIP, 341 the Commission is adopting Form
338

Exchange Act Section 13(n)(2), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(2). See also Section VI.D.2 of this
release discussing Rule 13n-4(b)(1), which implements Exchange Act Section 13(n)(2).

339

See Section VI.B of this release discussing Rule 13n-2(e).

340

Certain unexpected events that raise compliance concerns with respect to one applicant
but not another, such as deficiencies identified in connection with the Commission’s
consideration of whether an applicant meets the criteria set forth in Rule 13n-1(c), may
interfere with the Commission’s ability to process initial applications for registration
within the same period of time.

107

SDR, which incorporates the requirements of Form SIP, as discussed in Section VI.A.1.c above.
The Commission’s review of an applicant’s registration as an SDR on Form SDR will
encompass review with respect to both SDR and SIP registration. The Commission
contemplates that it will grant registrations to an applicant both as an SDR and as a SIP
simultaneously.
3.

Temporary Registration (Rule 13n-1(d))
a.

Proposed Rule

As proposed, Rule 13n-1(d) provided a method for SDRs to register temporarily with the
Commission. The proposed rule provided that, upon the request of an SDR, the Commission
may grant temporary registration of the SDR that would expire on the earlier of: (1) the date that
the Commission grants or denies (permanent) registration of the SDR, or (2) the date that the
Commission rescinds the temporary registration of the SDR. 342
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Two commenters submitted comments relating to this proposed rule. 343 One commenter
recommended that the Commission establish clear standards and requirements for temporary
registration. 344 Similarly, another commenter recommended that “the Commission establish
clearly articulated standards and requirements for temporary registration so that existing trade
repositories may quickly begin to provide similar transparency to the [SBS] markets that is
currently provided to the rest of the swaps market, thus facilitating the Commission’s oversight

108

of these markets.” 345 That same commenter also expressed concern about the temporary
registration provision, particularly the cumulative effect of the short time frame afforded for
registration and the possibility that a temporary registration regime “may lead to compromised
solutions [at SDRs], including operational and security compromises.” 346 Additionally, the
commenter urged the Commission to ensure that the registration process does not interfere with
the ongoing operation of existing SDRs.347
c.

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission has determined not to adopt proposed
Rule 13n-1(d). As stated in the Proposing Release, the temporary registration provision would
have enabled an SDR to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act upon its effective date (i.e., the later of
345

DTCC 5, supra note 19 (“Further clarity on the standards and process that will be utilized
to grant temporary registration will also provide applicants to register as [SDRs] with a
better understanding of the Commission’s expectations with respect to their obligations
and requirements prior to being granted full registration.”).

346

DTCC 2, supra note 19 (“DTCC is concerned that the SEC’s proposed implementation
schedule for reporting to SDRs is heavily compressed and, when coupled with the
temporary registration regime, may lead to compromised solutions, including operational
and security compromises . . . . [P]otential SDRs are unlikely to be able to offer fully
robust or efficient solutions for early registration, given that the final rules will be
available relatively shortly before the effective date. DTCC recommends that appropriate
due diligence is conducted with respect to the temporary registration process and that
those diligence findings are either used to support transition of existing infrastructure or
used for new entrants who can demonstrate that their infrastructure supports key
operational capabilities, including 24/6 operation, real-time processing, multiple
redundancy, and robust information security controls.”); see also DTCC 3, supra note 19
(“SDRs must be able to demonstrate an infrastructure which supports critical operational
capabilities . . . . Assessment of these core capabilities is a critical component of any
registration process, including a temporary registration.”).

347

DTCC 2, supra note 19; see also DTCC 5, supra note 19 (stating the same and “[w]hether
done through a phasing-in of final [SDR] rules or the Commission’s prompt issuance of
temporary registration conditioned on implementation of enhancements to comply more
fully with specified provisions, the Commission should ensure the continuation of
counterparty reporting and the ability of the entities currently performing the functions of
an [SDR] to receive and maintain current trade information on an ongoing basis”).
109

360 days after the date of its enactment or 60 days after publication of the final rule
implementing Exchange Act Section 13(n)) 348 regardless of any unexpected contingencies that
may arise in connection with the filing of Form SDR. The proposed temporary registration
would also have allowed the Commission to implement the registration requirements of the
Dodd-Frank Act for SDRs while still giving the Commission sufficient time to review fully the
application of an SDR after it becomes operational, but before granting a registration that is not
limited in duration.
These concerns were motivated primarily by the short timeframe between when the SDR
Rules were first proposed and when registration would have been required (i.e., as of July 16,
2011). However, the exemptive relief provided by the Commission, which was effective on June
15, 2011, 349 addressed this primary purpose for temporary registration. Further, the Compliance
Date for the SDR Rules 350 should provide sufficient time for SDRs to analyze and understand the
final SDR Rules, to develop and test new systems required to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act’s
provisions governing SDRs and the SDR Rules, to prepare and file Form SDR, to demonstrate
their ability to meet the criteria for registration set forth in Rule 13n-1(c)(3), and to obtain
registration with the Commission. Therefore, the Commission believes that it has addressed
commenters’ concerns relating to interference with the ongoing operation of existing SDRs. 351
For these reasons, the Commission no longer believes that a temporary registration regime for
SDRs is necessary or appropriate.

Amendment on Form SDR (Proposed Rule 13n-1(e)/Final Rule 13n-1(d))
a.

Proposed Rule

As proposed, Rule 13n-1(e) would require an SDR to file promptly an amendment on
Form SDR (“interim amendment”) if any information reported in Items 1 through 16, 25, and
46 352 of Form SDR or in any amendment thereto is or becomes inaccurate for any reason. The
Proposing Release indicated that an SDR would generally be required to file such an amendment
within 30 days from the time such information becomes inaccurate. 353 In addition, an SDR
would be required to file an annual amendment on Form SDR within 60 days after the end of its
fiscal year.
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission did not receive any comments relating to this proposed rule.
c.

Final Rule

The Commission is adopting Rule 13n-1(e) as proposed, redesignated as Rule 13n-1(d).
Under Rule 13n-1(d), if any information reported in Items 1 through 17, 26, and 48 of Form SDR
(designated as Items 1 through 16, 25, and 46 in proposed Rule 13n-1(e)) or in any amendment
thereto is or becomes inaccurate for any reason, whether before or after the registration has been
352

The Commission notes that the Proposing Release, proposed Rule 13n-1(e), and General
Instruction 6 to proposed Form SDR inadvertently referred to Item 44 instead of Item 46.
See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77314, 77315, and 77374, supra note 2. However, the
discussion in the Proposing Release made clear that the Commission expected a nonresident SDR to promptly amend its Form SDR after any changes in the legal and
regulatory framework that would impact the SDR’s ability to provide the Commission
with prompt access to the SDR’s books and records, and such amendment should include
a revised opinion of counsel. See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77314, supra note 2. This
discussion was clearly referring to the requirements in proposed Item 46 (requiring
opinion of counsel by non-resident SDRs), and not proposed Item 44 (requiring plan to
ensure data is maintained after the applicant withdraws from registration).

granted, an SDR shall promptly file an amendment on Form SDR updating the information. An
SDR should file an interim amendment as soon as practicable, and generally no later than 30
days from the time such information becomes inaccurate in order for the filing to be viewed as
“promptly” filed. For example, an SDR should file an amendment promptly after any change in
the identity of its CCO or if the biographical information provided about its CCO changes (e.g.,
if the CCO becomes the subject of certain specified SRO actions). 354
In addition to interim amendments, an SDR is required to file a comprehensive annual
amendment on Form SDR, including all items subject to interim amendments, within 60 days
after the end of its fiscal year. 355 This annual amendment must be fully restated and complete,
including all pages, answers to all items, together with exhibits. 356 This annual amendment must
also indicate which items have been amended since the last annual amendment, or if the SDR has
not yet filed an annual amendment, since the SDR’s application for registration. Rule 13n-1(d)
is consistent with the Commission’s requirements for other registrants (e.g., national securities
exchanges, broker-dealers, transfer agents, SIPs) to file updated and annual amendments to
registration forms with the Commission.357 The Commission believes that such amendments are

355

See Rule 13n-1(d).

356

The General Instructions to Form SDR have been amended from the proposal to clarify
what items and exhibits need to be included when filing an amendment. Additionally, the
Commission is revising Form SDR from the proposal to include separate designations on
the form for an annual amendment and an amendment other than an annual amendment,
rather than a single designation that covers any amendment. The signature block to Form
SDR has also been amended from the proposal to clarify that an SDR that files an
amendment (other than an annual amendment) need only represent that all unamended
information contained in Items 1 through 17, 26, and 48 remains true, current, and
complete as filed, rather than all unamended items and exhibits to Form SDR.
112

important to obtain updated information on each SDR, which will assist the Commission in
determining whether each SDR continues to be in compliance with the federal securities laws
and the rules and regulations thereunder. Obtaining updated information will also assist
Commission representatives in their inspection and examination of an SDR. The Commission
may make filed amendments available on its website, except for information where confidential
treatment is requested by the SDR 358 and granted by the Commission.

Service of Process and Non-Resident SDRs (Proposed Rules 13n-1(f) and
13n-1(g)/Final Rules 13n-1(e) and 13n-1(f))
a.

Proposed Rule

As proposed, Rule 13n-1(f) would require each SDR to designate and authorize on Form
SDR an agent in the United States, other than a Commission member, official, or employee, to
accept any notice or service of process, pleadings, or other documents in any action or
proceedings brought against the SDR to enforce the federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Proposed Rule 13n-1(g) would require any non-resident SDR applying
for registration to certify on Form SDR and provide an opinion of counsel that the SDR can, as a
357

See Exchange Act Rule 6a-2, 17 CFR 240.6a-2 (requiring national securities exchanges
to amend some information on Form 1 within 10 days, and other information annually);
Exchange Act Rule 15b3-1, 17 CFR 240.15b3-1 (requiring broker-dealers to promptly
amend applications for registration); Exchange Act Rules 17Ac2-1 and 17Ac2-2, 17 CFR
240.17Ac2-1 and 240.17Ac2-2 (requiring transfer agents to amend information on Form
TA-1 within 60 days, and to file an annual report); Rule 609 of Regulation NMS, 17 CFR
242.609, and Form SIP, 17 CFR 249.1001 (requiring SIPs to amend certain items on
Form SIP promptly and also requiring an annual amendment).

358

As discussed above, the Commission is adopting technical amendments to Exchange Act
Rule 24b-2 to clarify that the confidential portion of electronic filings by SDRs must be
filed electronically and to require SDRs to request confidential treatment electronically.
The Commission is also adopting technical amendments to Rule 101 of Regulation S-T to
provide that, except as otherwise provided, all filings by SDRs, including any
information with respect to which confidential treatment is requested, must be filed
electronically.

matter of law, provide the Commission with prompt access to the SDR’s books and records and
that the SDR can, as a matter of law, submit to onsite inspection and examination by the
Commission.
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission did not receive any comments relating to proposed Rule 13n-1(f). One
commenter submitted a comment relating to proposed Rule 13n-1(g). 359 The commenter
expressed concern that proposed Rule 13n-1(g) would subject non-resident SDRs to a stricter
regime than that applicable to resident SDRs. 360
c.

Final Rule

The Commission is adopting Rule 13n-1(f) as proposed, redesignated as Rule 13n-1(e).
Rule 13n-1(e) requires each SDR to designate and authorize on Form SDR an agent in the United
States, other than a Commission member, official, or employee, to accept any notice or service
of process, pleadings, or other documents in any action or proceedings brought against the SDR
to enforce the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. If an SDR
appoints a different agent to accept such notice or service of process, then the SDR will be
required to file promptly an amendment on Form SDR updating this information. 361 The
requirement applies equally to both SDRs within the United States and non-resident SDRs that
are required to register with the Commission. Rule 13n-1(e) is intended to conserve the

359

See ESMA, supra note 19.

360

ESMA, supra note 19 (“According to our reading, non-resident SDRs are actually subject
to a stricter regime than the resident ones, as they need to provide a legal opinion
certifying that they can provide the SEC with prompt access to their books and records
and that they can be subject to onsite inspections and examinations by the SEC.”).

361

See Rule 13n-1(d) (requiring an SDR to promptly file an amendment on Form SDR
updating information in Item 11 of Form SDR).
114

Commission’s resources and to minimize any logistical obstacles (e.g., locating defendants or
respondents within the United States or abroad) that the Commission may encounter when
attempting to effect service. For instance, by requiring an SDR to designate an agent for service
of process in the United States, and by prohibiting an SDR from designating a Commission
member, official, or employee as its agent for service of process, the rule will reduce a
significant resource burden on the Commission, including resources to locate agents of
registrants overseas and keep track of their whereabouts.
After considering the comment to proposed Rule 13n-1(g), the Commission is adopting
Rule 13n-1(g) as proposed, redesignated as Rule 13n-1(f), with one modification. Rule 13n-1(f)
requires any non-resident SDR applying for registration pursuant to this rule to certify on Form
SDR that the SDR can, as a matter of law, and will provide the Commission with prompt access
to the SDR’s books and records and can, as a matter of law, and will submit to onsite inspection
and examination by the Commission. Rule 13n-1(f) also requires any non-resident SDR
applying for registration to provide an opinion of counsel that the SDR can, as a matter of law,
provide the Commission with prompt access to the SDR’s books and records and can, as a matter
of law, submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission. The final rule differs
from the proposed rule in that, as proposed, a non-resident SDR would be required to certify that
it “can, as a matter of law” provide prompt access to the SDR’s books and records and submit to
onsite inspection and examination. As adopted, the rule requires the non-resident SDR to certify
that it “can, as a matter of law, and will” do those things. This change from the proposal is
intended to make clear to a non-resident SDR that it is making an affirmative commitment to
comply with its obligation to provide the Commission with prompt access to the SDR’s books

115

and records and submit to onsite inspection and examination. 362
While the Commission acknowledges that the rule will impose an additional requirement
on non-resident SDRs, for the reasons stated in Section VI.A.1.c above relating to Form SDR’s
certification and legal opinion requirements, the Commission continues to believe that before
granting registration to a non-resident SDR, it is appropriate to obtain a certification and opinion
of counsel that such person is in a position to provide legally the Commission with prompt
access to the SDR’s books and records and to be subject to onsite inspection and examination by
the Commission.363

Definition of “Report” (Proposed Rule 13n-1(h)/Final Rule 13n-1(g))
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-1(h) provided that “[a]n application for registration or any
amendment thereto that is filed pursuant to this [rule] shall be considered a ‘report’ filed with the
Commission for purposes of [Exchange Act Sections 18(a) and 32(a)] and the rules and
regulations thereunder and other applicable provisions of the United States Code and the rules
and regulations thereunder.”

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission did not receive any comments relating to this proposed rule.
362

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77312, supra note 2 (asking whether “the
representations that would be required to be made by the person who signs Form SDR
[are] appropriate and sufficiently clear,” and whether “the Commission [should] require
any additional or alternative representations”). See also Exchange Act Section 13(n)(2)
and Rule 13n-4(b)(1) (both requiring registered SDRs to be subject to inspection and
examination by any representative of the Commission) and Rule 13n-7(b) (requiring
SDRs to keep and preserve books and records and promptly furnish them to any
representative of the Commission upon request).

c.

Final Rule

The Commission is adopting Rule 13n-1(h) as proposed, redesignated as Rule 13n-1(g).
Rule 13n-1(g) provides that “[a]n application for registration or any amendment thereto that is
filed pursuant to this [rule] shall be considered a ‘report’ filed with the Commission for purposes
of [Exchange Act Sections 18(a) and 32(a)] and the rules and regulations thereunder and other
applicable provisions of the United States Code and the rules and regulations thereunder.”
Exchange Act Sections 18(a) and 32(a) set forth the potential liability for a person who makes, or
causes to be made, any false or misleading statement in any “report” filed with the Commission
(e.g., Form SDR). 364 The Commission believes that subjecting a person to this potential liability
will enhance the reliability and credibility of any “report” that is filed with the Commission
pursuant to Rule 13n-1 because the person will have incentive to take steps to verify the accuracy
of the report in order to avoid liability.
B.

Withdrawal From Registration; Revocation and Cancellation (Rule 13n-2)
1.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-2 set forth a process for a person to withdraw its registration as an

364

Exchange Act Section 18(a) provides, in part, that “[a]ny person who shall make or cause
to be made any statement in any . . . report . . . which statement was at the time and in the
light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect to
any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that such statement was false
or misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have purchased or sold a
security at a price which was affected by such statement, for damages caused by such
reliance, unless the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no
knowledge that such statement was false or misleading.” 15 U.S.C. 78r(a). Exchange
Act Section 32(a) provides, in part, that “[a]ny person who willfully and knowingly
makes, or causes to be made, any statement in any . . . report . . . which statement was
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, shall upon conviction be fined not
more than $5,000,000, or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both, except that when
such person is a person other than a natural person, a fine not exceeding $25,000,000 may
be imposed.” 15 U.S.C. 78ff(a).
117

SDR and for the Commission to revoke, suspend, or cancel an SDR’s registration. With respect
to proposed Rule 13n-2(b), a registered SDR would be required to withdraw from registration by
filing a notice of withdrawal with the Commission. The proposed rule would require the SDR to
designate on its notice of withdrawal a person associated with the SDR to serve as the custodian
of the SDR’s books and records. 365 Prior to filing a notice of withdrawal, an SDR would be
required to file an amended Form SDR to update any inaccurate information. 366 If there is no
inaccurate information to update, then an SDR would include a confirmation to that effect in its
notice of withdrawal.
Proposed Rule 13n-2(c) set forth the effective date of a notice of withdrawal from
registration. Proposed Rule 13n-2(d) provided that a notice of withdrawal from registration that
is filed pursuant to this section shall be considered a “report” filed with the Commission for
purposes of Exchange Act Sections 18(a) and 32(a) and the rules and regulations thereunder and
other applicable provisions of the United States Code and the rules and regulations thereunder. 367
Proposed Rule 13n-2(e) set forth the basis for the Commission, by order, to revoke the
registration of an SDR. Finally, proposed Rule 13n-2(f) provided that the Commission, by order,
may cancel the registration of an SDR if it finds that the SDR is no longer in existence or has
ceased to do business in the capacity specified in its application for registration.

3.

Final Rule

The Commission is adopting Rule 13n-2 as proposed with a few modifications. 368 The
Commission is revising the proposed rule to eliminate the requirement for a registered SDR to
file a separate notice of withdrawal with the Commission in order to streamline the withdrawal
process and make it more efficient for SDRs and Commission staff. Instead, Rule 13n-2(b)
permits a registered SDR to withdraw from registration by filing Form SDR electronically in a
tagged data format; 369 when making such a filing, the SDR must indicate on Form SDR that it is
filed for the purpose of withdrawing from registration. 370 The Commission is also revising the
proposed rule to give an SDR more flexibility in designating the custodian of the SDR’s books
and records by requiring the SDR to designate a person to serve as the custodian of the SDR’s

368

The Commission did not receive any comments on the definitions of “control” and
“person associated with a security-based swap data repository” in proposed Rule 13n2(a), but is omitting these definitions in Rule 13n-2 because the Commission’s revision of
the rule, as discussed in this section, no longer uses these terms.

369

The Commission is revising proposed Rule 13n-2(a) to add the definition of “tag”
(including the term tagged) to have the same meaning as set forth in Rule 11 of
Regulation S-T (17 CFR 232.11). This definition is added in order to conform the
requirements for filing Form SDR to withdraw registration with the requirements for
filing Form SDR to register or amend registration pursuant to Rule 13n-1.

370

Exchange Act Section 11A(b)(4) states that “[a] registered securities information
processor may, upon such terms and conditions as the Commission deems necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, withdraw from
registration by filing a written notice of withdrawal with the Commission.” 15 U.S.C.
78k-1(b)(4). A SIP that is dually-registered as an SDR may withdraw from registration
by filing Form SDR, which the Commission would deem as a written notice of
withdrawal under Exchange Act Section 11A(b)(4). In addition, the Commission has
modified the heading of this rule. As proposed, the heading of this rule was “Withdrawal
from registration.” As adopted, the heading is “Withdrawal from registration; revocation
and cancellation.” This change in the heading provides a more accurate description of
the subject of the rule.
119

books and records; 371 the person does not necessarily need to be associated with an SDR, as
proposed, and thus, the SDR has the option to designate an unaffiliated entity, such as another
registered SDR, as the custodian. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that an SDR’s
books and records are maintained and available to the Commission and other regulators after the
SDR withdraws from registration, and to assist the Commission in enforcing Rules 13n5(b)(7) 372 and 13n-7(c). 373
When filing a Form SDR as a withdrawal from registration, the SDR should update any
inaccurate information contained in its most recently filed Form SDR. 374 This requirement is
substantively the same as the proposal, which would require an SDR, prior to filing a notice of
withdrawal, to file an amended Form SDR to update any inaccurate information. 375 If there is no
inaccurate information to update, then an SDR should include a confirmation to that effect when
filing Form SDR. The Commission may make filed withdrawals available on its website, except

371

Rule 13n-2(b). The Commission is amending Form SDR from the proposal to add new
Item 12 to implement the requirement in Rule 13n-2(b) for an SDR to designate a
custodian of its books and records if it withdraws from registration. See new Item 12 to
Form SDR and Section VI.A.1 of this release discussing Form SDR. The Commission
has also made some conforming changes to proposed Form SDR and the General
Instructions to make clear that the form may be used for withdrawal of registration. For
example, General Instruction 1 now indicates that Form SDR and exhibits thereto are to
be filed electronically in a tagged data format in connection with withdrawing an SDR’s
registration. See General Instruction 1 to Form SDR.

372

See Section VI.E.7 of this release discussing requirement that an SDR that ceases to do
business preserve, maintain, and make accessible transaction data and historical
positions.

proposal to clarify what items and exhibits need to be included when filing a withdrawal.

Proposed Rule 13n-2(b).
120

for information where confidential treatment is requested by the SDR 376 and granted by the
Commission.
Rule 13n-2(c) provides that a withdrawal from registration filed by an SDR on Form
SDR shall become effective for all matters (except as provided in Rule 13n-2(c)) on the 60th day
after the filing thereof with the Commission, within such longer period of time as to which such
SDR consents or which the Commission, by order, may determine as necessary or appropriate in
the public interest or for the protection of investors, or within such shorter period of time as the
Commission may determine. A withdrawal from registration filed on Form SDR that is not
prepared and executed in compliance with applicable requirements may be deemed as not
acceptable for filing. 377 Rule 13n-2(d) provides that a withdrawal from registration filed on
Form SDR that is filed pursuant to this rule shall be considered a “report” filed with the
Commission for purposes of Exchange Act Sections 18(a) and 32(a) and the rules and
regulations thereunder and other applicable provisions of the United States Code and the rules
and regulations thereunder. 378
Under Rule 13n-2(e), if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity
for hearing, that any registered SDR has obtained its registration by making any false and
misleading statements with respect to any material fact or has violated or failed to comply with
376

As discussed in Section VI.A.1.c of this release, the Commission is adopting technical
amendments to Exchange Act Rule 24b-2 to clarify that the confidential portion of
electronic filings by SDRs must be filed electronically and to require SDRs to request
confidential treatment electronically. The Commission is also adopting technical
amendments to Rule 101 of Regulation S-T to provide that, except as otherwise provided,
all filings by SDRs, including any information with respect to which confidential
treatment is requested, must be filed electronically.

See Section VI.A.6 of this release discussing definition of “report.”
121

any provision of the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, the
Commission, by order, may revoke the registration. The rule further provides that pending final
determination of whether any registration be revoked, the Commission, by order, may suspend
such registration, if such suspension appears to the Commission, after notice and opportunity for
hearing on the record, to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
investors. 379 Finally, Rule 13n-2(f) provides that if the Commission finds that a registered SDR
is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business in the capacity specified in its application
for registration, the Commission, by order, may cancel the registration. 380
The Commission believes that it is important to set forth a process for a person to
withdraw its registration as an SDR and for the Commission to be able to revoke, suspend, or
cancel an SDR’s registration, similar to the approach that it takes with some of its other
registrants. 381
C.

Registration of Successor to Registered SDR (Rule 13n-3)
1.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-3 would govern the registration of a successor to a registered SDR.
379

Rule 13n-2(e).

380

Where an SDR anticipates that it will cease to exist or cease to do business as an SDR,
the SDR may withdraw from registration by filing a withdrawal on Form SDR pursuant
to Rule 13n-2(b). Regardless of whether the SDR withdraws from registration pursuant
to Rule 13n-2(b), the Commission revokes the SDR’s registration pursuant to Rule 13n2(e), or the Commission cancels the SDR’s registration pursuant to Rule 13n-2(f), the
SDR is obligated to comply with Rules 13n-5(b)(7) and 13n-7(c), which are discussed in
Sections VI.E.7 and VI.G.3 of this release, respectively.

381

Rule 13n-2 is similar to Exchange Act Rule 15b6-1, 17 CFR 240.15b6-1, which relates to
withdrawal from registration as a broker-dealer, and includes a provision similar to a
provision in Exchange Act Section 15(b)(5), 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(5) (stating that “[i]f the
Commission finds that any registered broker or dealer is no longer in existence or has
ceased to do business as a broker or dealer, the Commission, by order, shall cancel the
registration of such broker or dealer”).
122

Successor registration would be accomplished either by filing a new application on Form SDR
or, in certain circumstances, by filing an amendment on Form SDR.
2.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission did not receive any comments relating to this proposed rule.
3.

Final Rule

The Commission is adopting Rule 13n-3 as proposed, with minor revisions to track the
language of Rules 13n-1 and 13n-2 as adopted. Rule 13n-3 governs the registration of a
successor to a registered SDR. Because this rule is substantially similar to Exchange Act Rule
15b1-3, 382 which governs the registration of a successor to a registered broker-dealer, the same
concepts that the Commission explained when it adopted amendments to Rule 15b1-3 are
applicable here. 383
a.

Succession by Application

Rule 13n-3(a) provides that in the event that an SDR succeeds to and continues the
business of an SDR registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 13(n), the registration of the
predecessor shall be deemed to remain effective as the registration of the successor if, within 30
days after such succession, the successor files an application for registration on Form SDR, and
the predecessor files a withdrawal from registration on Form SDR with the Commission.384 A
successor will not be permitted to “lock in” the 30-day window period by filing an application

382

See 17 CFR 240.15b1-3.

383

See Registration of Successors to Broker-Dealers and Investment Advisers, Exchange
Act Release No. 31661 (Dec. 28, 1992), 58 FR 7 (Jan. 4, 1993).

384

As adopted, Rule 13n-2 differs from the proposal by requiring a “filing a withdrawal
from registration on Form SDR” rather than “filing a notice of withdrawal.” The
Commission is revising Rule 13n-3(a) from the proposal to track the language of Rule
13n-2.
123

for registration that is incomplete in material respects.
Rule 13n-3(a) further provides that the registration of the predecessor SDR shall cease to
be effective 90 days after the date of the publication of notice of the filing of an application for
registration on Form SDR by the successor SDR. 385 In other words, the 90-day period will not
begin to run until a complete Form SDR has been filed by the successor with the Commission
and the Commission publishes notice of the filing of Form SDR to afford interested persons an
opportunity to submit written comments concerning such application. This 90-day period is
consistent with the time period set forth in final Rule 13n-1, pursuant to which the Commission
would have 90 days to grant registration or institute proceedings to determine if registration
should be granted or denied.
The following are examples of the types of successions that would be required to be
completed by filing an application: (1) an acquisition, through which an unregistered person
purchases or assumes substantially all of the assets and liabilities of an SDR and then operates
the business of the SDR, (2) a consolidation of two or more registered SDRs, resulting in their
conducting business through a new unregistered SDR, which assumes substantially all of the
assets and liabilities of the predecessor SDRs, and (3) dual successions, through which one
registered SDR subdivides its business into two or more new unregistered SDRs.

385

As adopted, Rule 13n-1(c) differs from the proposal by starting the 90-day period from
the publication of notice of the filing of Form SDR rather than from the filing of Form
SDR. The Commission is revising Rule 13n-3(a) from the proposal to track more closely
the language of Rule 13n-1(c). As discussed in Section VI.A.2.c of this release, the
Commission is revising Rule 13n-1(c) from the proposal to make it procedurally
consistent with the registration process applicable to SIPs and the rule stems from the
Commission’s requirement that a registered SDR register as a SIP and the Commission’s
revision of Form SDR to accommodate SIP registration.
124

b.

Succession by Amendment

Rule 13n-3(b) provides that notwithstanding Rule 13n-3(a), if an SDR succeeds to and
continues the business of a registered predecessor SDR, and the succession is based solely on (1)
a change in the predecessor’s date or state of incorporation, (2) form of organization, or (3)
composition of a partnership, the successor may, within 30 days after the succession, amend the
registration of the predecessor SDR on Form SDR to reflect these changes. Such amendment
shall be deemed an application for registration filed by the predecessor and adopted by the
successor. In all three types of successions, the predecessor must cease operating as an SDR.
The Commission believes that it is appropriate to allow a successor to file an amendment to the
predecessor’s Form SDR in these three types of successions.
c.

Scope and Applicability of Rule 13n-3

The purpose of Rule 13n-3 is to enable a successor SDR to operate without an
interruption of business by relying for a limited period of time on the registration of the
predecessor SDR until the successor’s own registration becomes effective. The rule is intended
to facilitate the legitimate transfer of business between two or more SDRs and to be used only if
there is a direct and substantial business nexus between the predecessor and the successor SDR.
The rule cannot be used when a registered SDR sells its registration, eliminates substantial
liabilities, spins off personnel, or facilitates the transfer of the registration of a “shell”
organization that does not conduct any business. No person will be permitted to rely on Rule
13n-3 unless it is acquiring or assuming substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the
predecessor’s SDR business.
Rule 13n-3 does not apply to reorganizations that involve only registered SDRs. In those
situations, the registered SDRs need not use the rule because they can continue to rely on their
125

existing registrations. The rule also does not apply to situations in which the predecessor intends
to continue to engage in SDR activities. Otherwise, confusion may result as to the identities and
registration statuses of the parties. If a person acquires some or all of the shares of a registered
SDR, or if one registered SDR purchases part or all of the business assets or assumes personnel
of another registered SDR, then reliance on this rule would not be necessary. 386
D.

Enumerated Duties and Core Principles (Rule 13n-4)

Dodd-Frank Act Section 763(i) requires an SDR to comply with the requirements and
core principles described in Exchange Act Section 13(n) as well as any requirement that the
Commission prescribes by rule or regulation in order to be registered and maintain registration as
an SDR with the Commission. 387 After considering comments, the Commission is adopting Rule
13n-4 as proposed, with modifications.
The Commission is not adopting proposed Rules 13n-4(b)(9) and (10), which address
relevant authorities’ access to SBS data maintained by SDRs. As discussed below, the
Commission anticipates soliciting additional public comment regarding relevant authorities’
access to SBS data maintained by SDRs.

386

In the case of the purchase of the business assets or assumption of the personnel of one
registered SDR by another SDR, the purchasing SDR would file an amendment on Form
SDR to reflect any changes in its operations, while the other SDR would either file a
Form SDR to withdraw its registration or file an interim amendment on the form,
depending on whether the SDR remains in the SDR business.

Definitions (Rule 13n-4(a))
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-4(a) defined the following terms: “affiliate,” “board,” “control,”
“director,” “direct electronic access,” “end-user,” “market participant,” “nonaffiliated third
party,” and “person associated with a security-based swap data repository.”
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission received one comment on the proposed definitions in the context of the
SDR Rules. 388 Specifically, one commenter believed that the Commission’s requirement in the
definition of “direct electronic access” that data is “updated at the same time as the [SDR’s] data
is updated” may pose “operational difficulties that do not outweigh the marginal benefits to the
Commission.”389 The commenter also believed that “[t]he Commission’s proposed definition
provides for no latency between the moment when an [SDR’s] records are updated and when the
systems used by the Commission (or its designee with direct electronic access) are updated.” 390
For these reasons, the commenter suggested that the Commission “allow time for an [SDR] to
validate, process, and store the data received prior to populating the data to the environment that
will be utilized to provide such direct electronic access to the Commission.” 391
c.

Final Rule

After considering the comment, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-4(a) as proposed,

See DTCC 5, supra note 19. See also supra note 247 (discussing a general comment
regarding the term “affiliate”).

with modifications related to the definition of “end-user.” 392 Specifically, the Commission is
adopting Rule 13n-4(a) without the definition of “end-user.” As discussed above, the
Commission proposed rules that would require SDRs to collect data related to monitoring the
compliance and frequency of end-user clearing exemption claims. 393 In anticipation that the
Commission will consider final rules relating to end-users in a separate rulemaking, the
Commission has decided not to adopt the proposed definition of “end-user” in this release. The
Commission believes that it is better to address the issue of end-users more fully in that release
than in this release.
The Commission is adopting the definition of “direct electronic access” as proposed to
mean “access, which shall be in a form and manner acceptable to the Commission, to data stored
by [an SDR] in an electronic format and updated at the same time as the [SDR]’s data is updated
so as to provide the Commission or any of its designees with the ability to query or analyze the
data in the same manner that the [SDR] can query or analyze the data.” This includes access to
all transaction data and positions, as defined in Rule 13n-5(a), 394 and related identifying
information, such as transaction IDs and time stamps. 395 With respect to one commenter’s view
that requiring SBS data to be updated at the same time as the data is updated at an SDR may pose

392

The Commission is also correcting a typographical error in the proposed rule. Proposed
Rule 13n-4(a)(3)(ii) referred to the right to vote 25 percent “of” more of a class of
securities. See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77367, supra note 2. As adopted, Rule 13n4(a)(3)(ii) refers to the right to vote 25 percent “or” more of a class of securities. In
addition, certain definitions are being renumbered due to the removal of the definition of
“end-user.”

393

See End-User Exception Proposing Release, supra note 15.

394

See Section VI.E.1 of this release discussing the definition of “transaction data” and
Section VI.E.2 of this release discussing the definition of “position.”

395

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rules 901(f) and (g)).
128

“operational difficulties that do not outweigh the marginal benefits to the Commission,”396 the
Commission believes that its definition of “direct electronic access” is necessary for the
Commission’s adequate oversight of the SBS market. The commenter asserted that the
Commission’s definition of “direct electronic access” “provides for no latency between the
moment when an [SDR’s] records are updated and when the systems used by the Commission
(or its designee with direct electronic access) are updated.” 397 The Commission understands that
latency is inherent when updating systems, and that there may be some time lag between when
the SDR receives and updates the data and when the updated data is available for the
Commission to access. The Commission also understands that an SDR needs to check the data
for errors and omissions and process the data before providing the data to the Commission or its
designees. Otherwise, the Commission or its designees will not be able to query or analyze the
data. Thus, by referencing to the Commission’s or its designees’ ability to query or analyze the
data in the definition of “direct electronic access,” the Commission anticipates that there may be
a lag time for SDRs to check and process the data before providing the data to the Commission
or its designees. The Commission notes, however, that once an SDR checks and processes the
data, the SDR is required to provide the Commission or its designees with the ability to access
the checked and processed data at the same time as the checked and processed data is updated in
the SDR’s records.

396

See DTCC 5, supra note 19.

397

See DTCC 5, supra note 19 (suggesting that the Commission “allow time for an [SDR] to
validate, process, and store the data received prior to populating the data to the
environment that will be utilized to provide such direct electronic access to the
Commission”).

2.

Enumerated Duties (Rule 13n-4(b))
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-4(b) would incorporate an SDR’s duties that are enumerated in
Exchange Act Sections 13(n)(2), 13(n)(5), and 13(n)(6), 398 which require each SDR to: (1)
subject itself to inspection and examination by the Commission; (2) accept SBS data as
prescribed by Regulation SBSR; 399 (3) confirm with both counterparties to the SBS the accuracy
of the data that was submitted; (4) maintain the data as prescribed by the Commission; (5)
provide direct electronic access to the Commission or any of its designees; (6) provide certain
information as the Commission may require to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(m); 400 (7)
at such time and in such manner as may be directed by the Commission, establish automated
systems for monitoring, screening, and analyzing SBS data; (8) maintain the privacy of any and
all SBS transaction information that the SDR receives from an SBS dealer, counterparty, or any
registered entity; (9) on a confidential basis pursuant to Exchange Act Section 24 and the rules
and regulations thereunder, upon request, and after notifying the Commission of the request,
make available all data obtained by the SDR to certain relevant authorities; (10) before sharing
information with a relevant authority, obtain a written confidentiality agreement and obtain an
398

Exchange Act Section 13(n), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n).

399

See supra note 201 (discussing Regulation SBSR, which prescribes the data elements that
an SDR will be required to accept for each SBS in association with requirements under
Dodd-Frank Act Section 763(i)).

400

Exchange Act Section 13(m) pertains to the public availability of SBS data. See 15
U.S.C. 78m(m). In a separate release relating to implementation of Dodd-Frank Act
Section 763(i) (adding Exchange Act Section 13(m)), the Commission proposed rules
that impose various duties on SDRs in connection with the reporting and public
dissemination of SBS information. See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, supra note
8; see also Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31210-6, supra note 3 (reproposing Regulation SBSR). The Commission is adopting those rules as part of
Regulation SBSR. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13.
130

agreement from the relevant authority to indemnify the SDR and the Commission; and (11)
designate a CCO who must comply with specified duties.
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Six commenters submitted comments relating to various aspects of proposed Rule 13n4(b). 401 These comment letters are described in more detail below, other than those that relate
solely to relevant authorities’ access to SBS data maintained by SDRs, which the Commission
anticipates will be addressed separately. Generally speaking, one commenter believed that “all
of the substantive rule provisions proposed [as of July 22, 2013] must remain as strong as
possible, irrespective of the Commission’s approach to its very limited jurisdiction over crossborder transactions or the CFTC’s approach to the implementation of Title VII.” 402
i.

Inspection and Examination

One commenter expressed concern regarding the potential cost to non-resident SDRs of
complying with multiple regulatory regimes, including inspections and examinations by multiple
regulators. 403

401

See Barnard, supra note 19; Better Markets 1, supra note 19; DTCC 2, supra note 19;
ESMA, supra note 19; MFA 1, supra note 19; US & Foreign Banks, supra note 24; see
also DTCC 1*, supra note 20; DTCC 3, supra note 19; DTCC 5, supra note 19. In
addition to these commenters, one commenter to the Temporary Rule Release suggested
that the Commission affirmatively state that it intends to keep information furnished
pursuant to the rules in that release confidential under the Freedom of Information Act
(“FOIA”) or to seek a legislative solution. Deutsche Temp Rule, supra note 28.
Although this comment does not explicitly reference to the SDR Rules, the Commission
addresses this point in Section VI.D.2 of this release to the extent that the SDR Rules
require SDRs to submit information to the Commission.

[p]roposed [r]ules to accommodate concerns about international regulation of the SBS
markets).

131

ii.

Direct Electronic Access

As discussed in Section IV above, two commenters suggested that the Commission
designate one SDR to receive SBS data from other SDRs, through direct electronic access, in
order to provide the Commission and other regulators a consolidated location from which to
access SBS data. 404 Both commenters believed that such designation would ensure efficient
consolidation of data. 405
iii.

Monitoring, Screening, and Analysis

In the Proposing Release, the Commission proposed taking a measured approach and not
requiring SDRs to establish automated systems for monitoring, screening, and analyzing SBS
data at that time. 406 One commenter disagreed with this proposal. 407 Another commenter
supported “the broad concept that an SDR should monitor, screen and analyze SBS data as input
for the [Commission] to facilitate its oversight and monitoring responsibilities,” but believed that
the proposed rule is too broad and “not clear enough on the level of detail required and on the

404

DTCC 1*, supra note 20; Better Markets 1, supra note 19. Comments regarding direct
electronic access in the context of substituted compliance are addressed in a separate
release. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13.

streamlined access to consolidated data, reducing the strain on limited agency
resources.”); DTCC 3, supra note 19 (“When there are multiple SDRs in any particular
asset class, the [Commission] should take such action as is necessary to eliminate any
overstatements of open interest or other inaccuracies that may result from having broader
market data published from separate SDRs.”).

level of responsibility imposed on SDRs.” 408 A third commenter suggested that monitoring,
screening, and analysis should be performed centrally by an SDR for efficiency and that the data
maintained by the SDR should then be made available to relevant authorities. 409
iv.

Other Enumerated Duties

Comments on the other enumerated duties either are discussed later in this release or
addressed in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release or the Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release. 410 The Commission anticipates addressing comments regarding relevant
authorities’ access to SBS data maintained by SDRs in a separate release when it solicits
additional public comment regarding the issue.
c.

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-4(b) as proposed,
with modifications. Specifically, each SDR is required to:
(1)

subject itself to inspection and examination by any representative of the
Commission; 411

(2)

accept data as prescribed in Regulation SBSR 412 for each SBS;

408

on the anticipated requirements in order to better manage the expectations of SDRs and
wider market participants concerning their duties in this area”).

DTCC 2, supra note 19.

410

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13; Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release, supra note 13.

411

The Commission is revising its proposed rule by adding “any representative of” before
“the Commission” to track more closely Exchange Act Section 13(n)(2), 15 U.S.C.
78m(n)(2) (“Each registered security-based swap data repository shall be subject to
inspection and examination by any representative of the Commission.”).

412

The Commission addresses this enumerated duty in further detail in Regulation SBSR.
See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13.
133

(3)

confirm, as prescribed in Rule 13n-5, with both counterparties to the SBS the
accuracy of the data that was submitted, as discussed further in Section VI.E.1 of
this release;

(4)

maintain, as prescribed in Rule 13n-5, the data described in Regulation SBSR in
such form, in such manner, and for such period as provided therein and in the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, as discussed further in
Section VI.E of this release;

(5)

provide direct electronic access to the Commission (or any designee of the
Commission, including another registered entity);

(6)

provide the information described in Regulation SBSR in such form and at such
frequency as prescribed in Regulation SBSR to comply with requirements set forth
in Exchange Act Section 13(m) and the rules and regulations thereunder; 413

(7)

at such time and in such manner as may be directed by the Commission, establish
automated systems for monitoring, screening, and analyzing SBS data;

(8)

maintain the privacy of any and all SBS transaction information that the SDR
receives from an SBS dealer, counterparty, or any registered entity, as prescribed in
Rule 13n-9 and as discussed further in Section VI.I.1 of this release; and

(9)

this release. 414
With respect to one commenter’s general recommendation that all of the Commission’s
substantive rules “remain as strong as possible, irrespective of the Commission’s approach to its
very limited jurisdiction over cross-border transactions or the CFTC’s approach to the
implementation of Title VII,” 415 the Commission believes that the final SDR Rules are robust
and reflect an appropriate approach to furthering the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act and
minimizing an SDR’s cost of compliance. 416
Because the Commission anticipates soliciting additional public comment regarding
relevant authorities’ access to SBS data maintained by SDRs in a separate release, the
Commission is not adopting proposed Rules 13n-4(b)(9) and (10) at this time and is marking
those sections as “Reserved.” 417 However, SDRs will have to comply with all statutory
requirements, including Exchange Act Sections 13(n)(5)(G) and (H), 418 when the current

414

The Commission is revising proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(11) by not including the phrase
“who shall comply with the duties set forth in Exchange Act Rule 13n-11.” This revision
is being made to clarify that an SDR is only required to designate a CCO.

See Section VIII of this release discussing economic analysis.

417

In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission proposed interpretive guidance
to specify how SDRs may comply with the notification requirement set forth in Exchange
Act Section 13(n)(5)(G) and proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(9). Cross-Border Proposing
Release, 78 FR at 31046-31047, supra note 3. The Commission also specified how the
Commission proposed to determine whether a relevant authority is appropriate for
purposes of receiving SBS data from an SDR. Id. at 31047-31048. The Commission is
not taking any action on these proposals at this time and anticipates addressing these
issues in a separate release.

exemptive relief from the statutory requirements expires. 419
i.

Inspection and Examination

Each registered SDR is statutorily required to be subject to inspection and examination
by any representative of the Commission.420 With respect to one commenter’s concern regarding
the potential cost to non-resident SDRs of complying with multiple regulatory regimes, including
inspections and examinations by multiple regulators, 421 the Commission appreciates this concern
and has discussed this concern in the Cross-Border Proposing Release. 422 To address the
commenter’s broader concern of duplicative regulatory regimes, the Commission is adopting
Rule 13n-12 to provide an exemption from specific SDR requirements in certain circumstances,
as discussed in Section VI.K of this release. 423
ii.

Direct Electronic Access

Each SDR should coordinate with the Commission to provide direct electronic access to
the Commission or any of its designees. The form and manner that will be acceptable to the
Commission for an SDR to provide direct electronic access may vary on a case-by-case basis and
may change over time, depending on a number of factors. These factors could include the
development of new types of SBSs or variations of existing SBSs that require additional data to
accurately describe them. Additionally, the extent to which the Commission encounters
419

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31043, supra note 3 (discussing

compliance); Exchange Act Rule 0-13, 17 CFR 240.0-13 (relating to procedures for filing
applications for substituted compliance).
136

difficulty in normalizing and aggregating SBS data across multiple registered SDRs would be a
factor in considering the nature of the direct access provided by an SDR to the Commission.
As contemplated in the Proposing Release, the Commission anticipates that an SDR may
be able to satisfy its duty to provide direct electronic access to the Commission by providing, for
example, (1) a direct streaming of the data maintained by the SDR to the Commission or any of
its designees, (2) a user interface that provides the Commission or any of its designees with
direct access to the data maintained by the SDR and that provides the Commission or any of its
designees with the ability to query or analyze the data in the same manner that is available to the
SDR, or (3) another mechanism that provides a mirror copy of the data maintained by the SDR,
which is in an electronic form that is downloadable by the Commission or any of its designees
and is in a format that provides the Commission or any of its designees with the ability to query
or analyze the data in the same manner that is available to the SDR. 424 The alternative ways to
provide direct electronic access to the Commission are not intended to be mutually exclusive.
Additionally, the rule provides that the data must be in a form and manner acceptable to
the Commission. 425 Since one of the primary purposes of an SDR is to facilitate regulatory
oversight of the SBS market, a significant portion of the benefits of an SDR will not be realized
if data stored at an SDR is provided to the Commission in a form or manner that cannot be easily

424

Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77318, supra note 2.

425

See Rule 13n-4(a)(5) (defining “direct electronic access” to mean “access, which shall be
in a form and manner acceptable to the Commission, to data stored by a security-based
swap data repository in an electronic format and updated at the same time as the securitybased swap data repository’s data is updated so as to provide the Commission or any of
its designees with the ability to query or analyze the data in the same manner that the
security-based swap data repository can query or analyze the data”); see also Section
VI.E.4 of this release discussing the requirement to maintain transaction data and
positions in a place and format that is readily accessible to the Commission.
137

utilized by the Commission. Furthermore, the form and manner with which an SDR provides the
data to the Commission should not only permit the Commission to accurately analyze the data
maintained by a single SDR, but also allow the Commission to aggregate and analyze data
received from multiple SDRs.
The Commission continues to consider whether it should require the data to be provided
to the Commission in a particular format. 426 The Commission anticipates that it will propose for
public comment detailed specifications of acceptable formats and taxonomies that would
facilitate an accurate interpretation, aggregation, and analysis of SBS data by the Commission.
The Commission intends to maximize the use of any applicable current industry standards for the
description of SBS data, build upon such standards to accommodate any additional data fields as
may be required, and develop such formats and taxonomies in a timeframe consistent with the
implementation of SBS data reporting by SDRs. The Commission recognizes that as the SBS
market develops, new or different data fields may be needed to accurately represent new types of
SBSs, in which case the Commission may provide updated specifications of formats and
taxonomies to reflect these new developments. Until such time as the Commission adopts
specific formats and taxonomies, SDRs may provide direct electronic access to the Commission
to data in the form in which the SDRs maintain such data.
As stated in Section IV of this release with respect to commenters’ suggestions regarding
consolidation of SBS data, 427 the Commission does not believe that it is necessary to designate,
426

Cf. Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77319 and 77331, supra note 2 (asking questions about
how direct electronic access could be provided, and asking whether the Commission
should require information be kept in a particular format, such as FpML or another
standard).

427

See DTCC 1*, supra note 20 (recommending that the Commission designate one SDR to
receive, through direct electronic access, information from other SDRs to ensure efficient
138

at this time, an SDR or any registered entity to receive, through direct electronic access, SBS
data maintained by other SDRs in order to aggregate the data. At this time, the Commission
believes that it—rather than any particular registered entity—is in the best position to aggregate
data across multiple registered SDRs. The Commission anticipates that its proposal on the
formats and taxonomies for SBS data provided to the Commission pursuant to Rule 13n-4(b)(5)
will facilitate its ability to carry out this function. The Commission may revisit this issue as the
SBS market evolves.
A commenter to the Temporary Rule Release suggested that the Commission
affirmatively state that it intends to keep information furnished pursuant to the rules in that
release confidential under FOIA or to seek a legislative solution. 428 The Commission anticipates
that it will keep reported data that it obtains from an SDR (via direct electronic access or any
other means) confidential, subject to the provisions of applicable law. 429
After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-4(b)(5) as
proposed.
iii.

Monitoring, Screening, and Analysis

Although the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-4(b)(7) as proposed, it is not, at this time,

consolidation of data); Better Markets 1, supra note 19 (recommending that “the
Commission designate one SDR as the recipient of information of other SDRs, through
direct electronic access to the SBS data at the other SDRs, in order to provide the
Commission and relevant authorities with a consolidated location for SBS data”).
428

See Deutsche Temp Rule, supra note 28. It is unclear what the commenter contemplates
by its suggestion that the Commission seek a “legislative solution,” but the Commission
notes that it does not intend to affirmatively seek any legislative action to protect further
such information. The commenter is not precluded from doing so on its own initiative.

429

Pursuant to Commission rules, confidential treatment can be sought for information
submitted to the Commission. See 17 CFR 200.83 (regarding confidential treatment
procedures under FOIA).
139

directing SDRs to establish any automated systems for monitoring, screening, and analyzing SBS
data. One commenter urged the Commission to adopt a rule to require an SDR to establish
automated systems for monitoring, screening, and analyzing SBS data, 430 but the Commission
continues to believe that it is better to take a measured approach in addressing this statutory
requirement to minimize imposing costs on SDRs until the Commission is in a better position to
determine what information it needs in addition to the information that it can obtain from SDRs
through other rules applicable to SDRs, such as Rule 13n-4(b)(5). 431 For the same reasons, the
Commission is not, as another commenter suggested, 432 providing additional details on what may
be expected of SDRs in this area. The Commission, however, expects to consider further steps
to implement this requirement as the SBS market develops and the Commission gains experience
in regulating this market. 433 Because the Commission is not requiring an SDR to monitor,

430

See Better Markets 1, supra note 19.

431

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77318, supra note 2 (discussing reasons to take a
measured approach with respect to requiring an SDR to establish automated systems for
monitoring, screening, and analyzing SBS data). In a separate release, the Commission is
adopting a rule requiring an SDR to provide the Commission, upon request, information
or reports related to the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of data reported to the
SDR. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rule 907(e)). In addition,
the Commission proposed a rule that would require a counterparty to an SBS that invokes
the end-user clearing exemption to deliver or cause to deliver certain information to a
registered SDR, and, if adopted, then an SDR would be required to maintain this
information in accordance with Rule 13n-5(b)(4). See End-User Exception Proposing
Release, supra note 15.

432

See Barnard, supra note 19 (stating that the proposed rule regarding monitoring,
screening, and analysis is too broad and “not clear enough on the level of detail required
and on the level of responsibility imposed on SDRs”).

433

The Commission may revisit these issues as the Commission becomes more familiar with
the SBS market and consider requiring SDRs to monitor, screen, and analyze SBS data if,
for example, it is difficult for the Commission to aggregate and analyze the data because
SBS data is too fragmented among multiple SDRs or the data is maintained by multiple
SDRs in different formats.
140

screen, and analyze SBS data maintained by the SDR at this time, the Commission is also not
taking one commenter’s suggestion to designate, at this time, an SDR to centrally monitor,
screen, and analyze SBS data maintained by all SDRs. 434 The Commission believes that it is
premature to do so without better understanding what additional information would be useful to
the Commission. After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-4(b)(7)
as proposed.
3.

Implementation of Core Principles (Rule 13n-4(c))

Each SDR is required, under Exchange Act Section 13(n)(7), to comply with core
principles relating to (1) market access to services and data, (2) governance arrangements, and
(3) conflicts of interest. 435 Specifically, unless necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes
of the Exchange Act, an SDR 436 is prohibited from adopting any rules 437 or taking any action that
results in any unreasonable restraint of trade or imposing any material anticompetitive burden on
the trading, clearing, or reporting of transactions. 438 In addition, each SDR must establish
governance arrangements that are transparent to fulfill public interest requirements and to
support the objectives of the Federal Government, owners, and participants. 439 Moreover, each
434

See DTCC 2, supra note 19.

435

See Exchange Act Section 13(n)(7), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(7).

436

Although Exchange Act Section 13(n)(7)(A) refers to “swap data repository,” the
Commission believes that the Congress intended it to refer to “security-based swap data
repository.” See generally Am. Petroleum Institute v. SEC, 714 F.3d 1329, 1336-37
(D.C. Cir. 2013) (explaining that “[t]he Dodd-Frank Act is an enormous and complex
statute, and it contains” a number of “scrivener’s errors”).

SDR must establish and enforce rules to minimize conflicts of interest in the decision-making
process of the SDR and to establish a process for resolving any such conflicts of interest. 440 Rule
13n-4(c) incorporates and implements these three core principles.
a.

First Core Principle: Market Access to Services and Data (Rule
13n-4(c)(1))
i.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-4(c)(1) would incorporate and implement the first core principle 441 by
requiring SDRs, unless necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder, to not (i) adopt any policies and procedures or take any
action that results in an unreasonable restraint of trade; or (ii) impose any material
anticompetitive burden on the trading, clearing, or reporting of transactions. 442 Proposed Rule
13n-4(c)(1) would include four specific requirements. First, each SDR would be required to
ensure that any dues, fees, or other charges it imposes, and any discounts or rebates it offers, are
fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory; such dues, fees, other charges,
discounts, or rebates would be required to apply consistently across all similarly-situated users of
the SDR’s services. 443 Second, each SDR would be required to permit market participants to
access specific services offered by the SDR separately. 444 Third, each SDR would be required to
establish, monitor on an ongoing basis, and enforce clearly stated objective criteria that would
permit fair, open, and not unreasonably discriminatory access to services offered and data

maintained by the SDR as well as fair, open, and not unreasonably discriminatory participation
by market participants, market infrastructures, venues from which data can be submitted to the
SDR, and third party service providers that seek to connect to or link with the SDR. 445 Finally,
each SDR would be required to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to review any prohibition or limitation of any person with respect to access
to services offered, directly or indirectly, or data maintained by the SDR and to grant such person
access to such services or data if such person has been discriminated against unfairly. 446

Comments on the Proposed Rule

As discussed below, eight commenters submitted comments relating to this proposed
rule, 447 which were mixed. 448 Generally speaking, one commenter supported “the Commission’s
stated goals of protecting market participants and maintaining a fair, orderly, and efficient [SBS]
market through the promotion of competition” and urged “the Commission to adopt rules that

Three comments submitted prior to the Proposing Release agreed with the Commission
on the importance of market transparency. See McLeish*, supra note 20; CDEU*, supra
note 20 (supporting “efforts by Congress to improve transparency, accountability and
stability”); Benchmark*, supra note 20 (“fully support[ing] regulatory efforts to increase
transparency in the OTC markets”); see also SIFMA*, supra note 20 (indicating that
increased price transparency will improve the application of models used in the
computation of capital requirements for purposes of complying with Exchange Act Rule
15c3-1). For example, one commenter stressed the importance of requiring market
transparency for all market participants without any exceptions. McLeish*, supra note 20
(believing that “there should be transparency for everyone” and there should be “no
exceptions”). Another commenter believed that market transparency will improve
liquidity in the SBS market. Benchmark*, supra note 20. To the extent that these
commenters are broadly supporting transparency, the Commission believes that Rule
13n-4(c)(1) reflects this broad support.
143

preserve a competitive marketplace and forbid [ ] anti-competitive practices by all [SBS] market
participants.” 449 The commenter stated that “[i]n a global SB swap market, the anti-competitive
practices of even a single market participant have potential ramifications for the entire
marketplace.” 450
In suggesting that the Commission rely on CPSS-IOSCO’s recommendations such as the
PFMI Report, the commenter cited, as an example, to the Commission’s concurrence, in the
Proposing Release, with the CPSS-IOSCO Trade Repository Report’s recommendation that
“[m]arket infrastructures and service providers that may or may not offer potentially competing
services should not be subject to anticompetitive practices such as product tying, contracts with
non-compete and/ or exclusivity clauses, overly restrictive terms of use and anti-competitive
price discrimination.” 451
(1)

Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(i): Fair, Reasonable, and Not
Unreasonably Discriminatory Dues, Fees, Other
Charges, Discounts, and Rebates

One commenter supported the requirements in proposed Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(i) because
“they should encourage market participants to use SDRs’ services.” 452 The commenter believed
that an SDR should charge different fee structures only if it relates to the SDR’s “differing costs
449

DTCC 5, supra note 19 (stating that “the Commission correctly emphasizes that market
participants offering potentially competing services should not be subject to anticompetitive practices, including product tying, overly restrictive terms of use, and anticompetitive price discrimination”). With respect to this comment, the Commission notes
that the rules adopted in this release apply to only SDRs. To the extent that the
Commission adopts rules prohibiting other market participants from engaging in anticompetitive practices, those rules will be addressed in separate releases.

of providing access or service to particular categories” and that “[a]nything else would be
discrimination.” 453 The commenter suggested that “any preferential pricing such as volume
discounts or reductions should be generally viewed as discriminatory” and believed that “[s]uch
volume discounts or reductions tend to discriminate in favour of the large players.” 454
Two commenters believed that SDRs should be permitted to continue using the current
“dealer pays” or “sell-side pays” model, 455 or at least to continue using that model if it is
acceptable by the SDRs’ market participants. 456 One of the commenters expressed particular
concern about the effect that the Commission’s proposed rule requiring nondiscriminatory
pricing would have on the current “dealer pays” or “sell-side pays” model. 457 The commenter
suggested that alternatively, the Commission’s proposed rule could be amended to permit: (a)
different fee structures for different classes of participants (e.g., sell-side and buy-side) to reflect
the different cost of their usage of the SDR, or (b) payment of fees by only the reporting party. 458
The commenter believed that this approach would be consistent with the Commission’s proposed
“not unreasonably discriminatory” requirement because “SDRs would be prohibited from
discriminating within each class, while participants in different classes may be charged different
fees.” 459 The commenter further believed that “any other literal interpretation of ‘non-

discriminatory access’ would have the unintended consequence of significantly increasing the
costs for buy-side participants and, by doing so, generally discouraging their use of [SDRs].”460
The same two commenters further believed that an SDR’s fees for certain services should
reflect the SDR’s costs of providing related services. 461 One of these commenters believed, for
example, that “if a reporting party uses a third party service provider for trade submission, which
fulfils the SDR’s requirement to confirm the trade with both parties, this report would potentially
be charged at a lower cost than a direct report to the SDR, requiring the SDR itself to confirm
with the other party.” 462 The commenter further noted that since small “non-reporting
counterparties will legitimately want to interact with SDRs, if only to verify what has been
reported, SDRs should have the flexibility to facilitate such access by not charging, or charging
only nominal amounts, for such interaction.” 463 In addition, the commenter suggested that the
Commission clarify its rules to “prevent predatory or coercive pricing by providers engaged in
any two or more trading, clearing or repository services” and to prohibit cross-subsidies between
services. 464 The other commenter suggested that SDRs should be permitted to charge different
(i.e., higher) fees in order to recoup costs associated with “processing any highly non-standard,
albeit eligible [(i.e., within the asset class for which the SDR accepts data)], SBS

146

transactions.” 465
Another commenter believed that the Commission’s proposed rule, which refers to a
standard of “fair and reasonable” and “not unreasonably discriminatory” and which requires
consistent application across all similarly-situated users, is vague and suggested that the
Commission “establish fees, rates, or even formulas for determining rates.” 466 The commenter
suggested that in order to prevent SDRs from taking “unfair advantage of the mandated use of
their services,” particularly “in SBS markets where there is no effective competition, SDRs
[should] be required to justify the reasonableness of price levels charged to both suppliers of data
and recipients of data.” 467
One commenter to proposed Regulation SBSR suggested that SDRs should not be
permitted to charge fees to third parties acting on behalf of counterparties for accepting SBS
transaction information because such fees would increase the cost of using an SB SEF or other
third party. 468 The commenter believed that SDRs would likely charge the same third parties for
subsequent use of SBS data maintained by the SDRs. 469 In submitting comments to the
Commission’s rulemaking regarding SB SEFs, the same commenter suggested that the
Commission require SDRs to (i) make available any data they collect and may properly use for
commercial purposes to all market participants, including SB SEFs and clearing agencies, on
reasonable terms and pricing and on a non-discriminatory basis, and (ii) share, on commercially
reasonable terms, revenue that SDRs generate from redistributing such data with parties

providing the data to the SDRs (e.g., SB SEFs). 470 The commenter believed that without these
requirements, the Commission would be effectively taking away from market participants,
including SB SEFs and clearing agencies, a potentially significant and valuable component of
their potential market data revenue streams. 471
(2)

Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(ii): Offering Services Separately

Three commenters supported the Commission’s proposed rule requiring SDRs to permit
market participants to access services offered by SDRs separately. 472 Specifically, one
commenter agreed that SDRs’ fees should be transparent. 473 As a corollary to this, one of the
commenters suggested that third party service providers should be barred from bundling their
services with an SDR’s services. 474 Additionally, the same commenter believed that “[a]ny
provider offering trading[,] clearing or repository services for one asset class should not be

service provider].”); TriOptima, supra note 19 (“[I]t is important that market participants
have the ability to access specific services offered by the [SDR] separately.”); see also

SDR to permit market participants to access specific services offered by the SDR

SDR for trades it facilitates . . . . [A]side from being anti-competitive, this type of vertical

unnecessary risk to the control processes that market participants may determine are
needed.”).

permitted [to] bundl[e] or t[ie] when providing services for other asset classes.” 475 The
commenter suggested, however, that SDRs should be permitted to offer two or more service
options, including one that fulfills the minimum regulatory reporting requirements and a suite of
other services to complement the mandatory reporting function. 476
One commenter believed that SDRs should be able to offer ancillary services, whether
bundled or not. 477 The commenter, however, did not support the bundling of ancillary services
with mandatory or regulatory services. 478
Another commenter stated that the proposed rule went “a long way to address a third
party’s (such as a service provider’s) non-discriminatory access rights to granular [SDR]
Information,” and that such access is important so as to “not stifle innovation and the
competition in the provision of post-trade processing services” and to “uphold a fair, secure and
efficient post-trade market.” 479 In the context of discussing proposed Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(ii), the
commenter suggested that, to further these goals, the Commission should clarify that all “users”
of an SDR’s services, including unaffiliated third party service providers, and not only market
participants that submit trade data, should be permitted to access each of the SDR’s services
separately. 480

Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(iii): Fair, Open, and Not
Unreasonably Discriminatory Access

Four commenters generally supported the Commission’s proposed rule regarding fair,
open, and not unreasonably discriminatory access to services offered and data maintained by
SDRs, but a few of these commenters also recommended additional requirements. 481 One of
these commenters noted that “all counterparties to trades reported to an SDR should, as a matter
of principle, have access to all data relating to trades to which they are [counterparties]” and that
“[t]his access should be made available to smaller, lower volume market participants, as
necessary, through the reduction or waiver of certain fees.” 482 The same commenter also noted
that “clearinghouses and [SB SEFs] should have the ability to report trades to SDRs . . . to satisfy
their customers’ reporting preferences.” 483 In addition, the commenter supported “open access to
data by other service providers (based on the consent of the parties for that provider to receive
the data) [because it] is critical to preserve the trading parties’ control over their own data.” 484

require SDRs to support all connectivity methods, as the costs to do so would be
prohibitive”); see also TriOptima, supra note 19 (“[I]t is clear that an [SDR] should

Another commenter who supported the rule indicated that SDRs should be able to
condition access by specifying the methods and channels that must be used in order to connect to
the SDR and setting certain minimum standards. 485 This commenter also recommended that
SDRs should be permitted to provide connectivity to third party service providers, without
requiring any specific services from them as a condition to their gaining access to the SBS
data. 486
One commenter urged the Commission to “clarify in the final rule that [SDRs] shall
provide third party service providers, who have been authorized to access information by the
counterparties to the relevant trades under Written Client Disclosure Consents, with access to
[SDR] Information.” 487 The commenter further stressed the importance of providing “full and
unrestricted” access to SBS data to third party service providers, particularly those acting on
behalf of SBS counterparties. 488 The commenter objected to the lack of an “obligation on the
[SDR] to provide full and unrestricted access to [granular trade data] to a third party service
provider” and suggested that “this obligation should apply where the counterparties to the

automation and efficient operational processing in the market, while preserving the
parties’ control over confidential information”).

such full and unrestricted access to [SDR] Information to a third party (service provider)

should not restrict access to [SDR] Information on other grounds than integrity risks to

relevant trades have provided [written consents and authorizations] to the [SDR] to disclose
granular trading data to the third party service provider.” 489 The commenter noted that, when
such third party service provider is acting pursuant to a written consent by an SBS counterparty,
it is exercising that counterparty’s right to access its own trade information. 490 The commenter
“stress[ed] the importance that data access rights and requirements imposed on a third party
(service provider) seeking to access [SDR] Information[ ] are applied equally to the [SDR] itself
when providing ancillary services and to affiliated service providers within the same group as the
[SDR].” 491 In this regard, the commenter believed that “the [SDR] should not have discretion to
offer advantages in respect of its own ancillary services or services offered by affiliated service
providers vis-à-vis other third party service providers.” 492
One commenter recommended that the Commission require that each SDR establish and
maintain effective interoperability and interconnectivity with other SDRs, market infrastructures,
and venues from which data can be submitted to the SDR. 493 Additionally, the commenter
suggested that market participants should have “equal and fair access to data on SBS

‘agent’ for the owner of the trade information and provide the third party service provider

transactions,” 494 and that the Commission’s rules “establish stronger and more detailed standards
against discriminatory access, and they should also establish regulatory oversight of access
denials.” 495 The commenter further suggested that the Commission’s proposed rules set forth the
“clearly stated objective criteria” and permit denial of access only on risk-based grounds, i.e.,
risks related to the security or functioning of the market. 496
(4)

Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(iv): Prohibited or Limited Access

One commenter recommended that the Commission require an SDR “to promptly file a
notice with the Commission if the SDR . . . prohibits or limits any person’s access to services
offered or data maintained by the SDR.” 497
iii.

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-4(c)(1) as
proposed, with one minor modification. 498 Rule 13n-4(c)(1), which tracks the statutory
language, 499 provides that “[u]nless necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of the
[Exchange] Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, the security-based swap data repository
shall not adopt any policies or procedures 500 or take any action that results in an unreasonable
restraint of trade or impose any material anticompetitive burden on the trading, clearing, or

reporting of transactions.” In implementing the first core principle, this rule is intended to
protect investors and to maintain a fair, orderly, and efficient SBS market. 501 The Commission
believes that this rule will protect investors by, for example, fostering service transparency and
promoting competition in the SBS market. 502 Generally speaking, the Commission also believes
that “[m]arket infrastructures and service providers that may or may not offer potentially
competing services should not be subject to anti-competitive practices such as product tying,
contracts with non-compete and/or exclusivity clauses, overly restrictive terms of use and anticompetitive price discrimination.” 503 As discussed in the Proposing Release and more fully
below, when administering this rule, the Commission generally expects to apply the principles
and procedures that it has developed in other areas in which it monitors analogous services, such
as clearing agencies. 504 To comply with the first core principle, an SDR is required to comply
with four specific requirements.
(1)

Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(i): Fair, Reasonable, and Not
Unreasonably Discriminatory Dues, Fees, Other
Charges, Discounts, and Rebates

Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(i) requires each SDR to ensure that any dues, fees, or other charges that
it imposes, and any discounts or rebates that it offers, are fair and reasonable and not
501

See DTCC 5, supra note 19 (supporting “the Commission’s stated goals of protecting
market participants and maintaining a fair, orderly, and efficient [SBS] market through
the promotion of competition”).

502

See DTCC 5, supra note 19 (urging “the Commission to adopt rules that preserve a
competitive marketplace and forbid [ ] anti-competitive practices by all [SBS] market
participants”); see also DTCC CB, supra note 26 (stating that “[i]n a global [SBS]
market, the anti-competitive practices of even a single market participant have potential
ramifications for the entire marketplace”).

to the CPSS-IOSCO Trade Repository Report’s recommendation that market
infrastructures and service providers should not be subject to anticompetitive practices).

504

154

unreasonably discriminatory. 505 The rule also requires such dues, fees, other charges, discounts,
or rebates to be applied consistently across all similarly-situated users of the SDR’s services,
including, but not limited to, market participants, market infrastructures (including central
counterparties), venues from which data can be submitted to the SDR (including exchanges, SB
SEFs, electronic trading venues, and matching and confirmation platforms), and third party
service providers.
As discussed in the Proposing Release, the terms “fair” and “reasonable” often need
standards to guide their application in practice. 506 One factor that the Commission has taken
into consideration to evaluate the fairness and reasonableness of fees, particularly those of a
monopolistic provider of a service, is the cost incurred to provide the service. 507 Consistent
with commenters’ views, 508 the Commission believes that if an SDR’s fees for certain services
reflect the SDR’s costs of providing those services, then the fees would generally be considered

505

The Exchange Act applies a similar standard for other registrants. See, e.g., Exchange
Act Section 6(b)(4), 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) (“The rules of the exchange [shall] provide for
the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members
and issuers and other persons using its facilities.”); Exchange Act Section 17A(b)(3)(D),
15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(D) (“The rules of the clearing agency [shall] provide for the
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among its participants.”);
see also Exchange Act Sections 11A(c)(1)(C) and (D), 15 U.S.C. 78k-1(c)(1)(C) and (D)
(providing that the Commission may prescribe rules to assure that all SIPs may, “for
purposes of distribution and publication, obtain on fair and reasonable terms such
information” and to assure that “all other persons may obtain on terms which are not
unreasonably discriminatory” the transaction information published or distributed by
SIPs).

flexible approach to evaluate the fairness and reasonableness of an SDR’s fees and charges on a
case-by-case basis. The Commission recognizes that there may be instances in which an SDR
could charge different users different prices for the same or similar services. Such differences,
however, cannot be unreasonably discriminatory.
The Commission continues to believe that an SDR should make reasonable
accommodations, including consideration of any cost burdens, on a non-reporting counterparty
to an SBS in connection with the SDR following up on the accuracy of the SBS transaction
data. 509 Thus, the Commission agrees with one commenter’s view that an SDR may facilitate a
non-reporting counterparty’s ability to verify the accuracy of a reported SBS transaction by not
charging the counterparty or charging the counterparty only a nominal amount. 510
With respect to commenters’ views on the current “dealer pays” or “sell-side pays”
model, 511 the Commission does not believe that such a model is unreasonably discriminatory
per se. As such, the Commission believes that amending proposed Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(i) to
explicitly permit different fee structures, as suggested by one commenter, 512 is not necessary.
Furthermore, Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(i) is not intended to prohibit an SDR from utilizing any one
particular model, including a “dealer pays” or “sell-side pays” model, a model with different fee
structures for different classes of participants, or a model where only the reporting party is

required to pay an SDR’s fees, as long as there is a fair and reasonable basis for the fee structure
and it is not unreasonably discriminatory. If, however, an SDR imposes dues, fees, or other
charges to create intentionally a barrier to access the SDR without a legitimate basis, then those
dues, fees, or charges may be considered unfair or unreasonable.
The Commission disagrees with three comments received. The first commenter
suggested that the Commission establish fees or rates, or dictate formulas by which fees or rates
are determined. 513 The Commission believes that in light of the various SDR business models
and fee structures that may emerge, it is better to provide SDRs with the flexibility to establish
their own fees or rates, provided that they are fair, reasonable, and not unreasonably
discriminatory. The Commission is providing SDRs with such flexibility to promote
competition among SDRs, thereby keeping the cost of SDRs’ services to a minimum.
The second commenter believed that an SDR should charge different fee structures only
if it relates to the SDR’s “differing costs of providing access or service to particular categories”
and that “any preferential pricing such as volume discounts or reductions should be generally
viewed as discriminatory.” 514 Although an SDR’s costs in providing its services or access to
SBS data maintained by the SDR may be a factor in evaluating the SDR’s fee structure, the
Commission believes that it is not necessarily the only factor. There may be instances in which
an SDR’s fees or discounts (including volume discounts) are fair, reasonable, and not
unreasonably discriminatory, even if the fees or discounts are not related to the SDR’s costs in
providing such services or access. In all instances, the SDR is responsible for demonstrating

513

Better Markets 1, supra note 19.

514

Barnard, supra note 19.
157

that its fees or discounts meet this regulatory standard. 515 As stated above, the Commission
expects to evaluate the fairness and reasonableness of an SDR’s fees and charges on a case-bycase basis.
The third commenter suggested that the Commission require SDRs to make available any
data they collect and may properly use for commercial purposes to all market participants on
reasonable terms and pricing and on a non-discriminatory basis. 516 Although the Commission
agrees that fees imposed by SDRs should be “on reasonable terms and pricing and on a nondiscriminatory basis,” the Commission notes that an SDR is not required to make SBS data
available to all market participants, aside from SBS data that is publicly disseminated pursuant
to Regulation SBSR. 517 As discussed below, there may be limited instances in which an SDR
denies access to a market participant. 518
With respect to cross-subsidies, the Commission believes that it is not necessary, as one
commenter suggested, 519 to prohibit cross-subsidies between services provided by an SDR, but
the Commission recognizes that there may be instances in which such cross-subsidies would
violate Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(i). For example, cross-subsidies between an SDR’s services that result
in fees that are arbitrary or have no relationship to the costs of providing the service on a
discrete basis may not be consistent with Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(i). This is because an arbitrary fee
structure could mean that fees are not being incurred consistently by similarly-situated users of

the SDR’s services and because the Commission believes that, in certain instances, fee
structures without some relationship to the costs of the SDR may not be fair and reasonable due
to the differential impact such charges would have on market participants that may choose to
use some, but not all, of the SDR’s or its affiliate’s services. 520 Another commenter suggested
that the Commission prohibit SDRs from charging fees to third parties acting on behalf of
counterparties for accepting SBS transaction information. 521 The commenter also suggested
that the Commission require SDRs to share their revenue from redistributing data with parties
providing the data to the SDRs. 522 Consistent with the Commission’s approach with its other
registrants, including exchanges and clearing agencies, the Commission does not believe that it
is appropriate to dictate who an SDR can and cannot charge or with whom an SDR must share
its revenue.
One commenter suggested that the Commission extend the applicability of its rule to
providers engaged in two or more of trading, clearing, or repository services to prevent
predatory or coercive pricing by the providers. 523 As with its other rules governing SDRs, the
Commission’s rule implementing the first core principle generally applies only to SDR services.
To the extent that the Commission decides that predatory or coercive pricing with respect to
non-SDR services needs to be addressed, the Commission will take appropriate action.

Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(ii): Offering Services Separately

Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(ii) requires each SDR to permit market participants to access specific
520

Accord Exchange Act Section 17A(b)(3)(D), 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(D) (requiring the
rules of a clearing agency to provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees,
and other charges among its participants).

services offered by the SDR separately. As one commenter suggested, 524 an SDR may bundle its
services, including any ancillary services, regardless of the asset class at issue, but this rule
requires the SDR to also provide market participants with the option of using its services
separately. 525 The Commission believes that it is appropriate to adopt this rule as proposed to
promote competition. 526
If an SDR or its affiliate 527 provides an ancillary service, such as a matching and
confirmation service, then the SDR is prohibited by Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(ii) from requiring a market
participant to use and pay for that service as a condition of using the SDR’s data collection and
maintenance services. 528 In such an instance, the SDR is also prohibited from requiring a market
participant that uses the SDR’s or affiliate’s ancillary service to use the SDR’s data collection
and maintenance services. The Commission also believes that if an SDR enters into an oral or
written agreement or arrangement with an affiliate or third party service provider that reflects a
business plan in which the affiliate or third party service provider will require its customers to
use the core services of that SDR, then the SDR would not be in compliance with Rule 13n-

See DTCC 2, supra note 19 (suggesting that SDRs should be permitted to offer two or

4(c)(1)(ii). 529 In evaluating the fairness and reasonableness of fees that an SDR charges for
bundled and unbundled services, the Commission will take into consideration, among other
things, the SDR’s cost of making those services available on a bundled or unbundled basis, as the
case may be, and a market participant’s proportional use of the SDR’s services.
With regard to one commenter’s suggestion that all “users” of an SDR’s services,
including unaffiliated third party service providers, should be permitted to access the SDR’s nonSDR services separately, 530 the Commission agrees, as set forth in Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(ii), that
market participants that use an SDR’s services should have access to specific services offered by
the SDR, including any ancillary services, separately. The Commission believes that SDRs
should consider giving third party service providers acting as agents for such market participants
the same rights as the market participants to access these services separately. However, Rule
13n-4(c)(1)(ii) does not require an SDR to afford the agent access to the SDR’s unbundled
services outside of its agency capacity.
(3)

Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(iii): Fair, Open, and Not
Unreasonably Discriminatory Access

Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(iii) requires each SDR to establish, monitor on an ongoing basis, and
enforce clearly stated objective criteria that would permit fair, open, and not unreasonably
discriminatory access to services offered and data maintained by the SDR as well as fair, open,
and not unreasonably discriminatory participation by market participants, market infrastructures,
venues from which data can be submitted to the SDR, and third party service providers that seek
529

The Commission notes that under Exchange Act Section 20(b), 15 U.S.C. 78t(b), “[i]t
shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to do any act or thing which it
would be unlawful for such person to do under the provisions of [the Exchange Act] or
any rule or regulation thereunder through or by means of any other person.”

530

See TriOptima, supra note 19.
161

to connect to or link with the SDR. As with Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(i), the Commission will evaluate
whether such access or participation is “fair, open, and not unreasonably discriminatory” on a
case-by-case basis. Although this rule does not explicitly require, as one commenter
suggested, 531 SDRs to establish and maintain effective interoperability and interconnectivity with
other SDRs, 532 market infrastructures, and venues from which data can be submitted, the rule is
intended to encourage such interoperability and interconnectivity by requiring SDRs to establish
criteria that would permit fair, open, and not unreasonably discriminatory participation by others,
including those that seek to connect to or link with the SDR.
The Commission agrees with most of the comments on this rule. One commenter
suggested that market participants should have “equal and fair access to data on SBS
transactions.” 533 The Commission agrees with the comment to the extent that the commenter
equated “equal and fair access” with the “fair, reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory”
standard in the rule. However, the Commission notes that all market participants are not
required to be treated the same way in all instances. For example, if a market participant fails to
pay the SDR’s reasonable fees, then it may be “fair, reasonable and not unreasonably
discriminatory” for an SDR to deny access to the market participant.
The Commission agrees that an SDR should be able to condition access to SBS data that
it maintains by specifying the methods and channels that must be used to connect to the SDR and

531

See Better Markets 1, supra note 19.

532

The Commission is not explicitly requiring SDRs to maintain effective interoperability
and interconnectivity with other SDRs at this time, partly because such a requirement
could hinder the developing infrastructure for SBS transactions.

533

See Better Markets 2, supra note 19.
162

by setting certain minimum standards, 534 provided that such conditions are fair, open, and not
unreasonably discriminatory. The Commission also agrees with one commenter’s view that an
SDR should, to the extent feasible, provide each counterparty to an SBS transaction that is
reported to an SDR with reasonable access to the data relating to that transaction. 535 If an SDR
provides such access to smaller, lower volume market participants at reduced or waived fees, as
one commenter suggested, 536 then the discount must be fair and reasonable and not unreasonably
discriminatory. 537 The Commission further agrees with commenters’ views that an SDR should
provide connectivity to others, including third party service providers, clearinghouses, and SB
SEFs, 538 and, as one commenter suggested, 539 if the SDR delegates the function of providing
connectivity to another entity, that entity cannot require anyone to use the entity’s services as a
condition to obtaining connectivity to the SDR. The Commission also agrees with another
commenter that an SDR generally should impose similar data access rights and requirements on
itself (and its affiliates) as those imposed on a third party acting as an agent on behalf of an SBS
534

See MarkitSERV, supra note 19. Related to this comment, another commenter suggested
that market infrastructures such as clearing agencies and SB SEFs should generally have
the ability to report SBS transactions to SDRs to satisfy their customers’ reporting
preferences. See DTCC 3, supra note 19. As stated above, the Commission intends to
adopt rules relating to clearing agencies and SB SEFs in separate releases.

535

counterparty. 540
As stated in the Proposing Release, the Commission is concerned, among other things,
that an SDR, controlled or influenced by a market participant, may limit the level of access to the
services offered or data maintained by the SDR as a means to impede competition from other
market participants or third party service providers. 541 The Commission believes that Rule 13n4(c)(1)(iii) addresses this concern.
One commenter recommended that the Commission permit SDRs to deny access only on
risk-based grounds. 542 Although the Commission concurs that an SDR should always consider
the risks that an actual or prospective market participant may pose to the SDR, the Commission
does not believe that it is appropriate to explicitly limit an SDR’s ability to deny access because
there may be reasonable grounds for denial that may not be risk-related – e.g., a counterparty to
an SBS fails to pay the SDR’s reasonable fees or a third party service provider breaches its
contractual obligation to maintain the privacy of data received by the SDR. The same
commenter suggested that the Commission should set forth “clearly stated objective criteria”
with respect to fair access and denial of access in the final rule, 543 but the Commission does not
believe that it is necessary to do so. Under Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(iii), SDRs must establish
appropriate criteria to govern access to their services and data as well as participation by those
seeking to connect to or link with the SDR.

540

See TriOptima, supra note 19 (stating that non-discriminatory access is important so as to
“not stifle innovation and the competition in the provision of post-trade processing
services”).

The Commission does not believe that Rule 13n-1(c)(1)(iii) should require an SDR to
provide “full and unrestricted” access to third party service providers acting pursuant to written
authorizations from an SBS counterparty, as suggested by one commenter. 544 While the
Commission agrees with the commenter that such a third party service provider is exercising the
SBS counterparty’s right to access data with respect to that counterparty’s trades, the
Commission believes that requiring an SDR to provide “full and unrestricted” access (beyond
that provided to the SBS counterparty acting directly) would appear to be inconsistent with the
Exchange Act. Even if the service provider has received written authorization from one SBS
counterparty, the SDR nonetheless would be required to protect the privacy and confidentiality
of the other counterparty; 545 thus, the SDR need only provide the third party service provider
with access to such data that the SBS counterparty that has authorized disclosure would be
entitled to access. As noted by the commenter, such a third party service provider is acting as the
SBS counterparty’s agent and should be entitled to the same level of access as provided to the
SBS counterparty. 546 The Commission agrees with the commenter regarding the importance of
upholding “a fair, secure and efficient post-trade market” 547 and believes that the rule as adopted
achieves this goal.

Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(iv): Prohibited or Limited Access

policies and procedures reasonably designed to review any prohibition or limitation of any

person with respect to access to services offered, directly or indirectly, or data maintained by the
SDR and to grant such person access to such services or data if such person has been
discriminated against unfairly.
As stated in the Proposing Release, the Commission believes that, for any such policies
and procedures to be reasonable, at a minimum, those at an SDR involved in the decisionmaking process of prohibiting or limiting a person’s access to the SDR’s services or data cannot
be involved in the review of whether the prohibition or limitation was appropriate. 548 Otherwise,
the purpose of the review process would be undermined. Additionally, an SDR may wish to
consider whether its internal review process should be done by the SDR’s board 549 or an
executive committee.
As discussed above, one commenter suggested that the Commission require an SDR to
promptly file a notice with the Commission if the SDR prohibits or limits any person’s access to
services offered or data maintained by the SDR. 550 Rule 909 of Regulation SBSR, which the
Commission is concurrently adopting in a separate release, requires each registered SDR to
register as a SIP, and, as such, Exchange Act Section 11A(b)(5) governs denials of access to
services by an SDR. 551 This section provides that “[i]f any registered securities information
processor prohibits or limits any person in respect of access to services offered, directly or
indirectly, by such securities information processor, the registered securities information

processor shall promptly file notice thereof with the Commission.” 552 Accordingly, an SDR
must promptly notify the Commission if it prohibits or limits access to any of its services to any
person. In addition, the SDR is required to notify the Commission of any prohibition or
limitation with respect to services offered or data maintained by the SDR in its annual
amendment to its Form SDR, which will also enable the Commission to evaluate whether the
prohibition or limitation is appropriate. 553 Also, pursuant to Rule 13n-7, records of the decision
to prohibit or limit access are required to be maintained by the SDR, and the SDR must promptly
furnish such records to any representative of the Commission upon request. 554

Second Core Principle: Governance Arrangements (Rule 13n4(c)(2))
i.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-4(c)(2) would incorporate and implement the second core principle 555
by requiring SDRs to establish governance arrangements that are transparent (i) to fulfill public
interest requirements under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; (ii) to
carry out functions consistent with the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and
the purposes of the Exchange Act; and (iii) to support the objectives of the Federal Government,
owners, and participants. 556 The proposed rule would impose four specific requirements. First,
an SDR would be required to establish governance arrangements that are well defined and

include a clear organizational structure with effective internal controls. 557 Second, an SDR’s
governance arrangements would be required to provide for fair representation of market
participants. 558 Third, an SDR would be required to provide representatives of market
participants, including end-users, with the opportunity to participate in the process for
nominating directors and with the right to petition for alternative candidates. 559 Finally, an SDR
would be required to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to ensure that the SDR’s senior management and each member of the board or
committee that has the authority to act on behalf of the board possess requisite skills and
expertise to fulfill their responsibilities in the management and governance of the SDR, to have a
clear understanding of their responsibilities, and to exercise sound judgment about the SDR’s
affairs. 560
In the Proposing Release, the Commission solicited comments on whether to impose any
additional requirements, including ownership or voting limitations on SDRs and persons
associated with SDRs. 561

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Four commenters submitted comments relating to this proposed rule. 562 Comments on
the proposal were mixed. As a general matter, one commenter stated that the role of the

participants.” 563
In suggesting that “ownership and voting limitations be eliminated in their entirety,” 564
another commenter noted that such limitations would be an imprecise tool to achieve the
Commission’s policy goals regarding conflicts of interest. 565 The commenter stated that instead,
“[t]hese policy goals can best be met by structural governance requirements” such as governance
by market participants. 566 The commenter believed that “[i]n the specific case of an SDR,
governance by market participants is appropriate, given that most potential conflicts of interest
are dealt with directly in the Proposed Rule and will be overseen directly by the regulator.” 567
The commenter further believed that because the “SDR is not defining the reporting party,
timeliness or content for public dissemination, and similarly the SDR is not defining the
reporting party, content or process for regulatory access . . . the SDR does not have significant
influence over the inclusion or omission of information in the reporting process, nor does it
control the output of the process.” 568 The commenter suggested that the Commission focus on
ensuring open access and, to support such access, “the SDR needs governance that has
independence from its affiliates and is representative of users who are the beneficiaries of choice

accepted).”).

in service providers.” 569 Along this line, the commenter believed that SDRs should assure that
“dealings with affiliates . . . be subject to oversight by members of the SDR’s board of directors
who are not engaged in the governance or oversight of either the affiliates or their
competitors.” 570 The commenter also suggested that SDRs be “user-governed,” including “a
board of directors that is broadly representative of market participants and that incorporates
voting safeguards designed to prevent non-regulatory uses of data of a particular class of market
participants that are objectionable to that class.” 571 The commenter believed that “[i]ndependent
perspectives can provide value to a board of directors, but those who do not directly participate
in markets may not have sufficient, timely, and comprehensive expertise on those issues critical
to the extraordinarily complex financial operations of SDRs.” 572
A third commenter recommended that “meaningful corporate governance requirements
apply to [SDRs].” 573 In this regard, the commenter recommended that the Commission’s rules
relating to governance arrangements “be much more detailed and clear” and “require SDRs to
establish boards and nominating committees that are composed of a majority of independent
directors.” 574 The commenter believed that “[i]ndependent boards are one of the most effective
tools for ensuring that an SDR will abide by the letter and spirit of the enumerated duties and

core principles set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act.” 575 The commenter also believed that as
“important safeguards against the dominant influence of some market participants over others,”
the Commission’s rules should impose both individual and aggregate limitations on ownership
and voting (e.g., limit the aggregate ownership interest in an SDR by SDR participants and their
related persons to 20%, prohibit SDR participants and their related persons from directly or
indirectly exercising more than 20% of the voting power of any class of ownership interest in the
SDR). 576
Another commenter suggested that, with respect to “board membership requirements and
ownership and voting limits, there should be a level playing field between at least SDRs and
other swap entities.” 577 The commenter recommended that the Commission propose something
similar to the CFTC’s “Independent Perspective” 578 by “requiring a registered SDR to have
independent public directors on (i) its board of directors and (ii) any committee that has the
authority to (A) act on behalf of the board of directors or (B) amend or constrain the action of the
board of directors.” 579

The CFTC requires each swap data repository to establish, maintain, and enforce written

well as the process for assigning members of the board of directors or other person to
such committees, adequately incorporates an “Independent Perspective,” which is defined
as “a viewpoint that is impartial regarding competitive, commercial, or industry concerns
and contemplates the effect of a decision on all constituencies involved.” See CFTC

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-4(c)(2) as
proposed, with one minor modification. 580 Under this rule, each SDR is required to establish
governance arrangements that are transparent to fulfill public interest requirements under the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; to carry out functions consistent with the
Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the purpose of the Exchange Act; and to
support the objectives of the Federal Government, owners, and participants. 581 To comply with
the second core principle, each SDR is required to comply with four specific requirements: (i)
establish governance arrangements that are well defined and include a clear organizational
structure with effective internal controls; 582 (ii) establish governance arrangements that provide
for fair representation of market participants; 583 (iii) provide representatives of market
participants, including end-users, with the opportunity to participate in the process for
nominating directors and with the right to petition for alternative candidates; 584 and (iv)
establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that the SDR’s senior management and each member of the board or committee that has the

shareholders (or members) and participants in the selection of its directors and
administration of its affairs). The term “market participant” is defined as “(1) any person
participating in the security-based swap market, including, but not limited to, securitybased swap dealers, major security-based swap participants, and any other counterparties
to a security-based swap transaction.” See Rule 13n-4(a)(6); see also Rule 13n-9(a)(3);

authority to act on behalf of the board possess requisite skills and expertise to fulfill their
responsibilities in the management and governance of the SDR, have a clear understanding of
their responsibilities, and exercise sound judgment about the SDR’s affairs. 585
As proposed, Rule 13n-4(c)(2)(iv) would have required an SDR’s policies and procedures
be reasonably designed to ensure that its senior management and each member of the board or
committee that has the authority to act on behalf of the board to “possess requisite skills and
expertise . . . to have a clear understanding of their responsibilities” and “possess requisite skills
and expertise . . . to exercise sound judgment about the [SDR’s] affairs.” The Commission is
revising the proposed rule by removing the word “to” from the clauses above, to provide that an
SDR’s policies and procedures be reasonably designed to ensure that its senior management and
each member of the board or committee that has the authority to act on behalf of the board is
required to actually have a clear understanding of their responsibilities and exercise sound
judgment about the SDR’s affairs, rather than simply possess the skills and expertise to do so. 586
Without the revision from the proposal, the rule could have been misinterpreted to mean that an
SDR’s management and each member of the board or committee that has the authority to act on
behalf of the board need only possess the skills and expertise to have a clear understanding of
their responsibilities. With respect to sound judgment, an SDR may want to include, in its
policies and procedures, a requirement that its management and each member of the board or
committee that has the authority to act on behalf of the board consider fairly all relevant
information and views without undue influence from others, and provide advice and
recommendations that are reasonable under the relevant facts and circumstances.

Given an SDR’s unique and integral role in the SBS market, the Commission believes
that it is particularly important that an SDR establish a governance arrangement that is well
defined and include a clear organizational structure with effective internal controls. Because the
board has a role in overseeing the SDR’s compliance with the SDR’s statutory and regulatory
obligations, 587 the Commission also believes that it is important that those who are managing and
overseeing an SDR’s activities are qualified to do so. An SDR’s failure to comply with their
obligations could affect, for example, the SDR’s operational efficiency, which could, in turn,
impact the SBS market as a whole. 588
The Commission believes that Rule 13n-4(c)(2)’s requirement that SDRs establish
governance arrangements that provide for fair representation of market participants is consistent
with one commenter’s view that governance of SDRs by market participants is appropriate. 589
With respect to one commenter’s recommendation that an SDR’s governance should be
independent from its affiliates by, for example, ensuring that dealings with its affiliates are
subject to oversight by members of the SDR’s board who are not engaged in the governance or
oversight of either the affiliates or their competitors, 590 the Commission believes that this is one

589

See DTCC 2, supra note 19. In discussing governance arrangements, the commenter
seemed to imply that the Commission is responsible for directly overseeing an SDR’s
conflicts of interest. To clarify, it is the SDR itself that is statutorily required to establish
and enforce policies and procedures to minimize its conflicts of interest in its decisionmaking process. See Exchange Act Section 13(n)(7)(C), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(7)(C).

effective way to comply with the rule and to minimize the SDR’s potential conflicts of interest,
as discussed further in Section VI.D.3.c of this release.
In establishing a governance arrangement that provides for fair representation of market
participants, one way for an SDR to comply with Rule 13n-4(c)(2) is to provide market
participants with the opportunity to participate in the process for nominating directors and with
the right to petition for alternative candidates. These two requirements are interrelated. The
Commission believes that if market participants have no say in an SDR’s governance process,
then the market participants may not be fairly represented. 591 The Commission notes, however,
that having fair representation of market participants does not necessarily equate to requiring a
fixed number or percentage of enumerated categories of market participants. Instead, the
requirement is intended to promote a fair representation of the views and perspectives of market
participants.
The Commission considered whether an SDR’s potential and existing conflicts of interest
would warrant prescriptive rules relating to governance (e.g., ownership or voting limitations,
591

One commenter suggested that the Commission propose something similar to the CFTC’s
“Independent Perspective.” Barnard, supra note 19. The Commission believes that
although Rule 13n-4(c)(2) is different from CFTC Rule 49.20 in this area, both rules may
achieve the same objective of broad representation on SDRs’ boards. Rule 13n4(c)(2)(ii) requires SDRs to “[e]stablish governance arrangements that provide for fair
representation of market participants,” and Rule 13n-4(c)(2)(iii) requires SDRs to
“[p]rovide representatives of market participants, including end-users, with the
opportunity to participate in the process for nominating directors and with the right to
petition for alternative candidates.” Instead of focusing on fair representation of market
participants, CFTC Rule 49.20(c) requires a swap data repository to establish, maintain,
and enforce written policies and procedures to ensure that its board and other committees
adequately consider an “Independent Perspective” in their decision-making process. See
17 CFR 49.20(c). Cf. DTCC 2, supra note 19 (stating that “[i]ndependent perspectives
can provide value to a board of directors, but those who do not directly participate in
markets may not have sufficient, timely, and comprehensive expertise on those issues
critical to the extraordinarily complex financial operations of SDRs”).

independent directors, nominating committees composed of a majority of independent directors),
as two commenters suggested, 592 but believes that the rules that are intended to minimize such
conflicts and to help ensure that SDRs meet core principles are sufficient at this time. 593 If the
Commission were to impose additional governance requirements and limitations, SDRs would
likely incur costs in addition to the costs already imposed by the SDR Rules. 594 The
Commission, however, does not believe that the additional costs are warranted at this time.
Also, consistent with one comment, 595 the Commission continues to believe that it is appropriate
and cost-effective to provide SDRs with flexibility in determining their ownership and
governance structure. The Commission may, however, revisit the issue of whether to impose
additional governance requirements and limitations as the SBS market evolves.

Third Core Principle: Rules and Procedures for Minimizing and

i.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-4(c)(3) would incorporate the third core principle 596 by requiring each
SDR to establish and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to minimize
conflicts of interest in the decision making process of the SDR, and establish a process for
resolving any such conflicts of interest. 597 The proposed rule provided general examples of
conflicts of interest that should be considered by an SDR and would require each SDR to comply
with the core principle by (i) establishing, maintaining, and enforcing written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to identify and mitigate potential and existing conflicts of
interest in the SDR’s decision-making process on an ongoing basis; 598 (ii) recusing any person
involved in a conflict of interest from the decision-making process for resolving such conflicts of
interest; 599 and (iii) establishing, maintaining, and enforcing reasonable written policies and
procedures regarding the SDR’s non-commercial and/or commercial use of the SBS transaction
information that it receives from a market participant, any registered entity, or any other
person. 600

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Seven commenters submitted comments relating to this proposed rule. 601 One
commenter agreed that the Proposing Release “correctly highlights a number of the harmful
practices that can thrive in an environment that does not adequately address conflicts of interest .
. . .” 602 These practices are discussed further in Section VI.D.3.c.iii below. Another commenter
acknowledged that “[t]he mandatory reporting regime [under the Dodd-Frank Act] creates an
opportunity for [an] SDR to improperly commercialize the information it receives” and agreed
with the Commission that “market access by service providers to an SDR could be a potential
source for conflicts of interest.” 603 This commenter expressed the view, however, that because
“[t]he reporting rules for SDRs are highly prescriptive, and the primary consumers of this data
are regulators, [there is] limited room for conflicts involving regulatory or public data access.” 604
The commenter noted that “[i]t is important that regulators ensure that the public utility function
of SDRs . . . is separated from potential commercial uses of the data.” 605
As noted in the Proposing Release, a few entities that presently provide or had anticipated
providing trade repository services identified the following conflicts of interest that could arise at
an SDR. 606 First, owners of an SDR could have commercial incentives to exert undue influence
to control the level of access to the services offered and data maintained by the SDR and to

implement policies and procedures that would further their self-interests to the detriment of
others. 607 Specifically, owners of an SDR could exert their influence and control to prohibit or
limit access to the services offered and data maintained by the SDR in order to impede
competition. 608 Second, an SDR could favor certain market participants over others with respect
to the SDR’s services and pricing for such services. 609 Third, an SDR could require that services
be purchased on a “bundled” basis. 610 Finally, an SDR or a person associated with the SDR
could misuse or misappropriate data reported to the SDR for financial gain. 611 As one trade
repository noted, “SDR data is extremely valuable and could be sold either stand alone or
enhanced with other market data and analysis. The use of this data in this manner would present
competitive problems” as well as conflicts of interest issues. 612

Several commenters expressed their views on the ownership of SBS data maintained by
SDRs. Specifically, three commenters believed that ownership of SBS data should remain with
counterparties to the SBS unless specifically agreed by them. 613 One commenter to proposed
Regulation SBSR stated that ownership of SBS data should be retained by the reporting party
(e.g., SB SEFs, counterparties to an SBS), 614 whereas a commenter to the Proposing Release
believed that data ownership does not transfer to an SB SEF or any other regulated entity. 615
Three commenters, including two commenters to proposed Regulation SBSR, believed that
SDRs and/or their affiliates should be prohibited from using SBS data for commercial
purposes. 616 One of those commenters supported an SDR’s use of aggregated data for

One commenter to the SB SEF Proposing Release recommended that the Commission
clarify in its final rules or adopting release that its rules are not intended to impose or imply any
limit on the ability of market participants, including counterparties to SBS transactions, SB
SEFs, and clearing agencies, to use and/or commercialize data that they create or receive in
connection with the execution or reporting of SBS data. 618 Similarly, one commenter to
proposed Regulation SBSR suggested that the Commission require SDRs to adopt policies and
procedures explicitly acknowledging that counterparties to SBS transactions and SB SEFs retain
the ability to market and commercialize their own proprietary data. 619

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-4(c)(3) as
proposed. Under this rule, each SDR is required to establish and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to minimize conflicts of interest in the decision-making process
of the SDR and to establish a process for resolving any such conflicts of interest. 620
Rule 13n-4(c)(3) provides general examples of conflicts of interest that should be
considered by an SDR, including, but not limited to: (1) conflicts between the commercial
interests of an SDR and its statutory and regulatory responsibilities, (2) conflicts in connection
with the commercial interests of certain market participants or linked market infrastructures,

third party service providers, and others, (3) conflicts between, among, or with persons
associated with the SDR, 621 market participants, affiliates of the SDR, and nonaffiliated third
parties, 622 and (4) misuse of confidential information, material, nonpublic information, and/or
intellectual property. These general examples are the same as those included in proposed Rule
13n-4(c)(3) with one modification. The proposed rule provided, as an example, “conflicts
between the commercial interests of [an SDR] and its statutory responsibilities.” Upon further
consideration, the Commission is revising this example, to include potential conflicts between an
621

Rule 13n-4(a)(8) defines “person associated with a security-based swap data repository”
as (i) any partner, officer, or director of such SDR (or any person occupying a similar
status or performing similar functions), (ii) any person directly or indirectly controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with such SDR, or (iii) any employee of such
SDR. See also Rule 13n-9(a)(7). This definition draws from the definition of “person
associated with a broker or dealer” in the Exchange Act, and includes persons associated
with an SDR whose functions are solely clerical or ministerial. See Exchange Act
Section 3(a)(18), 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(18). Rule 13n-4(a)(3) defines “control” (including the
terms “controlled by” and “under common control with”) as “the possession, direct or
indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a
person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.”
Pursuant to Rule 13n-4(a)(3), “[a] person is presumed to control another person if the
person: (i) is a director, general partner, or officer exercising executive responsibility (or
having similar status or functions); (ii) directly or indirectly has the right to vote 25
percent or more of a class of voting securities or has the power to sell or direct the sale of
25 percent or more of a class of voting securities; or (iii) in the case of a partnership, has
the right to receive, upon dissolution, or has contributed, 25 percent or more of the
capital.” The Commission is correcting a typographical error in the proposed definition.
Proposed Rule 13n-4(a)(3)(ii) referred to the right to vote 25 percent “of” more of a class
of securities. See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77367, supra note 2. As adopted, Rule
13n-4(a)(3)(ii) refers to the right to vote 25 percent “or” more of a class of securities. See
also Rules 13n-9(a)(2) and 13n-11(b)(2). The definition of “control” incorporates the
definition of “control” in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 and Form BD, the registration form
for broker-dealers. See 17 CFR 240.12b-2 and Form BD, 17 CFR 249.501.

622

The term “nonaffiliated third party” of an SDR is defined as any person except (1) the
SDR, (2) an SDR’s affiliate, or (3) a person employed by an SDR and any entity that is
not the SDR’s affiliate (and “nonaffiliated third party” includes such entity that jointly
employs the person). See Rule 13n-4(a)(7); see also Rule 13n-9(a)(4). This definition
draws from the definition of “nonaffiliated third party” in § 248.3 of Regulation S-P. See
17 CFR 248.3.
182

SDR’s commercial interests and its regulatory responsibilities. This revision is intended to
clarify that an SDR’s commercial interests can conflict with not only its statutory
responsibilities, but also its regulatory responsibilities, which may be more prescriptive than its
statutory responsibilities.
To comply with the third core principle, an SDR is required to comply with three specific
requirements. First, Rule 13n-4(c)(3)(i) requires each SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and mitigate potential and
existing conflicts of interest in the SDR’s decision-making process on an ongoing basis. The
Commission continues to believe that requiring an SDR to conduct ongoing identification and
mitigation of conflicts of interest is important because such conflicts can arise gradually over
time or unexpectedly. Furthermore, a situation that is acceptable one day may present a conflict
of interest the next. The Commission believes that in order to identify and address potential
conflicts that may arise over time, an SDR’s procedures generally should provide a means for
regular review of conflicts as they impact the SDR’s decision-making processes. Rather than
imposing prescriptive requirements on SDRs regarding how to address conflicts, the
Commission believes that SDRs should be provided the flexibility to determine how best to
address and manage their conflicts.
Second, Rule 13n-4(c)(3)(ii) requires an SDR to recuse any person involved in a conflict
of interest from the decision-making process for resolving that conflict of interest. As stated in
the Proposing Release, the Commission believes that such recusal is necessary to eliminate an
apparent conflict of interest in an SDR’s decision-making process. 623 Additionally, recusal will
likely increase confidence in the SDR’s decision-making process and avoid an appearance of
623

Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77325, supra note 2.
183

impropriety.
Finally, Rule 13n-4(c)(3)(iii) requires an SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce
reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the SDR’s non-commercial and/or
commercial use of the SBS transaction information that it receives from a market participant, any
registered entity, or any other person. The Commission recognizes that an SDR may have
commercial incentives to operate as an SDR and agrees with one commenter’s view that the
Dodd-Frank Act’s mandatory reporting regime creates an opportunity for an SDR to
commercialize improperly the information that it receives. 624 To the extent that an SDR uses
data that it receives from others for commercial purposes, the Commission believes that such
uses should be clearly defined and disclosed to market participants. 625 If, for example, a market
participant is considering waiving confidentiality of the data that it provides to an SDR, then, at
the very least, such disclosure should provide the market participant with the information
necessary to make a meaningful choice. One commenter suggested that an SDR should, as a
way to minimize potential conflicts of interest, consider separating its utility function from its
commercial use of the SBS transaction information that it receives. 626 The Commission agrees
that this could be a way to address potential conflicts of interest, but the Commission does not
believe that it necessarily mitigates or eliminates conflicts in all circumstances. Thus, while
SDRs may wish to consider this approach, the Commission is not requiring them to do so at this
time.
As discussed in the Proposing Release, the Commission believes that a small number of
624

dealers could control an SDR, which may require SDR owners to balance competing interests. 627
Owners of an SDR could derive greater revenues from their non-trade repository activities in the
SBS market than they would from sharing in the profits of the SDR in which they hold a
financial interest; consequently, the owners of an SDR may be conflicted in making decisions
that would increase the SDR’s profitability, but decrease the profitability of their non-trade
repository activities. In addition, there may be a tension between an SDR’s statutory or
regulatory obligations (e.g., maintaining the privacy of data reported to the SDR) and its own
commercial interests or those of its owners (e.g., using data reported to the SDR for commercial
purposes). 628
An SDR’s conflicts of interest that are not properly managed could limit the benefits of
the SDR to the markets and regulators of SDRs as well as undermine the mandatory reporting
requirement in Exchange Act Section 13(m)(1)(G), thereby impacting efficiency in the SBS
market. 629 If, for instance, a market participant loses confidence in a particular SDR because the
SDR fails to minimize its conflicts of interest, then the market participant may report its SBS
transactions to an alternative SDR, which could lead to data fragmentation. By requiring an

SDR to take specific actions to minimize its conflicts of interest, the Commission believes that
Rule 13n-4(c)(3), as adopted, addresses these concerns as well as the concerns expressed in
comments received on the rule proposal.
Several commenters expressed their views on whether an SDR should be permitted to use
data for commercial purposes. 630 For a number of reasons, the Commission continues to believe
that it is not appropriate to adopt, at this time, a rule prohibiting an SDR and its affiliates from
using for commercial purposes SBS data that the SDR maintains without obtaining express
written consent from both counterparties to the SBS transaction or the reporting party. First, the
Commission believes that such a prohibition may limit transparency by hindering an SDR’s
ability to provide anonymized and aggregated reports to the public if the Commission does not
specifically mandate an SDR to provide these reports to the public. Under the final rule, an SDR
may provide these reports to the public, provided that it complies with the privacy requirements
of Rule 13n-9, as discussed in Section VI.I.1 below. 631 Second, a rule that prohibits an SDR
630

See Markit, supra note 19 (stating that “commercialization of data should only be done
with the specific consent of the data owners”); MarkitSERV, supra note 19 (stating that
“data provided to [SDRs] should only be used as permitted by the relevant market
participants in agreements between them and the [SDR]”); MFA 1, supra note 19
(suggesting that the Commission adopt a rule similar to the CFTC’s proposed rule that
would prohibit SDRs from using data for commercial purposes without express written
consent); see also DTCC SBSR, supra note 27 (suggesting that an SDR should not use
data for commercial purposes); WMBAA SBSR, supra note 27 (indicating that an SDR
should not have the authority to use SBS transaction data “for any purpose other than
those explicitly enumerated in the Commission’s regulations”). See also CFTC Rule
49.17(g), 17 CFR 49.17(g) (“Swap data accepted and maintained by the swap data
repository generally may not be used for commercial or business purposes by the swap
data repository or any of its affiliated entities”; however, “[t]he swap dealer, counterparty
or any other registered entity that submits the swap data maintained by the registered
swap data repository may permit the commercial or business use of the data by express
written consent.”).

from using SBS data for commercial purposes seems to presume that the market participants or
reporting party owns the data. As evidenced by the comment letters received, 632 the issue of who
owns the data is not clear cut, particularly when value is added to it. Third, a general prohibition
on an SDR’s commercial use of SBS data could hinder competition and the establishment of new
SDRs. As stated in Section III.D of this release, the Commission does not support any particular
business model; restricting an SDR’s commercial use of SBS data entirely, however, may be
viewed as the Commission favoring one model over other models. Finally, the Commission
believes that it is adopting adequate mechanisms to prevent or detect an SDR’s misuse of SBS
data. 633 If, however, such mechanisms prove to be inadequate, then the Commission may revisit
this issue.
At this time, the Commission believes that the core principles and statutory requirements
applicable to SDRs under the Dodd-Frank Act can be appropriately addressed under the final
SDR Rules, without the need for the Commission to take a position on ownership of SBS data.
In response to one commenter’s request for clarification, 634 the Commission notes that Rule 13n4(c)(3) is not intended to impose or imply any limit on the ability of market participants,
including counterparties to SBS transactions, SB SEFs, and clearing agencies, to use or
commercialize data that they create or receive in connection with the execution or reporting of
SBS data. The Commission, however, does not believe that it is necessary, as another

Indemnification Exemption (Rule 13n-4(d))

In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission proposed Rule 13n-4(d),
pursuant to its authority under Exchange Act Section 36, 636 to provide a tailored exemption from
the indemnification requirement set forth in Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5)(H)(ii) 637 and
previously proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(10) thereunder. 638 The Commission received a number of
comments relating to the indemnification requirement and the proposed exemption. 639 While the
Commission continues to believe that an exemption from the indemnification requirement should
be considered, the Commission also believes that the final resolution of this issue can benefit
from further consideration and public comment. Accordingly, the Commission is not adopting
proposed Rule 13n-4(d) at this time. The Commission anticipates soliciting additional public
comment regarding the indemnification requirement and a proposed exemption. As discussed
above, SDRs will have to comply with all statutory requirements, including the indemnification
requirement set forth in Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5)(H)(ii), 640 when the current exemptive
relief from the statutory requirements expires. 641

Data Collection and Maintenance (Rule 13n-5)

The Commission proposed Exchange Act Rule 13n-5 to specify the data collection and
maintenance requirements applicable to SDRs. 642 After considering the comments received on
this proposal, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-5 as proposed, with certain modifications. 643
1.

Transaction Data (Rule 13n-5(b)(1))
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(i) would require every SDR to establish, maintain, and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed for the reporting of transaction data
to the SDR, and would require the SDR to accept all transaction data that is reported to the SDR
in accordance with such policies and procedures. Proposed Rule 13n-5(a)(1) defined
“transaction data” to mean all the information reported to an SDR pursuant to the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder. 644
642

Rule 13n-5 is being promulgated under Exchange Act Sections 13(n)(4)(B), 13(n)(7)(D),
and 13(n)(9). See 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(4)(B), 78m(n)(7)(D), and 78m(n)(9). Rule 13n-5(b)
does not apply to SDR records other than transaction data and positions, as defined
below. Records made or kept by an SDR, other than transaction data and positions, are
governed by Rule 13n-7, as discussed in Section VI.G of this release.

643

Each definition in Rule 13n-5(a) is discussed alongside the substantive rule in which the
definition is used. See Section VI.E.1 below discussing “asset class” and “transaction
data”; and Section VI.E.2 below discussing “position.”

644

In a separate rulemaking implementing Dodd-Frank Act Sections 763(i) and 766(a)
(adding Exchange Act Sections 13(m) and 13A(a)(1) respectively), the Commission is
adopting rules requiring SBS transactions to be reported to a registered SDR. See
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rules 901 and 902). In another
separate proposal relating to implementation of Dodd-Frank Act Section 763(i) (adding
Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5)(E)), the Commission proposed rules that would require
SDRs to receive SBS transaction data that satisfies the notice requirement for parties that
elect the end-user exception to mandatory clearing of SBSs in order to aid the
Commission in its responsibility to prevent abuse of the end-user exception as provided
for in Exchange Act Section 3C(g). See End-User Exception Proposing Release, supra
note 15 (“Using the centralized facilities of SDRs should also make it easier for the
Commission to analyze how the end-user clearing exception is being used, monitor for
189

Proposed Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(ii) would require an SDR, if it accepts any SBS in a given
asset class, to accept all SBSs in that asset class that are reported to it in accordance with its
policies and procedures required by paragraph (b)(1) of the proposed rule. Proposed Rule 13n5(a)(3) defined “asset class” as “those security-based swaps in a particular broad category,
including, but not limited to, credit derivatives, equity derivatives, and loan-based derivatives.”
Proposed Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iii) would require every SDR to establish, maintain, and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to satisfy itself by reasonable means
that the transaction data that has been submitted to the SDR is accurate. This proposed rule
would also require every SDR to clearly identify the source for each trade side and the pairing
method (if any) for each transaction in order to identify the level of quality of that transaction
data. 645
Proposed Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iv) would require every SDR to promptly record the
transaction data it receives. 646
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Three commenters submitted comments relating to this proposed rule. 647 One commenter
stated that an SDR should have “certain minimum data standards” with regard to the transaction
data that it accepts, but that “such standards should be able to accommodate a wide variety of
potentially abusive practices, and take timely action to address abusive practices if they
were to develop.”).
645

Proposed Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iii).

646

In a separate release, the Commission is adopting rules prescribing the data elements that
an SDR is required to accept for each SBS, in association with requirements under DoddFrank Act Section 763(i) (adding Exchange Act Section 13(n)(4)(A), relating to standard
setting and data identification). See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13
(Rule 901).

647

See DTCC 2, supra note 19; MarkitSERV, supra note 19; MFA 1, supra note 19; see also
DTCC 3, supra note 19; DTCC 4, supra note 19; DTCC 5, supra note 19.
190

SBS transactions submitted per asset class.” 648 The commenter also stated that “the regulations
should be understood to permit [SDRs] to specify the methods and channels that participants
need to use to connect to them, which will most commonly be provided in the form of the
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and through setting of certain minimum
standards.” 649
Another commenter recommended revising the definition of “asset class” from the
proposal to eliminate “the distinction between loan-based and credit asset classes,” and noted
that “products like CDS on loans, while loan-based, are currently reported alongside other CDS
products.” 650 The commenter believed that “[i]n general, equity and credit derivatives will be
easy to classify, although it is possible that certain transactions could be mixed and more difficult
to classify.” 651 The commenter stated that it considers it more likely to have classification
difficulties between “a swap and an SBS, rather than between SBS asset classes.” 652 The
commenter suggested that, in order to mitigate the problem of classification between asset
classes, the Commission could combine “the loan-based asset class with credit derivatives, and
[allow] an SBS to be reported to either the equity or credit SDR if there is any uncertainty of a
product’s asset class.” 653
Two commenters agreed that SDRs should be required to support all trades in an asset

class. 654 One commenter stated that “[w]ithout specific requirements related to the range of
products that can be reported to them, [SDRs] may be tempted to limit their operating costs by
only accepting the more standardized categories of swaps [that] also tend to trade in high
volumes. This would result in incomplete market coverage and an increased fragmentation of
the reported data.” 655 Thus, the commenter recommended that the Commission require SDRs
“to accept all trades in a given asset class as a means of ensuring broad coverage while guarding
against fragmentation that could result from inadequate [SDR] functionality.” 656 The other
commenter stated that the “requirement for an SDR to support all trades in an asset class is . . .
important to reduce the complexity for reporting parties,” and that the “requirement discourages
an SDR from only servicing high volume products within an asset class to maximize profit, and
leaving more complex (and less frequently traded) transactions to be reported by reporting
parties directly to the Commission.” 657
Three commenters addressed the SDR’s role with respect to verifying the accuracy of the

risk and market activity profiles can be maintained”); DTCC 4, supra note 19 (stating that

transaction data submitted. 658 One commenter fully supported the requirement that SDRs
confirm with both counterparties the accuracy of the data submitted. 659 Another commenter
stated that “the Commission should encourage the use and reporting of trade data that has been
confirmed or verified by both counterparties via an affirmation or a matching process,” 660 and
that this should be “connected with” the Commission’s proposed requirement that SBS dealers
and major SBS participants provide trade acknowledgments and verify those trade
acknowledgments. 661 This commenter suggested, however, that SDRs should be able to accept
single-sided trades for real-time reporting purposes, and that any subsequently discovered
discrepancies could be corrected after confirmation. 662 The third commenter recommended that
“SDRs should not have additional duties with respect to verifying the accuracy of [a]
submission, as there is limited data available to the SDR. The SDR may carry out certain routine
functions to identify trades which may indicate erroneous data (e.g. based on size), but in
general, the primary responsibility for accuracy of reported information should remain with the
reporting party.” 663 This commenter also recommended that the Commission determine that an
SDR has satisfied its obligation where “(i) the [SBS] has been reported by a [SEF], clearing
agency, designated contract market, or other regulated counterparty who has an independent
obligation to maintain the accuracy of the transaction data; (ii) a confirmation has been submitted

to the [SDR] to demonstrate that both counterparties have agreed to the accuracy of the swap
information that was submitted to the [SDR]; or (iii) the [SBS] is deemed verified and the [SDR]
has developed and implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide the nonreporting side of the [SDR] with an opportunity to confirm the information submitted by the
reporting side.” 664 This same commenter stated that SDRs should “process transactions in realtime.” 665
c.

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-5(b)(1) and the
definition of “transaction data” under Rule 13n-5(a)(3) as proposed, with modifications. 666 The
Commission is adopting the definition of “asset class” under Rule 13n-5(a)(1) as proposed, with
one modification. 667
Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(i) and the definition of “transaction data”: Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(i) requires
every SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed for the reporting of complete and accurate transaction data to the SDR, and requires the
SDR to accept all transaction data that is reported to the SDR in accordance with such policies
and procedures. “Transaction data” is defined to mean all the information reported to an SDR
664

DTCC 5, supra note 19.

665

DTCC 2, supra note 19.

666

The Commission is making one technical amendment to proposed Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(ii).
As proposed, the rule referenced the “policies and procedures required by paragraph
(b)(1) of this section.” As adopted, the rule references the “policies and procedures
required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.” Additionally, the Commission is
renumbering the definition of “transaction data” as Rule 13n-5(a)(3) in order to
alphabetize the definitions in Rule 13n-5(a). The definition of “transaction data” is also
being revised from the proposal, as discussed below.

667

The definition of “asset class” is also being renumbered as Rule 13n-5(a)(1) in order to
alphabetize the definitions in Rule 13n-5(a).
194

pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except for information
provided pursuant to Rule 906(b) of Regulation SBSR. 668
As explained in the Proposing Release, a fundamental goal of Title VII is to have all
SBSs reported to SDRs. 669 Therefore, “transaction data” includes all information, including life
cycle events, required to be reported to an SDR under Rule 901 of Regulation SBSR. 670 Rule
13n-5(b)(1)(i) is intended to prevent SDRs from rejecting SBSs for arbitrary or anti-competitive
reasons, minimize the number of SBSs that are not accepted by an SDR, and to the extent that an
SDR’s policies and procedures make clear which SBSs the SDR will accept, make it easier for
market participants and market infrastructures to determine whether there is an SDR that will
accept a particular SBS. 671

668

Rule 13n-5(a)(3). As proposed, the definition of “transaction data” did not include the
exception for information provided pursuant to Rule 906(b) of Regulation SBSR. See
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rule 906(b) requiring a participant to
provide information related to its ultimate parent(s) and affiliates). Because the
information provided pursuant to Rule 906(b) is not tied to a particular SBS, the
Commission believes that it does not make sense to tie the retention of the information to
the expiration of an SBS. See Rule 13n-5(b)(4) (requiring an SDR to maintain
transaction data “for not less than five years after the applicable [SBS] expires”). By
adding the exception to the definition of “transaction data,” the information that an SDR
receives pursuant to Rule 906(b) will instead be required to be kept and preserved for not
less than five years, pursuant to Rule 13n-7(b).

669

Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77327, supra note 2. See Exchange Act Section
13(m)(1)(G), 15 U.S.C. 78m(m)(1)(G), as added by Dodd-Frank Act Section 763(i)
(requiring “[e]ach security-based swap (whether cleared or uncleared)” to be reported to a
registered SDR).

670

A definition of “life cycle event” is included in Regulation SBSR. See Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rule 900).

671

In a separate release relating to implementation of Dodd-Frank Act Section 763(i), the
Commission is adopting additional rules requiring an SDR to have policies and
procedures relating to the reporting of SBS data to the SDR. See Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rule 907); see also id. (Rule 901(h) requiring
information to be reported to an SDR “in a format required by the registered [SDR]”).
195

The Commission is revising the rule from the proposal to clarify that an SDR’s policies
and procedures should be reasonably designed for the reporting of “complete and accurate”
transaction data to the SDR. 672 For example, an SDR’s policies and procedures may not be
reasonable if they do not require reporting of all the data elements required under Regulation
SBSR and that the data reported be accurate.
The Commission agrees with one commenter’s view that an SDR’s policies and
procedures should allow for the reporting of “a wide variety of SBS transactions.” 673 The
Commission also agrees that SDRs should be allowed to “specify the methods and channels that
participants need to use to connect to [SDRs],”674 so long as such methods and channels are
reasonable. Therefore, an SDR may reject SBS data that is reported in a manner that is
inconsistent with its reasonable policies and procedures.
In addition, to the extent that an SDR’s policies and procedures allow SBSs to be
reported to it in more than one format, 675 the SDR may need to reformat or translate the data to
conform to any format and taxonomy that the Commission may adopt pursuant to Rule 13n4(b)(5) in order to satisfy the requirement of providing direct electronic access to the
672

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77307 and 77327, supra note 2 (“SDRs are required to
collect and maintain accurate SBS transaction data so that relevant authorities can access
and analyze the data from secure, central locations to better monitor for systemic risk and
potential market abuse” and “an SDR is useful only insofar as the data it retains is
accurate”); see also MFA 1, supra note 19 (discussing the importance of SDRs
maintaining accurate data).

674

See MarkitSERV, supra note 19.

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rule 907(a)(2) requiring a
registered SDR to establish and maintain written policies and procedures that specify one
or more acceptable data formats (each of which must be an open-source structured data
format that is widely used by participants), connectivity requirements, and other
protocols for submitting information).
196

Commission.676 For example, the SDR may need to reformat or translate terms of the
transaction (e.g., scheduled termination dates, prices, or fixed or floating rate payments). The
Commission notes that an SDR is not required to make persons who report SBSs to the SDR use
any of the formats and taxonomies specified by the Commission. Rather, the SDR is only
required to use such formats and taxonomies when providing the Commission with direct
electronic access.
Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(ii) and the definition of “asset class”: Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(ii) requires an
SDR, if it accepts any SBS in a particular asset class, to accept all SBSs in that asset class that
are reported to it in accordance with its policies and procedures required by Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(i).
As explained in the Proposing Release, this requirement is designed to maximize the number of
SBSs that are accepted by an SDR. 677 The comments that the Commission received on this rule
endorsed it. 678 The Commission believes that if certain SBSs are not accepted by any SDR and
are reported to the Commission instead, 679 the purpose of the Dodd-Frank Act to have

data in a format readily accessible and usable to the Commission); and Section VI.H of

centralized data on SBSs for regulators and others to access could be undermined. 680 In addition,
the Commission agrees with one commenter that this requirement will “reduce the complexity
for reporting parties.” 681 The Commission also agrees with commenters’ views that without this
requirement, SDRs may be tempted to limit their services to standardized, high-volume SBSs. 682
Given these incentives, the requirement that an SDR accept all SBSs in a given asset class if it
accepts any SBS in that asset class is meant to facilitate the aggregation of, and relevant
authorities’ and market participants’ access to, SBS transaction data. This requirement prevents
a provider of trading or clearing services to act as an SDR for only those SBSs that it trades or
clears. 683 This requirement also prevents an SDR from accepting only SBSs that have been
cleared. 684
As explained in the Proposing Release, an SDR is required to accept only those SBSs that
are reported in accordance with the SDR’s policies and procedures required by Rule 13n-

5(b)(1)(i). 685 For example, an SDR’s policies and procedures could prescribe the necessary
security and connectivity protocols that market participants and market infrastructures must have
in place prior to transmitting transaction data to the SDR. The SDR is not required to accept
transaction data from market participants and market infrastructures that do not comply with
these protocols; otherwise the transmission of the transaction data could compromise the SDR’s
automated systems. 686
In response to the comment recommending amending the definition of “asset class” to
remove the “the distinction between loan-based and credit asset classes,” 687 the Commission
agrees that removing such distinction will make it easier for reporting parties when classifying a
transaction. Therefore, the Commission is modifying from the proposal the definition of “asset
class” in Rule 13n-5(a)(1) to mean “those security-based swaps in a particular broad category,
including, but not limited to, credit derivatives and equity derivatives.” 688

685

Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77327, supra note 2. An SDR is required to disclose to
market participants its criteria for providing others with access to services offered and
data maintained by the SDR pursuant to Rule 13n-10(b)(1), as discussed in Section VI.I.2
of this release. Therefore, market participants will be made aware of an SDR’s policies
and procedures for reporting data.

686

To the extent that an SDR already has systems in place to accept and maintain SBSs in a
particular asset class, the Commission believes that Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(ii) will not add a

In a separate release relating to implementation of Dodd-Frank Act Section 763(i), the
Commission is adopting the same definition of “asset class.” See Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rule 900). In addition, the Commission proposed rules
relating to trade acknowledgments and verifications of SBSs, which proposed a definition
of “asset class” that is the same as the definition of “asset class” in the Proposing
Release, 75 FR at 77369, supra note 2, and therefore differs from the definition of “asset
class” being adopted in this release. See Trade Acknowledgment Release, supra note
133. The Commission expects to consider conforming the proposed definition of “asset
199

Where an SBS arguably could belong to more than one asset class, for example, if it has
characteristics of both credit and equity derivatives, then an SDR serving either asset class
should be able to accept that SBS without then being required to accept all SBSs in the other
asset class – i.e., an SDR for the credit derivative asset class could accept such an SBS without
then having to accept all equity SBSs, and an SDR for the equity derivative asset class could
accept the SBS without then having to accept all credit SBSs.
One commenter expressed concern about transactions that could be considered both
swaps and SBSs, such as one constructed based on the correlation between commodities and
equities. 689 The Commission notes that it has adopted, jointly with the CFTC, regulations
applicable to mixed swaps. 690 The Commission believes that if an SDR accepts a mixed swap,
then it should not be required to accept all SBSs in all asset classes to which the mixed swap
belongs. For example, if a swap data repository that accepts commodity swaps accepts a mixed
swap that is based on the value of both equity and commodity prices, then that swap data
repository should not be required to accept all equity SBSs.
Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iii): Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iii) requires every SDR to establish, maintain,
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to satisfy itself that the
transaction data that has been submitted to the SDR is complete and accurate. 691 Rule 13n-

691

As proposed, Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iii) would require the SDR’s policies and procedures to be
“reasonably designed to satisfy [the SDR] by reasonable means that the transaction data
that has been submitted to the SDR is accurate.” In adopting Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iii), the
200

5(b)(1)(iii) also requires every SDR to clearly identify the source for each trade side and the
pairing method (if any) for each transaction in order to identify the level of quality of that
transaction data. 692 These requirements, which are intended to improve data accuracy, are based
on the requirement in Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5)(B) that an SDR “confirm with both
counterparties to the security-based swap the accuracy of the data that was submitted.” 693 As
explained in the Proposing Release, the requirement is based on the premise that an SDR is
useful only insofar as the data it retains is accurate. 694 Unreliable SBS data does not enhance
transparency. Requiring the SDR to take steps regarding the accuracy of the transaction data
submitted to it, should help ensure that the data submitted to the SDR is accurate and agreed to
by both counterparties. One commenter suggested that “SDRs should not have additional duties
with respect to verifying the accuracy of submission.” 695 But because of the statutory
requirement and the likelihood that the commenter’s approach would lead to less accurate
information being provided to the Commission and the marketplace, the Commission is adopting
Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iii) largely as proposed.
As proposed, the rule would require an SDR’s policies and procedures to address the
Commission is removing the phrase “by reasonable means” to make the rule text clearer.
This revision is not intended to substantively change the meaning of the rule.
692

With regard to this requirement, proposed Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iii) used the phrase
“including clearly identifying.” In adopting Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iii), the Commission is
changing “including clearly identifying” to “clearly identifies” to make the rule text
clearer. This revision is not intended to substantively change the meaning of the rule.

accuracy of the transaction data. For purposes of clarification, the rule as adopted requires that
an SDR’s policies and procedures address both the completeness and accuracy of the transaction
data. For example, an SDR’s policies and procedures may not be reasonable if they allow data
elements required under Regulation SBSR to be blank.
The Commission understands that with respect to certain asset classes, third party service
providers currently provide an electronic affirmation or matching process prior to the SBS data
reaching an SDR. 696 As explained in the Proposing Release, the Commission believes that an
SDR can fulfill its responsibilities under Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5)(B), Rule 13n-4(b)(3), 697
and this Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iii) by developing reasonable policies and procedures that rely on
confirmations completed by another entity, such as an SB SEF, clearing agency, or third party
vendor, as long as such reliance is reasonable. 698 In order for such policies and procedures
establishing reliance on a third party to be reasonable, the SDR would need to oversee and
supervise the performance of the third party confirmation provider. This could include having
policies and procedures in place to monitor the third party confirmation provider’s compliance
with the terms of any agreements and to assess the third party confirmation provider’s continued
fitness and ability to perform the confirmations. It could also include having the SDR or an
independent auditor inspect or test the performance of the third party confirmation provider, with

Rule 13n-4(b)(3) requires SDRs to “[c]onfirm, as prescribed in Rule 13n-5 (§ 240.13n-5),
with both counterparties to the security-based swap the accuracy of the data that was
submitted.”

the SDR retaining records of such inspections or tests. 699
For example, if an SBS is traded on an SB SEF, that SB SEF could confirm the accuracy
of the transaction data with both counterparties, and the SB SEF could then report the transaction
data to an SDR. 700 The SDR would not need to further substantiate the accuracy of the
transaction data, as long as the SDR has a reasonable belief that the SB SEF performed an
accurate confirmation. However, the SDR would not comply with Exchange Act Section
13(n)(5)(B), Rule 13n-4(b)(3), and this Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iii) if the confirmation proves to be
inaccurate and the SDR’s reliance on the SB SEF for providing accurate confirmations was
unreasonable (e.g., the SDR ignored a pattern of inaccuracies or red flags). In certain
circumstances, such as where an SBS is transacted by two commercial end-users and is not
electronically traded or cleared, and is reported to an SDR by one of those end-users, there may
not be any other entity upon which the SDR can reasonably rely to perform the confirmation. In
such a case, the SDR would have to contact each of the counterparties to substantiate the
accuracy of the transaction data. 701
Similarly, it would not be reasonable for an SDR to rely on a trade acknowledgment
provided by one counterparty to an SBS, without verifying that the other counterparty has agreed
to the trade. However, if a party to an SBS timely delivers a trade acknowledgment to both the

Such records would have to be maintained pursuant to Rule 13n-7(b). See Section
VI.G.2 of this release discussing SDR recordkeeping.

701

The Commission believes that an SDR should consider making reasonable
accommodations, including consideration of any cost burdens, for a non-reporting
counterparty of an SBS transaction in connection with any follow-up by the SDR
regarding the accuracy of the counterparty’s SBS transaction. These accommodations
could, for example, include providing means for non-reporting counterparties to
substantiate the accuracy of the transaction data without having to incur significant
systems or technology costs.
203

counterparty and the SDR (or a third party confirmation provider), and the counterparty promptly
sends the verification back to both the original party and the SDR (or a third party confirmation
provider), then the SDR could use the trade acknowledgment and verification to fulfill its
obligations under this rule. 702
With regard to the requirement that an SDR “clearly identif[y] the source for each trade
side and the pairing method (if any) for each transaction,” 703 the Commission notes that
transaction data may vary in terms of reliability and such source and pairing method may affect
the reliability of the transaction data. As explained in the Proposing Release, some transaction
data may be affirmed by counterparties to an SBS, but not confirmed. 704 Some transaction data
may be confirmed informally by the back-offices of the counterparties, but the confirmation may
not be considered authoritative. Other transaction data may go through an electronic
confirmation process, which is considered authoritative by the counterparties. The Commission
is adopting this requirement to enable relevant authorities to better determine the reliability of
any particular transaction data maintained by an SDR. In order for an SDR’s policies and
procedures for satisfying itself that the transaction data that has been submitted to the SDR is
complete and accurate to be reasonable, the SDR could consider documenting the processes used
by third parties to substantiate the accuracy of the transaction data.
702

Although the Commission proposed rules requiring SBS dealers and major SBS
participants to provide trade acknowledgment and verification of SBS transactions, it has
not adopted any such rules. See Trade Acknowledgment Release, supra note 133. The
Commission may address in a later release whether the procedure described above would
comply with any such rules. See MarkitSERV, supra note 19 (stating that “the
environment envisaged by the SBS SDR Regulation would greatly benefit from being
connected with the confirmation requirement (such as the verified trade
acknowledgement record)”).

Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iv): Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iv) requires every SDR to promptly record the
transaction data it receives. As explained in the Proposing Release, it is important that SDRs
keep up-to-date records so that regulators and counterparties to SBSs will have access to accurate
and current information. 705 One commenter recommended that SDRs process transactions in
“real-time.” 706 The commenter did not define “real-time.” If, by “real-time,” the commenter
means that SDRs should begin to record the transaction data as soon as it arrives, then the
Commission believes that the rule’s requirement to “promptly record the transaction data it
receives” is consistent with the commenter’s recommendation.

Positions (Rule 13n-5(b)(2))
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-5(b)(2) would require every SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to calculate positions for all persons with
open SBSs for which the SDR maintains records. Proposed Rule 13n-5(a)(2) defined “position”
as the gross and net notional amounts of open SBS transactions aggregated by one or more
attributes, including, but not limited to, the (i) underlying instrument, index, or reference entity;
(ii) counterparty; (iii) asset class; (iv) long risk of the underlying instrument, index, or reference
entity; and (v) short risk of the underlying instrument, index, or reference entity. The
Commission requested comment regarding whether it should require SDRs to calculate market
values of each position at least daily and provide them to the Commission.707

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Three commenters submitted comments relating to this proposed rule. 708 One commenter
expressed the view that “position data is most valuable when aggregated among all SDRs,” and
therefore suggested that “one SDR should be given the responsibility to aggregate and maintain
the consolidated position data for regulatory purposes.” 709
None of the commenters believed that SDRs should be required to perform valuation
calculations at this time. One commenter indicated, however, that providing valuations should
be a long-term goal. 710 In this commenter’s view, existing SDRs do not have the capability to
provide valuations and they are not currently best situated to develop this capability; the shortterm goal should be for SDRs to collect, and potentially report, valuations provided by the
counterparties to an SBS and/or any relevant third party entities. 711 Another commenter
expressed the view that “firms” should provide market values because they invest considerable
resources in valuing trades and it would be difficult for an SDR to replicate these activities for all
trades. 712 The commenter stated that an “SDR could contract with a market valuation service to
provide some values and this would provide some independent valuation, but this will not readily
extend to illiquid or structured products.” 713 The commenter also stated that while mark-to708

would not be useful in assessing counterparty risk exposures.” 714 A third commenter stated that
valuation models for counterparty credit risks and systemic risk should include independent,
third party data. 715
c.

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-5(b)(2) and the
definition of “position” under Rule 13n-5(a)(2) as proposed. Rule 13n-5(b)(2) requires every
SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
calculate positions for all persons with open SBSs for which the SDR maintains records. 716 Rule
13n-5(a)(2) defines “position” as the gross and net notional amounts of open SBS transactions
aggregated by one or more attributes, including, but not limited to, the (i) underlying instrument,
index, or reference entity; (ii) counterparty; (iii) asset class; (iv) long risk of the underlying
instrument, index, or reference entity; and (v) short risk of the underlying instrument, index, or
reference entity. 717

715

Ethics Metrics, supra note 19; see also MarkitSERV, supra note 19 (describing valuations

Position data is required to be provided by an SDR to certain entities pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5)(G), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(G).

717

As stated in the Proposing Release, for purposes of this definition, positions aggregated
by long risk would be only for the aggregate notional amount of SBSs in which a market
participant has long risk of the underlying instrument, index, or reference entity.
Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77326 n.102, supra note 2. Similarly, positions aggregated
by short risk would be only for the aggregate notional amount of SBSs in which a market
participant has short risk of the underlying instrument, index, or reference entity. For
SBSs other than credit default swaps, a counterparty has long risk where the counterparty
profits from an increase in the price of the underlying instrument or index, and a
counterparty has short risk where the counterparty profits from a decrease in the price of
the underlying instrument or index. For credit default swaps, a counterparty has long risk
207

As explained in the Proposing Release, position information is important to regulators for
risk, enforcement, and examination purposes. 718 In addition, having a readily available source of
position information can be useful to counterparties in evaluating their own risk. As explained in
the Proposing Release, in order to meet its obligation to calculate positions, an SDR could
require reporting parties to report the necessary events to calculate positions, or it could have a
system that will monitor for and collect such information. 719 In order for the positions to be
calculated accurately, an SDR will need to promptly incorporate recently reported transaction
data and collected unreported data. It is important that the SDR keep up-to-date records so that
relevant authorities and parties to the SBS will have access to accurate and current information.
In calculating positions, an SDR is only required to reflect SBS transactions reported to that
SDR.
As explained in the Proposing Release, the definition of “position” is designed to be
sufficiently specific so that SDRs are aware of the types of position calculations that regulators
may require an SDR to provide, while at the same time, provide enough flexibility to encompass
the types of position calculations that regulators and the industry will find important as new
types of SBSs are developed. 720

where the counterparty profits from a decrease in the price of the credit risk of the
underlying index or reference entity, and a counterparty has short risk where the
counterparty profits from an increase in the price of the credit risk of the underlying
index or reference entity. As the market develops, the Commission may consider
whether to require SDRs calculate positions in another manner and provide those
positions to the Commission on a confidential basis.

208

While one commenter suggested that “one SDR should be given the responsibility to
aggregate and maintain the consolidated position data for regulatory purposes,” 721 the
Commission is not mandating the aggregation of position data at one SDR. At this time, the
Commission believes that it—rather than any particular registered entity—is in the best position
to aggregate data across multiple registered SDRs. As described above, the Commission
anticipates that it will propose for public comment detailed specifications of acceptable formats
and taxonomies that will facilitate an accurate interpretation, aggregation, and analysis of SBS
data by the Commission. 722 The Commission may revisit this issue as the SBS market
evolves. 723
With regard to valuations, the Commission agrees with commenters 724 that SDRs are not
necessarily in the best position to calculate market valuations at this time. While, as one
commenter pointed out, an SDR could contract with a market valuation service to provide some
values, 725 it is not apparent how useful the valuation would be without collateral information, 726
U.S.C. 78j-2. Specifically, Exchange Act Section 10B(a) provides that “[a]s a means
reasonably designed to prevent fraud and manipulation, the Commission shall, by rule or
regulation, as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
investors, establish limits (including related hedge exemption provisions) on the size of
positions in any security-based swap that may be held by any person.” Id. In addition,
Exchange Act Section 10B(d) provides that the Commission may establish position
reporting requirements for any person that effects transactions in SBSs, whether cleared
or uncleared. Id.

and a valuation service could not readily provide valuations for illiquid or structured products. 727
Therefore, the Commission is not requiring SDRs to calculate market values of positions daily
and to provide them to the Commission. The Commission notes that under Regulation SBSR,
the counterparties are required to report to an SDR the “data elements included in the agreement
between the counterparties that are necessary for a person to determine the market value of the
transaction.” 728 Accordingly, if necessary, the Commission could calculate some market
valuations either in-house or by hiring a third party market valuation service provider. As the
market develops and SDRs develop and increase their capabilities, the Commission may revisit
this issue.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Both commenters that submitted comments relating to this proposed rule agreed that

systemic risk mitigation [and that] SDRs will play a pivotal role in ensuring the accuracy of
[SBS] data both for public consumption and regulatory reporting purposes.” 730 The commenter
further noted that “[t]he existence of a number of feedback loops and distribution channels
through which data will flow will enable participants to identify, test and correct inaccuracies
and errors.” 731 This commenter also indicated that the ability to ensure data accuracy would be
influenced by the degree to which such data is utilized by industry participants in other
processes. Therefore, that commenter stressed that “SDRs and their affiliates should be
permitted to offer a range of ancillary services in addition to their core services of data
acceptance and data storage.” 732
Another commenter stated that “the multiple bilateral reconciliations performed between
the parties to a trade throughout the life of a trade (and often on an ad hoc basis or only following
a dispute), could be replaced by one single reconciliation framework with a shared central
record, increasing both [sic] operating efficiency as well as reducing operational risks. The
Commission’s suggestion for portfolio reconciliation seems well aligned with this, and this
would give the direct benefit of improved bilateral portfolio reconciliation processes between the
parties.” 733 The commenter also stated that “[a]fter each recorded transaction is consummated,
the SDR can maintain the validity of the data for that transaction by offering an asset servicing

function.” 734
c.

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-5(b)(3) as
proposed, with one modification. Rule 13n-5(b)(3) requires every SDR to establish, maintain,
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the transaction
data and positions that it maintains are complete and accurate. As explained in the Proposing
Release, maintaining accurate records is an integral function of an SDR. 735 As further explained
in the Proposing Release, maintaining accurate records requires diligence on the part of an SDR
because, among other things, SBSs can be amended, assigned, or terminated and positions
change upon the occurrence of new events (such as corporate actions). 736
As proposed, the rule would require an SDR’s policies and procedures to address the
accuracy of the transaction data and positions. For purposes of clarification, the rule as adopted
requires that an SDR’s policies and procedures address both the completeness and accuracy of
the transaction data and positions. For example, an SDR’s policies and procedures may not be
reasonable if they allow data elements required under Regulation SBSR to be blank.
The Commission agrees with one commenter that the degree to which industry
participants use the data will influence the accuracy of the data, and that the ability of
participants to identify, test, and correct inaccuracies and errors should be encouraged. 737 The
Commission also agrees with another commenter that offering an asset servicing function may

assist an SDR in maintaining the validity of transaction data and positions. 738 Therefore, the
Commission supports the provision by SDRs of voluntary ancillary services, such as asset
servicing, that improve the quality of the SBS data in the SDRs. 739 With regard to the comment
acknowledging the value to portfolio reconciliation, 740 while portfolio reconciliation is a
voluntary ancillary service, the Commission believes, consistent with its position in the
Proposing Release, 741 that it is a method that an SDR can use to ensure reasonably the accuracy
of the transaction data and positions that the SDR maintains.

Data Retention (Rule 13n-5(b)(4))

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-5(b)(4) would require every SDR to maintain transaction data for not
less than five years after the applicable SBS expires and historical positions for not less than five
years. Alternatively, the Commission considered, but did not propose a rule, requiring every
SDR to maintain transaction data for not less than five years after the applicable SBS expires or
ten years after the applicable SBS is executed, whichever is greater, and historical positions for
not less than five years. 742 Under either alternative, SDRs would be required to maintain the
transaction data and historical positions (i) in a place and format that is readily accessible to the

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Four commenters submitted comments relating to this proposed rule. 744 The commenters
generally agreed with the Commission’s proposal that SDRs should maintain SBS data for the
life of the SBS contract and a reasonable time period thereafter. 745 Commenters expressed
various views on whether the Commission should require SBS data to be maintained in a
particular format. 746 One commenter stated that “[t]he Proposed Rule should require the
retention of electronic records of transactions, including life cycle events. These should be
maintained for the life of the contract in order to provide an audit trail to positions and for a
reasonable retention period thereafter. An SDR’s records should be in an electronically readable
format (where available) that allows for application and analysis.” 747 The commenter also stated
that “certain aggregate data should be maintained beyond the maturity of contracts to provide
public availability of time series data.” 748
One commenter to the Temporary Rule Release believed that the Commission should
consider requiring SBS transaction data to be recorded and reported pursuant to a single
electronic data standard because “[t]his will enable transactions to be reported in an efficient and

Another commenter recommended that “the Commission require that all SDRs maintain [stored
SBS data] in the same format.” 752 This commenter further recommended that “the Commission
specifically require the SDR to organize and index accurately the transaction data and positions
so that the Commission and other users of such information are easily able to obtain the specific
information that they require.” 753 Another commenter stated that a “registered SDR should have
flexibility to specify acceptable data formats, connectivity requirements and other protocols for
submitting information. Market practice, including structure of confirmation messages and
detail of economic fields, evolve over time, and the SDR should have the capability to adopt and
set new formats.” 754
Another commenter recommended that data be “standardized and use a common
terminology.” 755 The commenter also recommended that records at SDRs be kept indefinitely
because the commenter believed that there is “no technological or practical reason for limiting
the retention period.” 756 The commenter further recommended that “[a]ny original documents

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-5(b)(4) as
proposed, with two modifications. Rule 13n-5(b)(4) requires every SDR to maintain transaction
data and related identifying information for not less than five years after the applicable SBS
expires and historical positions for not less than five years. Rule 13n-5(b)(4) also requires SDRs
to maintain the transaction data and historical positions (i) in a place and format that is readily
accessible and usable to the Commission and other persons with authority to access or view such
information; and (ii) in an electronic format that is non-rewriteable and non-erasable.
Time Period: As explained in the Proposing Release, a five-year retention period is the
current requirement for the records of clearing agencies and other registered entities, and is the
statutory requirement for SB SEFs. 758 Because an SBS transaction creates obligations that
continue for a specified period of time, the Commission believes that the transaction data should
be maintained for the duration of the SBS, with the five years running after the SBS expires.
This requirement applies to all transaction data, including life cycle events that are reported to an
SDR pursuant to Regulation SBSR. 759 The Commission believes that transaction data and
position data that are older than their respective retention periods will not be materially useful to
the Commission or other relevant authorities.

There may be transaction-specific identifying information assigned or used by an SDR,
such as a transaction ID 760 or a time stamp, 761 that are not included in the definition of
“transaction data.” This identifying information should also be maintained for the same time
period as the transaction data because it is necessary to understanding the transaction data.
Therefore, the Commission is revising the proposed rule to require SDRs to maintain “related
identifying information” for not less than five years after the applicable SBS expires. Positions
are not tied to any particular SBS transaction; therefore, the Commission requires positions, as
calculated pursuant to Rule 13n-5(b)(2), to be maintained for five years, similar to the record
retention requirement for clearing agencies. 762
The Commission is not adopting the alternative time period that was set forth in the
Proposing Release. No comments supported the alternative time period. The Commission is not
adopting one commenter’s recommendation that data at SDRs be kept indefinitely 763 because the
Commission believes that requiring transaction data to be maintained for not less than five years

760

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rule 901(g) requiring a
registered SDR to assign a transaction ID to each SBS, or establish or endorse a

after the applicable SBS expires is more reasonable, 764 and this approach is consistent with the
record retention period for other Commission registrants and the statutory requirement for SB
SEFs.
One commenter stated that “certain aggregate data should be maintained beyond the
maturity of contracts to provide public availability of time series data.” 765 Because the
Commission is not requiring an SDR to provide the public with historic data (aggregated or
otherwise) that it previously publicly disseminated, the Commission does not believe that it is
appropriate to require SDRs to maintain aggregate data for public availability. However, SDRs
may find it useful to maintain such data if they intend to provide the public with data sets beyond
the public dissemination requirements of Regulation SBSR. 766 To the extent that the
Commission requires the creation of aggregate data, such as through reports requested pursuant
to Rule 13n-8, the data will be for regulatory purposes. Any aggregation of data that is created
by an SDR, either at the Commission’s direction or voluntarily, must be retained for five years
pursuant to Rule 13n-7(b). 767
Format: As explained in the Proposing Release, the Commission believes that
transaction data, including life cycle events, and positions should be maintained in a place and
format that is readily accessible to the Commission and other persons with authority to access or

764

See DTCC 2, supra note 19 (“[E]lectronic records of transactions . . . should be

view such information. 768 This requirement is important to ensure that SDRs maintain the
information in an organized and accessible manner so that users, including relevant authorities
and counterparties, can easily obtain the data that would assist them in carrying out their
appropriate functions. The Commission also believes that this requirement helps ensure that the
information is maintained in a common and easily accessible language, such as a language
commonly used in financial markets. The Commission agrees with one commenter’s
recommendation that an SDR’s records should “be in an electronically readable format (where
available) that allows for application and analysis,” 769 and therefore the Commission is
modifying proposed Rule 13n-5(b)(4) to provide that the information must be in a format that is
usable to (1) the Commission and (2) other persons with authority to access or view such
information. 770 The Commission believes that if the information is not in a usable format, then
the Commission and others would not have the ability to analyze the information as needed.
Despite comments to the contrary, 771 the Commission is not establishing a specific,

See DTCC 2, supra note 19 (recommending that an SDR’s records “be in an

770

Rule 13n-5(b)(4). The Commission notes that this change is consistent with other
Commission rules. For example, Rule 605(a)(2) of Regulation NMS, 17 CFR
242.605(a)(2), requires reports be “in a uniform, readily accessible, and usable electronic
form.”

771

See Better Markets 1, supra note 19 (recommending that the Commission require all
SDRs to maintain stored SBS data in the same format); ISDA Temp Rule, supra note 28
(recommending that the Commission require SBS transaction data to be reported and
recorded pursuant to a single electronic data standard, and using FpML as that standard);
Barnard, supra note 19 (recommending that data be “standardized and use a common
terminology” and that original documents be scanned); see also Better Markets 2, supra
note 19 (recommending that reported data be subject to uniform formatting
requirements).
219

prescribed format in which an SDR must maintain transaction data and positions. The
Commission expects that the “readily accessible and usable” requirement will be sufficient to
cause the format and content of transaction data and historical positions maintained by any
individual SDR to be sufficiently robust and complete for relevant persons to fully, accurately,
and consistently process the data. The Commission believes that SDRs, working with market
participants, will be in a better position to upgrade formats and data elements as needed. Having
the Commission establish a specific format could impede the timely collection of data on new
types of transactions from the SDRs. 772
However, in order to oversee the SBS market, it will be necessary for the Commission to
aggregate and analyze data across different SDRs. 773 As discussed above, the Commission
anticipates that it will propose for public comment detailed specifications of acceptable formats
and taxonomies for providing SBS data to the Commission in order to facilitate an accurate
interpretation, aggregation, and analysis by the Commission of SBS data submitted to it by
different SDRs. 774
The requirement for transaction data and historical positions to be maintained in an
electronic format that is non-rewriteable and non-erasable 775 is consistent with the record

772

See DTCC SBSR, supra note 27 (stating that SDRs “should have flexibility to specify
acceptable data formats, connectivity requirements and other protocols for submitting
information,” and that SDRs “should have the capability to adopt and set new formats” as
market practices evolve over time).

retention format applicable to electronic broker-dealer records. 776 As explained in the Proposing
Release, this requirement would prevent the maintained information from being modified or
removed without detection. 777
The Commission is not specifically requiring that SDRs organize and index the
transaction data and positions that they collect and maintain. 778 The Commission believes that
the requirement in Rule 13n-5(b)(4) that each SDR must maintain transaction data and related
identifying information for not less than five years after the applicable SBS expires and historical
positions for not less than five years, in a place and format that is “readily accessible and usable
to the Commission and other persons with authority to access or view such information”
incorporates the requirement that the data must be organized in a way that allows the data to be
readily obtained or accessed by the Commission and other appropriate persons – data is not
readily accessible and usable if it is not organized in a way that allows the data to be obtained
quickly and easily. Further, whether users of information maintained by an SDR, other than the
Commission, are able to easily obtain such information is also addressed by Rule 13n4(c)(1)(iii), which requires, among other things, an SDR to establish, monitor on an ongoing
basis, and enforce clearly stated objective criteria that would permit fair, open, and not
776

See Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(f)(2)(ii)(A), 17 CFR 240.17a-4(f)(2)(ii)(A). In Electronic
Storage of Broker-Dealer Records, Exchange Act Release No. 47806 (May 7, 2003), 68
FR 25281 (May 12, 2003), the Commission stated, among other things, that a brokerdealer would not violate Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(f)(2)(ii)(A) “if it used an electronic
storage system that prevents the overwriting, erasing or otherwise altering of a record
during its required retention period through the use of integrated hardware and software
control codes.” The Commission incorporates this interpretation into Rule 13n-5(b)(4).

unreasonably discriminatory access to data maintained by the SDR. 779
With respect to the Commission’s ability to obtain the specific information it requires, the
Commission believes that several other statutory and regulatory requirements under the
Exchange Act also address this issue. For example, the Commission will have direct electronic
access to the transaction data and positions pursuant to Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5)(D) 780 and
Rule 13n-4(b)(5). 781 The Commission expects to be able to query and analyze the data as
necessary without imposing an indexing requirement at this time. 782 In addition, Rule 13n-8,
discussed below, requires each SDR to promptly report to the Commission, in a form and
manner acceptable to the Commission, such information as the Commission determines to be
necessary or appropriate for the Commission to perform the duties of the Commission under the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. 783

Controls to Prevent Invalidation (Rule 13n-5(b)(5))
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-5(b)(5) would require every SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce

780

781

See Sections VI.D.1 and VI.D.2 of this release discussing Rules 13n-4(a)(5) and 13n4(b)(5). Rule 13n-4(b)(5) requires each SDR to provide direct electronic access to the
Commission or its designees; “direct electronic access” is defined in Rule 13n-4(a)(5) to
mean access, which shall be in a form and manner acceptable to the Commission, to data
stored by an SDR in an electronic format and updated at the same time as the SDR’s data
is updated so as to provide the Commission with the ability to query or analyze the data
in the same manner that the SDR can query or analyze the data.

782

Although the Commission is not imposing an indexing requirement, SDRs are required
under Regulation SBSR to utilize a transaction ID for each SBS. The transaction ID is
designed to allow the Commission and other relevant persons to link related activity, such
as life cycle events, to the original transaction. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release,
supra note 13 (Rule 901).

from being invalidated or modified through the procedures or operations of the SDR.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Two commenters submitted comments relating to this proposed rule. 784 Both
commenters seemed to agree with this proposal. 785 One commenter stated that an SDR “should
be able to offer life cycle event processing and asset servicing activities” that may lead to “an
update or modification to the records in the SDR,” with the consent of both parties. 786
c.

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-5(b)(5) as
proposed. Rule 13n-5(b)(5) requires every SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent any provision in a valid SBS from being
invalidated or modified through the procedures or operations of the SDR. The terms of SBSs
can be the result of negotiation between the counterparties, and the Commission believes that
these terms should not be modified or invalidated without the full consent of the
counterparties. 787
The Commission agrees with one commenter’s view that an SDR should be able to offer
life cycle event processing and asset servicing activities that may lead to an updating of the
records in the SDR, with the consent of both parties. 788 In such a case, it is not the SDR that is

modifying the SBS, but the parties to the SBS who are doing so (or the parties are submitting
information regarding the SBS that relates to the terms of the original contract); the SDR is
simply updating its records to reflect the changes to the SBS made by the parties to the SBS, or
to reflect life cycle events that have occurred and the parties to the SBS agree should be reflected
in the updated records of the SDR. However, whenever an SDR updates its records, it must
retain the data as it existed prior to the update pursuant to Rule 13n-5(b)(4), which is discussed
above. 789
If the reporting party reports inconsistent data, such as where the reporting party reports
that the SBS is a standard SBS, but also reports a non-standard provision, the SDR can correct
the inconsistency if it gives appropriate notice to both parties. 790 In formulating its policies and
procedures required by Rule 13n-5(b)(5), an SDR may want to consider providing the parties
with notice of the inconsistency as soon as practicable.
6.

Dispute Resolution Procedures (Rule 13n-5(b)(6))
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-5(b)(6) would require every SDR to establish procedures and provide
facilities reasonably designed to effectively resolve disputes over the accuracy of the transaction

789

See Section VI.E.4 of this release discussing Rule 13n-5(b)(4).

790

The Commission believes that an SDR’s policies and procedures would not necessarily
be reasonable if they authorize the SDR to “deem” a user to have effectively consented to
the SDR’s changes if the user merely utilizes the SDR system after such change. At a
minimum, the SDR should inform both parties of the change. The Commission notes that
Rule 905 of Regulation SBSR establishes procedures for correcting errors in data
reported to an SDR. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rule 905).
Additionally, as discussed in Section VI.E.6 of this release, Rule 13n-5(b)(6) requires
SDRs to establish procedures and provide facilities reasonably designed to effectively
resolve disputes over the accuracy of the transaction data and positions that are recorded
in the SDR.

b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Two commenters submitted comments relating to this proposed rule. 792 One commenter
supported this proposed rule, stating that it is a key step in the effort to have accurate data at the
SDR. 793 The commenter stated that a reporting party and a non-reporting party may disagree on
the terms of a reported SBS transaction and the reporting party may refuse to correct the
erroneously reported transaction information. 794 The commenter urged the Commission to
require the SDR to review promptly the disputed data with the parties. 795 The other commenter
stated that it believed that “an SDR should be in a position to identify disputes or unconfirmed
data as part of its process to confirm the data with both parties. However, only the parties to a
transaction can resolve any dispute as to the terms of the trade.” 796 Where a trade comes through
a third party service provider that “act[s] directly as an affirmation, confirmation or verification
platform and already utilizes dispute resolution workflows,” the commenter did “not support a
Proposed Rule that would require that the SDR [build] processes to replicate these services.” 797
The commenter stated that “an SDR can make the quality of the data or disputed trades visible to

In a separate release, the Commission is adopting rules regarding the correction of errors
in SBS information maintained by an SDR in association with requirements under DoddFrank Act Section 763(i). See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rules

c.

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-5(b)(6) as
proposed. Rule 13n-5(b)(6) requires every SDR to establish procedures and provide facilities
reasonably designed to effectively resolve disputes over the accuracy of the transaction data and
positions that are recorded in the SDR. As the Commission explained in the Proposing Release,
the data maintained by an SDR will be used by relevant authorities and counterparties. 799
Parties, therefore, should have the ability to dispute the accuracy of the data maintained by an
SDR regarding their SBSs. SDRs providing the means to resolve disputes should enhance data
quality and integrity.
The Commission agrees with one commenter that only the parties to a dispute can resolve
it, 800 but the Commission believes that SDRs can provide processes to facilitate resolution,
which would improve the quality and accuracy of SBS data. The Commission does not believe
that this requirement mandates that an SDR replicate the services of third party service providers,
such as providing matching platforms. 801 Having both parties verify the SBS data through a
third party service provider prior to submitting it to an SDR will ensure a great deal of accuracy
in the data maintained by the SDR. However, there may be instances where disputes still occur,
such as where a party disagrees with a position reflected in an SDR’s records, where one party
798

DTCC 2, supra note 19.

799

Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77331, supra note 2. In some cases, the data maintained by
the SDR may be considered by the counterparties to be the legal or authoritative record of
the SBS. However, this is due to the consent of the counterparties. Simply reporting an
SBS to an SDR does not affect the legal terms of the SBS. See Section III.A of this
release discussing the service of maintaining legally binding records.

realizes it mistakenly verified a transaction and the other party refuses to submit or verify a
correction, or where a transaction has been amended, but one party refuses to report or verify the
amendment. In such instances, the Commission believes that the SDR should provide a party
with the ability to raise the dispute, and have some sort of process to resolve the dispute. As
with the other SDR Rules, an SDR could rely on a third party service provider to perform the
SDR’s obligation to provide a dispute resolution process. If it does so, in order for such a
process to be “reasonably designed,” the SDR would have to oversee and supervise the
performance of the third party service provider. The Commission agrees with one commenter 802
that to the extent that Rule 13n-5(b)(6) makes disputes visible to regulators, the rule should
incentivize parties to resolve them. In any event, the Commission believes that the rule will
further increase the quality and accuracy of SBS data.

Data Preservation After an SDR Ceases to Do Business (Rule 13n-5(b)(7))
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-5(b)(7) would require an SDR, if it ceases to do business, or ceases to
be registered as an SDR, to continue to preserve, maintain, and make accessible the transaction
data and historical positions required to be collected, maintained, and preserved by Rule 13n-5 in
the manner required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder for the
remainder of the period required by this rule. 803
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission received no comments relating to this proposed rule.
802

See DTCC 2, supra note 19.

803

As noted in the Proposing Release, this proposed requirement was based on Exchange
Act Rule 17a-4(g), 17 CFR 240.17a-4(g), which applies to books and records of brokerdealers. Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77332 n.128, supra note 2.

c.

Final Rule

The Commission is adopting Rule 13n-5(b)(7) as proposed. Rule 13n-5(b)(7) requires an
SDR, if it ceases to do business, or ceases to be registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section
13(n) and the rules and regulations thereunder, to continue to preserve, maintain, and make
accessible the transaction data and historical positions required to be collected, maintained, and
preserved by Rule 13n-5 in the manner required by the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder (including in a place and format that is readily accessible and usable to
the Commission and other persons with authority to access or view such information, in an
electronic format that is non-rewriteable and non-erasable, and in a manner that protects
confidentiality and accuracy) for the remainder of the period required by Rule 13n-5 (i.e., not
less than five years after the applicable SBS expires for transaction data and not less than five
years for historical positions). As the Commission explained in the Proposing Release, given the
importance of the records maintained by an SDR to the functioning of the SBS market, an SDR
ceasing to do business could cause serious disruptions in the market should the information it
maintains becomes unavailable. 804

Plan for Data Preservation (Rule 13n-5(b)(8))

Final Rule

The Commission is adopting Rule 13n-5(b)(8) as proposed. Rule 13n-5(b)(8) requires an
SDR to make and keep current a plan to ensure that the transaction data and positions that are
recorded in the SDR continue to be maintained in accordance with Rule 13n-5(b)(7), which shall
include procedures for transferring the transaction data and positions to the Commission or its
designee (including another registered SDR). 805 As the Commission explained in the Proposing
Release, given the importance of the records maintained by an SDR to the functioning of the
SBS market, if an SDR ceases to do business, the absence of a plan to transfer information could
cause serious disruptions. 806 The Commission expects that an SDR’s plan would establish
procedures and mechanisms so that another entity would be in the position to maintain this
information after the SDR ceases to do business or ceases to be registered pursuant to Exchange
Act Section 13(n) 807 and the rules and regulations thereunder.

Automated Systems (Rule 13n-6)

The Commission proposed Exchange Act Rule 13n-6 to provide standards for SDRs with
regard to their automated systems’ capacity, resiliency, and security. The proposed rule was
designed to be comparable to the standards applicable to SROs, including exchanges and

In addition, Item 45 of Form SDR requires each SDR to attach as an exhibit to its Form

data to the Commission or its designee (including another registered [SDR]).” This item

the SDR’s objective review is performed by an internal department rather than every

in diverse regions of the country, each capable of handling [the commenter’s] entire business.” 813
The commenter stated that it “performs both data center and operational failover tests every
year” and “[d]atacenter recovery tests are performed at least six times a year in various
configurations, and there are more than two dozen operational failover tests each year, ranging
from a single department failover, to an operational recovery involving more than 400 staff.” 814
The commenter believed that “[t]hese capabilities are fundamental to any registration as an
SDR.” 815 The commenter further stated that ‘“[g]iven the importance of SDRs to the regulatory
and systemic risk oversight of the financial markets and the important role they will play in
providing market transparency, a lack of robust resiliency and redundancy in operations should
disqualify an entity from registering as an SDR.” 816
The second commenter suggested that the Commission “take all possible steps to ensure
that identifying information is protected by SDRs and the [Commission].” 817 The third
commenter believed that SDRs, among other entities, should “have proper safeguards and
barriers in place in order to ensure the security of data, prevent cyber-crime and safeguard
against inappropriate access,” and that such entities should “make the appropriate level of
investment to design, implement and continually review their information barriers . . . in order to

important that regulators ensure that the viability and rigor of these information barriers . . . are
reviewed and audited as they are at all other market participants.” 819

Final Rule

After considering the comments received on this proposal, the Commission is not
adopting the more specific requirements of proposed Rule 13n-6(b)(1), 820 but is instead adopting
the core policies and procedures requirement. Thus, final Rule 13n-6 is consistent with, but is
more general and flexible than, proposed Rule 13n-6. Final Rule 13n-6 provides in full that
“[e]very security-based swap data repository, with respect to those systems that support or are
integrally related to the performance of its activities, shall establish, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that its systems provide adequate
levels of capacity, integrity, resiliency, availability, and security.” 821 The Commission is not

procedures and systems in place to address the information barrier and privacy issue.”).

819

ISDA, supra note 19.

820

Rule 13n-6 is being promulgated under Exchange Act Sections 13(n)(4)(B), 13(n)(7)(D),
and 13(n)(9). See 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(4)(B), 78m(n)(7)(D), and 78m(n)(9).

821

Rule 13n-6 is similar to the first sentence in proposed Rule 13n-6(b)(1). As adopted, the
words “integrity” and “availability” have been added. The addition is consistent with,
and captures concepts in, the rule as proposed, which implicitly addressed both integrity
and availability. See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77370, supra note 2 (proposing
requirement that an SDR has policies and procedures that, at a minimum, (i) establish
reasonable current and future capacity estimates; (ii) conduct periodic capacity stress
tests of critical systems to determine such systems’ ability to process transactions in an
accurate, timely, and efficient manner; (iii) develop and implement reasonable procedures
to review and keep current its system development and testing methodology; (iv) review
the vulnerability of its systems and data center computer operations to internal and
external threats, physical hazards, and natural disasters; and (v) establish adequate
contingency and disaster recovery plans). These edits also make Rule 13n-6 more
consistent with Rule 1001(a)(1) of Regulation SCI, 17 CFR 242.1000(a)(1) (requiring
each SCI entity to “establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures
232

adopting proposed Rules 13n-6(b)(2), (3), and (4). 822
The Commission is not adopting Rule 13n-6 as proposed because, after proposing Rule
13n-6, the Commission considered the need for an updated regulatory framework for certain
systems of the U.S. securities trading markets and adopted Regulation Systems Compliance and
Integrity (“Regulation SCI”). 823 Regulation SCI supersedes the Commission’s ARP Policy
Statements and Rule 301(b)(6) of Regulation ATS (with respect to significant-volume ATSs that
trade NMS stocks 824 and non-NMS stocks), on which proposed Rule 13n-6 was largely based.
The Regulation SCI Adopting Release includes a discussion of comment letters addressing the
application of Regulation SCI to SDRs. 825
In light of this development, the Commission believes that Rule 13n-6, as adopted, better
sets an appropriate core framework for the policies and procedures of SDRs with respect to
automated systems. While this framework responds to comments about the application of
Regulation SCI to SDRs and is broadly consistent with Regulation SCI, Rule 13n-6 does not
apply Regulation SCI and its specific obligations to SDRs. 826 In adopting Regulation SCI, the
reasonably designed to ensure that its SCI systems and, for purposes of security
standards, indirect SCI systems, have levels of capacity, integrity, resiliency, availability,
and security, adequate to maintain the SCI entity’s operational capability and promote the
maintenance of fair and orderly markets”).
822

In addition, the Commission is not adopting proposed Rules 13n-6(a), (c), and (d)
because they are not applicable without proposed Rules 13n-6(b)(2), (3), and (4).

823

See Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity, Exchange Act Release No. 73639
(Nov. 19, 2014), 79 FR 72252 (Dec. 5, 2014) (“Regulation SCI Adopting Release”).

Regulation SCI Adopting Release, 79 FR at 72363-4, supra note 823.

826

In preparing their policies and procedures, SDRs may consider whether to incorporate
aspects of Regulation SCI that may be appropriate for their particular implementation of
Rule 13n-6, including where an SDR is related by virtue of its corporate structure to an
entity subject to Regulation SCI.
233

Commission explained that it will “monitor and evaluate the implementation of Regulation SCI,
the risks posed by the systems of other market participants, and the continued evolution of the
securities markets, such that it may consider, in the future, extending the types of requirements in
Regulation SCI to additional categories of market participants.” 827 Consistent with this approach
and in recognition of the importance of SDRs as the primary repositories of SBS trade
information, the Commission may consider the application of any features of Regulation SCI to
SDRs in the future. In addition, to the extent that an SDR may share systems with an SCI entity
(e.g., an affiliated clearing agency), such systems may meet the definition of “indirect SCI
systems” of the SCI entity, as defined in Regulation SCI, and certain provisions of Regulation
SCI may apply. 828
Rule 13n-6 applies to “systems that support or are integrally related to the performance of
[each SDR’s] activities.” 829 This includes automated systems that support or are integrally
related to performing both core and ancillary services, including functions that may be required
by Regulation SBSR, such as public dissemination of SBS information. 830 To the extent that an
SDR uses a third party service provider to perform the SDR’s functions, the SDR’s policies and
procedures required by Rule 13n-6 continue to apply; an SDR cannot absolve itself of its
responsibilities under this rule through the use of a third party service provider.

See Regulation SCI, 17 CFR 242.1000-1007. Rule 1000 of Regulation SCI defines

234

The Commission believes that Rule 13n-6 addresses commenters’ concerns about
operational capabilities and protecting information. 831 With respect to comments suggesting
specific substantive requirements, 832 the Commission believes that a more measured approach is
to adopt a rule that requires SDRs to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to
ensure that they have adequate levels of capacity, integrity, resiliency, availability, and security.
Consistent with the comments, 833 an SDR may want to consider, in developing its policies and
procedures required by Rule 13n-6, whether to include the establishment and maintenance of
multiple redundant systems and data and operations centers in diverse regions of the country, 834
periodic data center and operational failover tests, 835 robust operational capabilities, 836 and
multiple levels of operational redundancy and data security. 837 The Commission also believes
that an SDR’s policies and procedures required by Rule 13n-6 can be “a part of or consistent
with a parent or affiliate entity’s disaster recovery operations.” 838 The Commission further
believes that Rule 13n-6 is consistent with one commenter’s recommendation that SDRs should
“have proper safeguards and barriers in place in order to ensure the security of data, prevent

cyber-crime and safeguard against inappropriate access.” 839 Additionally, the Commission
believes that to comply with Rule 13n-6, SDRs will likely need to “make the appropriate level of
investment to design, implement and continually review their information barriers . . . in order to
protect markets and market participants.” 840
G.

SDR Recordkeeping (Rule 13n-7)

The Commission proposed Rule 13n-7 to specify the books and records requirements
applicable to SDRs. After receiving no comments on this proposal, the Commission is adopting
Rule 13n-7 as proposed, with some technical modifications.
1.

Records to be Made by SDRs (Rule 13n-7(a))
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-7(a) would require every SDR to make and keep current certain
books and records relating to its business.
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission received no comments relating to this proposed rule.
c.

Final Rule

The Commission is adopting Rule 13n-7(a)(1) as proposed. Rule 13n-7(a)(1) requires
every SDR to make and keep current “a record for each office listing, by name or title, each
person at that office who, without delay, can explain the types of records the security-based swap
data repository maintains at that office and the information contained in those records.” The
Commission continues to believe that SDR recordkeeping practices may vary in ways ranging

839

ISDA, supra note 19.

840

ISDA, supra note 19.
236

from format and presentation to the name of a record. 841 Therefore, as explained in the
Proposing Release, the Commission believes that each SDR must be able to promptly explain
how it makes, keeps, and titles its records. 842 To comply with this rule, an SDR may identify
more than one person and list which records each person is able to explain. Because it may be
burdensome for an SDR to keep this record current if it lists each person by name, an SDR may
satisfy this requirement by recording the persons capable of explaining the SDR’s records by
either name or title.
The Commission is also adopting Rule 13n-7(a)(2) as proposed. Rule 13n-7(a)(2)
requires every SDR to make and keep current “a record listing each officer, manager, or person
performing similar functions of the security-based swap data repository responsible for
establishing policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with the
[Exchange] Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.” This rule is intended to assist
securities regulators by identifying individuals responsible for designing an SDR’s compliance
policies and procedures.
The purpose of both Rules 13n-7(a)(1) and 13n-7(a)(2) is to assist the Commission in its
inspection and examination function. 843 These two requirements are based on Exchange Act
Rules 17a-3(a)(21) and (22), respectively, which are applicable to broker-dealers. 844 It is
important for the Commission’s examiners to have the ability to find quickly what records are

procedures of an SDR.
2.

Records to be Preserved by SDRs (Rule 13n-7(b))
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-7(b) would require every SDR to keep and preserve copies of its
documents, keep such documents for a period of not less than five years, the first two in a place
that is immediately available to Commission staff, and promptly furnish such documents to
Commission staff upon request.
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission received no comments relating to this proposed rule.
c.

Final Rule

The Commission is adopting Rule 13n-7(b) as proposed, with one technical modification.
Rule 13n-7(b)(1) requires every SDR to “keep and preserve at least one copy of all documents,
including all documents and policies and procedures required by the [Exchange] Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder, correspondence, memoranda, papers, books, notices, accounts,
and other such records as shall be made or received by it in the course of its business as such.”
Rule 13n-7(b)(2) requires every SDR to “keep all such documents for a period of not less than
five years, the first two years in a place that is immediately available to representatives of the
Commission for inspection and examination.” 845 Rule 13n-7(b)(3) requires every SDR to, “upon

845

The Commission is making a technical modification to Rule 13n-7(b)(2) from the
proposal. As proposed, the rule referred to “the staff of the Commission.” As adopted,
the rule instead refers to “representatives of the Commission” for consistency with other
rules being adopted in this release. See Rule 13n-4(b)(1) and Rule 13n-7(b)(3) (both
referring to “any representative of the Commission”).
238

request of any representative of the Commission, promptly furnish 846 to the possession of such
representative copies of any documents required to be kept and preserved by it pursuant to
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this [rule].”
Rule 13n-7(b) is based on Exchange Act Rule 17a-1, which is the recordkeeping rule for
national securities exchanges, national securities associations, registered clearing agencies, and
the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. 847 As explained in the Proposing Release, Rule
13n-7(b) is intended to set forth the recordkeeping obligation of SDRs and thereby facilitate
implementation of the broad inspection authority given to the Commission in Exchange Act
Section 13(n)(2). 848 This rule includes all electronic documents and correspondence, such as
data dictionaries, e-mails and instant messages, which should be furnished in their original
electronic format.
3.

Recordkeeping After an SDR Ceases to do Business (Rule 13n-7(c))
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-7(c) would require an SDR that ceases doing business, or ceases to be
registered as an SDR, to continue to preserve, maintain, and make accessible the records/data
required to be collected, maintained, and preserved by Rule 13n-7 in the manner required by this
846

For purposes of Rule 13n-7(b)(3), the Commission interprets the term “promptly” to
mean making reasonable efforts to produce records that are requested by Commission
representatives during an examination without delay. The Commission believes that in
many cases, an SDR could, and therefore will be required to, furnish records immediately
or within a few hours of a request. The Commission expects that only in unusual
circumstances would an SDR be permitted to delay furnishing records for more than 24
hours. Accord Registration of Municipal Advisors, Exchange Act Release No. 70462
(Sept. 20, 2013), 78 FR 67468, 67578-67579 n.1347 (Nov. 12, 2013) (interpreting the

b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission received no comments relating to this proposed rule.
c.

Final Rule

The Commission is adopting Rule 13n-7(c) as proposed, with a technical modification.
Rule 13n-7(c) requires an SDR that ceases doing business, or ceases to be registered pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 13(n) and the rules and regulations thereunder, to continue to preserve,
maintain, and make accessible the records and data 850 required to be collected, maintained, and
preserved by Rule 13n-7 in the manner required by this rule and for the remainder of the period
required by this rule. This requirement is intended to allow Commission representatives to
perform effective inspections and examinations of an SDR pursuant to Exchange Act Section
13(n)(2). 851 In addition, the Commission notes that, as discussed in Section VI.B of this release
regarding Rule 13n-2, an SDR that ceases to exist or do business as an SDR is required to file a
withdrawal from registration on Form SDR pursuant to Rule 13n-2(b) and designate on Item 12
of Form SDR a custodian of books and records.
An SDR may wish to consider establishing contingency plans so that another entity will
be in the position to maintain the SDR’s records and data after the SDR ceases to do business.
The Commission notes that the requirement in Rule 13n-5(b)(8) for an SDR to make and keep
current a plan to ensure that the SDR’s transaction data and positions are maintained after it
849

This requirement is based on Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(g), 17 CFR 240.17a-4(g), which
applies to books and records of broker-dealers.

850

The Commission is making a technical amendment to Rule 13n-7(c) from the proposal.
As proposed, the rule referred to “records/data.” The rule being adopted refers to
“records and data” for clarity.

851

15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(2); see also Rule 13n-4(b)(1) (implementing same requirement).
240

ceases doing business or ceases to be registered 852 does not expressly extend to a plan for
maintaining all of the records and data required to be maintained pursuant to Rule 13n-7, but that
plan could also include such records and data.
4.

Applicability (Rule 13n-7(d))
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-7(d) provided that Rule 13n-7 “does not apply to data collected and
maintained pursuant to Rule 13n-5.”
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission received no comments relating to this proposed rule.
c.

Final Rule

The Commission is adopting Rule 13n-7(d) as proposed, with a technical modification.
Rule 13n-7(d) states that Rule 13n-7 “does not apply to transaction data and positions collected
and maintained pursuant to Rule 13n-5 (§ 240.13n-5).” 853 As explained in the Proposing
Release, the purpose of this rule is to clarify that the requirements in Rule 13n-7 are designed to
capture those records of an SDR other than the transaction data, positions, and market data that
852

See Section VI.E.8 of this release discussing Rule 13n-5(b)(8).

853

The Commission is making a technical modification to Rule 13n-7(d) from the proposal,
changing “data” to “transaction data and positions.” This is to clarify that the data that
Rule 13n-7 does not apply to is limited to transaction data and positions, both of which
are required to be maintained in accordance with Rule 13n-5(b)(4). Rule 13n-7 applies to
other information that may be created pursuant to Rule 13n-5, but which is not required
to be maintained pursuant to Rule 13n-5(b)(4). For example, in order to assure itself of
compliance with Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iv), an SDR could run tests to determine how long it
takes for it to record transaction data that it receives. Data from such test would be
required to be retained pursuant to Rule 13n-7, not Rule 13n-5(b)(4). The Commission
clearly contemplated this distinction in the Proposing Release when it stated that Rule
13n-7(d) was proposed to clarify that Rule 13n-7 was designed to capture those records
other than the data required to be maintained in accordance with proposed Rule 13n-5.
See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77338, supra note 2.
241

would be required to be maintained in accordance with Rule 13n-5, as discussed in Section VI.E
of this release. 854 The requirements of Rule 13n-7 do apply to records that an SDR creates using
the data required to be maintained in accordance with Rule 13n-5, such as aggregate reports.
H.

Reports to be Provided to the Commission (Rule 13n-8)

The Commission proposed Rule 13n-8 to specify certain reports that an SDR would be
required to provide to the Commission. After considering the two comments received on this
proposal, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-8 as proposed.
1.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-8 would require every SDR to “promptly report to the Commission,
in a form and manner acceptable to the Commission, such information as the Commission
determines to be necessary or appropriate for the Commission to perform the duties of the
Commission under the [Exchange] Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.” This proposed
rule was designed to provide the Commission with the necessary information for it to fulfill its
regulatory duties.
2.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Two commenters submitted comments relating to this proposed rule. 855 One commenter
stated that it “currently makes information available directly to regulators, having created a web
portal for access to scheduled reports, and providing extracts from [the trade repository’s]
database based on parameters set by regulators . . . . Through this system, [the commenter]
854

Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77338, supra note 2.

855

See DTCC 2, supra note 19; Barnard, supra note 19. In addition, one commenter to the
Temporary Rule Release suggested that the Commission affirmatively state that it intends
to keep information furnished to the Commission pursuant to the rules in that release,
which could be information similar to that reported to the Commission under Rule 13n-8,
confidential under FOIA or to seek a legislative solution. See Deutsche Temp Rule,
supra note 28.
242

expects to be able to offer acceptable access to the Commission.”856 The other commenter
recommended that reports “be standardized and use a common terminology.” 857
3.

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-8 as proposed.
Rule 13n-8 requires every SDR to “promptly report to the Commission, in a form and manner
acceptable to the Commission, such information as the Commission determines to be necessary
or appropriate for the Commission to perform the duties of the Commission under the
[Exchange] Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.” This requirement provides flexibility
to the Commission to obtain information on a case-by-case basis and in connection with
fulfilling its examination function. 858
Under Rule 13n-8, the Commission may request specific reports related to the final SDR
Rules. 859 For example, in the Proposing Release, the Commission stated that it may request a

856

DTCC 2, supra note 19.

857

Barnard, supra note 19.

858

One commenter describes its approach to addressing the proposed rule’s requirements.
See DTCC 2, supra note 19. With respect to the commenter to the Temporary Rule
Release suggesting that the Commission affirmatively state that it intends to keep
information furnished pursuant to the rules in that release confidential under FOIA or to
seek a legislative solution, the Commission anticipates that it will keep reported data that
SDRs submit to the Commission (via Rule 13n-8 or any other means) confidential,
subject to the provisions of applicable law. See Deutsche Temp Rule, supra note 28.
Pursuant to Commission rules, confidential treatment can be sought for information
submitted to the Commission. See 17 CFR 200.83 (regarding confidential treatment
procedures under FOIA). The Commission does not intend to affirmatively seek any
legislative action to protect further such information. The commenter is not precluded
from doing so on its own initiative.

859

In a separate release, the Commission is adopting a rule requiring an SDR to provide the
Commission, upon request, information or reports related to the timeliness, accuracy, and
completeness of data reported to the SDR. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release,
supra note 13 (Rule 907(e)).
243

report on the number of complaints an SDR has received pertaining to data integrity. 860 In
addition, the Commission may request other reports in the future based upon, for example,
developments in the SBS markets or a newly identified need for particular SBS information. The
Commission expects that an SDR will be able to promptly report any information in its
possession to the Commission pursuant to Rule 13n-8. If the report involves provision of SBS
data, then the Commission could require an SDR to adhere to any formats and taxonomies
required pursuant to Rule 13n-4(b)(5). 861 This approach is consistent with one commenter’s
recommendation that reports “be standardized and use common terminology.” 862

Privacy Requirements (Rule 13n-9)

Proposed Rule 13n-9 set forth requirements to implement an SDR’s statutory duty to
“maintain the privacy of any and all security-based swap transaction information that the [SDR]
receives from a security-based swap dealer, counterparty, or any other registered entity.” 863
After considering the comments received on the proposal, the Commission is adopting the rule as
proposed.

See Section VI.D.2.c.ii of this release discussing anticipated Commission proposal
pursuant to Rule 13n-4(b)(5). With regard to other types of reports, the Commission will
seek to work with SDRs to develop the form and the manner for the SDRs to provide the
Commission with the information it needs, while seeking to minimize the SDRs’ burdens.

Such policies and procedures would be required to include, but not be limited to, policies and
procedures to protect the privacy of any and all SBS transaction information that the SDR shares
with affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties. 864 The proposed rule would also require each SDR
to establish and maintain safeguards, policies, and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the
misappropriation or misuse of (i) any confidential information received by the SDR; (ii) material,
nonpublic information; and/or (iii) intellectual property, by the SDR or any person associated
with the SDR for their personal benefit or the benefit of others. 865 Such safeguards, policies, and
procedures would be required to address, without limitation, (1) limiting access to such
confidential information, material, nonpublic information, and intellectual property, (2) standards
pertaining to the trading by persons associated with the SDR for their personal benefit or the
benefit of others, and (3) adequate oversight to ensure compliance of this provision. 866

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Five commenters submitted comments relating to this proposed rule. 867 Two of the
commenters supported the proposal. 868 One commenter “fully support[ed] the Commission’s
efforts to protect the privacy of any and all SBS transaction information received by an SDR”
and believed that “no communication of data (other than to, or as required by, applicable

trading activity of a counterparty should be permitted without the consent of that
counterparty.” 869 The commenter suggested that the definition of “personally identifiable
information” in proposed Rule 13n-9(a)(6) be limited to information that is not otherwise
disclosed or made available to the public. 870 In making its suggestion, the commenter stated that
“[b]ecause much of the information utilized to on-board participants or to identify counterparties
to an [SBS] will be publicly available through websites issuing legal entity identifiers or similar
identifiers, this information should not be considered confidential simply because it is required
by an [SDR].” 871
Another commenter also “agree[d] with the Commission’s concerns about privacy of
SBS data” and “strongly support[ed] imposing privacy requirements on [SDRs].” 872
Specifically, the commenter supported the Commission’s proposed requirements related to
policies and procedures reasonably designed to protect the privacy of SBS transaction
information and noted that “such privacy protections will ensure that market participants utilize
the services of registered [SDRs] with confidence.” 873 The commenter made a number of
suggestions. First, the commenter suggested that the Commission add safeguards related to
“confidentiality of trading positions” to the Commission’s proposed rule because disclosure of

position information could reveal market participants’ customized and proprietary investment
strategies in which they invest heavily and “which form the foundation of their businesses.” 874
Second, the commenter suggested that the Commission expand its proposed rules to include a
standard of care that would require SDRs to adopt policies and procedures to ensure that any
confidential information received will be used solely for the purpose of fulfilling regulatory
obligations. 875 Third, the commenter suggested that the Commission require SDRs to adopt
policies and procedures to limit access to confidential information to directors, officers,
employees, agents, and representatives who need to know such information in order to fulfill
regulatory obligations. 876 The commenter noted that “[t]hose policies and procedures should
also have a mechanism in place for all [SDR representatives] to be informed of, and required to
follow, the [SDR’s] policies and procedures related to privacy of information received.” 877 The
commenter believed that such persons should be liable for any breach of an SDR’s policies and
procedures related to privacy of information. 878
Another commenter suggested that “where trading counterparties have given [written
authorizations] in favor of a third party service provider to access their [SBS transaction
information], there is no need to have the third party service provider observe the [SDR’s]
privacy policies and procedures.” 879 The commenter stated that “if the counterparties to a trade

restrict or limit such use through privacy policies and procedures when the owners of the
information have provided appropriate consents and authorizations.” 880
Consistent with the commenters supporting proposed Rule 13n-9, a commenter to the
Temporary Rule Release stated that “market participants have legitimate interests in the
protection of their confidential and identifying financial information.” 881 In this regard, the
commenter suggested that the Commission “take all possible steps to ensure that identifying
information is protected by SDRs and the [Commission]” and that the Commission use its
statutory authority under Dodd-Frank Act Section 763 to “impose strict requirements on the
handling, disclosure and use by the SDRs of identifying information and on the operational and
technological measures that must be employed by SDRs to protect such information from
disclosure (including by way of unauthorized access).” 882
Another commenter believed that “non-bank entities,” including SDRs, should “make the
appropriate level of investment to design, implement and continually review their . . . data
privacy policies and procedures in order to protect markets and market participants.” 883 The

would “be appropriate and helpful to the market if the SEC can clarify in the final rule

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-9 as proposed,
with two minor modifications. 885 Specifically, Rule 13n-9(b)(1) requires each SDR to establish,
maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to protect the privacy
of any and all SBS transaction information that the SDR receives from an SBS dealer,
counterparty, or any registered entity. The rule further provides that such policies and
procedures shall include, but are not limited to, policies and procedures to protect the privacy of
any and all SBS transaction information that the SDR shares with affiliates 886 and nonaffiliated
third parties. 887 As mentioned above, the Exchange Act 888 requires, and commenters supported,
the Commission’s imposition of privacy requirements on SDRs.889
Additionally, Rule 13n-9(b)(2) requires each SDR to establish and maintain safeguards,

policies, and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misappropriation or misuse, directly
or indirectly, of: (1) any confidential information received by the SDR, including, but not limited
to, trade data, position data, and any nonpublic personal information 890 about a market
participant 891 or any of its customers; (2) material, nonpublic information; and/or (3) intellectual
property, such as trading strategies or portfolio positions, by the SDR or any person associated
with the SDR 892 for their personal benefit or the benefit of others. Such safeguards, policies, and
procedures shall address, without limitation, (1) limiting access to such confidential information,
material, nonpublic information, and intellectual property, (2) standards pertaining to the trading
by persons associated with the SDR for their personal benefit or the benefit of others, and (3)
adequate oversight to ensure compliance with Rule 13n-9(b)(2). 893 As stated in the Proposing
890

In response to one commenter’s suggestion, the Commission is revising the definition of
“nonpublic personal information” from the proposal to mean (1) personally identifiable
information that is not publicly available information and (2) any list, description, or
other grouping of market participants (and publicly available information pertaining to
them) that is derived using personally identifiable information that is not publicly
available information. See Rule 13n-9(a)(5); DTCC 5, supra note 19 (suggesting limiting
the applicability of Rule 13n-9 to “personally identifiable information” that is not
otherwise disclosed or made available to the public “[b]ecause much of the information
utilized to on-board participants or to identify counterparties to an [SBS] will be publicly
available through websites issuing legal entity identifiers or similar identifiers, this
information should not be considered confidential simply because it is required by an
[SDR]”). This revision, which limits personally identifiable information to not publicly
available information, is consistent with the definition of “nonpublic personal
information” in Regulation SP, 17 CFR 248.3(t). The term “personally identifiable
information” is defined as any information (i) a market participant provides to an SDR to
obtain service from the SDR, (ii) about a market participant resulting from any
transaction involving a service between the SDR and the market participant, or (iii) the
SDR obtains about a market participant in connection with providing a service to that
market participant. See Rule 13n-9(a)(6).

Release, Rule 13n-9(b)(2) incorporates current requirements regarding the treatment of
proprietary information of clearing members, which are contained in exemptive orders issued to
SBS clearing agencies, 894 and draws from Exchange Act Section 15(g), which requires brokerdealers to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information by such broker or dealer or any person
associated with such broker or dealer. 895
The Commission anticipates that as a central recordkeeper of SBS transactions, each
SDR will receive proprietary and highly sensitive information, which could disclose, for
instance, a market participant’s trade information, trading strategy, or nonpublic personal

information. 896 Rule 13n-9 is designed to ensure that an SDR has reasonable safeguards,
policies, and procedures in place to protect such information from being misappropriated or
misused by the SDR or any person associated with the SDR. The Commission agrees with one
commenter’s view that “market participants have legitimate interests in the protection of their
confidential and identifying financial information,” and Rule 13n-9 sets forth requirements
sufficient to protect such information from disclosure, as the commenter suggested. 897
The Commission also believes that as part of an SDR’s responsibility to have adequate
oversight to ensure compliance with Rule 13n-9, an SDR’s governance arrangements and
organizational structure should have adequate internal controls to protect against
misappropriation or misuse of a market participant’s trade information, trading strategy, or
nonpublic personal information. 898 For instance, an SDR could limit access to the proprietary
and sensitive information by creating informational, technological, and physical barriers.
Consistent with one commenter’s suggestion, 899 an SDR could also limit access to the data that it
maintains to only those officers, directors, employees, and agents who need to know the data to
perform their job responsibilities, including responsibilities to fulfill the SDR’s regulatory
obligations. An SDR may want to consider limiting such access to data only to the extent that
such access is justified based on the particular job responsibilities of the officers, directors,
employees, or agents. In preventing the misappropriation or misuse of confidential information,
material, nonpublic information, and intellectual property pursuant to Rule 13n-9(b)(2), an SDR

could have controls to prevent unauthorized or unintentional access to its data. An SDR may
want to consider holding its officers, directors, employees, and agents contractually liable for a
breach of its privacy policies and procedures, as suggested by one commenter. 900 In order for an
SDR to enforce effectively its written policies and procedures to protect the privacy of SBS
transaction information, it is reasonable to expect that the SDR must, as one commenter noted, 901
properly convey these policies and procedures to all those subject to its privacy requirements.
Additionally, in establishing standards pertaining to the trading by persons associated
with an SDR in accordance with Rule 13n-9(b)(2), the SDR should consider restricting the
trading activities of individuals who have access to proprietary or sensitive information
maintained by the SDR or implementing firm-wide restrictions on trading certain SBSs, as well
as underlying or related investment instruments. 902 Such restrictions could include, for example,
a pre-trade clearance requirement. An SDR should also have systems in place to prevent and
detect insider trading by the SDR or persons associated with the SDR. Such systems could
include a mechanism to monitor such persons’ access to the SDR’s data, their trading activities,
and their e-mails. 903
The Commission believes that to the extent that an SDR or any person associated with

the SDR shares information with the SDR’s affiliate or a nonaffiliated third party, the SDR’s
policies and procedures pursuant to Rule 13n-9(b)(1) should be reasonably designed to protect
the privacy of the information shared. 904 One option that an SDR could choose to comply with
this requirement would be to require the affiliate or nonaffiliated party to consent to being
subject to the SDR’s privacy policies and procedures as a condition of receiving any sensitive
information from the SDR. 905
Consistent with one commenter’s view, the Commission agrees that an SDR will likely
need to make an appropriate level of investment to design, implement, and periodically review
its privacy policies and procedures “in order to protect markets and market participants,” 906 but
that an SDR should have some flexibility to develop reasonable policies and procedures to
protect the privacy of the SBS transaction information that the SDR receives. One approach, as
one commenter suggested, 907 may be for an SDR’s policies and procedures to require consent of
counterparties prior to communication of the SBS transaction information to an SDR’s affiliate
or a nonaffiliated third party. 908 An SDR may, however, develop other reasonable policies and

The Commission notes that CFTC Rule 49.17(e) permits a third party service provider to
access swap data maintained by a swap data repository on the condition that both the
swap data repository and the provider have strict confidentiality procedures that protect
data and information from proper disclosure and that they execute a “confidentiality
agreement.” See 17 CFR 49.17(e).

procedures to protect the privacy of the SBS transaction information.
With respect to one commenter’s suggestion that the Commission add safeguards related
to “confidentiality of trading positions,” 909 the Commission believes that its final rule broadly
covers such safeguards. Although not explicitly stated in Rule 13n-9, the Commission also
believes that its definitions of “nonpublic personal information” 910 and “personally identifiable
information” 911 overlap significantly with the information that the commenter recommended the
rule to explicitly cover. 912 Certain information, however, will be subject to public dissemination
under Regulation SBSR. 913 The commenter further suggested that SDRs should be permitted to
use confidential information solely to fulfill their regulatory obligations, 914 but the Commission
does not believe that it is necessary or appropriate to impose such a narrow restriction on SDRs.
It could, for example, be in the public interest for SDRs to use transaction-specific confidential
SBS data to generate aggregated reports for the public even though such reports are not
mandated. However, any such reports must be sufficiently anonymized so that the trading
positions or identities of market participants, or group of market participants, cannot be derived
from the reports.

One commenter suggested that a third party service provider should not be required to
observe an SDR’s privacy policies and procedures if such third party service provider has
received written authorization from an SBS counterparty to access its SBS transaction
information. 915 The Commission believes that an SDR’s obligation to provide fair, open, and not
unreasonably discriminatory participation to third party service providers 916 would prohibit an
SDR from unreasonably imposing its privacy policies and procedures on third party service
providers. The Commission also believes that, generally, a third party service provider, acting as
an agent for a counterparty, should be given the same rights to access SBS transaction
information as the counterparty for which it is acting as an agent. To the extent that the
counterparties to a transaction reach a confidentiality agreement between themselves limiting the
information that can be provided to their agents, it is up to the parties to ensure that the
authorizations they provide to the SDR are appropriately limited. 917
With respect to one commenter’s view that regulators should “ensure that the viability
and rigor of [an SDR’s] privacy policies are reviewed and audited as they are at all other market
participants,” 918 the Commission contemplates that its review of an SDR’s privacy policies and

915

See TriOptima, supra note 19 (stating that “if the counterparties to a trade authorize the
third party service provider to use their information, an [SDR] should not be able to

information have provided appropriate consents and authorizations”).

916

See Section VI.D.3.a of this release discussing fair, open, and not unreasonably
discriminatory access.

917

To the extent that a transaction is executed anonymously on an SB SEF or exchange,
when the counterparties do not know each other’s identity or other reported information
(e.g., the trader ID), the SDR’s policies and procedures under Rule 13n-9(b) must not
allow either counterparty to access this information relating to the other counterparty.

918

256

procedures will be sufficient. 919 As a general matter, the Commission will review an SDR’s
privacy policies and procedures for compliance with the law in a manner similar to reviews of
other registrants’ privacy policies and procedures. For example, an SDR is required to file, as
exhibits to Form SDR, its policies and procedures to protect the privacy of any and all SBS
transaction information that the SDR receives from a market participant or any registered
entity. 920 These policies and procedures are subject to the Commission’s review. As discussed
in Section VI.A.2 of this release, the Commission will review an SDR’s application for
registration on Form SDR in determining whether the SDR is able to comply with the federal
securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Commission will also review an
SDR’s comprehensive annual amendment on Form SDR in determining whether the SDR
continues to be in compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Additionally, an SDR (including its privacy policies and procedures) are subject to
inspection and examination by any representative of the Commission. 921 In addition, an SDR’s
CCO is required to review the compliance of its policies and procedures at least on an annual
basis and include a description of such compliance as well as the SDR’s enforcement of its
policies and procedures in the SDR’s annual compliance report that is filed with the
Commission.922

919

To the extent that the Commission addresses other market participants’ privacy policies
and procedures, it will do so in separate releases pertaining specifically to those market
participants.

Disclosure Requirements (Rule 13n-10)
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-10 would require each SDR to provide a disclosure document to each
market participant prior to accepting any SBS data from the market participant or upon the
market participant’s request. The disclosure document would include specific information
designed to enable a market participant to identify and evaluate the risks and costs associated
with using the SDR’s services.
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Two commenters submitted comments relating to this proposed rule. 923 One commenter
agreed with proposed Rule 13n-10(b)(8), which would require disclosure of an SDR’s updated
schedule of any dues; unbundled prices, rates, or other fees for all of its services, including any
ancillary services; any discounts or rebates offered; and the criteria to benefit from such
discounts or rebates. 924 In supporting the Commission’s proposed rule, another commenter
“recognize[d] the importance of providing market participants with disclosure documents
outlining the SDR’s policies regarding member participant criteria and the safeguarding and
privacy of data submitted to the SDR.” 925

efficiency, promote standardization, and foster competition. 926 Specifically, the rule provides
that before accepting any SBS data from a market participant 927 or upon a market participant’s
request, each SDR must furnish to the market participant a disclosure document that contains the
following written information, which must reasonably enable the market participant to identify
and evaluate accurately the risks and costs associated with using the SDR’s services: (1) the
SDR’s criteria for providing others with access to services offered and data maintained by the
SDR, (2) the SDR’s criteria for those seeking to connect to or link with the SDR, (3) a
description of the SDR’s policies and procedures regarding its safeguarding of data and
operational reliability, as described in Rule 13n-6, (4) a description of the SDR’s policies and
procedures reasonably designed to protect the privacy of any and all SBS transaction information
that the SDR receives from an SBS dealer, counterparty, or any registered entity, as described in
Rule 13n-9(b)(1), (5) a description of the SDR’s policies and procedures regarding its noncommercial and/or commercial use of the SBS transaction information that it receives from a
market participant, any registered entity, or any other person, (6) a description of the SDR’s
dispute resolution procedures involving market participants, as described in Rule 13n-5(b)(6), (7)
a description of all the SDR’s services, including any ancillary services, (8) the SDR’s updated
schedule of any dues; unbundled prices, rates, or other fees for all of its services, including any
ancillary services; any discounts or rebates offered; and the criteria to benefit from such
discounts or rebates, and (9) a description of the SDR’s governance arrangements. 928
As stated in the Proposing Release, these disclosure requirements are intended to promote

competition and foster transparency regarding SDRs’ services by enabling market participants to
identify the range of services that each SDR offers and to evaluate the risks and costs associated
with using such services. 929 The Commission also believes that transparency regarding SDRs’
services is particularly important in light of the complexity of OTC derivatives products and their
markets, and that greater service transparency could improve market participants’ confidence in
an SDR and result in greater use of the SDR, which would ultimately increase market efficiency.

Chief Compliance Officer of Each SDR; Compliance Reports and Financial
Reports (Rule 13n-11)

Proposed Rule 13n-11 set forth the requirements for an SDR’s CCO, annual compliance
reports, and financial reports. The Commission is adopting the rule substantially as proposed
with changes in response to comments.
1.

In General (Rule 13n-11(a))
a.

Proposed Rule

To implement the statutory requirement for each SDR to designate an individual to serve
as a CCO, 930 the Commission proposed Rule 13n-11(a), which would require each SDR to
identify on Form SDR a person who has been designated by the board to serve as a CCO of the
SDR. In addition, to promote the independence and effectiveness of the CCO, the proposed rule
would require that the compensation and removal of the CCO be approved by a majority of the
SDR’s board. 931

929

Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77340, supra note 2. See also Barnard, supra note 19
(believing that the disclosure requirement in Rule 13n-10(b)(8) would formalize “the
market practice and ensure that informed decisions were being made”).

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Two commenters submitted comments relating to this proposed rule. 932 Specifically, one
commenter agreed that “[w]ith respect to compensation and termination of the CCO, the
Proposed Rules appropriately assign authority over those matters to the board, rather than
management,” but believed that “[t]he rules should go one step further and confer that authority
upon the independent board members.” 933 Additionally, the commenter suggested that “the
[SDR Rules] should preclude the General Counsel or a member of that office from serving as
CCO, since those attorneys owe a duty of loyalty to the SDR itself that may not be compatible
with the watchdog function of the CCO.” 934 The commenter also suggested “[c]ompetency
standards to ensure that CCOs have the background and skills necessary to fulfill their
responsibilities.” 935 The commenter further suggested requiring a group of affiliated or
controlled entities to appoint the CCO. 936
Another commenter fully supported the intent of proposed Rule 13n-11, but also
suggested that the Commission “restrict the CCO from serving as the General Counsel or other
attorney within the legal department of the SDR.” 937 The commenter stated that the CCO’s
remuneration must be designed so as to avoid potential conflicts of interest with his compliance

authority and sole responsibility to appoint or remove the CCO, or to materially change its duties
and responsibilities[ ] only vests with the independent public directors or ‘Independent
Perspective’ . . . and not the full board.” 939
c.

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-11(a) as
proposed, with one modification. Rule 13n-11(a) requires that (1) each SDR identify on Form
SDR a person who has been designated by the board to serve as a CCO of the SDR and (2) the
compensation and removal of the CCO be approved by a majority of the SDR’s board. 940 The
Commission is revising the rule from the proposal to require the appointment of the CCO to be
approved by the majority of the SDR’s board. 941
In the Proposing Release, the Commission asked whether there are other measures that
would further enhance a CCO’s independence and effectiveness that should be prescribed in a
rule. 942 Two commenters suggested that the Commission require the CCO’s appointment,
removal, or compensation be approved by independent board members or “independent public

939

CCO’s independence and possibly mitigate the Commission’s need to promulgate
additional measures to adequately protect CCOs from undue influence or coercion).

940

See Barnard, supra note 19 (supporting the CCO’s compensation to be specifically
designed to avoid potential conflicts of interest with the CCO’s compliance role).

941

The Commission is also revising the heading of Rule 13n-11 from the proposal to
describe the scope of the rule more accurately. The proposed heading was “Designation
of chief compliance officer of security-based swap data repository.” As revised, the
heading is broader: “Chief compliance officer of security-based swap data repository;
compliance reports and financial reports.”

directors.” 943 The Commission has determined not to adopt such a requirement at this time
because, as discussed in Section VI.D.3.b.iii of this release, the Commission is not requiring
SDRs to have independent directors. 944 Based in part on these comments, however, the
Commission believes that requiring the appointment of the CCO to be approved by a majority of
the SDR’s board would be another measure to enhance the CCO’s independence and
effectiveness. The Commission notes that the requirement that the appointment of the CCO
must be approved by a majority of the SDR’s board is consistent with the requirement that the
designation of CCOs at investment companies must be approved by the board of directors. 945
One commenter suggested requiring a group of affiliated or controlled entities to appoint the
CCO. 946 The Commission believes that this suggestion contravenes an SDR’s statutory
requirement to designate the CCO. 947
The Commission is concerned that an SDR’s commercial interests might discourage its
CCO from making forthright disclosure to the board or senior officer about any compliance
failures. 948 The Commission believes that to mitigate this potential conflict of interest, an SDR’s
943

See Better Markets 1, supra note 19 (discussing independent board members); Barnard,
supra note 19 (discussing independent public directors); see also Better Markets 3, supra
note 19.

944

To the extent that an SDR has independent board members or independent public
directors, the SDR may want to consider requiring the appointment, removal, or
compensation of the CCO be approved by the majority of independent board members or
independent public directors in addition to the majority of the board.

945

See Rule 38a-1(a)(4)(i) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment
Company Act”), 17 CFR 270.38a-1(a)(4)(i). The Commission also notes that CFTC Rule
49.22(c) requires the appointment, compensation, and removal of a CCO to be approved
by either a swap data repository’s board or senior officer. See 17 CFR 49.22(c).

CCO should be independent from its management so as not to be conflicted in reporting or
addressing any compliance failures. Accordingly, as discussed in Section VI.J.3 below, each
CCO of an SDR is required to report directly to the board or its senior officer, 949 but only the
board is able to approve the CCO’s appointment, remove the CCO from his or her
responsibilities, and approve the CCO’s compensation.
Rule 13n-11(a) is intended to promote a CCO’s independence and effectiveness. The
Commission is not extending the applicability of this rule to an SDR’s senior officer because the
Commission believes that this may unnecessarily create conflicts of interest for the CCO,
particularly if the CCO is subsequently responsible for reviewing the senior officer’s compliance
with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
In promoting a CCO’s independence and effectiveness, the Commission does not believe
that it is necessary to adopt, as two commenters suggested, 950 a rule prohibiting a CCO from
being a member of the SDR’s legal department or from serving as the SDR’s general counsel.
To the extent that this poses a potential or existing conflict of interest, the Commission believes
that an SDR’s written policies and procedures can be designed to adequately identify and
mitigate any associated costs. 951
949

See Exchange Act Section 13(n)(6)(B)(i), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(6)(B)(i).

950

See Barnard, supra note 19 (suggesting that the Commission “restrict the CCO from
serving as the General Counsel or other attorney within the legal department of the
SDR”); Better Markets 1, supra note 19 (suggesting that “the [SDR Rules] should
preclude the General Counsel or a member of that office from serving as CCO, since
those attorneys owe a duty of loyalty to the SDR itself that may not be compatible with
the watchdog function of the CCO”).

951

As discussed in Section VI.D.3.c of this release, Rule 13n-4(c)(3)(i) requires each SDR to
establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
identify and mitigate potential and existing conflicts of interest in the SDR’s decisionmaking process on an ongoing basis.
264

With respect to one commenter’s suggestion that there should be “[c]ompetency
standards to ensure that CCOs have the background and skills necessary to fulfill their
responsibilities,” 952 the Commission notes that while it is not requiring such standards, Form
SDR requires an SDR to provide a brief account of the CCO’s prior business experience and
business affiliations in the securities industry or derivatives industry. 953 In addition, as discussed
above, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-4(c)(2)(iv) to require an SDR to establish,
maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the
SDR’s senior management and each member of the board or committee that has the authority to
act on behalf of the board possess requisite skills and expertise to fulfill their responsibilities in
the management and governance of the SDR, have a clear understanding of their responsibilities,
and exercise sound judgment about the SDR’s affairs. 954 To the extent that a CCO is considered
to be in senior management of an SDR, Rule 13n-4(c)(2)(iv) applies to the CCO, but even if the
CCO is not in senior management, the Commission does not believe that it is necessary to
prescribe competency standards for CCOs by rule, in part because it is most likely that an SDR
already has business incentives to retain a competent CCO in light of the SDR’s exposure to
liability if its CCO fails to comply with his or her statutory and regulatory responsibilities.
Additionally, the Commission believes that an SDR will be in a better position to determine what
its own requirements and specific needs are with respect to a CCO’s background and skills, both
of which may change as the SBS market evolves.

Definitions (Rule 13n-11(b))
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-11(b) defined the following terms: “affiliate,” “board,” “director,”
“EDGAR Filer Manual,” “material change,” “material compliance matter,” and “tag.”
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission received no comments relating to the proposed definitions.
c.

Final Rule

The Commission is adopting Rule 13n-11(b) substantially as proposed, with several
modifications. Specifically, the Commission is adopting the definitions of “board,” “director,”
“EDGAR Filer Manual,” “material change,” and “material compliance matter” as proposed.
However, the Commission is not adopting the definition of “affiliate” because the term is not
used in the final rule. To conform with adopted Rule 13n-11(f), as discussed below, the
Commission is adding the definitions of “Interactive Data Financial Report” and “official filing,”
both of which have the same meaning as set forth in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T, which sets forth
the standards for electronic filing with the Commission. 955 For consistency, the Commission is
revising the definition of “tag” (including the term “tagged”) from the proposal to have the same
meaning as set forth in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T. 956
Moreover, the Commission is adopting the definition of “senior officer” to mean “the
chief executive officer or other equivalent officer.” 957 Proposed Rule 13n-11 referenced the
955

See Rules 13n-11(b)(4) and (b)(7). The terms “Interactive Data Financial Report” and
“official filing” are used in new Rule 407 of Regulation S-T, as discussed in Section
VI.J.5.c of this release.

956

See Rule 13n-11(b)(9).

957

See Rule 13n-11(b)(8). The term “senior officer” is used in Rules 13n-11(c)(1) and
(c)(3), as discussed in Section VI.J.3 of this release. This definition is consistent with the
266

“chief executive officer” in lieu of the statutory references to the “senior officer.” 958 As adopted,
Rule 13n-11 tracks the statutory references to “senior officer” and defines “senior officer” to
include an SDR’s CEO.
3.

Enumerated Duties of Chief Compliance Officer (Rule 13n-11(c))
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 13n-11(c) incorporated the CCO’s duties that are set forth in Exchange
Act Section 13(n)(6). 959 Proposed Rule 13n-11(c) would require a CCO to (1) report directly to
the board or to the SDR’s CEO, (2) review the SDR’s compliance with respect to its statutory
and regulatory requirements and core principles, (3) in consultation with the board or the SDR’s
CEO, resolve any conflicts of interest that may arise, (4) be responsible for administering each
policy and procedure that is required to be established pursuant to Exchange Act Section 13 and
the rules and regulations thereunder, (5) ensure compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder relating to SBSs, (6) establish procedures for the remediation of
noncompliance issues identified by the CCO through certain specified means, and (7) establish
and follow appropriate procedures for the handling, management response, remediation,
retesting, and closing of noncompliance issues.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Two commenters submitted comments relating to this proposed rule, expressing differing
definition proposed in the CCO rules for SBS dealers, major SBS participants, and
clearing agencies. See Business Conduct Standards for Security-Based Swap Dealers and

views. 960 As discussed below, one commenter suggested a more prescriptive approach 961 while
the other suggested a less prescriptive approach, but with certain clarifications. 962
Specifically, one commenter suggested that the Commission “establish a meaningful role
for” an SDR’s CCO. 963 The commenter believed that “the rules should preclude the [g]eneral
[c]ounsel or a member of that office from serving as CCO, since those attorneys owe a duty of
loyalty to the SDR itself that may not be compatible with the watchdog function of the CCO.” 964
The commenter also believed that “the CCO should have a direct reporting line to the
independent board members and should be required to meet with those independent members at
least quarterly” in order for “independent members of the board to become effective partners
with the CCO in promoting a culture of compliance within the SDR.” 965
The other commenter believed that as a general matter, “SDRs should have some
flexibility to implement the required compliance procedures in ways consistent with their
structure and business.” 966 The commenter “agree[d] with the Commission that a robust internal
compliance function[, including a CCO,] plays an important role in facilitating an SDR’s

monitoring of, and compliance with, the requirements of the Exchange Act (and rules
thereunder) applicable to SDRs.” 967 The commenter also “fully support[ed] Commission efforts
to require the highest standards of regulatory compliance at SDRs, and believe[d that] requiring
each SDR to have a CCO is an effective way to ensure compliance.” 968
The commenter, however, believed that “some of the enumerated responsibilities of [a
CCO] require clarification in order to avoid an overly broad reading of those duties.” 969
Specifically, the commenter suggested that the CCO’s responsibilities should not, for instance,
“be read to encompass responsibilities beyond those traditionally understood to be part of a
compliance function (i.e., those issues that can as a matter of competence, and typically would
be, handled by a compliance department).” 970 The commenter further believed that “the CCO
should be responsible for establishing relevant compliance procedures, and monitoring
compliance with those procedures and other applicable legal requirements” and that “the CCO
should also participate in other aspects of the SDR’s activities that implicate compliance or
regulatory issues.” 971 The commenter believed, however, that “the CCO cannot be, and should
not be, required to be responsible for the overall operation of the SDR’s business.” 972 The
commenter stated that the Commission “should recognize that oversight of certain aspects of
SDR activities are principally (and, as a practical matter, need to be) within the purview of risk
management and operations personnel. Although there may be a regulatory component to

whether an SDR is meeting its operational readiness, service level or data security
responsibilities for example, oversight of those aspects of the SDR business should remain with
the relevant business areas, subject of course to oversight by senior management and ultimately
the board of directors. While a CCO may have an important role to play in overall oversight and
remediation of any problems, the Commission’s rules should not be interpreted to impose on
CCOs responsibility outside of their traditional core competencies.” 973
In suggesting that the Commission “clarify what types of conflict of interest should be
within the CCO’s purview,” the commenter noted that “[s]ome issues, such as permissibility of
dealings with related parties or entities, are properly within the CCO’s functions. Other issues,
such as restrictions on ownership and access, may be fundamental for the board of directors and
senior management to address.” 974 Additionally, the commenter stated that to the extent that the
Commission’s rule requires consultation with the board or senior management, “some materiality
threshold would be appropriate, as not every potential conflict of interest that might be addressed
by a CCO (or his or her subordinates) would need such consultation.” 975
The commenter further suggested that the Commission “clarify that the CCO’s specific
responsibilities related to conflicts are limited to compliance with the provisions of Exchange
Act Section 13(n) and the final rules thereunder as they relate to the SBS operations of an
SDR.” 976 The commenter believed that “[t]he Commission should not mandate compliance
responsibilities with respect to other regulatory requirements to which an SDR may be subject;

those responsibilities should be specified by the regulator imposing the other requirements.” 977
c.

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-11(c) as
proposed, with modifications. The final rule incorporates the duties of an SDR’s CCO that are
set forth in Exchange Act Section 13(n)(6) 978 and imposes additional requirements. Specifically,
each CCO is required to comply with the following requirements: (1) report directly to the
board 979 or to the SDR’s senior officer, 980 (2) review the compliance of the SDR with respect to
the requirements and core principles described in Exchange Act Section 13(n) and the rules and
regulations thereunder, (3) in consultation with the board or the SDR’s senior officer, 981 take
reasonable steps to resolve any material conflicts of interest that may arise, (4) be responsible for
administering each policy and procedure that is required to be established pursuant to Exchange
Act Section 13 and the rules and regulations thereunder, (5) take reasonable steps to ensure
compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder relating to SBSs,
including each rule prescribed by the Commission under Exchange Act Section 13, (6) establish
procedures for the remediation of noncompliance issues identified by the CCO through any (a)
compliance office review, (b) look-back, (c) internal or external audit finding, (d) self-reported
error, or (e) validated complaint, and (7) establish and follow appropriate procedures for the

978

See 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(6).

979

See supra note 549 (defining “board”).

980

The Commission is amending proposed Rule 13n-11(c)(1) by replacing “chief executive
officer” with “senior officer” to track the language of Exchange Act Section
13(n)(6)(B)(i)), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(6)(B)(i).

271

handling, management response, remediation, retesting, and closing of noncompliance issues.
Consistent with one commenter’s suggestion, the Commission believes that Rule 13n-11(c)
establishes a meaningful role for CCOs. 982 However, because the Commission is not requiring
SDRs to have independent directors, Rule 13n-11(c) does not, as the commenter suggested, 983
require a CCO to report directly to independent directors or meet with independent directors at
least quarterly. To provide CCOs with greater flexibility in fulfilling their duties, the
Commission is also not requiring, as the commenter suggested, CCOs to “meet quarterly with the
Audit Committee (if there is one or non-management members of the [b]oard if there is not), in
addition to annual meetings with the board and senior management.” 984 The Commission
expects CCOs to meet with the board, the senior officer, and others, whenever necessary to fulfill
their duties.
The Commission agrees with one commenter that, in general, SDRs should have
flexibility to implement the required compliance procedures in ways consistent with their
structure and business. 985 In response to a commenter’s request for clarification, 986 the
Commission notes that generally, an SDR’s CCO is not responsible for the SDR’s overall or dayto-day business operation, for example, with respect to risk management and operations; nor is
the CCO responsible for the decisions and actions of every director, officer, and employee of the
SDR. Instead, the CCO’s statutory and regulatory responsibilities generally entail, among other

things, administering the SDR’s policies and procedures required under Exchange Act Section
13 and the rules and regulations thereunder, keeping the SDR’s board or senior officer apprised
of significant compliance issues, advising the board or senior officer of needed changes in the
SDR’s policies and procedures, generally overseeing compliance with the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder, as well as remediating noncompliance at the SDR. If, in the
course of administering policies and procedures required under Exchange Act Section 13 and the
rules and regulations thereunder, the CCO believes that operations or risk management personnel
are not in compliance with such policies and procedures or the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder relating to SBSs (e.g., with Rule 13n-9, which prohibits the
misappropriation or misuse of material nonpublic information by employees), then the CCO is
responsible for establishing and following procedures for the handling, management response,
remediation, retesting, and closing of noncompliance issues.
In the Proposing Release, the Commission stated that “a CCO should review, on an
ongoing basis, the SDR’s service levels, costs, pricing, and operational reliability, with the view
to preventing anticompetitive practices and discrimination, and encouraging innovation and the
use of the SDR.” 987 With respect to one commenter’s remarks regarding the scope of the CCO’s
responsibilities, 988 the Commission continues to believe that the CCO’s administration of an
SDR’s policies and procedures should include, among other things, a review of the SDR’s

levels, costs, pricing, and operational reliability are reasonable. 989 The Commission recognizes,
however, that oversight of certain aspects of an SDR’s activities may overlap with or be within
the purview of the SDR’s risk management and operations personnel or other business
personnel. 990 In that situation, the CCO may need to consult with business personnel to assess
whether they have an appropriate justification for the reasonableness of such service levels,
costs, pricing, and operational reliability.
As the Commission also noted in the Proposing Release, an SDR is not required to hire
an additional person to serve as its CCO. 991 Instead, an SDR can designate an individual already
employed with the SDR as its CCO. Given the critical role that a CCO is intended to play in
ensuring an SDR’s compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, 992 the Commission believes that an SDR’s CCO should be competent and
knowledgeable regarding the federal securities laws, should be empowered with full
responsibility and authority to develop and enforce appropriate policies and procedures for the
SDR, as necessary, and should be responsible for monitoring compliance with the SDR’s
policies and procedures adopted pursuant to rules under the Exchange Act. However, the
Commission will not substantively review a CCO’s competency, and is not requiring any

there may be a regulatory component to whether an SDR is meeting its operational
readiness, service level or data security responsibilities for example, oversight of those
aspects of the SDR business should remain with the relevant business areas, subject of
course to oversight by senior management and ultimately the board of directors”).

particular level of competency or business experience for a CCO.
To address a concern raised by one commenter, 993 the Commission is revising Rule 13n11(c)(3) from the proposal to clarify that the CCO must, in consultation with the board or the
senior officer of the SDR, take reasonable steps to resolve any material conflicts of interest (as
opposed to all conflicts of interest) that may arise. 994 Recognizing that a CCO may not be in a
position to resolve certain material conflicts of interest, as suggested by the commenter, 995 the
Commission is revising the rule from the proposal to specify that CCOs must take reasonable
steps to resolve such conflicts, which is intended to clarify that CCOs are not required to actually
resolve such conflicts. These conflicts of interest may include, for example, general conflicts of
interest identified in the Commission’s Rule 13n-4(c)(3), as discussed in Section VI.D.3.c of this
release.
Recognizing that a CCO cannot guarantee an SDR’s statutory compliance, the
Commission is also revising Rule 13n-11(c)(5) from the proposal to clarify that CCOs are not
required to ensure compliance with the relevant Exchange Act provisions and the rules and
regulations thereunder relating to SBSs, but rather to take reasonable steps to ensure such
compliance. With respect to the comment that the CCO’s specific responsibilities related to
conflicts should be limited to compliance with the provisions of Exchange Act Section 13(n) and

993

See DTCC 2, supra note 19 (noting that some conflicts of interest are within a CCO’s
purview while other issues (e.g., restrictions on ownership and access) may be
fundamental for an SDR’s board or senior management to address and that a CCO would
not need to consult with the board every potential conflict of interest that might be
addressed by a CCO).

the final rules thereunder as they relate to the SBS operations of an SDR, 996 the Commission
notes that the CCO’s responsibilities go beyond the provisions of Exchange Act Section 13(n), as
required by the Dodd-Frank Act. 997 For example, the CCO should take reasonable steps to
ensure compliance with Exchange Act Section 10(b)’s antifraud requirements. 998 However, the
CCO is required to take only reasonable steps to ensure compliance with relevant Exchange Act
provisions and the rules and regulations thereunder “relating to” SBSs.

Compliance Reports (Rules 13n-11(d) and 13n-11(e))
a.

Proposed Rule

An SDR’s CCO is required, under Exchange Act Section 13(n)(6)(C)(i), to annually
prepare and sign a report that contains a description of the SDR’s compliance with respect to the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and each policy and procedure of the
SDR (including the SDR’s code of ethics and conflicts of interest policies). 999 The Commission
proposed Rule 13n-11(d)(1) to incorporate this requirement and to set forth minimum
requirements for what must be included in each annual compliance report.
Under proposed Rule 13n-11(d)(2), an SDR would be required to file with the
Commission a financial report, as discussed further in Section VI.J.5 of this release, along with a
compliance report, which must include a certification that, under penalty of law, the compliance

a tagged data format in accordance with instructions contained in the EDGAR Filer Manual, as
described in Rule 301 of Regulation S-T. 1001
In addition, proposed Rule 13n-11(e) would require a CCO to submit the annual
compliance report to an SDR’s board for its review prior to the submission of the report to the
Commission under proposed Rule 13n-11(d)(2).
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Two commenters submitted comments relating to this proposed rule. 1002 One commenter
believed that an annual compliance report “should be limited to compliance with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the policies and procedures of the SDR that relate to its
activities as such with respect to SBSs (as opposed to policies and procedures that may address
other regulatory requirements).” 1003 Additionally, the commenter did “not believe [that] it is
appropriate to require the report to include a discussion of recommendations for material changes
to the policies and procedures of the SDR as a result of the annual review (as well as the
rationale for such recommendations and whether the policies or procedures will be modified as a
result of such recommendations).” 1004 The commenter believed that “the inclusion of a
description of any material changes to the SDR’s policies and procedures, and any material
compliance matters identified both since the date of the preceding compliance report, provide

comprehensive information,” and that “requiring the CCO to detail every recommendation
(whether or not accepted) may chill open communication between the CCO and other SDR
management.” 1005 The commenter “firmly believe[d that] the annual report should be kept
confidential by the Commission” and explained that “[g]iven the level of disclosure expected to
be required . . . the report will likely contain confidential and proprietary business
information.” 1006
The other commenter recommended that “the review and reporting should be more
frequent, at least semiannually or quarterly,” and that “the rules should expressly prohibit the
board of an SDR from requiring the CCO to make any changes to the compliance reports.” 1007
The commenter suggested that “[a]ny edits or supplements to the report sought by the board may
be submitted to the Commission along with – but not as part of – the CCO’s report.” 1008
c.

Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rules 13n-11(d) and 13n11(e) as proposed, each with two modifications. 1009 Specifically, Rule 13n-11(d)(1) requires that
an SDR’s CCO annually prepare and sign a report that contains a description of the SDR’s
compliance with respect to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and each
of the SDR’s policies and procedures (including the SDR’s code of ethics and conflicts of

Better Markets 1, supra note 19.

1009

To conform with Rule 13n-11’s heading, as adopted, the Commission is revising the
heading of paragraph (d) of the rule to specify that the paragraph pertains to
“[c]ompliance reports” rather than “[a]nnual reports.” See supra note 941.

interest policies). One commenter suggested that the Commission limit the applicability of this
rule to an SDR’s activities relating to SBSs, but did not provide a rationale for such a limit. 1010
The Commission does not believe that there is a rationale for such a limit and has concluded that
it is appropriate to adopt this rule, which essentially reiterates the statutory language. 1011 In
addition, compliance issues at an SDR that are not related to SBSs may impact the SDR as a
whole, of which the Commission should be kept apprised.
Additionally, Rule 13n-11(d)(1) requires each annual compliance report to contain, at a
minimum, a description of: (1) the SDR’s enforcement of its policies and procedures, (2) any
material changes 1012 to the policies and procedures since the date of the preceding compliance
report, (3) any recommendation for material changes to the policies and procedures as a result of
the annual review, the rationale for such recommendation, and whether such policies and
procedures were or will be modified by the SDR to incorporate such recommendation, and (4)
any material compliance matters 1013 identified since the date of the preceding compliance report.
These minimum disclosure requirements are substantially similar to the Commission’s
requirements for annual reports filed by CCOs of investment companies. 1014 Further, these

The term “material change” is defined as a change that a CCO would reasonably need to
know in order to oversee compliance of the SDR. See Rule 13n-11(b)(5).

1013

The term “material compliance matter” is defined as any compliance matter that the
board would reasonably need to know to oversee the compliance of the SDR and that
involves, without limitation: (1) a violation of the federal securities laws by the SDR, its
officers, directors, employees, or agents; (2) a violation of the policies and procedures of
the SDR, by the SDR, its officers, directors, employees, or agents; or (3) a weakness in
the design or implementation of the SDR’s policies and procedures. See Rule 13n11(b)(6).

1014

See Investment Company Act Rule 38a-1(a)(4)(iii), 17 CFR 270.38a-1(a)(4)(iii).

disclosure requirements will provide important information to Commission staff regarding any
material compliance issues at an SDR and material changes or recommendations for material
changes to the SDR’s policies and procedures. Among other things, such information will be
useful to assist Commission staff in monitoring compliance by SDRs with the relevant
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Thus, the Commission
believes that the minimum disclosure requirements are appropriate and disagrees with one
commenter’s remark that it is not appropriate to require a compliance report to include a
description of any recommendation for material changes to an SDR’s policies and procedures as
a result of an annual review, the rationale for such recommendation, and whether such policies
and procedures were or will be modified by the SDR to incorporate such recommendation. 1015
To address a concern raised by the same commenter, 1016 the Commission notes that it is
not “requiring the CCO to detail every recommendation.” 1017 The rule is limited to
“recommendations for material changes.” 1018 The Commission believes that limiting the
description required in an annual compliance report to recommendations for material changes to
the SDR’s policies and procedures appropriately addresses the commenter’s concern. The
Commission notes, however, that individual compliance matters may not be material when
viewed in isolation, but may collectively suggest a material compliance matter. In addition, the

1018

Rule 13n-11(d)(1)(iii).
280

Commission recognizes that this rule may “chill open communication between the CCO and
other SDR management,” as one commenter suggested, 1019 but the Commission believes that the
usefulness of the information in an SDR’s annual compliance reports to the Commission, as
discussed above, would justify any potential chilling of communications.
Consistent with the relevant statutory provision, 1020 the rule requires annual compliance
reports. The Commission does not believe that it is necessary to require more frequent reports,
as one commenter suggested, in order to assess an SDR’s financial stability. 1021 CCOs, however,
should consider the need for interim reviews of compliance at SDRs in response to significant
compliance events, changes in business arrangements, and regulatory developments. For
example, if there is an organizational restructuring of an SDR, then its CCO should consider
evaluating whether its policies and procedures are adequate to guard against potential conflicts of
interest. Additionally, if a new rule regarding SDRs is adopted by the Commission, then a CCO
would need to take reasonable steps to ensure compliance with the rule, including reviewing the
SDR’s policies and procedures.
Under Rule 13n-11(d)(2), an SDR is required to file with the Commission a financial
report along with the annual compliance report, and the compliance report must include a
certification by the CCO that, to the best of his or her knowledge and reasonable belief, 1022 and

The Commission is revising Rule 13n-11(d)(2) from the proposal to clarify that the
certification must be made by the CCO and permit the certification to be based on the
best of the CCO’s knowledge and reasonable belief. Accord General Rule of Practice
153(b)(1)(ii), 17 CFR 201.153(b)(1)(ii) (requiring an attorney who signs a filing with the

under penalty of law, the compliance report is accurate and complete. The compliance report is
also required to be filed in a tagged 1023 data format in accordance with instructions contained in
the EDGAR Filer Manual, 1024 as described in Rule 301 of Regulation S-T. 1025
Rule 13n-11(e) requires a CCO to submit the annual compliance report to the board for its
review prior to the filing of the report with the Commission under Rule 13n-11(d)(2). 1026
Although the rule requires the compliance report to be submitted to the board once a year, a CCO
should promptly bring serious compliance issues to the board’s attention rather than wait until an
annual compliance report is prepared. One commenter suggested that the Commission permit an
SDR’s board to submit edits or supplements to a CCO’s annual compliance report, but not as
part of the report. 1027 Rule 13n-11 does not prohibit a CCO from editing an annual compliance
report to reflect the board’s comments because the Commission believes that the CCO and the
board should be working toward the same compliance goals and that prohibiting the CCO from
taking the board’s edits could create an adversarial atmosphere between them. As discussed
above, however, an SDR could, pursuant to the conflicts of interest requirements set forth in
Rule 13n-4(c)(3), consider prohibiting a board from requiring the CCO to make any changes to
existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of
existing law”).

efficient analysis and review of the information contained in the report.

1026

The Commission is revising Rule 13n-11(e) from the proposal to refer to the
“submission” of the annual compliance report “to” the Commission as the “filing” of the
report “with” the Commission. The Commission believes that using the term “filing” is
more precise than the term “submission” in this context.

One commenter suggested that the Commission keep the annual compliance report
confidential. 1029 The Commission is not providing, by rule, that the annual compliance reports
are automatically granted confidential treatment, but an SDR may seek confidential treatment
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 24b-2. This approach is consistent with how the Commission
generally treats the filings that it receives from its regulated entities, including exchanges and
clearing agencies. The Commission may make filed annual compliance reports available on its
website, except for information where confidential treatment is requested by the SDR and
granted by the Commission. 1030

accounting principles (“GAAP”) for the SDR’s most recent two fiscal years. 1031 Second, the

electronic filings by SDRs must be filed electronically and to require SDRs to request
confidential treatment electronically. The Commission is also adopting technical
amendments to Rule 101 of Regulation S-T to provide that, except as otherwise provided,

registered public accounting firm that complies with paragraphs (a) through (d) of Rule 2-02 of
Regulation S-X. 1033 Fourth, if an SDR’s financial statements contain consolidated information
of a subsidiary of the SDR, then the SDR’s financial statements must provide condensed
financial information as prescribed by the Commission. 1034 Fifth, an SDR’s financial reports
would be required to be provided in XBRL consistent with Rules 405(a)(1), (a)(3), (b), (c), (d),

Proposed Rule 13n-11(g) would further require that annual compliance reports and
financial reports be filed within 60 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by such reports.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission received one comment relating to this proposed rule. 1036 Specifically,
one commenter suggested harmonizing Rule 13n-11(f) with the CFTC’s rule by eliminating
proposed Rule 13n-11(f)(2)’s requirement that each financial report be audited in accordance
with the PCAOB’s standards by a registered public accounting firm that is qualified and

The commenter believed that “[t]his requirement imposes an additional burden for an [SDR] and
is not justified in relation to the risks that an [SDR] would pose to its members.” 1038 The
commenter further suggested that the Commission “consider adopting the CFTC’s approach in
its final [swap data repository] rules, which require [a swap data repository’s] financial
statements be prepared in conformity with . . . GAAP.” 1039

Final Rules

The Commission is adopting proposed Rules 13n-11(f) and (g) with modifications. 1040
Specifically, Rule 13n-11(f)(1) requires each financial report to be a complete set of the SDR’s
financial statements that are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP for the SDR’s most recent
two fiscal years. 1041 Rule 13n-11(f)(2) provides that each financial report must be audited in
accordance with the PCAOB’s standards by a registered public accounting firm 1042 that is

participants that would justify the imposition of this requirement”).

1039

DTCC 5, supra note 19.

1040

To conform with the headings of Rule 13n-11 and paragraph (d) of the rule, as adopted,
the Commission is revising the heading of paragraph (f) of the rule to refer to “financial
reports” in a plural form.

1041

This is generally consistent with CFTC Rule 49.25(f). See 17 CFR 49.25(f); DTCC 5,
supra note 19 (suggesting that the Commission adopt the CFTC’s rule requiring a swap
data repository’s financial statements to be prepared in conformity with GAAP).

1042

The term “registered public accounting firm” is defined in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(59)
to have the same meaning as in Section 2 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. See 15
U.S.C. 78c(a)(59). Section 2 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act defines “registered public
accounting firm” as a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB in accordance
with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
285

qualified and independent in accordance with Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X. 1043 Pursuant to Rule
13n-11(f)(3), each financial report is required to include a report of the registered public
accounting firm that complies with paragraphs (a) through (d) of Rule 2-02 of Regulation SX. 1044
Rule 13n-11(f)(4) further provides that if an SDR’s financial statements contain
consolidated information of a subsidiary of the SDR, then the SDR’s financial statements must
provide condensed financial information, in a financial statement footnote, as to the financial
position, changes in financial position and results of operations of the SDR, as of the same dates
and for the same periods for which audited consolidated financial statements are required. Such
financial information need not be presented in greater detail than is required for condensed
statements by Rules 10-01(a)(2), (3), and (4) of Regulation S-X. 1045 Detailed footnote disclosure
that would normally be included with complete financial statements may be omitted with the
exception of disclosures regarding material contingencies, long-term obligations, and
guarantees. 1046 Descriptions of significant provisions of the SDR’s long-term obligations,
mandatory dividend or redemption requirements of redeemable stocks, and guarantees of the
SDR shall be provided along with a five-year schedule of maturities of debt. 1047 If the material
contingencies, long-term obligations, redeemable stock requirements, and guarantees of the SDR
have been separately disclosed in the consolidated statements, then they need not be repeated in

which pertains to condensed financial information of registrants. 1049
The Commission is revising proposed Rule 13n-11(f)(5) to require an SDR’s financial
reports to be provided as an official filing 1050 in accordance with the EDGAR Filer Manual and
include, as part of the official filing, an Interactive Data Financial Report 1051 filed in accordance
with new Rule 407 of Regulation S-T. Finally, Rule 13n-11(g) provides that annual compliance
reports and financial reports filed pursuant to Rules 13n-11(d) and (f) are required to be filed
within 60 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by such reports.
Rule 407 of Regulation S-T
In conjunction with Rule 13n-11(f)(5), the Commission is adopting new Rule 407 of
Regulation S-T, which stems from provisions in proposed Rule 13n-11(f). Rule 407 sets forth
the requirements equivalent to those in Rules 405(a)(1) (except as to the requirement for website

“Official filing” has the same meaning as set forth in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T. Rule
13n-11(b)(7). Specifically, Rule 11 of Regulation S-T defines “official filing” as “any
filing that is received and accepted by the Commission, regardless of filing medium and
exclusive of header information, tags and any other technical information required in an
electronic filing; except that electronic identification of investment company type and
inclusion of identifiers for series and class (or contract, in the case of separate accounts of
insurance companies) as required by [R]ule 313 of Regulation S-T (§ 232.313) are
deemed part of the official filing.”

1051

“Interactive Data Financial Report” has the same meaning as set forth in Rule 11 of
Regulation S-T. Rule 13n-11(b)(4). Specifically, the Commission is adding the
definition of “Interactive Data Financial Report” in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T to mean
“the machine-readable computer code that presents information in eXtensible Business
Reporting Language (XBRL) electronic format pursuant to § 232.407.” This definition is
substantially the same as the definition of “Interactive Data File” in Rule 11 of
Regulation S-T. However, Interactive Data Financial Reports are not considered
Interactive Data Files for purposes of Rule 405 or for other rules and regulations that
reference to Rule 405.

the exception of Rule 405(a)(2), these provisions were cross-referenced in proposed Rule 13n11(f)(5). Thus, substantively, the requirements in new Rule 407 are the same as those proposed
under proposed Rule 13n-11(f)(5), except as detailed below. The text of Rule 407 is also
substantially the same as those provisions of Rule 405 that pertain to the content, format, and
filing requirements of XBRL-formatted financial statements. Rule 407, however, applies to
Interactive Data Financial Reports, whereas Rule 405 applies to Interactive Data Files. The
Commission is adopting new Rule 407 to specify the content, format, and filing requirements for
Interactive Data Financial Reports.
Although substantially similar, there are several differences between the provisions of
Rule 405 that proposed Rule 13n-11(f) cross-referenced and the provisions of Rule 405 that are
included in new Rule 407. As a general matter, these differences relate to modifications from the
proposal that address the unique aspects of SDRs and the applicability of certain filing
requirements to them.
Upon further consideration, the Commission is not adopting, in Rule 407, several
provisions that the Commission had initially proposed applying to SDRs’ financial reports. Rule
405(a)(1), which was cross-referenced in proposed Rule 13n-11(f)(5), requires compliance with
the web site posting requirements found elsewhere in Rule 405. As adopted, Rule 407 does not
have website posting requirements because the Commission believes that it is not necessary to
impose such requirements on SDRs in this context. No commenters have suggested otherwise.
Additionally, this is consistent with the SDR Rules not imposing any web site posting
requirements on any other filings by SDRs. Rule 407 also does not require an SDR to file its
financial reports consistent with Rules 405(d)(2), (3), and (4), all of which require detailed
288

tagging of footnotes in financial statements. Additionally, Rule 407 does not require an SDR to
file its financial reports consistent with Rule 405(e)(2), which requires detailed tagging of
financial statement schedules. The Commission believes that block-text tags of complete
footnotes and schedules in an SDR’s financial reports 1052 will provide sufficient data structure
for the Commission to assess and analyze effectively the SDR’s financial and operational
condition. Thus, the Commission believes that it is not necessary to impose additional costs on
SDRs to provide detailed tagged footnotes and schedules in SDRs’ financial reports. For these
reasons, the Commission is not requiring SDRs to detail tag footnotes and schedules in their
financial reports.
In addition, the provisions of Rule 405 that proposed Rule 13n-11(f) cross-referenced and
the provisions of Rule 405 that are included in new Rule 407 differ in another way. New Rule
407(a)(2) specifies that Rule 407 applies only to SDRs filing financial reports. 1053 Specifically,
new Rule 407(a)(2) states that an Interactive Data Financial Report must be filed only by an
electronic filer that is required to file an Interactive Data Financial Report pursuant to Rule 13n11(f)(5) as an exhibit to a filing of an SDR’s financial report. Consistent with other documents
required to be filed in a tagged data, or interactive, format, 1054 an SDR’s financial report is
required to be filed with the Commission in two formats. The first part of the official filing is the

1052

See Rules 407(d) and (e) of Regulation S-T (requiring complete footnotes and schedules
in financial statements to be block-text tagged).

1053

Rule 405(a)(2), on the other hand, applies to other electronic filers either required or
permitted to submit an Interactive Data File.

See Rule 405 of Regulation S-T, 17 CFR 232.405.

Related Official Financial Report Filing, 1055 which is in ASCII or HTML format. The second
part of the official filing, the Interactive Data Financial Report, is an exhibit to the filing, which
is required to be in XBRL format. 1056
In addition to adopting new Rule 407 of Regulation S-T, the Commission is making a
conforming amendment to Rule 305 of Regulation S-T to include Interactive Data Financial
Reports among the list of filings to which Rule 305(a) does not apply. 1057 Rule 305(a) limits the
number of characters and positions of tabular or columnar information of electronic filings with
the Commission. By amending Rule 305, the Commission is treating Interactive Data Financial
Reports in the same manner as it treats other XBRL filings in this context.
As mentioned above, Rule 13n-11(g) provides that annual compliance reports and
financial reports are required to be filed within 60 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by
such reports. The Commission anticipates developing an electronic filing system through which
an SDR will be able to file annual compliance reports and financial reports shortly after the
effective date of Rule 13n-11. The Commission anticipates that this electronic filing system will
be through EDGAR and that it will be the same portal for SDRs to file Form SDR. If an SDR
needs to file an annual compliance report and financial report prior to such time as the electronic
filing system is available, then the SDR may file the reports in paper format with the
1055

The Commission is adding the definition of “Related Official Financial Report Filing” in
Rule 11 of Regulation S-T to mean “the ASCII or HTML format part of the official filing
with which an Interactive Data Financial Report appears as an exhibit.”

1056

The Commission’s proposed Rule 13n-11(f) stated that an SDR’s financial report must be
provided in XBRL consistent with certain provisions in Rule 405. As adopted, Rule 407
is intended to clarify that it is only the exhibit to the filing of an SDR’s financial report
that must be in XBRL.

1057

The Commission notes that Rule 305(a) of Regulation S-T does not apply to HTML
documents. If a Related Official Financial Report Filing is filed in HTML format, then
Rule 305(a) will not apply to that filing.
290

Commission’s Division of Trading and Markets at the Commission’s principal office in
Washington, DC. However, doing so does not relieve the SDR from compliance with the
requirement in Rule 13n-11(d)(2) to file the annual compliance report “in a tagged data format in
accordance with the instructions contained in the EDGAR Filer Manual,” or the requirement in
Rule 13n-11(f)(5) to provide the financial report “as part of an official filing in accordance with
the EDGAR Filer Manual.” Therefore, when the Commission’s electronic filing system is
available, the SDR should file electronically any such reports that previously had been filed in
paper format.
The Commission is not providing, by rule, that the financial reports are automatically
granted confidential treatment, but an SDR may seek confidential treatment of certain
information pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 24b-2. As stated above, this approach is consistent
with how the Commission generally treats the filings that it receives from its regulated entities,
including exchanges. The Commission may make filed financial reports available on its website
except for information where confidential treatment is requested by the SDR and granted by the
Commission. 1058
The Commission notes that with respect to its other filers, the Commission has required,
at a minimum, the financial information discussed above 1059 and, in some instances, significantly
1058

As discussed in Section VI.A.1.c of this release, the Commission is adopting technical
amendments to Exchange Act Rule 24b-2 to clarify that the confidential portion of
electronic filings by SDRs must be filed electronically and to require SDRs to request
confidential treatment electronically. The Commission is also adopting technical
amendments to Rule 101 of Regulation S-T to provide that, except as otherwise provided,
all filings by SDRs, including any information with respect to which confidential
treatment is requested, must be filed electronically.

1059

See, e.g., Exchange Act Rule 17a-5(d), 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d) (requiring broker-dealers to
file annually audited financial statements); Article 3 of Regulation S-X, 17 CFR 210.3-01
et seq. (requiring certain financial statements to be audited by independent accountants).
291

more information. 1060 Additionally, as discussed in the Proposing Release, the Commission
believes that it is necessary to obtain an audited annual financial report from each registered
SDR to understand the SDR’s financial and operational condition. It is particularly important for
the Commission to have this understanding because SDRs are intended to play a pivotal role in
improving the transparency and efficiency of the SBS market and because SBSs (whether
cleared or uncleared) are required to be reported to a registered SDR. 1061 In its role as central
recordkeeper, an SDR serves an important role as a source of data for regulators to monitor
exposures, risks, and compliance with the Exchange Act and for market participants to access
position information. Among other things, the Commission will need to know whether an SDR
has adequate financial resources to comply with its statutory obligations or is having financial
difficulties. If an SDR ultimately ceases doing business, then it could create a significant
disruption in the OTC derivatives market.
With respect to one commenter’s suggested deletion of the auditing requirement in Rule
13n-11(f)(2), the Commission disagrees with the commenter’s view that the requirement imposes
an additional burden for an SDR that is not justified in relation to the risks that an SDR would
pose to its members. 1062 The Commission believes that the audit requirement will serve as an
effective means to assure the reliability of the information in an SDR’s financial report that is
filed with the Commission. The Commission also believes that the filing of audited financial
1060

See, e.g., Exchange Act Rule 17a-5(a), 17 CFR 240.17a-5(a) (requiring broker-dealers to
file monthly and quarterly Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single
(FOCUS) reports); Article 10-01(d) of Regulation S-X, 17 CFR 210.10-01(d) (requiring
public companies to have their quarterly reports reviewed by independent public
accountants).

statements (as opposed to unaudited financial statements) is important because it would bolster
market participants’ confidence in the SDR and provide greater credibility to the accuracy of the
information that the SDR files with the Commission. 1063 The Commission recognizes that
because of the audit requirement in Rule 13n-11(f)(2), the rule may, in some instances, be more
costly than the CFTC’s requirement of quarterly unaudited financial statements. 1064 The
Commission believes, however, that the additional burden, where it exists, is justified by the
aforementioned benefits of requiring audited financial statements.
6.

Additional Rule Regarding Chief Compliance Officer (Rule 13n-11(h))

In the Proposing Release, the Commission asked whether it should prohibit any officers,
directors, or employees of an SDR from, directly or indirectly, taking any action to coerce,
manipulate, mislead, or fraudulently influence the SDR’s CCO in the performance of his
responsibilities. 1065 In response, one commenter recommended that the Commission adopt such
a prohibition. 1066 After considering the commenter’s recommendation, the Commission has
decided to adopt Rule 13n-11(h), which states that “[n]o officer, director, or employee of a
security-based swap data repository may directly or indirectly take any action to coerce,
manipulate, mislead, or fraudulently influence the security-based swap data repository’s chief
compliance officer in the performance of his or her duties under [Rule 13n-11].” This rule is

intended to advance the goals of the statute’s requirements by preventing others at the SDR from
seeking to improperly affect the SDR’s CCO in the performance of his or her responsibilities.
This rule is also intended to promote the independence of an SDR’s CCO while maintaining the
CCO’s effectiveness by mitigating the potential conflicts of interest between the CCO and the
SDR’s officers, directors, and employees.

Exemption from Requirements Governing SDRs for Certain Non-U.S. Persons
(Rule 13n-12)
1.

Proposed Rule

In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission proposed, pursuant to its
authority under Exchange Act Section 36, 1067 an exemption from Exchange Act Section 13(n) 1068
and the rules and regulations thereunder (collectively, the “SDR Requirements”) for non-U.S.
persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the United States, subject to a condition. 1069
Specifically, the Commission proposed Rule 13n-12 (“SDR Exemption”), which provides: “A
non-U.S. person 1070 that performs the functions of a security-based swap data repository within
the United States shall be exempt from the registration and other requirements set forth in
Section 13(n) of the [Exchange] Act . . . and the rules and regulations thereunder, provided that
1067

Exchange Act Section 36 authorizes the Commission to conditionally or unconditionally
exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities,
or transactions, from certain provisions of the Exchange Act or certain rules or
regulations thereunder, by rule, regulation, or order, to the extent that such exemption is
necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of
investors. 15 U.S.C. 78mm.

Commission.”1071

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission received several comment letters concerning the registration and
regulation of SDRs in the cross-border context, most of which were submitted prior to the
Commission’s proposal of Rule 13n-12. As a general matter, commenters suggested that the
Commission should apply principles of international comity. 1072
One commenter expressed concern that “the current asymmetry in the [proposed SDR

1072

See DTCC 2, supra note 19 (urging the Commission, in its regulation of SDRs, to aim for
regulatory comity as it has already been agreed to by ODRF and other international
bodies such as CPSS and IOSCO); Foreign Banks SBSR, supra note 27 (recommending
that the Commission work with foreign authorities to permit SDRs in all major
jurisdictions to register with the appropriate regulators in each jurisdiction); see also
Société Générale SBSR, supra note 27 (suggesting that the Commission consider
international comity and public policy goals of derivatives regulation to limit its
regulation of swap business and requesting that the Commission coordinate with its
foreign counterparts, especially those based in Europe, to work toward an MOU on the
jurisdictional reach of the derivatives rules of the U.S./European Market Infrastructure
Regulation); ISDA SIFMA SBSR, supra note 27 (“The Commission should consult with
foreign regulators before establishing the extra-territorial scope of the rules promulgated
under Title VII.”). See also DTCC CB, supra note 26 (“Given the global nature of OTC
swaps and SB swaps markets, the United States should continue to promote an approach
to the regulation of the swaps markets that adheres to international comity and mitigates
the risk of regulatory arbitrage in market decisions. Regulations among jurisdictions
must be coordinated in a manner that promotes competition, transparency, and protects
the safety and soundness of these global markets. At the same time, the Commission
should remain vigilant that the international framework is efficient and does not unfairly
disadvantage or concentrate systemic risk in the United States.”).
295

Rules], when compared to existing international standards, will lead to fragmentation along
regional lines and prohibit global services and global data provision, which will weaken the
introduction of trade repositories as a financial markets reform measure.” 1073 The commenter
stated that “because of the onerous standards imposed on SDRs compared to the regulatory
framework of other competitive jurisdictions, the U.S. will be less attractive than other locations
for the purpose of storing full global data where SDRs are actively looking to service the global
regulatory community.” 1074
In addition, two commenters expressed concern about the potential impact of duplicative
registration requirements imposed on SDRs. 1075 Specifically, one of these commenters remarked
that the Commission’s proposed rules governing SDRs “would seem to force a non-resident SDR
to be subject to multiple regimes and to the jurisdiction of several authorities” and that the
Proposing Release made no “reference to equivalency of regulatory regimes or cooperation with
the authorities of the country of establishment of the non-resident SDRs.” 1076 To address this
concern, the commenter suggested that the Commission adopt a regime under which foreign
SDRs would be deemed to comply with the SDR Requirements if the laws and regulations of the
relevant foreign jurisdiction were equivalent to those of the Commission and an MOU has been
entered into between the Commission and the relevant foreign authority. 1077 The commenter
noted that the recommended “regime would have the following advantages: i) facilitating
cooperation among authorities from different jurisdictions; ii) ensuring the mutual recognition of

[SDRs]; and iii) establishing convergent regulatory and supervisory regimes which is necessary
in a global market such as the OTC derivatives one.” 1078
Recognizing that some SDRs would function solely outside of the United States and,
therefore, would be regulated by an authority in another jurisdiction, commenters suggested
possible approaches to the SDR registration regime. One commenter, for example, suggested
that “a non-U.S. SDR should not be subject to U.S. registration so long as it collects and
maintains information from outside the U.S., even if such information is collected from non-U.S.
swap dealer or [major security-based swap participant] registrants.” 1079 Two commenters
supported “cross-registration” of SDRs, whereby SDRs in all major jurisdictions may register
with the appropriate regulators in each jurisdiction. 1080

Final Rule

As stated above, 1081 the Commission believes that a non-U.S. person that performs the
functions of an SDR within the United States is required to register with the Commission, absent

“European Commission’s proposal for a Regulation on OTC derivatives, central
counterparties and trade repositories”).

jurisdictions. Cross-border information sharing and cross-registration, coupled with the
new standard identification codes that will be required for reporting to SDRs, would
provide regulators and market participants with a comprehensive picture, thus enabling
more robust surveillance and supervision of the global swaps market.”); BofA SBSR,

an exemption. 1082 After considering comments, including those urging the Commission to take
into consideration the principles of international comity and mitigate the risk of regulatory
arbitrage in market decisions, 1083 the Commission is adopting Rule 13n-12 as proposed, with two
modifications, 1084 to provide an exemption from the SDR Requirements for certain non-U.S.
persons. This rule is intended to provide legal certainty to market participants and to address
commenters’ concerns regarding the potential for duplicative regulatory requirements. 1085
Specifically, Rule 13n-12 states as follows: “A non-U.S. person 1086 that performs the functions
of a security-based swap data repository within the United States shall be exempt from the
registration and other requirements set forth in section 13(n) of the [Exchange] Act . . . and the
rules and regulations thereunder, provided that each regulator with supervisory authority over

Act Section 13(n)(1), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(1) (requiring persons that, directly or indirectly,
make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform
the functions of an SDR, to register with the Commission). The Commission recognizes
that some non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR may do so entirely
outside the United States, and thus, are not required to register with the Commission.

1086

Exchange Act Rule 13n-12(a)(1), as adopted, defines “non-U.S. person” to mean any
person that is not a U.S. person. Exchange Act Rule 13n-12(a)(2) defines “U.S. person”
by cross-reference to the definition of “U.S. person” in Exchange Act Rule 3a713(a)(4)(i), 17 CFR 240.3a71-3(a)(4)(i). See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at
47371, supra note 11 (adopting Exchange Act Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i)). As proposed, Rule
13n-12(a)(2) cross-referenced to “§ 240.3a71-3(a)(7).” For consistency in how crossreferences are formatted in the SDR Rules, the Commission is revising from the proposal
the format of the cross-reference to “Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i) (§ 240.3a71-3(a)(4)(i)).”

such non-U.S. person has entered into a memorandum of understanding 1087 or other arrangement
with the Commission that addresses the confidentiality of data collected and maintained by such
non-U.S. person, access by the Commission to such data, and any other matters determined by
the Commission.”
The Commission continues to believe that the SDR Exemption is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, and consistent with the protection of investors. 1088 Because the
reporting requirements of Title VII and Regulation SBSR can be satisfied only if an SBS
transaction is reported to an SDR that is registered with the Commission,1089 the Commission
continues to believe that the primary reason for a person subject to the reporting requirements of
1087

Upon further consideration, the Commission is revising the proposed rule to require an
MOU rather than a more specific “supervisory and enforcement” MOU. Requiring an
MOU provides the Commission with the flexibility to negotiate a broad range of terms,
conditions, and circumstances under which information can be shared with other relevant
authorities.

1088

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31043, supra note 3.

1089

The Commission believes that the SDR Exemption addresses one commenter’s view that
“a non-U.S. SDR should not be subject to U.S. registration so long as it collects and
maintains information from outside the U.S.” See US & Foreign Banks, supra note 24;
see also Section III.B of this release (discussing when SDRs that are non-U.S. persons
must register with the Commission). The Commission notes, however, that a non-U.S.
person that performs the functions of an SDR outside the United States may choose to
register with the Commission as an SDR to enable that person to accept data from
persons that are reporting an SBS pursuant to the reporting requirements of Title VII and
Regulation SBSR. See Exchange Act Sections 13(m)(1)(G) and 13A(a)(1), 15 U.S.C.
78m(m)(1)(G) and 78m-1(a)(1), as added by Dodd-Frank Act Sections 763(i) and 766(a);
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rule 901 requiring all SBSs to be
reported to a registered SDR or, if no SDR will accept the SBSs, the Commission). This
approach is consistent with commenters’ views supporting cross-registration of SDRs.
See Foreign Banks SBSR, supra note 27 (suggesting cross-registration of SDRs); BofA
SBSR, supra note 27 (suggesting cross-registration of SDRs). The Commission may
consider also granting, pursuant to its authority under Exchange Act Section 36, 15
U.S.C. 78mm, exemptions to such non-U.S. person that registers with the Commission
from certain of the SDR Requirements on a case-by-case basis. In determining whether
to grant such an exemption, the Commission may consider, among other things, whether
there are overlapping requirements in the Exchange Act and applicable foreign law.
299

Title VII and Regulation SBSR to report an SBS transaction to an SDR that is not registered with
the Commission would likely be to satisfy reporting obligations that it or its counterparty has
under foreign law. 1090 Such person would still be required to fulfill its reporting obligations
under Title VII and Regulation SBSR by reporting its SBS transaction to an SDR that is
registered with the Commission, absent other relief from the Commission, 1091 even if the
transaction were also reported to a non-U.S. person that is not registered with the Commission
because it is relying on the SDR Exemption. The Commission believes that this approach to the
SDR Requirements appropriately balances the Commission’s interest in having access to data
about SBS transactions involving U.S. persons, while addressing commenters’ concerns
regarding the potential for duplicative regulatory requirements 1092 as well as furthering the goals
of the Dodd-Frank Act.
The SDR Exemption includes a condition that each regulator with supervisory authority
over the non-U.S. person that performs the functions of an SDR within the United States enters
into an MOU or other arrangement with the Commission, as specified in Exchange Act Rule
13n-12(b). The Commission anticipates that in determining whether to enter into such an MOU
or other arrangement with a relevant authority, the Commission will consider whether the
relevant authority can keep confidential requested data that is collected and maintained by the

non-U.S. person that performs the functions of an SDR within the United States 1093 and whether
the Commission will have access to data collected and maintained by such non-U.S. person. 1094
The Commission anticipates that it will consider other matters, including, for example, whether
the relevant authority agrees to provide the Commission with reciprocal assistance in securities
matters within the Commission’s jurisdiction and whether an MOU or other arrangement would
be in the public interest. 1095 The Commission believes that, in lieu of requiring every non-U.S.
person that performs the functions of an SDR within the United States to register with the
Commission, the condition in the SDR Exemption is appropriate to address the Commission’s
interest in having access to SBS data involving U.S. persons and U.S. market participants that is
maintained by non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the United States
and protecting the confidentiality of such SBS data involving U.S. persons and U.S. market
participants. 1096

1093

The Commission contemplates that the relevant authority will keep requested data that is
collected and maintained by such non-U.S. person confidential in a manner that is
consistent with Exchange Act Section 24 and Rule 24c-1 thereunder. See 15 U.S.C. 78x
and 17 CFR 240.24c-1.

1094

The Commission contemplates that the Commission’s access to data collected and
maintained by such non-U.S. person will be in a manner that is consistent with Exchange
Act Section 13(n)(5)(D) and Rule 13n-4(b)(5) thereunder. See Exchange Act Section
13(n)(5)(D), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(D).

1095

The Commission has entered numerous cooperative agreements with foreign authorities.
See Cooperative Arrangements with Foreign Regulators, available at
http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oia/oia_cooparrangements.shtml. Based on the
Commission’s experience with negotiating MOUs and other agreements with foreign
authorities, the Commission believes that the MOU or agreement described in Rule 13n12(b) could, in many cases, be negotiated in a timely manner so that the exemption
provided under Rule 13n-12(b) should be available before the registration of an SDR
seeking to claim the exemption would otherwise be required.

With respect to one commenter’s concern about “the current asymmetry in the [proposed
SDR Rules] when compared to existing international standards” and “onerous standards imposed
on SDRs compared to regulatory framework of other competitive jurisdictions,” the Commission
believes that the SDR Exemption is intended to encourage international cooperation, and thereby
mitigate to some extent the concern of data fragmentation and regulatory arbitrage. 1097 The
commenter, which was submitted prior to the Commission’s proposal of Rule 13n-12, did not
provide specific examples of international standards or regulatory frameworks for comparison
with the SDR Rules, but, as discussed in Section I.D above, the Commission has taken into
consideration recommendations by international bodies; Commission staff also has consulted and
coordinated with foreign regulators through bilateral and multilaterial discussions. 1098

Paperwork Reduction Act
Certain provisions of the SDR Rules 1099 and Form SDR impose new “collection of

information” requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995
(“PRA”). 1100 In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5 CFR 1320.11, the Commission submitted
the provisions to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review when it issued the
Proposing Release. The title of the new collection of information is “Form SDR and Securityan MOU on the jurisdictional reach of the derivatives rules of the U.S./European Market
Infrastructure Regulation).
1097

See DTCC 2, supra note 19.

1098

Senior representatives of authorities with responsibility for regulation of OTC derivatives
have met on a number of occasions to discuss international coordination of OTC
derivatives regulations. See, e.g., Report of the OTC Derivatives Regulators Group
(ODRG) on Cross-Border Implementation Issues (Mar. 31, 2014), available at
http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public/@internationalaffairs/documents/file/

conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless
it displays a currently valid OMB control number. OMB assigned control number 3235-0719 to
the new collection of information.
In the Proposing Release, the Commission solicited comment on the collection of
information requirements and the accuracy of the Commission’s statements. 1101 The
Commission received three comments noting the importance of confidentiality. 1102 The
Commission received one comment generally discussing the burden of Rule 13n-11(f)(2), which
is discussed below. 1103
The Commission also received one comment recommending that “the Commission
should generally seek to avoid any divergence from the CFTC’s and international regulators’
frameworks that is likely to give rise to undue costs or burdens.” 1104 The commenter believed

1101

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77354, supra note 2.

1102

One commenter emphasized that regulators should provide confidential treatment to the
annual compliance reports that SDRs provide to the Commission. DTCC 2, supra note
19. Consistent with its treatment of filings that it receives from other registrants, the
Commission is not providing, by rule, that annual compliance reports are automatically
granted confidential treatment, but SDRs may request confidential treatment. See
Section VI.J.4.c of this release. One commenter to the Temporary Rule Release
emphasized the importance of the Commission protecting information furnished to it
under the rules in that release. Deutsche Temp Rule, supra note 28. A second
commenter reiterated that regulators should provide confidential treatment to SBS data
provided by SDRs. ESMA, supra note 19. The Commission anticipates that it will keep
reported data that SDRs submit to the Commission confidential, subject to the provisions
of applicable law. Pursuant to Commission rules, confidential treatment can be sought
for information submitted to the Commission. See 17 CFR 200.83 (regarding
confidential treatment procedures under FOIA).

that “divergence is generally warranted only if the rule adopted by the Commission is more
flexible than those adopted by others (and therefore would not preclude the voluntary adoption of
consistent practices by market participants).” 1105
None of the commenters specifically addressed the burden estimates in the Proposing
Release related to the collection of information. The Commission has, however, revised the
burden associated with completing Form SDR to reflect some additional material incorporated
from Form SIP to accommodate SDRs’ registration as SIPs and to reflect a revision to the
disclosure of business affiliations. 1106 The Commission has also made a change to correct a
calculation error. 1107 Other than these changes, the Commission’s estimates remain unchanged
from the Proposing Release.
A.

Summary of Collection of Information
1.

Registration Requirements, Form SDR, and Withdrawal from Registration

Rule 13n-1(b) requires an SDR to apply for registration with the Commission by filing
Form SDR electronically in tagged data format in accordance with the instructions contained on
the form. Under Rule 13n-1(e), each SDR is required to both designate and authorize on Form
SDR an agent in the United States, other than a Commission member, official, or employee, to
accept notice or service of process, pleadings, or other documents in any action or proceedings
brought against the SDR to enforce the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Rule 13n-1(f) requires a non-resident SDR to (i) certify on Form SDR that the SDR

1106

See Section VII.D.1 of this release discussing the burdens associated with SDRs’
registration requirements.

1107

The calculation of the burden on non-resident SDRs under Rule 13n-1(f) has been revised
to correct a calculation error, which slightly reduces the burden hours incurred by nonresident SDRs. See infra note 1136 and the accompanying text.
304

can, as a matter of law, and will provide the Commission with prompt access to the SDR’s books
and records and can, as a matter of law, and will submit to onsite inspection and examination by
the Commission and (ii) provide an opinion of counsel that the SDR can, as a matter of law,
provide the Commission with prompt access to the SDR’s books and records and can, as a matter
of law, submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission. Under Rule 13n-3(a),
in the event that an SDR succeeds to and continues the business of a registered SDR, the
successor SDR may file an application for registration on Form SDR (and the predecessor SDR
is required to file a withdrawal from registration with the Commission) within 30 days after the
succession in order for the registration of the predecessor to be deemed to remain effective as the
registration of the successor. Also, under Rule 13n-11(a), an SDR is required to identify on
Form SDR a person who has been designated by the board to serve as a CCO of the SDR.
Rule 13n-1(d) requires SDRs to file an amendment on Form SDR annually as well as
when any information provided in items 1 through 17, 26, and 48 on Form SDR is or becomes
inaccurate for any reason. Under Rule 13n-3(b), if an SDR succeeds to and continues the
business of a registered SDR and the succession is based solely on a change in the predecessor’s
date or state of incorporation, form of organization, or composition of a partnership, the
successor SDR is permitted, within 30 days after the succession, to amend the registration of the
predecessor SDR on Form SDR to reflect these changes.
Rule 13n-2(b) permits a registered SDR to withdraw from registration by filing a
withdrawal from registration on Form SDR electronically in a tagged data format. The SDR
must designate on Form SDR a person to serve as custodian of its books and records. When
filing a withdrawal from registration on Form SDR, the SDR must update any inaccurate
information.
305

2.

SDR Duties, Data Collection and Maintenance, and Direct Electronic
Access

Rule 13n-4(b) sets out a number of duties for SDRs. Under Rules 13n-4(b)(2) and (4),
SDRs are required to accept data as prescribed in Regulation SBSR 1108 and maintain that data, as
required in Rule 13n-5, for each SBS reported to the SDRs. SDRs are required, pursuant to Rule
13n-4(b)(5), to provide direct electronic access to the Commission or its designees. 1109 SDRs are
required, pursuant to Rule 13n-4(b)(6), to provide information in such form and at such
frequency as required by Regulation SBSR. The Commission anticipates that it will propose for
public comment detailed specifications of acceptable formats and taxonomies for the purposes of
direct electronic access. Until such time as the Commission adopts any format or taxonomy,
SDRs may provide direct electronic access to the Commission to data in the form in which SDRs
maintain such data.
SDRs have an obligation under Rule 13n-4(b)(3) to confirm, as prescribed in Rule 13n-5,
with both counterparties the accuracy of the information submitted to the SDRs. Under Rule
13n-4(b)(7), at such time and in such manner as may be directed by the Commission, an SDR is
required to establish automated systems for monitoring, screening, and analyzing SBS data. 1110
Rule 13n-5 establishes rules regarding SDR data collection and maintenance. Rule 13n5(b)(1) requires every SDR to (1) establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed for the reporting of complete and accurate transaction data to the

1108

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13.

1109

See also Rule 13n-4(a)(5) (defining “direct electronic access”).

1110

The Commission is not requiring SDRs to monitor, screen, and analyze SBS data
maintained by the SDR at this time. See Section VI.D.2.c.iii of this release.
306

SDR; 1111 (2) accept all transaction data reported to it in accordance with those policies and
procedures; (3) accept all data provided to it regarding all SBSs in an asset class if the SDR
accepts data on any SBS in that particular asset class; and (4) establish, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to satisfy itself that the transaction data that
has been submitted to the SDR is complete and accurate, and clearly identifies the source for
each trade side, and the pairing method (if any) for each transaction in order to identify the level
of quality of the transaction data. An SDR is also required under Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iv) to
promptly record transaction data it receives.
In addition, Rule 13n-5(b) requires every SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed: (1) to calculate positions 1112 for all persons with
open SBSs for which the SDR maintains records; (2) to ensure that the transaction data and
positions that it maintains are complete and accurate; and (3) to prevent any provision in a valid
SBS from being invalidated or modified through the procedures or operations of the SDR.
Rule 13n-5(b)(4) requires that every SDR maintain the transaction data and related
identifying information for not less than five years after the applicable SBS expires and historical
positions for not less than five years. This data is required to be maintained in a place and format
that is readily accessible and usable to the Commission and other persons with authority to
access or view the information. SDRs must also maintain this data in an electronic format that is
non-rewritable and non-erasable. Under Rule 13n-5(b)(7), the SDR’s obligation to preserve,
maintain, and make accessible the transaction data and historical positions extends to the periods
required under Rule 13n-5 even if the SDR ceases to do business or to be registered pursuant to
1111

“Transaction data” is defined in Rule 13n-5(a)(3).

1112

“Position” is defined in Rule 13n-5(a)(2).
307

Exchange Act Section 13(n). Rule 13n-5(b)(8) requires every SDR to make and keep current a
plan to ensure that the transaction data and positions that are recorded in the SDR continue to be
maintained in accordance with Rule 13n-5(b)(7), including procedures for transferring the
transaction data and positions to the Commission or its designee (including another registered
SDR).
Rule 13n-6 establishes rules regarding SDR automated systems. Rule 13n-6 requires that
every SDR, with respect to those systems that support or are integrally related to the performance
of its activities, establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to ensure that its systems provide adequate levels of capacity, integrity, resiliency,
availability, and security.
3.

Recordkeeping

Rule 13n-7 requires every SDR to make and keep records, in addition to those required
under Rules 13n-4(b)(4) and 13n-5. Specifically, every SDR is required, under Rule 13n-7(a)(1),
to make and keep current a record for each office listing, by name or title, each person at that
office who, without delay, can explain the types of records the SDR maintains at that office and
the information contained in those records. Every SDR is also required, under Rule 13n-7(a)(2),
to make and keep current a record listing each officer, manager, or person performing similar
functions of the SDR responsible for establishing policies and procedures that are reasonably
designed to ensure compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Rule 13n-7(b) requires every SDR to keep and preserve at least one copy of all documents made
or received by it in the course of its business as such. These records are required to be kept for a
period of not less than five years, the first two years in a place that is immediately available to
representatives of the Commission for inspection and examination. Upon the request of any
308

representative of the Commission, pursuant to Rule 13n-7(b)(3), an SDR is required to furnish
promptly to such representative copies of any documents required to be kept and preserved by
the SDR pursuant to Rules 13n-7(a) and (b). Under Rule 13n-7(c), the SDR’s recordkeeping
obligation is extended to the periods required under Rule 13n-7 even if the SDR ceases to do
business or to be registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 13(n).
SDRs are also required to make available the books and records required by Rules 13n-1
through 13n-11 upon request by Commission representatives for inspection and examination. 1113
4.

Reports

Under Rule 13n-8, SDRs are required to promptly report to the Commission, in a form
and manner acceptable to the Commission, such information as the Commission determines
necessary or appropriate for the Commission to perform its duties.
5.

Disclosure

Rule 13n-10 describes disclosures that SDRs are required to provide to a market
participant before accepting any SBS data from that market participant or upon a market
participant’s request. The information required in the disclosure document includes: (1) the
SDR’s criteria for providing others with access to services offered and data maintained by the
SDR, (2) the SDR’s criteria for those seeking to connect to or link with the SDR, (3) a
description of the SDR’s policies and procedures regarding its safeguarding of data and
operational reliability, as described in Rule 13n-6, (4) a description of the SDR’s policies and
procedures reasonably designed to protect the privacy of any and all SBS transaction information
that the SDR receives from an SBS dealer, counterparty, or any registered entity, as described in
Rule 13n-9(b)(1), (5) a description of the SDR’s policies and procedures regarding its non1113

See, e.g., Rules 13n-4(b)(1) and 13n-7(b)(3).
309

commercial and/or commercial use of the SBS transaction information that it receives from a
market participant, any registered entity, or any other person, (6) a description of the SDR’s
dispute resolution procedures involving market participants, as described in Rule 13n-5(b)(6), (7)
a description of all the SDR’s services, including any ancillary services, (8) the SDR’s updated
schedule of any dues; unbundled prices, rates, or other fees for all of its services, including any
ancillary services; any discounts or rebates offered; and the criteria to benefit from such
discounts or rebates, and (9) a description of the SDR’s governance arrangements.
6.

Chief Compliance Officer; Compliance Reports and Financial Reports

Rule 13n-4(b)(11) requires an SDR and Rule 13n-11(a) requires the board of an SDR to
designate a CCO to perform the duties identified in Rule 13n-11. Under Rules 13n-11(c)(6) and
(7), the CCO is responsible for, among other things, establishing procedures for the remediation
of noncompliance issues identified by the CCO and establishing and following appropriate
procedures for the handling, management response, remediation, retesting, and closing of
noncompliance issues.
The CCO is also required under Rules 13n-11(d), (e), and (g) to prepare and submit
annual compliance reports to the SDR’s board for review before they are filed with the
Commission. The annual compliance reports must contain, at a minimum, a description of the
SDR’s enforcement of its policies and procedures, any material changes to the policies and
procedures since the date of the preceding compliance report, any recommendation for material
changes to the policies and procedures, and any material compliance matters identified since the

310

date of the preceding compliance report. The compliance reports must be filed in a tagged data
format in accordance with the instructions contained in the EDGAR Filer Manual. 1114
Rules 13n-11(f) and (g) require that financial reports be prepared and filed annually with
the Commission. These financial reports must, among other things, be prepared in conformity
with GAAP for the most recent two fiscal years of the SDR, audited by a registered public
accounting firm that is qualified and independent in accordance with Rule 2-01 of Regulation SX, and audited in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board. The financial reports must be provided as an official filing in accordance with the
EDGAR Filer Manual and include, as part of the official filing, an Interactive Data Financial
Report filed in accordance with Rule 407 of Regulation S-T. 1115
7.

Other Provisions Relevant to the Collection of Information

Rule 13n-4(c)(1) sets forth the requirements for SDRs related to market access to services
and data. Among other things, an SDR must: (1) establish, monitor on an ongoing basis, and
enforce clearly stated objective criteria that would permit fair, open, and not unreasonably
discriminatory access to services offered and data maintained by the SDR, as well as fair, open,
and not unreasonably discriminatory participation by market participants, market infrastructures,
venues from which data can be submitted to the SDR, and third party service providers that seek
to connect to or link with the SDR; and (2) establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to review any prohibition or limitation of any person with
respect to services offered or data maintained by the SDR and to grant that person access to those
services or data if the person has been discriminated against unfairly.
1114

See 17 CFR 232.301.

1115

See Section VI.J.5.c of this release discussing Rule 407 of Regulation S-T.
311

Rule 13n-4(c)(2)(iv) requires each SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the SDR’s senior management and
each member of the board or committee that has the authority to act on behalf of the board
possesses requisite skills and expertise to fulfill their responsibilities in the management and
governance of the SDR, have a clear understanding of their responsibilities, and exercise sound
judgment about the SDR’s affairs.
Rule 13n-4(c)(3) sets forth the conflicts of interest controls required of SDRs. In
particular, SDRs must establish and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to minimize conflicts of interest, including establishing, maintaining, and enforcing written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and mitigate potential and existing
conflicts of interest in the SDR’s decision-making process on an ongoing basis and written
policies and procedures regarding the SDR’s non-commercial and commercial use of the SBS
transaction information that it receives.
Rule 13n-5(b)(6) requires SDRs to establish procedures and provide facilities reasonably
designed to effectively resolve disputes over the accuracy of the transaction data and positions
that are recorded in the SDR.
Rules 13n-4(b)(8) and 13n-9 relate to the privacy requirements for SDRs. Rule 13n4(b)(8) requires SDRs to maintain the privacy of any and all SBS transaction information that the
SDR receives from a SBS dealer, counterparty, or any registered entity as prescribed in Rule
13n-9. Rule 13n-9(b)(1) requires each SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to protect the privacy of any and all SBS transaction
information that the SDR receives from any SBS dealer, counterparty, or any registered entity.
Rule 13n-9(b)(2) requires each SDR to establish and maintain safeguards, policies, and
312

procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misappropriation or misuse of any confidential
information received by the SDR, material, nonpublic information, and/or intellectual property.
At a minimum, these policies and procedures must address limiting access to such information
and intellectual property, standards pertaining to the trading by persons associated with the SDR
for their personal benefit or the benefit of others, and adequate oversight.
B.

Use of Information
1.

Registration Requirements, Form SDR, and Withdrawal from Registration

As discussed above, Rules 13n-1 and 13n-3 generally require SDRs to register on Form
SDR and make amendments on Form SDR when specified information on the form becomes
inaccurate, as well as annually. The information collected in Form SDR is used to enhance the
ability of the Commission to monitor SDRs and oversee their compliance with the federal
securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, as well as understand their operations
and organizational structure. The information will also be used to make determinations of
whether to grant or institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be granted or
denied.
As discussed above, Rule 13n-2 generally permits a registered SDR to withdraw from
registration by filing Form SDR electronically in a tagged data format, designating a custodian of
its books and records, and updating any inaccurate information contained in its most recently
filed Form SDR. The information collected from an SDR withdrawing from registration is used
by the Commission to monitor and oversee SDRs by ensuring that the Commission has an
accurate record of registered SDRs and access to an SDR’s books and records after the SDR
withdraws from registration.

313

Also, under Rule 13n-11(a), an SDR is required to identify on Form SDR a person who
has been designated by the board to serve as a CCO of the SDR. This information will help the
Commission identify SDRs’ CCOs.
2.

SDR Duties, Data Collection and Maintenance, and Direct Electronic
Access

As discussed above, Rules 13n-4(b), 13n-5, and 13n-6 specify the duties of SDRs, require
SDRs to collect and maintain specific data and provide that data to certain entities. 1116 The
information that is collected under these provisions will help ensure an orderly and transparent
SBS market as well as provide the Commission and other relevant authorities with tools to help
oversee this market.
3.

Recordkeeping

As discussed above, Rule 13n-7 requires an SDR to make and keep books and records
relating to its business (except for the transaction data and positions collected and maintained
pursuant to Rule 13n-5) for a prescribed period. 1117 The information collected under these
provisions is necessary for Commission representatives to inspect and examine an SDR and to
facilitate the Commission’s efforts to evaluate the SDR’s compliance with the federal securities
laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.
4.

Reports

As discussed above, Rule 13n-8 requires SDRs to provide certain reports to the
Commission.1118 The Commission will use the information collected under this provision to

1116

See Sections VI.D.2.c, VI.E, and VI.F.3 of this release discussing Rules 13n-4(b), 13n-5,
and 13n-6, respectively.

See Section VI.G of this release discussing Rule 13n-7.

1118

See Section VI.H.3 of this release discussing Rule 13n-8.
314

assist in its oversight of SDRs, which will help ensure an orderly and transparent SBS market.
5.

Disclosure

As discussed above, Rule 13n-10 requires SDRs to provide certain specific disclosures to
a market participant before accepting any data from that market participant or upon a market
participant’s request. 1119 These disclosures will help market participants understand the potential
risks and costs associated with using an SDR’s services, as well as the protections and services
available to them.
6.

Chief Compliance Officer; Compliance Reports and Financial Reports

As discussed above, Rule 13n-11 requires an SDR’s CCO to establish certain procedures
relating to the remediation of noncompliance issues as well as prepare and sign an annual
compliance report, which is filed with the Commission. 1120 Rule 13n-11 also requires that a
financial report be prepared and filed with the Commission as an official filing in accordance
with the EDGAR Filer Manual and include, as part of the official filing, an Interactive Data
Financial Report filed in accordance with Rule 407 of Regulation S-T. The information
collected under this rule will help ensure compliance by SDRs with the federal securities laws
and the rules and regulations thereunder as well as assist the Commission in overseeing SDRs.
7.

Other Provisions Relevant to the Collection of Information

As discussed above, Rule 13n-4(c)(1) requires SDRs to comply with certain requirements
relating to market access to services and data, including establishment of certain policies and
procedures and clearly stated objective criteria. Rule 13n-4(c)(2)(iv) requires SDRs to establish,
maintain, and enforce policies and procedures regarding the skills and expertise, understanding
1119

See Section VI.I.2.c of this release discussing Rule 13n-10.

1120

See Section VI.J of this release discussing Rule 13n-11.
315

of responsibilities, and sound judgment of the SDRs’ senior management and members of the
board or committee that has the authority to act on behalf of the board. Rule 13n-4(c)(3) requires
SDRs to establish and enforce written conflicts of interest policies and procedures; to establish,
maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and
mitigate conflicts of interest on an ongoing basis; and to establish, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures regarding their noncommercial and commercial use of transaction
information. Rule 13n-5(b)(6) requires SDRs to establish procedures and provide facilities
reasonably designed to effectively resolve disputes regarding the accuracy of the transaction data
and positions that are recorded in the SDRs. Rules 13n-4(b)(8) and 13n-9 require SDRs to
establish, maintain, and enforce policies, procedures, and safeguards regarding privacy and
misappropriation or misuse of certain information. 1121 The information collected pursuant to
these provisions will help ensure a transparent and orderly SBS market, protect market
participants’ privacy, and facilitate Commission oversight of SDRs.

Respondents
1.

Registration Requirements, Form SDR, and Withdrawal from Registration

As discussed above, the registration requirements of Rules 13n-1, 13n-2, 13n-3, 13n11(a), and Form SDR apply to every U.S. person performing the functions of an SDR and every
non-U.S. person performing the functions of an SDR within the United States, absent an
exemption.1122 Commission staff is aware of seven persons that have, to date, filed applications
for registration with the CFTC as swap data repositories, three of which have withdrawn their
applications and four of which are provisionally registered with the CFTC. It is reasonable to
1121

See Section VI.I.1.c of this release discussing Rule 13n-9.

1122

See Section VI.K of this release discussing Rule 13n-12 (“SDR Exemption”).
316

estimate that a similar number of persons provisionally registered with the CFTC may seek to
register with the Commission as SDRs. Therefore, the Commission continues to estimate, for
PRA purposes, that ten persons may register with the Commission as SDRs. The Commission
also continues to estimate, for PRA purposes, that three of the ten respondents may be nonresident SDRs subject to the additional requirements of Rule 13n-1(f). The Commission
received no comments on its estimate of the number of non-resident SDRs and continues to
believe that this estimate is reasonable. Although non-resident SDRs may be able to take
advantage of the SDR Exemption, the Commission conservatively estimates for PRA purposes
that none of the three would rely on the exemption.
2.

SDR Duties, Data Collection and Maintenance, and Direct Electronic
Access

The duties, data collection and maintenance, and direct electronic access requirements of
Rules 13n-4(b), 13n-5, and 13n-6 as a general matter, apply to all SDRs, absent an exemption.
Thus, for these provisions, the Commission estimates that there will be 10 respondents.
3.

Recordkeeping

The recordkeeping requirements of Rule 13n-7 apply to all SDRs, absent an exemption.
Thus, for this rule, the Commission estimates that there will be 10 respondents.
4.

Reports

The report requirement of Rule 13n-8 applies to all SDRs, absent an exemption. Thus,
for this rule, the Commission estimates that there will be 10 respondents.
5.

Disclosure

The disclosure requirements of Rule 13n-10 apply to all SDRs, absent an exemption.
Thus, for this rule, the Commission estimates that there will be 10 respondents.

317

6.

Chief Compliance Officer; Compliance Reports and Financial Reports

The provisions regarding CCOs set forth in Rule 13n-11 apply to all SDRs, absent an
exemption. Thus, for this rule, the Commission estimates that there will be 10 respondents.
7.

Other Provisions Relevant to the Collection of Information

The remaining requirements of the SDR Rules 1123 relevant to the collection of
information, specifically Rules 13n-4(c), 13n-5(b)(6), and 13n-4(b)(8) and 13n-9, apply to all
SDRs, absent an exemption. Thus, for these provisions, the Commission estimates that there will
be 10 respondents.
As stated above, no commenters addressed any of these estimates. 1124
D.

Total Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burden

The Commission received no comments on any of the estimates provided in the
Proposing Release. The Commission has, however, revised the burden associated with
completing Form SDR to reflect some additional material incorporated from Form SIP to
accommodate SDRs’ registration as SIPs and to reflect a revision to the disclosure of business
affiliations. The Commission has also made a change to correct a calculation error. 1125 Other
than these changes, the Commission’s estimates remain unchanged from the Proposing Release.
1.

Registration Requirements, Form SDR, and Withdrawal from Registration

Rule 13n-1(b) and Rule 13n-3(a) (which relates to successor SDRs as described above)
require SDRs to apply for registration using Form SDR and file the form electronically in tagged

As noted above, “SDR Rules” means Rules 13n-1 to 13n-12.

1124

See Section VII of this release discussing comments related to the collection of
information.

1125

In one minor respect, the calculation of the burden on non-resident SDRs under Rule
13n-1(f) has been revised to correct a calculation error, which slightly reduces the burden
hours incurred by non-resident SDRs. See infra note 1136 and the accompanying text.

data format with the Commission in accordance with the instructions to the form. 1126 Further,
Rule 13n-1(e) requires SDRs to designate an agent for service of process on Form SDR, and
Rule 13n-11(a) requires SDRs to identify their CCOs on Form SDR. For purposes of the PRA,
the Commission initially estimated that it would take an SDR approximately 400 hours to
complete the initial Form SDR with the information required, including all exhibits to Form
SDR. 1127 The Commission based this estimate on the number of hours necessary to complete
Form SIP because Form SDR was based on Form SIP and incorporated many of the provisions
of Form SIP. 1128 The Commission continues to estimate, based on Form SIP, that it will initially
take an SDR 400 hours to complete the proposed portions of Form SDR with the information
required, including all exhibits thereto, 1129 and now estimates that it will take an SDR an
additional 81 hours to complete Form SDR to reflect the additional burden hours discussed
below.
As noted above, the Commission has revised Form SDR to incorporate certain provisions
from Form SIP to allow SDRs to register as both SDRs and SIPs using Form SDR. 1130 The
Commission believes that the burden of filing Form SDR should be adjusted to reflect these
1126

See Sections VI.A and VI.C.3 of this release discussing Rule 13n-1(b) and Rule 13n-3(a),
respectively.

The Commission calculated in 2011 that Form SIP would take 400 hours to complete.
See Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request, 76 FR 30984 (May 27, 2011)
(outlining the Commission’s most recent calculations regarding the PRA burdens for
Form SIP) (“SIP PRA Filing”). While the requirements of Form SIP and Form SDR are
not identical, the Commission believes that there is sufficient similarity for PRA purposes
that the burden will be roughly equivalent.

discussing changes to proposed Form SDR to incorporate the additional information
requested on Form SIP of applicants for registration as a SIP.

revisions. Because of the overlap between Form SDR and Form SIP, the Commission initially
estimated that SDRs would need only one-quarter of the time to complete Form SIP, or 100
hours, when registering with the Commission as SIPs separately on Form SIP. 1131 The
Commission believes that this estimate of the burden of an SDR to register as a SIP using Form
SDR should be reduced to 80 hours because (1) SDRs will not have to process and file two
separate forms; (2) SDRs will not have to provide duplicate information in two forms; and (3)
SDRs will not have to prepare and file duplicate exhibits to two forms. The Commission
believes that 80 hours represents a reasonable estimate of the additional burden hours that SDRs
will incur in responding to the provisions incorporated from Form SIP into Form SDR.
Moreover, as discussed above, the Commission is revising Form SDR from the proposal
by requiring disclosure of business affiliations in the “derivatives industry” rather than the “OTC
derivatives industry” for an applicant’s designated CCO, officers, directors, governors, and
persons performing functions similar to any of the foregoing, and the members of all standing
committees. 1132 The Commission believes that SDRs will incur an additional burden in replying
to this disclosure, which may require disclosure of more business affiliations than would have
been disclosed under Form SDR, as proposed. The Commission believes that 1 hour represents a
reasonable estimate of the additional burden hours that each SDR will incur in responding to the
revised disclosure requirement.
1131

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75260, supra note 8 (“Any entity that
is required to complete proposed Form SDR also would have to complete Form SIP.
Because of the substantial overlap in the forms, much of the burden for completing Form
SIP would be subsumed in completing proposed Form SDR. Therefore, the Commission
preliminarily estimates that, having completed a proposed Form SDR, an entity would
need only one-quarter of the time to then complete Form SIP, or 100 hours (specifically,
37.5 hours of legal compliance work and 62.5 hours of clerical compliance work).”).

1132

See Section VI.A.1.c of this release discussing Form SDR.
320

As noted above, the Commission estimates that 10 respondents will be subject to this
burden. 1133 Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the one-time initial registration burden
for all SDRs is approximately 4810 burden hours. 1134 The Commission believes that SDRs will,
as a general matter, prepare Form SDR internally, except as otherwise discussed below. In the
Proposing Release, the Commission solicited comments as to whether SDRs would outsource
this requirement, but the Commission did not receive any comments in this regard. 1135
Under Rule 13n-1(f), a non-resident SDR must (i) certify that the SDR can, as a matter of
law, and will provide the Commission with prompt access to the SDR’s books and records and
can, as a matter of law, and will submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission
and (ii) provide an opinion of counsel that the SDR can, as a matter of law, provide the
Commission with access to the books and records of such SDR and can, as a matter of law,
submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission. This creates an additional
burden for non-resident SDRs. The Commission estimates, based on similar requirements of
Form 20-F, that this additional burden will add 1 hour and $900 in outside legal costs per
respondent. 1136 As stated above, the Commission believes that there will be three respondents to
1133

See Section VII.C.1 of this release discussing respondents to the registration
requirements and Form SDR.

1134

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (400 hours for the burden of
Form SDR, as proposed) + (80 hours for the burden of responding to additional
provisions incorporated from Form SIP) + (1 hour for the burden of responding to the
revised disclosure of business affiliations) x 10 SDRs = 4810.

Foreign Bank Exemption from the Insider Lending Prohibition of Exchange Act Section
13(k), Exchange Act Release No. 49616 (Apr. 26, 2004), 69 FR 24016, 24022 (Apr. 30,
2004) (outlining the Commission’s calculations regarding the PRA burdens resulting
from having to provide a legal opinion and additional disclosure required by Instruction 3
to Item 7.B to Form 20-F). The Commission calculates that the certification and opinion
of counsel would result in an additional burden to non-resident SDRs of 3.25 hours, of
321

this collection, for a total additional burden of 3 hours and $2,700 for non-resident SDRs to
comply with Rule 13n-1(f). 1137
SDRs are also required to amend Form SDR pursuant to Rule 13n-1(d) annually as well
as when information in certain items is or becomes inaccurate. Amendments are also permitted
in certain situations involving successor SDRs pursuant to Rule 13n-3(b). 1138 The Commission
believes that these amendments represent the ongoing annual burdens of Form SDR and Rules
13n-1(d) and 13n-3(b). 1139 The Commission estimates that the ongoing annualized burden for
complying with these registration amendment requirements will be approximately 12 burden

which approximately 1 hour would be incurred by the non-resident SDRs themselves and
2.25 hours would be incurred by outside legal counsel, which would cost approximately
$900 ($900 = 2.25 hours (portion of estimated burden incurred by outside legal counsel)
× $400 (hourly rate for an outside attorney)). The Commission continues to estimate the
hourly rate for an outside attorney at $400 per hour, based on industry sources. See
Registration of Municipal Advisors, Exchange Act Release No. 70462 (Sep. 20, 2013),
78 FR 67468, 67593 n.1538 (Nov. 12, 2013) (estimating the cost of an outside attorney to
be $400 per hour). In the Proposing Release, the Commission mistakenly estimated the
burden to be 3 hours incurred by each non-resident SDR (in addition to $900 incurred by
each SDR in connection with hiring outside legal counsel). Proposing Release, 75 FR at
77348, supra note 2.
1137

See Section VII.C.1 of this release discussing respondents to the registration
requirements and Form SDR. The base burden of 4000 hours includes resident and nonresident SDRs. The 3 hour and $2700 figures are the additional costs as a result of Rule
13n-1(f) for non-resident SDRs not already accounted for in the 4000 hour figure.

1138

See Section VI.C.3 of this release discussing Rule 13n-3(b).

1139

When estimating the burden associated with Form SIP, the Commission did not
separately estimate the burden associated with amendments on Form SIP because the
Commission believed that the annual burden of Form SIP encompassed the burden of
amending Form SIP. SIP PRA Filing, 76 FR 30984, supra note 1129 (“This annual
reporting and recordkeeping burden does not include the burden hours or cost of
amending a Form SIP because the Commission has already overstated the compliance
burdens by assuming that the Commission will receive one initial registration pursuant to
Rule 609 on Form SIP a year.”) Although the Commission is basing its estimate of the
burden of Form SDR on its estimate of the burden of Form SIP, the Commission is
separately estimating the burden of amendments on Form SDR.
322

hours for each SDR per amendment 1140 and approximately 120 burden hours for all SDRs per
amendment. Rule 13n-1(d) requires one annual amendment on Form SDR as well as interim
amendments on Form SDR when certain reported information therein is or becomes inaccurate
or, under Rule 13n-3(b), in certain circumstances involving successor SDRs, as discussed
above. 1141 When Form ADV was amended in 2010, the Commission estimated that there were 2
amendments per year for that form. 1142 The Commission believes that 2 amendments will be a
reasonable estimate for the number of amendments per year to correct inaccurate information or
in situations involving successor SDRs because amendments on Form ADV, like amendments on
Form SDR, are required annually as well as when certain information on Form ADV becomes
inaccurate. 1143 Thus, the Commission estimates that respondents will be required to file on
average a total of 3 amendments per year, 2 amendments plus the required annual amendment.
Therefore, the Commission estimates that each respondent will have an average annual burden of
1140

When amendments to Form ADV were proposed in 2008, the Commission estimated the
hour burden for amendments to be roughly 3% of the initial burden. Amendments to
Form ADV, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 2711 (Mar. 3, 2008), 73 FR 13958,
13979 (Mar. 14, 2008). In that proposal, the initial burden was calculated to be 22.25
hours per respondent and 0.75 hours per respondent for amendments. The Commission
believes that a similar ratio will apply to filers of Form SDR because filers of Form
ADV, like filers of Form SDR, are required to file amendments annually as well as when
certain information on Form ADV becomes inaccurate. See Form ADV: General
Instructions, available at http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/formadv-instructions.pdf.
Thus, the Commission estimates that the annual burden of filing one amendment on Form
SDR will be 3% of the 400 hour initial burden, or 12 hours.

1141

See Sections VI.A.4.c and VI.C.3 of this release discussing Rule 13n-1(d) and Rule 13n3(b), respectively.

1142

Amendments to Form ADV, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 3060 (July 28, 2010),
75 FR 49234, 49257 (Aug. 12, 2010). Although this information is based upon
investment adviser statistics, the Commission believes that, for PRA purposes, the
differences between investment advisers and SDRs are minimal.

1143

See Form ADV: General Instructions, available at
http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/formadv-instructions.pdf.
323

36 hours for a total estimated average annual burden of 360 hours. 1144 The Commission believes
that SDRs will conduct this work internally.
SDRs may withdraw from registration by filing a withdrawal from registration on Form
SDR electronically in a tagged data format. An SDR withdrawing from registration must
designate on Form SDR a person to serve as the custodian of the SDR’s books and records. An
SDR must also update any inaccurate information. The Commission believes that an SDR’s
withdrawal from registration on Form SDR will be substantially similar to its most recently filed
Form SDR. The Form SDR being filed in this circumstance will therefore already be
substantially complete and as a result, the burden will not be as great as the burden of filing an
application for registration on Form SDR. Rather, the Commission believes that the burden of
filing a withdrawal from registration on Form SDR will be akin to filing an amendment on Form
SDR. Thus, the Commission estimates that the one-time burden of filing a Form SDR to
withdraw from registration will be approximately 12 burden hours for each SDR and
approximately 120 burden hours for all SDRs.
2.

SDR Duties, Data Collection and Maintenance, and Direct Electronic
Access

As discussed above, Rules 13n-4(b)(2) and (4), and 13n-5 require SDRs to accept and
maintain data, including transaction data, received from third parties and to calculate and
maintain positions.1145 Rule 13n-4(b)(5) requires SDRs to provide direct electronic access to the
Commission or its designees. Rules 13n-4(b)(3) and 13n-5(b)(1)(iii) require SDRs to confirm
1144

The 36 hour figure is the result of the estimated burden hour per SDR per amendment
(12) times the estimated number of amendments per year (3). The 360 hour figure is the
result of the estimated burden per SDR (36) times the number of SDRs (10).

1145

See Sections VI.D.2.c, VI.E, and VI.F.3 of this release discussing Rules 13n-4(b)(2) and
(4), 13n-5, and 13n-6, respectively.
324

the accuracy of the data submitted and to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to satisfy themselves that the transaction data that has been
submitted to the SDRs is complete and accurate. In addition, Rule 13n-5(b)(4) requires SDRs to
maintain the transaction data and related identifying information for not less than five years after
the applicable SBS expires and historical positions for not less than five years. 1146 This
obligation would continue even if an SDR ceases to be registered or ceases doing business. 1147
SDRs are required to make and keep current a plan to ensure compliance with this
requirement. 1148
The Commission estimates that the average one-time start-up burden per SDR of
establishing systems compliant with all of the requirements described in this section, including
the SBS data maintenance requirements of Rules 13n-5(b)(4), (7), and (8), will be 42,000 hours
and $10 million in information technology costs. Based on the expected number of respondents,
the Commission estimates a total start-up cost of 420,000 hours and $100 million in information
technology costs. The Commission further estimates that the average ongoing annual costs of
these systems to be 25,200 hours and $6 million per respondent or a total of 252,000 hours and
$60 million for a total ongoing annual burden.
Each SDR is also required to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures, reasonably designed: (1) under Rule 13n-5(b)(1), for the reporting of complete and
accurate transaction data to the SDR and to satisfy itself that such information is complete and
1146

This data is required to be maintained in a place and format that is readily accessible and
usable to the Commission and other persons with authority to access or view the
information and is also required to be maintained in an electronic format that is nonrewritable and non-erasable.

accurate; (2) under Rule 13n-5(b)(2), to calculate positions for all persons with open SBSs for
which the SDR maintains records; (3) under Rule 13n-5(b)(3), to ensure transaction data and
positions that the SDR maintains are complete and accurate; (4) under Rule 13n-5(b)(5), to
prevent any provision in a valid SBS from being invalidated or modified through the procedures
or operations of the SDR; and (5) under Rule 13n-6, with respect to those systems that support or
are integrally related to the performance of the SDR’s activities, to ensure that those systems
provide adequate levels of capacity, integrity, resiliency, availability, and security. While these
policies and procedures will vary in exact cost, the Commission estimates that they will require
an average of 210 hours per respondent per policy and procedure to prepare and implement. The
Commission further estimates that these policies and procedures will require a total of $100,000
for outside legal costs per SDR. 1149 In sum, the Commission estimates the initial burden for all
respondents to be 10,500 hours and $1,000,000 for outside legal costs. 1150 The Commission
based these estimates upon those estimates the Commission used with regards to establishing
policies and procedures regarding Regulation NMS. 1151 Once these policies and procedures are
established, the Commission estimates that it will take, on average, 60 hours annually to
1149

This figure is the result of an estimated $400 an hour cost for outside legal services (as
discussed in supra note 1136) times 50 hours of outside legal consulting per policy and
procedure, times 5 policies and procedures.

1150

The 10,500 hour figure is the result of the number of hours per policy and procedure
(210) times the number of policies and procedures required by these provisions (5), times
the number of respondents (10). The $1,000,000 figure is the result of the outside dollar
cost per respondent ($100,000) times the number of respondents (10).

1151

Regulation NMS, Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, 2005), 70 FR 37496, 37577
(June 29, 2005) (“Regulation NMS Adopting Release”). The Commission based these
estimates on those for non-SRO trading centers rather than for SRO trading centers
because the Commission believes that, for PRA purposes, non-SRO trading centers’
burdens are more like those that SDRs will face under the SDR Rules. Like non-SRO
trading centers, SDRs are not SROs and handle data regarding trades.
326

maintain each of these policies and procedures per respondent, with a total estimated average
annual burden of 3,000 hours for all respondents. 1152 The Commission believes that SDRs will
conduct this maintenance work internally.
As discussed above, the Commission is not adopting the more specific requirements of
proposed Rule 13n-6(b)(1), but is instead adopting the core policies and procedures
requirement. 1153 The Commission continues to believe, however, that the 210 hour per
respondent estimate for adopting policies and procedures is applicable because Rule 13n-6
continues to require SDRs to adopt policies and procedures. The Commission believes that the
210 hour estimate is a reasonable estimate because the estimate is used in other contexts to
estimate the burdens of creating policies and procedures and the Commission expects that the
policies and procedures required by Rule 13n-6 would result in a comparable burden to
SDRs. 1154 Also as discussed above, the Commission is not adopting proposed Rules 13n-6(b)(3)
and (4). 1155 Thus, the Commission is no longer including the estimated burden of those proposed
rules in the overall burdens discussed in this release.
3.

Recordkeeping

Every SDR is required, under Rule 13n-7(a)(1), to make and keep current a record for
each office listing, by name or title, each person who, without delay, can explain the types of
records the SDR maintains at that office. Also, under Rule 13n-7(a)(2), every SDR is required to
make and keep current a record listing officers, managers, or persons performing similar
1152

The 3,000 hour figure is the result of the estimated average hourly burden to maintain
each policy and procedure (60), times the total number of policies and procedures
required under this requirement (5), times the total number of SDRs (10).

1153

See Section VI.F.3 of this release discussing Rule 13n-6.

327

functions with responsibility for establishing the policies and procedures of the SDR that are
reasonably designed to ensure compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. The Commission estimates that these records will create an initial burden, at a
maximum, of 1 hour per respondent, for a total initial burden of 10 hours. The Commission
estimates that the ongoing annual burden will be 0.17 hours (10 minutes) per respondent to keep
these records current and to store these documents based on the Commission’s estimates for
similar requirements for broker-dealers. 1156 This results in a total ongoing annual burden of 1.7
hours. The Commission believes that SDRs will conduct this work internally.
Rule 13n-7(b) requires each SDR to keep and preserve at least one copy of all documents
made or received by it in the course of its business as such, other than the transaction data and
positions collected and maintained pursuant to Rule 13n-5. These records are required to be kept
for a period of not less than five years, the first two years in a place that is immediately available
to representatives of the Commission for inspection and examination. 1157 Upon the request of
any representative of the Commission, an SDR is required to furnish promptly documents
required to be kept and preserved by it pursuant to Rules 13n-7(a) or (b) to such a representative.
As discussed above, Rule 13n-7(b) is intended to set forth the recordkeeping obligations of SDRs
and thereby facilitate implementation of the inspection and examination of SDRs by
representatives of the Commission.1158 Based on the Commission’s experience with
1156

See Books and Records Requirements for Brokers and Dealers Under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Exchange Act Release No. 44992 (Oct. 26, 2001), 66 FR 55818,
55836 (Nov. 2, 2001) (regarding the collection of information pursuant to Rules 17a3(a)(21) and (22)).

1157

This obligation will continue even if an SDR withdraws from registration or ceases doing
business. See Rule 13n-7(c).

1158

See Section VI.G.2.c of this release discussing Rule 13n-7(b).
328

recordkeeping costs and consistent with prior burden estimates for similar provisions, 1159 the
Commission estimates that this requirement will create an initial burden of 345 hours and $1800
in information technology costs per respondent, for a total initial burden of 3450 hours and
$18,000 for all respondents. The Commission further estimates that the ongoing annual burden
will be 279 hours per respondent and a total ongoing annual burden of 2790 hours for all
respondents.
4.

Reports

Under Rule 13n-8, SDRs are required to report promptly to the Commission, in a form
and manner acceptable to the Commission, such information as the Commission determines
necessary or appropriate for the Commission to perform the duties of the Commission. For PRA
purposes only, the Commission estimates that it will request these reports a maximum of once
per year, per respondent. For PRA purposes only, the Commission estimates that these reports
will be limited to information that will have been already compiled under the SDR Rules and
thus require only 1 hour per response to compile and transmit. Thus, the Commission estimates,
for PRA purposes only, that the total annual burden for these reports to be 10 hours for all
respondents. The Commission believes that SDRs will conduct this work internally.
As discussed above, the Commission is not adopting proposed Rule 13n-6(b)(2). 1160
Thus, the Commission is no longer including the estimated burden of that proposed rule in the
overall burdens discussed in this release.

Disclosure

As discussed above, pursuant to Rule 13n-10, SDRs are required to provide certain
disclosures to certain market participants. 1161 The Commission estimates that the average onetime start-up burden per SDR of preparing this disclosure document is 97.5 hours and $4,400 of
external legal costs and $5,000 of external compliance consulting costs, resulting in a total initial
burden of 975 hours and $94,000 for all respondents. This estimate reflects the Commission’s
experience with and burden estimates for similar disclosure document requirements applied to
investment advisers with 1000 or fewer employees and as a result of its discussions with market
participants. 1162 Because the Commission expects that SDRs will be able to provide this
disclosure document electronically, the Commission expects that this requirement will result in
an average annual burden, after the initial creation of the disclosure document, of 1 hour per
respondent, with a total annual burden of 10 hours for all respondents. The Commission believes
that SDRs will conduct this ongoing annual work internally.

Chief Compliance Officer; Compliance Reports and Financial Reports

Under Rules 13n-11(c)(6) and (7), an SDR’s CCO is responsible for, among other things,
establishing procedures for the remediation of noncompliance issues identified by the CCO, and
establishing and following appropriate procedures for the handling, management response,
remediation, retesting, and closing of noncompliance issues. Based on the Commission’s
estimates regarding Regulation NMS, 1163 it estimates that on average these two provisions will

burden associated with Form ADV for each medium-sized investment adviser, meaning
an adviser with between 11 and 1,000 employees, to be 97.5 hours).

require 420 hours to implement and 120 hours to administer per year per respondent, for a total
burden of 4200 hours initially and, on average, 1200 hours annually for all respondents. 1164 Also
based on the estimates regarding Regulation NMS, the Commission estimates that SDRs will
incur a total of $40,000 in initial outside legal costs to establish the required procedures as a
result of this burden per respondent, for a total outside cost burden of $400,000 for all
respondents. 1165
A CCO is also required under Rules 13n-11(d), (e), and (g) to prepare and submit annual
compliance reports to the SDR’s board for review before the annual compliance reports are filed
with the Commission. Based upon the Commission’s estimates for similar annual reviews by
CCOs of investment companies, 1166 the Commission estimates that these reports will require on
average 5 hours per respondent per year. Thus, the Commission estimates a total annual burden
of 50 hours for all respondents. The Commission believes that these costs will be internal costs.
Rules 13n-11(f) and (g) require that financial reports be prepared and filed with the
Commission as an official filing in accordance with the EDGAR Filer Manual and include, as
1164

The 420 hour figure is the result of the estimated average burden hours to create one
policy and procedure (210) times the 2 policies and procedures required by these
provisions. The 120 hour figure is the result of the estimated average burden hours to
administer one policy and procedure (60) times the 2 policies and procedures required by
these provisions. The 4200 hour figure is the result of the estimated average burden
hours per respondent to create these policies and procedures (420) times the number of
SDRs (10). The 1200 hour figure is the result of the estimated average burden hours per
respondent to maintain these policies and procedures (120) times the number of SDRs
(10).

1165

$400,000 figure is the result of an estimated $400 an hour cost for outside legal services
(as discussed in supra note 1136) times 50 hours per policy and procedure, times 2
policies and procedures, times the number of SDRs (10).

1166

part of the official filing, an Interactive Data Financial Report filed in accordance with Rule 407
of Regulation S-T. The Commission estimates, based on its experience with entities of similar
size to the respondents to this collection, that preparing and filing the financial reports will
generally require on average 500 hours per respondent and cost $500,000 for independent public
accounting services. Thus, the Commission estimates a total annual burden of 5000 hours and
$5,000,000 for all respondents.
One commenter suggested that “[i]n an attempt to harmonize final [SDR] rules with the
CFTC’s final [swap data repository] rules, the Commission should consider removing Proposed
Rule 240.13n–11(f)(2)’s requirement that each financial report filed with a compliance report is
audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board by
a registered public accounting firm that is qualified and independent unless the [SDR] is under a
separate obligation to provide financial statements.” 1167 The commenter believed that “[t]his
requirement imposes an additional burden for an [SDR] and is not justified in relation to the risks
that an [SDR] would pose to its members” and that “[u]nlike clearing agencies or other entities
supervised by the Commission, an [SDR] does not have financial exposure to its users or
participants that would justify the imposition of this requirement.” 1168 The commenter suggested
that the Commission consider “adopting [instead] the CFTC’s approach in its final [swap data
repository] rules, which require [a swap data repository’s] financial statements be prepared in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles . . . .” 1169

As discussed further below, although the Commission understands that SDRs will incur
costs in hiring and retaining qualified public accounting firms, the Commission believes that
obtaining audited financial reports from SDRs is important given the significant role the
Commission believes that SDRs will play in the SBS market. 1170 Given this significant role, the
Commission believes that it is important to obtain audited financial reports from SDRs in order
to determine whether or not they have sufficient financial resources to continue operations.
While the Commission recognizes that Rule 13n-11(f)(2) may, in some cases, be more costly
than the CFTC’s requirement of quarterly unaudited financial statements, the Commission
believes that the additional burden, where it exists, is justified by the benefits of requiring
audited financial statements.
The compliance reports and financial reports filed with the Commission are required to
be filed in a tagged data format. The compliance reports must be filed in a tagged data format in
accordance with the instructions contained in the EDGAR Filer Manual, 1171 and the financial
reports must be provided as an official filing in accordance with the EDGAR Filer Manual and
include, as part of the official filing, an Interactive Data Financial Report filed in accordance
with Rule 407 of Regulation S-T. 1172 These requirements will create an additional burden on
respondents beyond the preparation of these reports. The Commission estimates, based on its
experience with other tagged data initiatives, that these requirements will add a burden of an
average of 54 hours and $22,772 in outside software and other costs per respondent per year,
creating an estimated total annual burden of 540 hours and $227,720 for all respondents to tag

Other Provisions Relevant to the Collection of Information

Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(iii) requires an SDR to establish, monitor on an ongoing basis, and
enforce clearly stated objective criteria that would permit fair, open, and not unreasonably
discriminatory access to services offered and data maintained by the SDR as well as fair, open,
and not unreasonably discriminatory participation by market participants and others that seek to
connect to or link with the SDRs. For PRA purposes only, the Commission believes that this
should be a lesser burden than for written policies and procedures because such criteria may not
need to be as detailed or intricate as written policies and procedures. Thus, the Commission
estimates that this provision will require 157.5 hours to implement, with an associated outside
legal cost of $15,000 per respondent. 1173 This results in an estimate of an initial burden for this
requirement for all respondents of 1575 hours and $150,000. The Commission estimates that the
average annual burden will be 45 hours per respondent, for a total estimated average annual
burden of 450 hours for all respondents. 1174 The Commission believes that SDRs will conduct
this work internally.
1173

These numbers are based on 75% of the 210 hour and $20,000 (50 hours of outside legal
costs at $400 an hour) estimates to create one set of written policies and procedures under
Regulation NMS for non-SRO trading centers. See Regulation NMS Adopting Release,
supra note 1151. This is based on an estimate that this requirement will create 75% of the
burden of creating written policies and procedures under Regulation NMS. The
Commission believes that the 75% assumption is appropriate because the Commission
believes that Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(iii) imposes a lesser burden than the written policies and
procedures required by other SDR Rules because it requires only written criteria and not
full policies and procedures.

1174

These numbers are 75% of the 60 hour estimates of the ongoing burden regarding one set
of written policies and procedures under Regulation NMS for non-SRO trading centers.
See Regulation NMS Adopting Release, supra note 1151. This is based on an estimate
334

Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(iv) requires an SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to review any prohibition or limitation of any person with
respect to access to services offered, directly or indirectly, or data maintained by the SDR and to
grant such person access to such services or data if such person has been discriminated against
unfairly. Based on the Commission’s estimates regarding Regulation NMS, 1175 it estimates that,
on average, this provision will require 210 hours to implement and 60 hours to administer per
year per respondent, for a total burden of 2100 hours initially and 600 hours on average,
annually. The Commission also estimates, based on this earlier estimate, that SDRs will incur a
total of $20,000 in initial outside legal costs to establish the required policies and procedures as a
result of this provision per respondent for a total outside cost burden of $200,000 for all
respondents. 1176
Rule 13n-4(c)(2)(iv) requires an SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the SDR’s senior management and each
member of the board or committee that has the authority to act on behalf of the board possess
that this requirement will create 75% of the ongoing burden of written policies and
procedures under Regulation NMS. The Commission believes that the 75% assumption
is appropriate because the Commission believes that Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(iii) imposes a
lesser burden than the written policies and procedures required by other SDR Rules
because it requires only written criteria and not full policies and procedures.
1175

See Regulation NMS Adopting Release, supra note 1151. These estimates are based on
100% of the 210 hour estimate to create one set of written policies and procedures and
100% of the 60 hour estimate of the ongoing burden regarding one set of written policies
and procedures under Regulation NMS for non-SRO trading centers. The Commission
believes that the 100% assumption is appropriate because Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(iv) requires
written policies and procedures.

1176

This figure is the result of an estimated $400 an hour cost for outside legal services (as
discussed in supra note 1136) times 50 hours per policy and procedure, times 1 policy
and procedure, times the number of SDRs (10). The Commission believes that SDRs will
use outside counsel to initially create these policies and procedures because SDRs just
beginning operations may not have sufficient in-house legal staff.
335

requisite skills and expertise to fulfill their responsibilities in the management and governance of
the SDR, to have a clear understanding of their responsibilities, and to exercise sound judgment
about the SDR’s affairs. Based on the Commission’s estimates regarding similar requirements in
Regulation NMS, 1177 it estimates that, on average, this provision will require 210 hours to
implement and 60 hours to administer per year per respondent, for a total burden of 2100 hours
initially and 600 hours on average, annually. The Commission also estimates, based on this
earlier estimate, that SDRs will initially incur a total of $20,000 in outside legal costs to establish
the required policies and procedures as a result of this provision per respondent for a total outside
cost burden of $200,000 for all respondents. 1178 The Commission believes that SDRs will
conduct the ongoing administration of this provision internally.
Rule 13n-4(c)(3) addresses the conflict of interest requirements governing SDRs. In
particular, each SDR is required to establish and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to minimize conflicts of interest. This includes establishing, maintaining,
and enforcing written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and mitigate
potential and existing conflicts of interest in the SDR’s decision-making process on an ongoing
basis. It also includes establishing, maintaining, and enforcing written policies and procedures
regarding the SDR’s non-commercial and commercial use of the SBS transaction information
that it receives. Based on the Commission’s estimates regarding Regulation NMS, 1179 it
estimates that on average these two requirements will require 420 hours to implement and 120
1177

See Regulation NMS Adopting Release, supra note 1151.

1178

This figure is the result of an estimated $400 an hour cost for outside legal services (as
noted in supra note 1136) times 50 hours per policy and procedure, times 1 policy and
procedure, times the number of SDRs (10).

1179

See Regulation NMS Adopting Release, supra note 1151.
336

hours to administer per year per respondent, for a total burden of 4200 hours initially and 1200
hours on average annually. 1180 Also based on the Regulation NMS estimates regarding policies
and procedures, the Commission estimates that SDRs will incur a total of $40,000 in initial
outside legal costs to establish the required policies and procedures as a result of this provision
per respondent for a total outside cost burden of $400,000 for all respondents. 1181
Rule 13n-5(b)(6) requires that every SDR establish procedures and provide facilities
reasonably designed to effectively resolve disputes over the accuracy of the transaction data and
positions that are recorded in the SDR. For PRA purposes only, the Commission believes that
this is a greater burden than that for written policies and procedures alone because SDRs will
also be required to provide facilities. Thus, the Commission estimates that Rule 13n-5(b)(6) will
require 315 hours for each respondent to implement. 1182 There will likely be a need for a
respondent to consult with outside legal counsel, which the Commission estimates will cost
1180

The 420 hour figure is the result of the estimated average burden hours to create one
policy and procedure (210) times the 2 policies and procedures required by these
provisions. The 120 hour figure is the result of the estimated average burden hours to
administer one policy and procedure (60) times the 2 policies and procedures required by
these provisions. The 4200 hour figure is the result of the estimated average burden
hours per respondent to create these policies and procedures (420) times the number of
SDRs (10). The 1200 hour figure is the result of the estimated average burden hours per
respondent to maintain these policies and procedures (120) times the number of SDRs
(10).

1181

This $400,000 figure is the result of an estimated $400 an hour cost for outside legal
services (as discussed in supra note 1136) times 50 hours, times 2 policies and
procedures, times the number of SDRs (10).

1182

This number is 150% of the 210 hour estimate to create one set of written policies and
procedures under Regulation NMS for non-SRO trading centers. See Regulation NMS
Adopting Release, supra note 1151. This is based on an estimate that Rule 13n-5(b)(6)
will create 150% of the burden of creating written policies and procedures under
Regulation NMS because, in addition to establishing procedures, SDRs will also be
required to provide facilities reasonably designed to effectively resolve disputes over the
accuracy of the transaction data and positions that are recorded in the SDR.
337

$30,000 per respondent. 1183 Thus, the Commission estimates a total initial burden for all
respondents of 3150 hours and $300,000 in outside costs. The Commission estimates the
ongoing average annual burden of this requirement to be 90 hours per respondent for a total of
900 hours for the estimated total annual burden for all respondents. 1184 The Commission
believes that SDRs will conduct this ongoing work internally.
Rules 13n-4(b)(8) and 13n-9 address privacy requirements for SDRs. Rule 13n-4(b)(8)
requires SDRs to maintain the privacy of any and all SBS transaction information that the SDR
receives from a SBS dealer, counterparty, or any registered entity as prescribed in Rule 13n-9.
Rule 13n-9(b)(1) requires each SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to protect the privacy of any and all SBS transaction information
that the SDR receives from any SBS dealer, counterparty, or any registered entity. Based on the
Commission’s estimates regarding Regulation NMS, 1185 it estimates that, on average, these
provisions will require 420 hours to implement and 120 hours to administer per year per
1183

This number is 150% of the estimate of outside legal costs (50 hours) to create one set of
written policies and procedures under Regulation NMS for non-SRO trading centers, at
an estimate of $400 per hour. See Regulation NMS Adopting Release, supra note 1151.
This is based on an estimate that Rule 13n-5(b)(6) will create 150% of the burden of
creating written policies and procedures under Regulation NMS because, in addition to
establishing procedures, SDRs will also be required to provide facilities reasonably
designed to effectively resolve disputes over the accuracy of the transaction data and
positions that are recorded in the SDR.

1184

These numbers are based on 150% of the 60 hour estimate of the ongoing burden
regarding one set of written policies and procedures under Regulation NMS for non-SRO
trading centers. See Regulation NMS Adopting Release, supra note 1151. This is based
on an estimate that Rule 13n-5(b)(6) will create 150% of the ongoing burden of written
policies and procedures under Regulation NMS because, in addition to establishing
procedures, SDRs will also be required to provide facilities reasonably designed to
effectively resolve disputes over the accuracy of the transaction data and positions that
are recorded in the SDR.

respondent, for a total burden of 4200 hours initially and 1200 hours on average, annually. 1186
Also based on the Regulation NMS estimates, 1187 the Commission estimates that SDRs will incur
a total of $40,000 in initial outside legal costs to establish the required policies and procedures as
a result of these provisions per respondent for a total outside cost burden of $400,000 for all
respondents. 1188
Rule 13n-9(b)(2) requires each SDR to establish and maintain safeguards, policies, and
procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misappropriation or misuse, directly or indirectly,
of (1) any confidential information received by the SDR, (2) material, nonpublic information,
and/or (3) intellectual property. At a minimum, these safeguards, policies and procedures must
address limiting access to that information and intellectual property, standards pertaining to the
trading by persons associated with the SDR for their personal benefit or the benefit of others, and
adequate oversight. Based on the Commission’s estimates regarding Regulation NMS, 1189 it
estimates that on average this provision will require 210 hours to implement and 60 hours to
administer per year per respondent, for a total burden of 2100 hours initially and 600 hours on

The 420 hour figure is the result of the estimated average burden hours to create one
policy and procedure (210) times the 2 policies and procedures required by these
provisions. The 120 hour figure is the result of the estimated average burden hours to
administer one policy and procedure (60) times the 2 policies and procedures required by
these provisions. The 4200 hour figure is the result of the estimated average burden
hours per respondent to create these policies and procedures (420) times the number of

VIII. Economic Analysis
A.

Introduction

The Commission has considered the economic implications of the SDR Rules and Form
SDR as well as comments regarding the costs and benefits of the SDR Rules and Form SDR. 1198
The Commission is sensitive to the economic consequences and effects of the SDR Rules and
Form SDR, including their costs and benefits. In adopting the SDR Rules and Form SDR, the
Commission has analyzed their costs and benefits, as set forth below, and has been mindful of
the economic consequences of its policy choices. The SDR Rules and Form SDR fulfill the
mandate of the Dodd-Frank Act that the Commission adopt rules governing the registration,
duties, and core principles of SDRs.
As discussed above, the SBS market developed as an opaque OTC market without
centralized trading venues or dissemination of pre- or post-trade pricing and volume
information. 1199 SBS dealers, as intermediaries in SBS transactions, observe order flow and have
access to pricing and volume information that is generally not available to other market
participants. With such access, SBS dealers generally have an informational and competitive
advantage over non-dealer counterparties, granting SBS dealers some degree of market power,
1198

See Further Definition of “Swap,” “Security-Based Swap,” and “Security-Based Swap
Agreement”; Mixed Swaps; Security-Based Swap Agreement Recordkeeping, Securities
Act Release No. 9338 (July 18, 2012), 77 FR 48208, 48332 (Aug. 13, 2012) (noting that
“[t]he programmatic costs and benefits associated with substantive rules applicable to
[SBSs] under Title VII are being addressed in more detail in connection with the
applicable rulemakings implementing Title VII”).

1199

See Section II.A of this release discussing limited information currently available to
market participants.
343

which may enable them to extract economic rents in transactions with those counterparties. This
informational advantage may result in increased transaction costs for less-informed
counterparties relative to a market where all participants have competitive access to information.
In addition to the advantages that an opaque SBS market may give to SBS dealers, the
opacity of the SBS market as described above may also affect current participation levels in the
SBS market. 1200 Certain market participants, including speculative traders who rely on
proprietary trading strategies, may wish to keep their trades anonymous and may prefer to
operate in an opaque SBS market. Hedgers and other market participants that do not benefit
from opacity, however, may be dissuaded from participating in the SBS market by higher
transaction costs and their disadvantageous informational position.
Opacity in the SBS market also limits the ability of market participants to form broad
views of financial market conditions. In capital markets, pricing and volume information
provide signals about liquidity and the quality of investments, including investments in reference
entities underlying derivatives. In the SBS market, where pricing and volume information is not
readily available, market participants may have difficulty assessing investment opportunities as
well as the state of the broader market, or must form assessments with a narrower set of
information than SBS dealers. In an opaque SBS market, difficulty in assessing investment
opportunities and the state of the SBS market may inhibit participation in the SBS market.
While opacity may generally confer a competitive advantage to SBS dealers who observe
the largest share of order flow and limit participation in the SBS market, some features of the
market and market participants may offset these effects. For example, large market participants
that often transact with many SBS dealers are aware of the potential information asymmetries in
1200

See Section II.B of this release.
344

the market. Furthermore, by virtue of their high trading volume, these participants may also
observe a large share of the market, reducing the information advantage afforded to SBS dealers.
SBS dealers may wish to compete for SBS business with the largest counterparties, and these
participants may be able to obtain access to competitive pricing. 1201 Nevertheless, the
Commission generally expects that market participants with proprietary access to information –
in the case of SBS markets, SBS dealers who observe order flow – can benefit from opacity and
earn economic rents from their less-informed counterparties. 1202
It is in this context that the Commission analyzes the economic effects of the SDR Rules
and Form SDR. The Commission envisions that registered SDRs will become an essential part
of the infrastructure of the SBS market. Persons that meet the definition of an SDR will be
required by the SDR Rules to maintain policies and procedures relating to data accuracy and
maintenance, and will be further required by Regulation SBSR to publicly disseminate
transaction-level data, thereby promoting post-trade transparency in the SBS market.
Transparency stemming from the SDR Rules and Regulation SBSR should reduce the
informational advantage of SBS dealers and promote competition among SBS dealers and other
market participants. 1203 This could reduce implicit transaction costs and attract liquidity from
1201

As described in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the non-dealer market participants
transact with four counterparties on average. Cross Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at
31126 n.1329, supra note 3. However, the largest market participants transact with as
many as 50 counterparties, suggesting that dealers compete for business with these
participants.

1202

See, e.g., Richard C. Green, Burton Hollifield, and Norman Schurhoff, Financial
Intermediation and the Costs of Trading in an Opaque Market, 20 Review of Financial
Studies 275 (2007) (estimating that, prior to the introduction of transparency measures in
the municipal bond market, dealers exercised substantial market power, but that market
power decreases with the size of the trade).

1203

See Section II.A of this release.
345

those market participants that do not benefit from opacity, providing more opportunities for
market participants with hedging needs to manage their risks and providing more opportunities
for market participants to access liquidity. Similarly, public dissemination of SBS pricing and
volume information by SDRs pursuant to Regulation SBSR may allow market participants to
incorporate information from the SBS market into their assessments of SBS and non-SBS
investment opportunities, thereby promoting price efficiency and efficient capital allocation.
At the same time, increased quality and quantity of pricing and volume information and
other information available to the Commission about the SBS market may enhance the
Commission’s ability to respond to market developments. As discussed above, DTCC-TIW
voluntarily provides to the Commission data on individual CDS transactions in accordance with
an agreement between the DTCC-TIW and the ODRF. In conjunction with Regulation SBSR,
the SDR Rules should assist the Commission in fulfilling its regulatory mandates and legal
responsibilities such as detecting market manipulation, fraud, and other market abuses by
providing it with greater access to SBS information than that provided under the voluntary
reporting regime. In particular, without an SDR, data on SBS transactions could be dispersed
and might not be readily available to the Commission and others. SDRs may be especially
critical during times of market turmoil, both by giving the Commission information to monitor
risk exposures taken by individual entities or to particular referenced entities, and by promoting
stability through enhanced transparency. Additionally, more available data about the SBS
market should give the Commission better insight into how regulations are affecting, or may
affect, the SBS market, which may allow the Commission to better craft regulations to achieve
desired goals, and therefore, increase regulatory effectiveness.
In adopting the SDR Rules and Form SDR, the Commission has attempted to balance
346

different goals. For example, data fragmentation resulting from multiple SDRs may make it
more difficult for the Commission and to the extent that SBS data is made public, the public, to
aggregate SBS data from multiple SDRs. The Commission could have resolved issues related to
data fragmentation by designating one SDR as the recipient of the information from all other
SDRs in order to provide the Commission with a consolidated location from which to access
SBS data for regulatory monitoring and oversight purposes. Designating one SDR as the data
consolidator, however, could discourage new market entrants, and interfere with competition.
Designating one SDR as data consolidator may also impose an additional cost on market
participants to cover the SDR’s cost for acting as the data consolidator. Similarly, the SDR
Exemption, 1204 which allows certain non-U.S. persons to perform the functions of an SDR within
the United States without registering with the Commission, may reduce potentially duplicative
registration and operating costs by allowing these persons to continue to receive data reported
pursuant to the reporting requirements of a foreign jurisdiction. The SDR Exemption, however,
also increases the risk of data fragmentation to the extent that reporting requirements differ
across jurisdictions and relevant authorities have difficulty accessing data across jurisdictions.
The Commission has attempted to balance the considerations of competition, data fragmentation,
and avoidance of potentially duplicative registration and operating costs in adopting the SDR
Rules.
In assessing the economic impact of the SDR Rules and Form SDR, the Commission
refers to the broader costs and benefits associated with the application of the rules and
interpretations as “programmatic” costs and benefits. These include the costs and benefits of
applying the substantive Title VII requirements to the reporting of transactions by market
1204

See Section VI.K of this release discussing Rule 13n-12.
347

participants, as well as to the functions performed by market infrastructures, including SDRs, in
the global SBS market. The Commission’s analysis also takes into consideration “assessment
costs,” which arise from current and future market participants expending effort to determine
whether they are subject to the SDR Rules. Current and future market participants could incur
expenses in making this determination even if they ultimately are not subject to the SDR Rules.
Finally, the Commission’s analysis considers “compliance costs,” which are the costs that SDRs
will incur in registering and complying with the SDR Rules.
B.

General Comments on the Costs and Benefits of the SDR Rules

The Commission received two comments regarding the general costs and benefits of the
SDR Rules. 1205
One commenter offered general observations about the application of the SDR Rules to
non-resident SDRs, maintaining that the costs of an extraterritorial application of U.S. law would
be significant and not estimable beforehand, and that the Commission should consider comity
and conflict with non-U.S. regulatory requirements when weighing the costs and benefits of the
SDR Rules. 1206 The Commission agrees that determining the costs and benefits of the
application of the SDR Rules to non-resident SDRs is difficult; nevertheless, the Commission
has analyzed the economic effects of the SDR Rules below.
A second commenter recommended that “the Commission should generally seek to
avoid any divergence from the CFTC’s and international regulators’ frameworks that is likely to
give rise to undue costs or burdens.” 1207 The commenter believed that “divergence is generally

348

warranted only if the rule adopted by the Commission is more flexible than those adopted by
others (and therefore would not preclude the voluntary adoption of consistent practices by
market participants).” 1208 The Commission acknowledges that there are concerns regarding
divergent regulatory frameworks. The economic effects that could result from divergent
regulatory frameworks, as well as other comments regarding the costs and benefits of specific
rules, are discussed below. The Commission notes, however, that the SDR Rules are largely
consistent with the CFTC’s rules. Furthermore, the Commission has consulted and coordinated
with foreign regulators through bilateral and multilateral discussions and has taken these
discussions into consideration in developing the SDR Rules and Form SDR.
C.

Consideration of Benefits, Costs, and the Effect on Efficiency, Competition, and
Capital Formation

The potential economic effects stemming from the SDR Rules can be grouped into
several categories. In this section, the Commission first discusses assessment costs relating to
the SDR Rules. The Commission then discusses the SDR Rules’ programmatic costs and
benefits, highlighting broader and more comprehensive economic effects that result when the
SDR Rules are considered as a part of other rules resulting from Title VII of the Dodd Frank Act.
Next, the Commission discusses the effects of the SDR Rules on efficiency, competition, and
capital formation. In the next section, the Commission discusses the compliance costs relating to
certain of the SDR Rules.
1.

Assessment Costs

The Commission believes that persons will incur assessment costs in determining
whether they fall within the statutory definition of an SDR. The Commission believes that the

1208

IIB CB, supra note 26.
349

statutory definition in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(75) describes the core services or functions of
an SDR. Whether a person falls within the statutory definition of an SDR is fact-specific. The
Commission believes that at least 10 persons 1209 will make the assessment of whether they fall
within the statutory definition of an SDR, which may result in a cost of $15,200 per person, for a
total cost of $152,000 for all persons. 1210
The Commission believes that certain non-U.S. persons may incur assessment costs in
determining whether they can rely on the SDR Exemption. Under the Commission’s approach,
certain non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR may incur certain assessment
costs in determining whether they fall within the statutory definition of an SDR, and, if so,
whether they perform the functions of an SDR within the United States. If so, they may incur
certain assessment costs in determining whether they can rely on the SDR Exemption.1211
With respect to determining the availability of the SDR Exemption for a non-U.S. person
performing the function of an SDR within the United States, the Commission believes that costs
1209

At a minimum, the Commission estimates that the same persons who will register with
the Commission as SDRs will make an assessment as to whether they fall within the
statutory definition of an SDR. Therefore, the Commission estimates that at least 10
persons will make this assessment. See Section VII.C.1 of this release discussing the
number of respondents to the registration requirements and Form SDR.

1210

This estimate is based on an estimated 40 hours of in-house legal or compliance staff’s
time to assess whether a person falls within the statutory definition of an SDR. The
Commission estimates that a person will assign these responsibilities to an Attorney.
Data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry
2013, modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead,
suggest that the cost of an Attorney is $380 per hour. Thus, the total one-time estimated
dollar cost is $15,200 per person and $152,000 for all persons, calculated as follows:
(Compliance Attorney at $380 per hour for 40 hours) x 10 persons = $152,000.

1211

The Commission recognizes that some non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an
SDR may do so entirely outside the United States, and thus, may determine that they do
not need to incur any assessment costs related to the Commission’s approach.
350

would arise from confirming whether the Commission and each regulator with supervisory
authority over such non-U.S. person have entered into an MOU or other arrangement. The
Commission believes that because this information generally should be readily available, 1212 the
cost involved in making such assessment should not exceed one hour of in-house legal or
compliance staff’s time or $380 per person, 1213 for an aggregate one-time cost of $7,600. 1214
Assessment costs may also result from determining whether existing policies and
procedures will satisfy the requirements of the SDR Rules. An SDR may have existing policies
and procedures that it may use to comply with the SDR Rules. In order to use such policies and
procedures to comply with the SDR Rules, the SDR will first have to assess whether the policies
and procedures will result in compliance with the SDR Rules.
2.

Programmatic Costs and Benefits
a.

SDR Registration, Duties, and Core Principles

Rules 13n-1 through 13n-3 and Form SDR establish the mechanism by which SDRs must
register as such pursuant to Exchange Act Section 13(n), absent an exemption. Rules 13n-4

1212

The Commission provides a list of MOUs and other arrangements on its public website,
which are available at this link:
http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oia/oia_cooparrangements.shtml.

1213

This estimate is based on an estimated one hour of in-house legal or compliance staff’s
time to confirm whether the Commission and each regulator with supervisory authority
over such non-U.S. person have entered into an MOU or other arrangement. The
Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to an Attorney.
Thus, the total one-time estimated dollar cost is $380 per person, calculated as follows:
(Attorney at $380 per hour for 1 hour) = $380.

1214

This total is based on the assumption that as many as 20 non-U.S. persons that perform
the functions of an SDR would use in-house legal or compliance staff, specifically, an
Attorney, to determine whether an applicable MOU or other arrangement is in place.
Thus, the total one-time estimated dollar cost for all 20 non-U.S. persons is $7,600,
calculated as follows: (Attorney at $380 per hour for 1 hour) x 20 non-U.S. persons =
$7,600.
351

through 13n-10 set forth the duties and core principles of SDRs. Rule 13n-11 sets forth the
requirements for an SDR’s CCO, annual compliance reports, and financial reports. Finally, Rule
13n-12 provides an exemption from registration and other requirements in certain circumstances.
The Commission believes that it and market participants will enjoy a number of
programmatic benefits from the SDR Rules. For example, because the final SDR Rules require
SDRs to register with and provide data to the Commission and require SDRs to take steps to
facilitate accurate data collection and retention with respect to SBSs, the SDR Rules will
increase the availability of SBS data relative to that in the existing voluntary disclosure
system. 1215 The data provided by SDRs will provide a window into SBS transactions and allow
the Commission to oversee the SBS market beyond that which is currently available. Further,
the SDR Rules requiring SDRs to provide information to market participants about the nature
and costs of SDRs’ services are intended to provide transparency about the costs of reporting,
thereby enabling market participants to make informed choices among competing SDRs.
Finally, by requiring SDRs to register with the Commission, provide the Commission with
access to their books and records, and submit to inspections and examinations by representatives
of the Commission, the SDR Rules will allow the Commission to evaluate SDRs’ compliance
with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Persons that meet the definition of an SDR will also be required to comply with the
public dissemination requirements of Regulation SBSR. Public dissemination is a core
component of post-trade transparency in the SBS market. As discussed below, enhanced
transparency should produce market-wide benefits in terms of a reduction in SBS dealers’
1215

See Section II.B of this release discussing data that is currently available to regulators
and market participants.
352

market power. Enhanced transparency could also lead to reduced trading costs if competitive
access to information and reduced SBS dealers’ market power reduce the premium that SBS
dealers are able to charge for intermediating SBS transactions. 1216 Indeed, post-trade
transparency has been shown to reduce implicit trading costs (i.e., the difference between the
price at which a market participant can trade a security and the fundamental value of that
security) in other securities markets. For example, post-trade transparency that followed the
introduction of TRACE and trade reporting in the corporate bond market has been shown to
lower implicit costs of trading corporate bonds. 1217 While there are differences between SBSs
and corporate bonds, there are similarities to how the markets are structured – both markets
evolved as dealer-centric OTC markets with limited pre- or post-trade transparency. Thus, the
Commission expects that some of the benefits that result from transparency in the corporate bond
market may extend to SBS markets as well.
Nevertheless, the extent to which trading cost reductions are realized could be mitigated
by additional factors. Trade reporting, public dissemination, and providing direct electronic
access are costly in terms of establishing and maintaining infrastructure necessary to report and
store large volumes of trade-level transaction data. SDRs may be able to pass the costs of
complying with the SDR Rules and public dissemination requirements onto reporting parties –
e.g., SBS dealers – who, in turn, may be able to pass costs on to their customers. Therefore, the
infrastructure costs associated with transparency may partially offset the trade cost benefits that
could accrue through the reduction in asymmetric information and SBS dealers’ market power.

1216

See Section VIII.C.3 of this release discussing the potential effects on competition,
efficiency, and capital formation.

1217

See supra note 58.
353

Enhanced transparency could produce additional market-wide benefits by promoting
stability in the SBS market, particularly during periods of market turmoil, 1218 and it should
indirectly contribute to improved stability in related financial markets, including equity and bond
markets. 1219 In conjunction with Regulation SBSR, the SDR Rules should assist the
Commission in fulfilling its regulatory mandates and legal responsibilities such as detecting
market manipulation, fraud, and other market abuses by providing it with greater access to SBS
information. 1220 In particular, without an SDR, data on SBS transactions would be dispersed and
would not be readily available to the Commission and others. SDRs may be especially critical
during times of market turmoil, both by giving the Commission information to monitor risk
exposures taken by individual entities or to particular referenced entities, and by promoting
stability through enhanced transparency. Additionally, more available data about the SBS
market should give the Commission a better idea of how regulations are affecting, or may affect,

1218

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77307, supra note 2 (“SDRs may be especially critical
during times of market turmoil, both by giving relevant authorities information to help
limit systemic risk and by promoting stability through enhanced transparency. By
enhancing stability in the SBS market, SDRs may also indirectly enhance stability across
markets, including equities and bond markets.”).

1219

See Darrell Duffie, Ada Li, and Theo Lubke, Policy Perspectives of OTC Derivatives
Market Infrastructure, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No. 424 (Jan.
2010, as revised Mar. 2010) (“Transparency can have a calming influence on trading
patterns at the onset of a potential financial crisis, and thus act as a source of market
stability to a wider range of markets, including those for equities and bonds.”).

1220

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77307, supra note 2 (“The enhanced transparency
provided by an SDR is important to help regulators and others monitor the build-up and
concentration of risk exposures in the SBS market.”); see also DTCC 1*, supra note 20
(“A registered SDR should be able to provide (i) enforcement agents with necessary
information on trading activity; (ii) regulatory agencies with counterparty-specific
information about systemic risk based on trading activity; (iii) aggregate trade
information for publication on market-wide activity; and (iv) a framework for real-time
reporting from swap execution facilities and derivatives clearinghouses.”).

the SBS market, which may allow the Commission to better craft regulation to achieve desired
goals, and therefore, increase regulatory effectiveness.
The Commission believes that U.S. persons performing the functions of an SDR will play
a key role in collecting and maintaining information regarding SBS transactions, and making
available such information to the Commission and the public, all of which may affect the
transparency of the SBS market within the United States. 1221 Requiring such U.S. persons to
comply with the SDR Requirements will help ensure that they maintain data and make it
available in a manner that advances the benefits that the requirements are intended to produce.
The information provided by SDRs to the Commission pursuant to the SDR Rules may
assist it in advancing the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act was designed,
among other things, to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving
accountability and transparency in the financial system and the SDR Rules, which implement the
statute, are a necessary and important component of implementing this goal. 1222 As discussed
above, an SBS transaction involves ongoing financial obligations between counterparties during
the life of the transaction, which can typically span several years, and counterparties bear credit
and market risk until the transaction is terminated or expires. Because large market participants
may have ongoing obligations with many different counterparties, financial markets may be
particularly vulnerable to instability resulting from the financial distress of a large market
participant being transmitted to counterparties and others through connections in the SBS
market. In extreme cases, the default of a large market participant could lead to financial distress

among the counterparties to SBSs, which could introduce the potential for sequential
counterparty failure and create uncertainty in the SBS market, thereby reducing the willingness
of market participants to extend credit. A reduction in credit may result in liquidity and
valuation difficulties that could spill over into the broader financial market.
Thus, disruptions in the SBS market could potentially affect other parts of the financial
system. Increasing the availability and reliability of information about the SBS market will
improve the Commission’s ability to oversee and regulate this market. A more complete
understanding of activity in the SBS market, including information on risk and connections
between counterparties, should help the Commission assess the risk in these markets and
evaluate appropriate regulatory responses to market developments. Appropriate and timely
regulatory responses to market developments could enhance investor protection and confidence,
which may encourage greater investor participation in the SBS market. 1223
b.

Registration Requirements in the Cross-Border Context

The Commission believes that there are a number of programmatic benefits to requiring
non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the United States to register with
the Commission and to comply with the SDR Requirements. These requirements are intended to
help ensure that all persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the United States
function in a manner that will increase the transparency and further other goals of the DoddFrank Act. 1224 The SDR Requirements, including requirements that SDRs register with the

1223

See Section II.A of this release discussing broad economic considerations.

1224

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77354, supra note 2 (noting that “the proposed SDR
rules will lead to a more robust, transparent environment for the market for SBSs”);
Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31183, supra note 3 (discussing programmatic
benefits to requiring non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the
356

Commission, retain complete records of SBS transactions, maintain the integrity and
confidentiality of those records, and disseminate appropriate information to the public are
intended to help ensure that the data held by SDRs is reliable and that the SDRs provide
information that contributes to the transparency of the SBS market while protecting the
confidentiality of information provided by market participants. 1225
Non-U.S. persons performing the functions of an SDR within the United States also may
affect the transparency of the SBS market within the United States, even if transactions involving
U.S. persons or U.S. market participants are being reported to such non-U.S. persons in order to
satisfy the reporting requirements of a foreign jurisdiction (and not those of Title VII). The
Commission believes that, to the extent that non-U.S. persons are performing the functions of an
SDR within the United States, they will likely receive data relating to transactions involving U.S.
persons and other U.S. market participants. Ensuring that such data is maintained and made
available in a manner consistent with the SDR Requirements would likely contribute to the
transparency of the U.S. market and reduce potential confusion that may arise from discrepancies
in transaction data due to, among other things, differences in the operational standards governing
persons that perform the functions of an SDR in other jurisdictions (or the absence of such
standards for any such persons that are not subject to any regulatory regime). Moreover, given
the sensitivity of reported SBS data and the potential for market abuse and subsequent loss of
liquidity in the event that a person performing the function of an SDR within the United States

United States to register with the Commission and to comply with the SDR
Requirements). See also Dodd-Frank Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203 at Preamble.
1225

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77307, supra note 2 (noting that SDRs “are intended to
play a key role in enhancing transparency in the SBS market” and thus “it is important
that SDRs are well-run and effectively regulated”).
357

fails to maintain the privacy of such data, 1226 the Commission believes that requiring non-U.S.
persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the United States to register with the
Commission will help ensure that data relating to transactions involving U.S. persons or U.S.
market participants is handled in a manner consistent with the confidentiality protections
applicable to such data, thereby reducing the risk of the loss or disclosure of proprietary or other
sensitive data and of market abuse arising from the misuse of such data.
As noted above, the Commission is adopting Exchange Act Rule 13n-12 to provide an
exemption from the SDR Requirements for non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an
SDR within the United States, provided that each regulator with supervisory authority over any
such non-U.S. person has entered into an MOU or other arrangement with the Commission that
addresses the confidentiality of data collected and maintained by such non-U.S. person, access
by the Commission to such data, and any other matters determined by the Commission.
The Commission believes that this SDR Exemption will not significantly reduce the
programmatic benefits associated with the SDR Requirements. Although the approach could
potentially reduce the number of persons performing the functions of an SDR that are registered
with the Commission,1227 the Commission believes that there will be little impact on reporting of
transactions involving U.S. persons because data relating to transactions involving U.S. persons
1226

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77307, supra note 2 (“The inability of an SDR to protect
the accuracy and integrity of the data that it maintains or the inability of an SDR to make
such data available to regulators, market participants, and others in a timely manner could
have a significant negative impact on the SBS market.”).

1227

As of November 2014, there were several non-U.S. persons performing the functions of
an SDR or intending to do so in the future. See OTC Derivatives Market Reforms Eighth
Progress Report on Implementation, Financial Stability Board (Nov. 2014), available at
http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/r_141107.pdf. The
Commission, however, does not possess data regarding how many, if any, of these
persons perform the functions of an SDR within the United States.
358

and U.S. market participants would still be required to be reported, pursuant to Regulation
SBSR, to an SDR registered with the Commission and subject to all SDR Requirements, absent
other exemptive relief from the Commission.1228 Moreover, the SDR Exemption may have the
benefit of reducing the incentive for non-U.S. persons performing the functions of an SDR
within the United States to restructure their operations to avoid registration with the
Commission.
Moreover, the SDR Exemption is conditioned on an MOU or other arrangement with
each regulator with supervisory authority over the non-U.S. person that seeks to rely on the SDR
Exemption. This MOU or arrangement will address the Commission’s interest in having access
to SBS data involving U.S. persons and other U.S. market participants that is maintained by nonU.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the United States and in protecting the
confidentiality of such data. Further, Rule 13n-12 should not impair the integrity and
accessibility of SBS data. The Commission, therefore, believes that exempting certain non-U.S.
persons performing the functions of an SDR within the United States, subject to the condition
described above, will likely not significantly affect the programmatic benefits that the SDR
Requirements are intended to achieve. 1229

1228

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rule 908(c) setting forth
“substituted compliance” regime).

1229

The Commission also anticipates that non-U.S. persons that avail themselves of the SDR
Exemption will be subject to the regulatory requirements of one or more foreign
jurisdictions. The SDR Exemption will help ensure that such persons do not incur costs
of compliance with duplicative regulatory regimes while also ensuring, through the
condition that each regulator with supervisory authority enter into an MOU or other
arrangement with the Commission, that they are subject to regulatory requirements that
will prevent them from undermining the transparency and other purposes of the SDR
Requirements by, for example, failing to protect the confidentiality of data relating to
U.S. persons and other U.S. market participants.
359

Registering with the Commission and complying with the SDR Requirements will
impose certain costs on an SDR. 1230 The Commission believes that the SDR Exemption is likely
to reduce the costs for certain non-U.S. persons performing the functions of an SDR within the
United States without reducing the expected benefits of the SDR Requirements. 1231 As discussed
in Section VI.K.3 of this release, the Commission believes that such persons will likely be
performing the functions of an SDR in order to permit persons to satisfy reporting requirements
under foreign law. The exemption, if available, will allow these non-U.S. persons to continue to
perform this function within the United States without incurring the costs of compliance with the
SDR Rules; such non-U.S. persons may pass along their cost savings to U.S. market participants
that report to the non-U.S. persons pursuant to the market participants’ reporting obligations
under foreign law. Additionally, the exemption may reduce the incentive for non-U.S. persons
performing the functions of an SDR within the United States to restructure their operations to
avoid registration with the Commission.
The Commission recognizes that conditioning the SDR Exemption may delay the
availability of the SDR Exemption to certain non-U.S. persons. In some cases, the Commission
may be unable to enter into an MOU or other arrangement with each regulator with supervisory
1230

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31184-31185, supra note 3 (discussing
programmatic costs of SDRs registering with the Commission and complying with the
SDR Requirements).

1231

As noted above, the data currently available to the Commission does not indicate how
many non-U.S. persons performing the functions of an SDR perform such functions
within the United States. See supra note 1227. However, even if persons with reporting
obligations under Regulation SBSR report their transactions to a non-U.S. person that
performs the functions of an SDR within the United States, but is exempt from
registration, they will still be required to report transactions under Regulation SBSR to an
SDR registered with the Commission, absent other exemptive relief from the
Commission. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13 (Rule 908(c)
setting forth “substituted compliance” regime).
360

authority over a non-U.S. person performing the functions of an SDR within the United States.
The resulting delay or unavailability of the SDR Exemption may lead some of these non-U.S.
persons to exit the U.S. market by, for example, restructuring their business so that they perform
the functions of an SDR entirely outside the United States, potentially resulting in business
disruptions in the SBS market. Despite the potential business disruptions in the SBS market that
could result from the delay or unavailability of the SDR Exemption, the Commission believes
that conditioning the SDR Exemption on an MOU or other arrangement with each regulator with
supervisory authority over the non-U.S. person that seeks to rely on the exemption is important
because it will help ensure the Commission’s access to SBS data involving U.S. persons and
other U.S. market participants that may be maintained by such non-U.S. person.
Finally, in developing its approach to the application of the SDR Requirements to nonU.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the United States, the Commission
considered, as an alternative to Rule 13n-12, requiring such non-U.S. persons to comply with the
SDR Requirements, including registering with the Commission, as well as other requirements
applicable to SDRs registered with the Commission. 1232 In such a scenario, a non-U.S. person
performing the functions of an SDR within the United States would be required to register as an
SDR and incur the costs associated with the SDR Requirements, as well as other requirements
applicable to SDRs registered with the Commission. 1233 The Commission believes that the
benefit of requiring all non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the United
States to register with the Commission, even where similar objectives could be achieved through

1232

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31185-31186, supra note 3 (discussing
alternatives to proposed SDR Exemption).

1233

361

an exemption conditioned on an MOU or other arrangement with each regulatory authority with
supervisory authority over such non-U.S. persons, would be marginal, particularly in light of the
costs that such non-U.S. persons would incur in complying with the SDR Requirements, as well
as other requirements applicable to SDRs registered with the Commission.1234
3.

Consideration of Burden on Competition and Promotion of Efficiency,
Competition, and Capital Formation

In developing its approach to the registration, duties, and implementation of the core
principles of SDRs, the Commission has focused on meeting the goals of Title VII, including
promoting financial stability and transparency in the United States financial system. 1235 The
Commission has also considered the effects of its policy choices on competition, efficiency, and
capital formation as mandated under Exchange Act Section 3(f). 1236 That section requires the
Commission, whenever it engages in rulemaking pursuant to the Exchange Act and is required to
consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to
consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. In addition, Exchange Act Section 23(a)(2) requires the
Commission, when making rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact such rules
would have on competition. 1237 Section 23(a)(2) also prohibits the Commission from adopting
any rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 1238

In Section II of this release, the Commission described the baseline used to evaluate the
economic impact of the SDR Rules, including the impact on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation. In particular, the Commission noted that the current SBS market is characterized by
information asymmetries that confer a competitive advantage on SBS dealers relative to their
non-dealer counterparties who may be less informed. The Commission also noted that the
opacity of the SBS market may lead to certain inefficiencies in the market relative to a
transparent market, including higher transaction costs and wider spreads. Finally, the
Commission noted that some of the effects described below, such as the effects on capital
formation, are measured relative to a world without public dissemination requirements. That is,
in evaluating the effect of the SDR Rules on capital formation, the Commission discusses how
the final SDR Rules may enhance or diminish capital formation relative to the current opaque
SBS market environment.
a.

Potential Effects on Efficiency

Two important economic characteristics of SDRs are the high fixed costs and increasing
economies of scale. Compliance with the SDR Rules necessitates large investments in
information technology infrastructure, including storage infrastructure and technology for
electronic reporting and access to data, which results in high fixed costs for SDRs. The
Commission believes, however, that once the infrastructure for operating as an SDR and
compliance with the SDR Rules is in place, the SDR’s costs of accepting transactions are
minimal. Consequently, an SDR exhibits increasing economies of scale in that the average total
cost to the SDR per transaction reported, which includes fixed costs, diminishes with the increase
in volume of trades reported as high fixed costs are spread over a larger number of trades.

363

As a result, viewed in terms of minimizing the average SDR-related cost per transaction,
it may be efficient to limit the total number of SDRs to one per asset class. In such a case, the
SDR chosen for each asset class would receive reports of all transactions in that asset class,
reducing inefficient duplication of fixed costs and potentially giving that SDR a large number of
transactions over which the SDR could spread its high fixed costs. Furthermore, limiting the
number of SDRs to one per asset class would reduce the potential difficulties that may arise
when consolidating and aggregating data from multiple SDRs.1239 While such a limitation would
resolve many of the challenges involved in aggregating SBS data, the Commission is not limiting
the number of SDRs. 1240 There are competitive benefits to having multiple SDRs, as discussed
below. Furthermore, the existence of multiple SDRs may reduce operational risks, such as the
risk that a catastrophic event or the failure of an SDR leaves no registered SDR to which
transactions can be reported, impeding the functioning of the SBS market.
Nevertheless, the Commission believes that multiple SDRs may result in certain
inefficiencies relative to a market with a single SDR per asset class, as explained above. 1241 In
particular, the potential reporting of transaction data to multiple SDRs may create a need to
aggregate that data by the Commission and other interested parties. If aggregation of data is
made difficult because identifiers or data field definitions used by different SDRs are not
compatible, then the cost and time required by the Commission or any other interested party to
aggregate the data would increase, and the Commission’s oversight of the SBS market would be
1239

As discussed above, some commenters suggested limiting the number of SDRs to one per
asset class. However, their suggestions concerning average total cost and data
fragmentation extend to one SDR that serves the entire SBS market. See Section IV of
this release discussing number of SDRs.

1240

1241

See Sections II.A and IV of this release.
364

less efficient. The complications associated with aggregation could be particularly costly when
aggregation is required across the same asset class and related transactions reside in different
SDRs.
On the other hand, by allowing the creation of multiple SDRs, Exchange Act Section
13(n) 1242 and the SDR Rules may result in positive effects for market participants. Competition
among SDRs may lead to better services and may reduce the costs of those services for market
participants. As discussed above, there are currently four swap data repositories for equity or
credit swaps that are provisionally registered with the CFTC and that may choose to register with
the Commission as SDRs. While some swap data repositories may ultimately choose not to
register and operate as an SDR, either because of regulatory requirements that govern SDRs or
for other reasons, the Commission is not limiting the number of SDRs per asset class.
Furthermore, the Commission believes that the SDR Exemption may have positive
effects on operational efficiency for SDRs, in terms of cost savings relative to a scenario where
the SDR Exemption does not exist. The Commission believes that the exemption will allow
certain non-U.S. persons to continue to receive data reported pursuant to the reporting
requirements of a foreign jurisdiction without registering with the Commission as an SDR,
subject to a condition that helps ensure that the privacy of the data and the Commission’s access
to the data is maintained. The SDR Exemption may also reduce the incentives for SDRs to
restructure their operations to avoid triggering registration requirements, thereby reducing
potentially negative effects on efficiency. 1243 In particular, some persons may restructure solely

1242

15 U.S.C. 78m(n).

1243

See Section VI.K of this release discussing the SDR Exemption.
365

for the purposes of avoiding registration; in such restructurings, persons expend resources that
could potentially be put to more productive uses.
Viewed in the context of the broader transparency goals of Title VII, the SDR Rules may
provide additional informational (or price) efficiency benefits in terms of asset valuation. 1244
That is, by improving the flow of information about SBSs and the reference entities underlying
SBSs, the SDR Rules may result in a market where prices of SBSs and their underlying reference
entities more accurately reflect their fundamental value. The SDR Rules, together with the
reporting and public dissemination requirements of Regulation SBSR, should also promote the
process by which market participants seek the best available price. Increased availability of
information may lead to a reduction in the spread between the price at which market participants
can enter into an SBS and the fundamental value of that SBS (referred to as implicit trading costs
in this release). 1245 Real-time transaction pricing and volume information provide signals to
market participants about the value of their investments. Market participants may use these
signals to update their assessment of the value of an investment opportunity. In contrast to an
opaque market, information revealed through trades that are reported and publicly disseminated
allows market participants to make more-informed assessments of asset valuations, promoting
informational efficiency. This should be true for the underlying assets or reference entities as
well. That is, information from SBS transactions provides signals not only about SBS valuation,
but also about the value of reference assets underlying SBSs.

1244

Informational or price efficiency refers to the degree to which asset prices reflect
available information about the value of the asset. See, e.g., Eugene Fama, Efficient
Capital Market II, 46(5) Journal of Finance 1575 (1991).

1245

See Section II.A of this release.
366

b.

Potential Effects on Competition

The Commission believes that by allowing multiple SDRs to provide data collection,
maintenance, and recordkeeping services, the SDR Rules should promote competition among
SDRs. The Commission notes that, in an analogous setting, there are currently four swap data
repositories provisionally registered with the CFTC, suggesting that multiple SDRs competing in
the SBS market is a likely outcome. 1246 Increased competition may lower costs for users of SDR
services.
The Commission believes that because the SDR Rules do not preclude an SDR from
registering with the Commission and other foreign relevant authorities, non-resident SDRs
generally can take steps to comply with both their home country requirements and the SDR
Rules, and therefore can register with the Commission. The Commission recognizes that a nonresident SDR will incur additional burdens in making the certification or providing the opinion
of counsel required by Exchange Act Rule 13n-1(f), and that these burdens may place nonresident SDRs at a competitive disadvantage relative to resident SDRs. 1247 The Commission
believes that by subjecting non-resident SDRs to the same requirements as resident SDRs in all
other respects – e.g., requiring all SDRs to provide prompt access to books and records and
submit to onsite inspection and examination – the SDR Rules do not give a significant
competitive advantage to either resident or non-resident SDRs. As a result, the Commission
believes that the SDR Rules should promote competition among SDRs both domestically and
internationally.

1246

See Section II.B of this release.

1247

See Section VIII.D.1.b of the release discussing cost of certification and opinion of
counsel.
367

The Commission recognizes that there may be competitive effects due to the
jurisdictional divide between the CFTC and the Commission with respect to swaps and SBSs.
Swap data repositories that are registered only with the CFTC may compete against SDRs that
are registered only with the Commission, and vice versa, for acceptance of mixed swaps. As
noted by commenters, divergent regulatory frameworks could lead to “undue costs or burdens”
for SDRs and SBS market participants. 1248 To the extent that the SDR Rules contain provisions
that are more burdensome than the CFTC’s rules, the SDR Rules could hinder 1) an SDR
registered with only the Commission from competing against a swap data repository registered
with only the CFTC for acceptance of mixed swaps, and 2) an SDR registered with both the
Commission and the CFTC from competing against a swap data repository registered with only
the CFTC for acceptance of CFTC-regulated swaps. On the other hand, if the SDR Rules are
less burdensome than the CFTC’s rules, then an SDR registered with only the Commission may
enjoy a competitive advantage relative to 1) a swap data repository registered with only the
CFTC for acceptance of mixed swaps, and 2) an SDR registered with both the Commission and
the CFTC for acceptance of SBSs.
As stated above, the Commission believes that the SDR Rules and the CFTC’s final rules
governing swap data repositories’ registration, duties, and core principles are largely
consistent. 1249 Indeed, the Commission believes that, on the whole, the SDR Rules are
substantially similar to those adopted by the CFTC for swaps, and that any differences are not
significant enough to reduce the ability of SEC-registered SDRs to compete against CFTC-

1248

See IIB CB, supra note 26.

1249

See Section I.D of this release.
368

registered swap data repositories for acceptance of mixed swaps. 1250 Thus, the Commission does
not believe that the SDR Rules, as a result of the jurisdictional divide between the Commission
and the CFTC, will negatively affect competition in the market for acceptance of mixed swaps.
Finally, in addition to affecting competition among SDRs, the SDR Rules have
implications for competition among market participants. As discussed above, by observing order
flow, SBS dealers may have access to information not available to the broader market, and
therefore may enjoy a competitive advantage over their non-dealer counterparties. 1251 Because
price and volume information (revealed to SBS dealers through their observation of order flow)
contains signals about the value of investment opportunities, SBS dealers are able to use private
information about order flow to derive more-informed assessments of current market values,
allowing them to extract economic rents from less-informed counterparties. 1252 Impartial access
to pricing and volume information should allow market participants to derive more-informed
assessments of asset valuations, reducing SBS dealers’ market power over other market
participants. Additionally, price transparency should also promote competition among SBS
dealers. The Commission expects that, as in other securities markets, quoted bids and offers
should form and adjust according to reported, executed trades.

are generally consistent with those of” the commenter’s trade repository).

c.

Potential Effects on Capital Formation

The Commission believes that compliance with the SDR Rules will promote data
collection, maintenance, and recordkeeping. In conjunction with Regulation SBSR, including its
public dissemination requirements, the SDR Rules will likely have a positive effect on
transparency in credit markets by increasing information about the SBS market. In particular,
the definition of an SDR, which identifies persons that may be required to register with the
Commission and thereby required to comply with the public dissemination requirements of
Regulation SBSR, and the data accuracy and maintenance requirements in the SDR Rules,
should have a positive effect by making comprehensive, accurate information available to all
market participants. The increased availability of information should enable persons that rely on
the SBS market to meet their hedging objectives to make better decisions about capital formation
in general, which may positively affect capital formation in the broader capital market. In
particular, improved transparency in the SBS market should improve the quality and quantity of
price information available in the SBS market, so that SBS prices more accurately reflect
fundamental value and risk. Improved insight into the relationship between price and risk could
attract hedgers and other market participants that do not benefit from opacity, improving
liquidity and increasing opportunities for market participants to diversify and share risks through
trading SBS. 1253
Similarly, the Commission expects increased transparency in the SBS market to benefit
the broader economy. Similar to the derivatives markets providing signals about the valuation of
underlying reference entities, transparent SBS prices provide signals about the quality of a
reference entity’s business investment opportunities. Because market prices incorporate
1253

See Section II.A of this release discussing transparency in the SBS market.
370

information about the value of underlying investment opportunities, market participants can use
their observations of price and volume to derive assessments of the profitability of a reference
entity’s business and investment opportunities. Furthermore, business owners and managers can
use information gleaned from the SBS market – both positive and negative – to make moreinformed investment decisions in physical assets and capital goods, as opposed to investment in
financial assets, thereby promoting efficient resource allocation and capital formation in the real
economy. Finally, transparent SBS prices may also make it easier for firms to obtain new
financing for business opportunities, by providing information and reducing uncertainty about
the value and profitability of a firm’s investments. 1254
The SDR Rules are intended to help the Commission perform its oversight functions in a
more effective manner. For example, a more complete picture of the SBS market, including
information on risk exposures and asset valuations, should allow the Commission to better assess
risk in the SBS market and evaluate the effectiveness of the Commission’s regulation of the SBS
market. Appropriate and timely regulatory responses to market developments could enhance
investor protection, and could encourage greater participation in the SBS market, thereby
improving risk-sharing opportunities and efficient capital allocation. In addition, the SBS data
provided by SDRs to the Commission should help it advance the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act,
thereby promoting stability in the overall capital markets. Increased overall stability in the
capital markets could promote investor participation, thereby increasing liquidity and capital
formation.

Markets, 4 Annual Review of Financial Economics 339 (2012) (reviewing the theoretical
literature on the feedback between financial market prices and the real economy).
371

Finally, to the extent that the SDR Rules promote competition among SDRs, as discussed
above, the SDR Rules may lower costs for users of SDR services. 1255 Decreased costs may
promote capital formation by increasing the amount of capital available for investment by users
of SDR services.

Costs and Benefits of Specific Rules
1.

Registration Requirements, Form SDR, and Withdrawal from Registration

Rule 13n-1 and Form SDR describe the information that a person must file to register as
an SDR and also provide for interim amendments and required annual amendments that must be
filed within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year of the SDR and that these filings must be in
a tagged data format. Each non-resident SDR is required to (i) certify on Form SDR that the
SDR can, as a matter of law, and will provide the Commission with prompt access to the SDR’s
books and records and can, as a matter of law, and will submit to onsite inspection and
examination by the Commission and (ii) provide an opinion of counsel that the SDR can, as a
matter of law, provide the Commission with access to the books and records of such SDR and
can, as a matter of law, submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission. Rule
13n-2 sets forth the process by which a registered SDR would withdraw its registration or have
its registration revoked or cancelled. 1256 Rule 13n-3 sets forth the registration process for a
successor to a registered SDR. 1257 These rules and Form SDR are adopted pursuant to the
Commission’s rulemaking authority under Exchange Act Section 13(n). 1258

a.

Benefits

The rules and Form SDR described in this section provide for the registration of SDRs,
withdrawal from registration, revocation and cancellation of the registration, and successor
registration of SDRs. Congress enacted the new registration requirements as part of the DoddFrank Act in order to increase the transparency in the SBS market. The registration process will
further the Dodd-Frank Act’s goals by assisting the Commission in overseeing and regulating the
SBS market. The requirement that a non-resident SDR (i) certify that the SDR can, as a matter
of law, and will provide the Commission with prompt access to the SDR’s books and records and
can, as a matter of law, and will submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission
and (ii) provide an opinion of counsel that it can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission
with access to the SDR’s books and records and can, as a matter of law, submit to inspection and
examination will allow the Commission to evaluate an SDR’s ability to meet the requirements
for registration and to conduct ongoing oversight.
The information required to be provided in Form SDR is necessary to enable the
Commission to assess whether an applicant has the capacity to perform the duties of an SDR and
to comply with the duties, core principles, and other requirements imposed on SDRs pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 13(n) and the rules and regulations thereunder.
The requirement that SDRs file Form SDR in a tagged data format will facilitate review
and analysis of registration materials by Commission staff and, to the extent such materials are
made public, the public This requirement is consistent with the Commission’s longstanding
efforts to increase transparency and the usefulness of information by requiring the data tagging
of information contained in electronic filings in order to improve the accuracy of submitted

373

information, including financial information, and facilitate its analysis. 1259
The Commission solicited comments on the benefits associated with the registrationrelated rules and Form SDR. 1260 The Commission did not receive any comments specifically
addressing these benefits.
b.

Costs

The Commission anticipates that the primary costs to SDRs from the registration-related
rules and Form SDR result from the requirement to complete Form SDR and any amendments
thereto.
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the average initial paperwork cost of
SDR registration will be 481 hours per SDR and the average ongoing paperwork cost of interim
and annual updated Form SDR will be 36 hours for each registered SDR. 1261 Assuming a
maximum of ten SDRs, the aggregate one-time estimated dollar cost will be $793,840 1262 and the

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77355, supra note 2.

1261

See Section VII.D.1 of this release discussing the cost of SDR registration.

1262

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Attorney and a Compliance Clerk. Data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional
Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, modified by Commission staff to account for an
1800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee
benefits, and overhead, suggest that the cost of a Compliance Clerk is $64 per hour.
Thus, the total one-time estimated dollar cost of complying with the initial registrationrelated requirements is $79,384 per SDR and $793,840 for all SDRs, calculated as
374

aggregate ongoing estimated dollar cost per year will be $55,440 1263 to comply with the rule.
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the average initial paperwork cost of
filing a Form SDR to withdraw from registration will be 12 hours per SDR. 1264 Assuming that,
at most, one SDR per year would withdraw, the aggregate one-time estimated dollar cost will be
$4,008 1265 to comply with the rule.
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the average initial paperwork cost for
each non-resident SDR to (i) certify on Form SDR that the SDR can, as a matter of law, and will
provide the Commission with prompt access to the SDR’s books and records and can, as a matter
of law, and will submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission and (ii) provide
an opinion of counsel that the SDR can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission with prompt
access to the SDR’s books and records can, as a matter of law, and submit to onsite inspection
and examination will be 1 hour and $900 per SDR. 1266 Assuming a maximum of three non-

follows: (Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for 180 hours) + (Compliance Clerk at
$64 per hour for 301 hours) x (10 registrants) = $793,840.
1263

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Attorney and a Compliance Clerk. Thus, the total estimated dollar cost of complying
with the ongoing registration-related requirements is $5,544 per year per SDR and
$55,440 per year for all SDRs, calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney at $334 per
hour for 12 hours) + (Compliance Clerk at $64 per hour for 24 hours) x (10 registrants) =
$55,440.

1264

See Section VII.D.1 of this release discussing the cost of filing Form SDR to withdraw
from registration.

1265

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Attorney. Thus, the total estimated dollar cost of complying with the requirements
related to withdrawal from registration is $4,008 per year per SDR and $4,008 per year
for all SDRs, calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for 12 hours)
x (1 SDR withdrawing) = $4,008.

1266

See Section VII.D.1 of this release discussing the cost of non-resident SDRs’ certification
on Form SDR and opinion of counsel.
375

resident SDRs, 1267 the aggregate one-time estimated dollar cost will be $3,840. 1268
The Commission believes that the costs of filing Form SDR in a tagged data format
beyond the costs of collecting the required information, will be minimal. The Commission does
not believe that these costs will be significant, as large-scale changes will likely not be necessary
for most modern data management systems to output structured data files, particularly for widely
used file formats such as XML. XML is a widely used file format, and based on the
Commission’s understanding of current practices, it is likely that most reporting persons and
third party service providers have systems in place to accommodate the use of XML.
The Commission solicited comment on the estimated costs associated with the
registration-related rules and Form SDR. 1269 The Commission specifically requested comment
on the estimated number of respondents that would be filing Form SDR and the initial costs
associated with completing the registration form and the ongoing annual costs of completing the
required amendments. 1270
One commenter expressed concern about non-resident SDRs being subject to a stricter
regime than resident SDRs because of the non-resident SDRs’ obligation to provide a

1267

See Section VII.C.1 of this release discussing the number of non-resident SDRs.

1268

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to an Attorney.
Data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry
2013, modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead,
suggest that the cost of an Attorney is $380 per hour. Thus, the total estimated dollar cost
of complying with the requirements of Rule 13n-1(f) is $1,280 per year per SDR and
$3,840 per year for all SDRs, calculated as follows: ($900 for outside legal services +
(Attorney at $380 per hour for 1 hour)) x (3 non-resident registrants) = $3,840.

certification and opinion of counsel under Rule 13n-1(f). 1271 The Commission acknowledges
that non-resident SDRs may incur costs in providing the certification and opinion of counsel.
The Commission believes, however, that these costs may be avoided to the extent that nonresident SDRs are able to take advantage of the SDR Exemption.
The Commission did not receive any other comments on the estimated costs associated
with the registration-related rules and Form SDR. 1272
c.

Alternatives

Following one commenter’s suggestion, the Commission considered requiring an SDR
applicant to submit its rulebook 1273 with its initial Form SDR. As discussed above, the
Commission has not adopted this approach because an SDR is already required to provide
policies and procedures on Form SDR, and the Commission believes that most of the
information that would be contained in a rulebook would be filed as part of an SDR’s policies
and procedures. 1274 If an SDR’s rulebook is broader than its policies and procedures, however,
an SDR may submit its rulebook to the Commission to assist the Commission in better
understanding the context of the SDR’s policies and procedures or how the policies and
procedures relate to one another.
In accordance with one commenter’s suggestion, 1275 the Commission amended Form
1271

ESMA, supra note 19.

1272

Although one commenter expressed concern that non-resident SDRs would be subject to
a stricter regulatory regime because of the certification and opinion of counsel
requirements, the commenter did not comment specifically on the Commission’s
estimates of the costs of providing such an opinion. See ESMA, supra note 19.

SDR to accommodate SIP registration, as discussed above. 1276 The Commission considered
requiring persons to register as an SDR and SIP on two separate forms, but determined not to do
so because the costs to SDRs to make multiple filings of separate Form SDR and Form SIP
would not provide any measureable benefits to the Commission.
The Commission considered, in accordance with one commenter’s suggestion, 1277
adopting a joint form with the CFTC for SDR and swap data repository registration. As
discussed above, the Commission believes that it is necessary to maintain separate registration so
that each agency’s form remains tailored to the particular needs of that agency. 1278 For example,
the Commission is revising Form SDR to accommodate SIP registration, while the CFTC’s form
accommodates only swap data repository registration. Moreover, adopting a joint form may
impose costs and cause uncertainty for dual registrants because the CFTC would be required to
amend its form, which it has already adopted, at a time when the industry is still in the
implementation phase and some swap data repositories are already provisionally registered with
the CFTC. Finally, because the CFTC’s registration form for swap data repositories is
substantially similar to the Commission’s Form SDR, the Commission does not anticipate that
filing with each commission separately will entail a significant cost for a dual registrant. The
Commission is sensitive to the potential costs imposed by duplicative forms, but believes that
these costs are justified by the need of having a form specifically tailored to the SDR registration
scheme.

The Commission considered the request of one commenter, which is provisionally
registered with the CFTC as a swap data repository, for expedited review of the commenter’s
application for registration as an SDR. 1279 Although it is not clear what the commenter means by
“expedited review,” the Commission believes that it is necessary to conduct a review of an
SDR’s application for registration independent of the CFTC’s review of a swap data repository’s
application for registration. Moreover, the Commission believes that the procedures for
reviewing applications for registration as an SDR that the Commission is adopting in this release
provide reasonable timeframes for the Commission’s review of the applications. These
procedures are consistent with how the Commission reviews the applications of other registrants,
such as SIPs and registered clearing agencies. The Commission believes that each SDR
applicant, including an applicant who is provisionally registered with the CFTC, needs to
demonstrate that it is so organized, and has the capacity, to be able to assure the prompt,
accurate, and reliable performance of its functions as an SDR, comply with any applicable
provision of the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and carry out its
functions in a manner consistent with the purposes of Exchange Act Section 13(n) and the rules
and regulations thereunder.
Finally, the Commission considered providing a method for temporary registration, as
proposed. 1280 As discussed above, the Commission believes that the exemptive relief provided
by the Commission in the Effective Date Order, which was effective on June 15, 2011, addressed
the primary purpose for temporary registration. 1281 The Commission also believes that the

Compliance Date for the SDR Rules 1282 should provide sufficient time for SDRs to analyze and
understand the final SDR Rules, to develop and test new systems required to comply with the
Dodd-Frank Act’s provisions governing SDRs and the SDR Rules, to prepare and file Form
SDR, to demonstrate their ability to meet the criteria for registration set forth in Rule 13n1(c)(3), and to obtain registration with the Commission. 1283 For these reasons, the Commission
no longer believes that a temporary registration regime for SDRs is necessary or appropriate.

SDR Duties, Data Collection and Maintenance, and Direct Electronic
Access

Rules 13n-4(b)(2) – (7), 13n-5, and 13n-6 include various requirements relating to SDRs’
information technology systems. Rules 13n-4(b)(2) – (7), 13n-5, and 13n-6 set forth the duties
of an SDR, including an SDR’s collection, maintenance, and analysis of transaction data and
other records. 1284
Under Rules 13n-4(b)(2) and (4), an SDR is required to accept data as prescribed in
Regulation SBSR and maintain transaction data and related identifying information as required
by Rule 13n-5(b)(4). Rule 13n-4(b)(5) states that each SDR must provide direct electronic
access to the Commission or any of its designees. 1285
Rule 13n-5 establishes requirements for data collection and maintenance. 1286 Rule 13n5(b) requires, among other things, an SDR to promptly record transaction data and to establish,

for which the SDR maintains records; (4) to ensure that the transaction data and positions that it
maintains are complete and accurate; and (5) to prevent any provision in a valid SBS from being
invalidated or modified through the procedures or operations of the SDR. Rule 13n-5(b)(4)
establishes requirements related to the formats in which and time periods for which an SDR must
maintain transaction data, related identifying information, and positions. Rule 13n-5(b)(7)
requires an SDR that ceases doing business, or ceases to be registered pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 13(n), to preserve, maintain, and make accessible the transaction data and historical
positions for the remainder of the time period required by Rule 13n-5. Rule 13n-5(b)(8) requires
an SDR to make and keep current a plan to ensure that the transaction data and positions that are
recorded in the SDR continue to be maintained in accordance with Rule 13n-5(b)(7).
Rule 13n-6 requires SDRs, with respect to those systems that support or are integrally
related to the performance of their activities, establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to ensure that their systems provide adequate levels of capacity,
integrity, resiliency, availability, and security. 1287
a.

Benefits

The rules discussed in this section will enhance the Commission’s ability to oversee the
SBS market beyond that in the current voluntary reporting system. The Commission’s ability to
oversee the SBS market and benefits of SDRs to the market depend on the accuracy and
reliability of the data maintained by SDRs. Exchange Act Section 13(n)(4)(B) specifically
1287

See Section VI.F.3 of this release discussing Rule 13n-6.
381

instructs the Commission to “prescribe data collection and maintenance standards for” SDRs. 1288
The rules related to an SDR’s information technology and related policies and procedures are
designed to facilitate accurate data collection and retention with respect to SBSs in order to
promote transparency with respect to the SBS market.
The ability of the Commission to oversee the SBS market and detect fraudulent activity
depends on the Commission having access to accurate current and historical market data. In
particular, the direct electronic access requirement described in Rule 13n-4(b)(5) will permit the
Commission to carry out these responsibilities in a more effective and more efficient manner.
The requirement that each SDR make and keep current a plan to ensure that SBS data recorded
in such SDR continues to be maintained is essential to ensure that the Commission will continue
to have access to and the ability to analyze SBS data in the event that the SDR ceases to do
business.
The requirements in the rules discussed in this section are likely to create benefits that
will follow from providing the Commission with access to SBS market information. Pursuant to
the rules discussed in this section, in conjunction with Regulation SBSR, 1289 SDRs will receive
and maintain systemically important SBS transaction data from multiple market participants.
This data will increase transparency about activity in the SBS market. In addition, this data will
enhance the ability of the Commission to respond to market developments.
Benefits also may accrue from the Commission’s ability to use SBS data in order to
oversee the SBS market for illegal conduct. For example, data collected by SDRs will enhance
the Commission’s ability to detect and deter fraudulent and manipulative activity and other
1288

15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(4)(B).

1289

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 13.
382

trading abuses in connection with the SBS market, conduct inspections and examinations to
evaluate the financial responsibility and soundness of market participants, and verify compliance
with the statutory requirements and duties of SDRs. This data may also help the Commission
identify fraudulent or other predatory market activity. Increasing market participants’
confidence that the likelihood of illegal or fraudulent activity is low and that the likelihood that
they will suffer economic loss from such illegal or fraudulent activity is low will reduce the
prices at which they are willing to use SBS to hedge market risks to which they are exposed,
which should, in turn, encourage participation in the SBS market.
The richness of data collected by SDRs also may facilitate market analysis. For example,
the Commission may review market activity through the study of SBS transactions, which may
help assess the effectiveness of the Commission’s regulation of the SBS market. Such reviews
can inform the Commission on the need for modifications to these and other rules as the market
evolves.
The Commission recognizes that these benefits may be reduced to the extent that SBS
market data is fragmented across multiple SDRs. Fragmentation of SBS market data may
impose costs on any user of this data associated with consolidating, reconciling, and aggregating
that data. As discussed above, the Commission believes that the form and manner with which an
SDR provides the data to the Commission should not only permit the Commission to accurately
analyze the data maintained by a single SDR, but also allow the Commission to aggregate and
analyze data received from multiple SDRs.1290
SDRs also may create economic benefits for market participants by providing non-core
services, such as facilitating the reporting of life cycle events, asset servicing, or payment
1290

See Section VI.D.2.c.ii of this release discussing direct electronic access.
383

calculations. These activities may be less costly to perform when SBS market data is centrally
located and accessible.
The Commission solicited comment on the benefits related to Rules 13n-4(b)(2) – (7),
13n-5, and 13n-6. 1291 The Commission specifically requested comment on whether any
additional benefits would accrue if the Commission imposed further, more specific technologyrelated requirements. 1292 The Commission received no comments on the estimated benefits of
the rules discussed in this section.
b.

Costs

The Commission anticipates that the primary costs to SDRs, particularly those that are
not already registered with the CFTC or operating as trade repositories, are from the rules
described in this section that relate to the cost of developing and maintaining systems to collect
and store SBS transaction data. SDRs also need to develop, maintain, and enforce compliance
with related policies and procedures and provide applicable training. Changes in the cost of
developing and maintaining such systems are likely to be passed on to market participants;
similarly, compliance costs incurred by SDRs are likely to be passed on to market participants.
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the cost associated with creating SDR
information technology systems will be 42,000 hours and $10,000,000 for each SDR and the
average ongoing paperwork cost will be 25,200 hours and $6,000,000 per year for each SDR. 1293
Assuming a maximum of ten SDRs, the aggregate one-time estimated dollar cost will be

1291

1292

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77357, supra note 2.

1293

See Section VII.D.2 of this release discussing the costs of creating SDR information
technology systems.
384

$210,810,000 1294 and the aggregate ongoing estimated dollar cost per year will be
$126,486,000 1295 to comply with the rules. Based on Commission staff’s conversations with
industry representatives, the Commission estimates that the cost imposed on SDRs to provide
direct electronic access to the Commission should be minimal as SDRs likely have or will
establish comparable electronic access mechanisms to enable market participants to provide data
to SDRs and review transactions to which such participants are parties. 1296
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the average initial paperwork cost
associated with developing policies and procedures necessary to comply with Rules 13n-5(b)(1),
(2), (3), and (5) and 13n-6 will be 1,050 hours and $100,000 for each SDR and the average

1294

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to an Attorney,
a Compliance Manager, a Programmer Analyst, and a Senior Business Analyst. Data
from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013,
modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and multiplied by
5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead, suggest that the
cost of a Compliance Manager is $283 per hour, a Programmer Analyst is $220 per hour,
and a Senior Business Analyst is $251 per hour. Thus, the total initial estimated dollar
cost will be $21,081,000 per SDR and $210,810,000 for all SDRs, calculated as follows:
($10,000,000 for information technology systems + (Attorney at $380 per hour for 7,000
hours) + (Compliance Manager at $283 per hour for 8,000 hours) + (Programmer Analyst
at $220 per hour for 20,000 hours) + (Senior Business Analyst at $251 per hour for 7,000
hours)) x 10 registrants = $210,810,000.

1295

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to an Attorney,
a Compliance Manager, a Programmer Analyst, and a Senior Business Analyst. Thus,
the total ongoing estimated dollar cost will be $12,648,600 per SDR and $126,486,000
for all SDRs, calculated as follows: ($6,000,000 for information technology systems +
(Attorney at $380 per hour for 4,200 hours) + (Compliance Manager at $283 per hour for
4,800 hours) + (Programmer Analyst at $220 per hour for 12,000 hours) + (Senior
Business Analyst at $251 per hour for 4,200 hours)) x 10 registrants = $126,486,000.

1296

See SDR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77357, supra note 2. Indeed, the Commission
notes that one commenter, which currently operates a trade repository, stated that “[t]he
Commission’s proposed required practices are generally consistent with those of” the
commenter’s trade repository. DTCC 2, supra note 19.
385

ongoing paperwork cost will be 300 hours per year for each SDR. 1297 Assuming a maximum of
ten SDRs, the aggregate one-time estimated dollar cost will be $4,185,300 1298 and the aggregate
ongoing estimated dollar cost per year will be $965,400 1299 to comply with the rules.
The Commission believes that existing SDRs may have already developed and
implemented information technology systems and related policies and procedures. 1300 Such
persons are currently not subject to regulation by the Commission, and therefore, may need to
enhance their information technology systems and related policies and procedures to comply
with the SDR Rules. Thus, such persons may experience costs in enhancing their information
technology systems and related policies and procedures to comply with the SDR Rules.
Moreover, because the costs discussed above represent the costs of creating information
technology systems and related policies and procedures without any existing information

1297

See Section VII.D.2 of this release discussing the costs of developing policies and
procedures necessary to comply with Rules 13n-5(b)(1), (2), (3), and (5) and 13n-6.

1298

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Manager, an Attorney, a Senior Systems Analyst, and an Operations Specialist. Data
from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013,
modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and multiplied by
5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead, suggest that the
cost of a Senior Systems Analyst is $260 per hour and the cost of an Operation Specialist
is $125 per hour. Thus, the total initial estimated dollar cost will be $418,530 per SDR
and $4,185,300 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: ($100,000 for outside legal services +
(Compliance Manager at $283 per hour for 385 hours) + (Attorney at $380 per hour for
435 hours) + (Senior Systems Analyst at $260 per hour for 115 hours) + (Operations
Specialist at $125 per hour for 115 hours)) x 10 registrants = $4,185,300.

1299

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Manager and an Attorney. Thus, the total ongoing estimated dollar cost will be $96,540
per SDR and $965,400 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: ((Compliance Manager at
$283 per hour for 180 hours) + (Attorney at $380 per hour for 120 hours)) x 10
registrants = $965,400.

1300

Cf. DTCC 2, supra note 19 (stating that “[t]he Commission’s proposed required practices
are generally consistent with those of” the commenter’s trade repository).
386

technology systems or policies and procedures in place, existing SDRs that already have
information technology systems and related policies and procedures may experience initial costs
lower than those estimated above. The Commission believes that after such persons bring their
technology systems and related policies and procedures into compliance with the SDR Rules,
however, the ongoing annual costs for such persons will likely be consistent with the estimates
provided above. 1301
Multiple SDRs may register with the Commission, potentially within the same asset
class, with each SDR collecting data from a subset of market participants. While multiple SDRs
per asset class will allow for market competition to decide how data is collected, it may hinder
market-wide data aggregation due to coordination costs, particularly if market participants adopt
incompatible reporting standards and practices. The SDR Rules do not specify a particular
reporting format or structure, which may create the possibility that persons reporting to SDRs or
other market participants accessing SBS data, will have to accommodate different data standards
and develop different systems to accommodate each. This may result in increased costs for
reporting persons and users of SBS data.
Furthermore, the costs associated with aggregating data across multiple SDRs by the
Commission and other users of such data will increase to the extent that SDRs choose to use
different identifying information for transactions, counterparties, and products. Data aggregation
costs also could accrue to the extent that there is variation in the quality of data maintained
across SDRs. Each SDR has discretion over how to implement its policies and procedures in the
recording of reportable data, and variations in quality may result. Since aggregated data used for
1301

See Section VII.D.2 of this release discussing the costs of Rules 13n-4(b)(2) – (7), 13n-5,
and 13n-6.
387

surveillance and risk monitoring requires that the underlying components are provided with the
same level of accuracy, variations in the quality of data could be costly if subsequent
interpretations of analysis based on the data suffer from issues of integrity. To the extent that
market competition among SDRs impacts profit margins and the level of resources devoted to
collecting and maintaining transaction data, there is an increased likelihood of variations in the
quality of reported data, which could make the aggregation of data across multiple SDRs more
difficult.
In the Proposing Release the Commission solicited comment on the costs related to Rules
13n-4(b)(2) – (7), 13n-5, and 13n-6. 1302 The Commission specifically requested comment on the
initial and ongoing costs associated with establishing and maintaining the technology systems
and related policies and procedures; additional costs to creating an SDR that the Commission
should consider; alternatives that the Commission should consider; whether the estimates
accurately reflect the cost of storing data in a convenient and usable electronic format for the
required retention period; and a description and, to the extent practicable, quantification of the
costs associated with any comments that are submitted. 1303 The Commission received no
comments on the estimated costs of the rules discussed in this section.
c.

Alternatives

Commenters suggested that an SDR’s duties should include reporting SBS data to a
single SDR that would consolidate the data. 1304 Specifically, one commenter recommended that

1302

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77358, supra note 2.

1303

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77358, supra note 2.

1304

See DTCC 1*, supra note 20; Better Markets 1, supra note 19; see also FINRA SBSR,
supra note 27 (urging the Commission to mandate the consolidation of disseminated SBS
data to the public).
388

the Commission “designate one SDR as the recipient of the information of the other SDRs to
ensure the efficient consolidation of data.” 1305 The commenter further stated that the designated
SDR would need to have “the organization and governance structure that is consistent with being
a financial market utility serving a vital function to the entire marketplace.” 1306 The Commission
recognizes, as asserted by the commenter, that fragmentation of data among SDRs would “leave
to regulators the time consuming, complicated and expensive task of rebuilding complex data
aggregation and reporting mechanisms.” 1307 If the Commission were to designate one SDR as
the data consolidator, however, such an action could be deemed as the Commission’s
endorsement of one regulated person over another, discourage new market entrants, and interfere
with competition, resulting in a perceived government-sponsored monopoly. In addition, such a
requirement would likely impose an additional cost on market participants to cover the SDR’s
cost for acting as the data consolidator. The Commission does not believe that, at this time, the
benefits of such a requirement, in terms of saving other SDRs the costs of having to make data
available to the Commission and saving the costs of consolidating the data itself, would be
substantial enough to justify this potential negative effect on competition among SDRs. The
Commission, however, may revisit this issue if, for example, there is data fragmentation among
SDRs that is creating substantial difficulties for relevant authorities to get a complete and
accurate view of the market.
The Commission considered directing, under Rule 13n-4(b)(7), all SDRs to establish
1305

DTCC 1*, supra note 20; see also Better Markets 1, supra note 19 (making similar
comments); DTCC 2, supra note 19 (“The role of an aggregating SDR is significant in
that it ensures regulators efficient, streamlined access to consolidated data, reducing the
strain on limited agency resources.”).

1306

DTCC 1*, supra note 20.

1307

389

automated systems for monitoring, screening, and analyzing SBS data, a position urged by one
commenter. 1308 The Commission believes that mandating automated systems for monitoring,
screening, and analyzing SBS data at this time would impose an additional cost on SDRs. The
Commission believes that it should avoid imposing the cost of automated systems on SDRs until
the Commission can better determine what information it needs through such automated systems
in addition to the information that it can obtain from SDRs through other rules applicable to
SDRs, such as Rule 13n-4(b)(5).
The Commission considered requiring every SDR to maintain transaction data and
related identifying information for not less than five years after the applicable SBS expires or ten
years after the applicable SBS is executed, whichever is greater, as an alternative to the time
period in Rule 13n-5(b)(4) (for not less than five years after the applicable SBS expires). The
Commission understands, however, that the alternative time period does not fit current industry
practices and therefore would be costly to implement. The five-year period is consistent with the
record retention period for other Commission registrants and the statutory requirement for SB
SEFs.
The Commission also considered, as an alternative to Rule 13n-5(b)(4)(i), prescribing a
particular data format in which an SDR must maintain transaction data and positions, as
suggested by three commenters. 1309 The Commission believes that SDRs should have the

1308

See Better Markets 1, supra note 19. Similarly, another commenter suggested that the
Commission “provide additional details on the anticipated requirements in order to better
manage the expectations of SDRs and wider market participants concerning their duties
in this area.” Barnard, supra note 19.

1309

See Better Markets 1, supra note 19; ISDA Temp Rule, supra note 28; Barnard, supra
note 19.
390

flexibility to choose their own data format, based on what works best in practice. 1310 The
Commission is also concerned that a format that it mandates would eventually become outdated,
necessitating either a rule change to keep pace with technological innovation or a requirement
that SDRs use outdated technology. Market participants may incur the increased costs of
converting their transaction data to a format that is no longer an industry standard. Although the
Commission recognizes that a commonly-mandated format for all SBS data has the potential to
facilitate aggregation of data across different SDRs, the Commission believes that not imposing a
particular format saves SDRs the costs associated with using and implementing one data format
chosen by the Commission. The Commission believes that SDRs, working with market
participants, will be in the best position to choose and upgrade formats as needed. 1311 For these
reasons, the Commission does not believe that mandating a particular format in which an SDR
must maintain transaction data, related identifying information, and positions is, at this time, an
appropriate alternative to the flexible approach of Rule 13n-5(b)(4)(i) and the lower compliance
costs.
Finally, the Commission considered, as suggested by one commenter, requiring SDRs to
keep records of data indefinitely. 1312 This commenter asserted that there was “no technological
or practical reason for limiting the retention period,” 1313 but the Commission believes that given

1310

See Section VI.E.4.c of this release discussing Rule 13n-5(b)(4).

1311

As discussed above, when an SDR is deciding the format in which it will maintain
transaction data and positions, it may want to consider whether it will need to reformat or
translate the data to reflect any formats and taxonomies that the Commission may adopt
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5)(D) and Rule 13n-4(b)(5). See Section
VI.E.4.c of this release.

1312

See Barnard, supra note 19.

1313

391

the volume of data and transactions SDRs may handle, prohibiting SDRs from ever eliminating
records may result in SDRs retaining a large volume of records for which there may be little or
no use. Having to maintain records secure and accessible for an indefinite period of time may
impose significant costs to SDRs, particularly as storage and access technology evolves.
Because the Commission believes that requiring transaction data to be maintained for not less
than five years after the applicable SBS expires is more reasonable, and because that approach is
consistent with the record retention period for other Commission registrants and the statutory
requirement for SB SEFs, the Commission does not believe that risks and costs that could come
with imposing an unlimited time period for retention are justified. Accordingly, the Commission
is not adopting the alternative suggested by the commenter.
3.

Recordkeeping

Rule 13n-7 requires an SDR to make and keep certain records relating to its business and
retain a copy of records made or received by the SDR in the course of its business for a period of
not less than five years, the first two years in a place that is immediately available to
representatives of the Commission for inspection and examination. The rule also requires an
SDR that ceases doing business or ceases to be registered as an SDR to preserve, maintain, and
make accessible the records required to be collected, maintained, and preserved pursuant to the
rule for the remainder of the time period required by Rule 13n-7. 1314
a.

Benefits

Rule 13n-7 is designed to further the Dodd-Frank Act’s goals by enhancing the
Commission’s ability to oversee SDRs, which are critical components of the new regulatory
scheme governing SBSs. The rule will assist the Commission in determining whether an SDR is
1314

See Section VI.G of this release discussing Rule 13n-7.
392

complying with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. In addition,
the recordkeeping requirements contained in the rule will permit the Commission to evaluate the
financial responsibility and soundness of SDRs.
To the extent that the rule standardizes the business recordkeeping practices of SDRs, the
Commission will be better able to perform efficient, targeted inspections and examinations with
an increased likelihood of identifying improper conduct. To the extent that standardized
recordkeeping requirements will allow the Commission to perform more efficient, targeted
inspections and examinations, SDRs may incur less costs in responding to targeted inspections
and examinations (as opposed to inspections and examinations that are broader in scope). In
addition, both the Commission and SDRs should benefit from standardized recordkeeping
requirements to the extent that uniform records will enable the Commission and SDRs to know
what records the SDRs are required to maintain.
The Commission solicited comment on the benefits related to Rule 13n-7. 1315 The
Commission did not receive any comments on the benefits related to Rule 13n-7.
b.

Costs

As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the average initial paperwork cost
associated with making, keeping and preserving certain records and developing and maintaining
information technology systems to ensure compliance with the recordkeeping requirements will
be 346 hours and $1,800 for each SDR and the average ongoing paperwork cost associated with
compliance with the recordkeeping requirements will be 279.17 hours per year for each SDR. 1316
Assuming a maximum of ten SDRs, the aggregate one-time estimated dollar cost will be
1315

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77358, supra note 2.

1316

See Section VII.D.3 of this release discussing the cost associated with Rule 13n-7.
393

$986,600 1317 and the aggregate ongoing estimated dollar cost per year will be $790,051.10 1318 to
comply with Rule 13n-7.
The Commission believes that existing SDRs may already maintain business records as
part of their day-to-day operations. 1319 Such persons are currently not subject to regulation by
the Commission, and therefore, may need to enhance their maintenance of business records to
comply with Rule 13n-7. Thus, such persons may experience costs in enhancing their
recordkeeping to comply with Rule 13n-7. Moreover, because the costs discussed above
represent the costs of establishing a recordkeeping system without any existing recordkeeping
system in place, existing SDRs that already have a recordkeeping system may experience initial
costs lower than those estimated above. The Commission believes that after such persons bring
their recordkeeping into compliance with Rule 13n-7, however, the ongoing annual costs for
such persons will likely be consistent with the estimates provided above.
The Commission solicited comment on the costs related to Rule 13n-7. 1320 The
Commission specifically requested comment on the initial and ongoing costs associated with
establishing and maintaining the recordkeeping systems and related policies and procedures,
1317

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities primarily to a
Compliance Manager as well as a Senior Systems Analyst. Thus, the total initial
estimated dollar cost will be $98,660 per SDR and $986,600 for all SDRs, calculated as
follows: ($1,800 in information technology costs + (Compliance Manager at $283 per
hour for 300 hours) + (Senior Systems Analyst at $260 per hour for 46 hours)) x 10
registrants = $986,600.

1318

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Manager. Thus, the total ongoing estimated dollar cost will be $79,005.11 per SDR and
$790,051.10 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: (Compliance Manager at $283 per hour
for 279.17 hours) x 10 registrants = $790,051.10.

including whether currently-operating SDRs would incur different recordkeeping costs. 1321 The
Commission did not receive any comments on the costs related to Rule 13n-7.

Reports

Rule 13n-8 requires SDRs to report promptly to the Commission, in a form and manner
acceptable to the Commission, such information as the Commission determines necessary or
appropriate for the Commission to perform its duties. 1322
a.

Benefits

Title VII establishes a regulatory framework for the OTC derivatives market that depends
on the Commission’s access to information regarding the current and historical operation of the
SBS market to verify compliance with the statute and to provide for effective monitoring for
market abuse. In addition, specific provisions of Title VII require routine, targeted monitoring of
certain types of events. Access to such information will enable the Commission to oversee the
SBS market, which is critical to the continued integrity of the markets, and detect and deter
fraudulent and manipulative activity and other trading abuses in connection with the derivatives
markets.
The Commission solicited comment on the benefits related to the requirements contained
in Rule 13n-8. 1323 The Commission did not receive any comments on the benefits related to the

b.

Costs

The Commission anticipates that the initial costs to SDRs from Rule 13n-8 relate to the
cost of developing and maintaining systems to respond to requests for information and provide
the necessary reports and establishing related policies and procedures. In addition, SDRs will
need to employ staff to maintain systems to provide the requested reports as well as to respond to
ad hoc requests that cannot be satisfied using such systems. 1324 The information technology
costs associated with this rule are included in the overall information technology costs discussed
above. 1325
Furthermore, as discussed above, the Commission estimates that SDRs will incur costs in
compiling the information requested under Rule 13n-8, which the Commission estimates will be
limited to information already compiled under the SDR Rules, and thus, require only 1 hour per
response to compile and transmit per year for each SDR. 1326 Assuming a maximum of ten SDRs,
the aggregate ongoing estimated dollar cost per year will be $2,510 to comply with the rule. 1327
The Commission solicited comment on the costs related to Rule 13n-8. 1328 The
Commission specifically requested comment on the initial and ongoing costs associated with

1324

The Commission understands that some existing trade repositories may have dedicated
personnel who are responsible for responding to and providing ad hoc report requests
from relevant authorities, including the Commission. To the extent that Rule 13n-8 may
result in more automated reporting, the need for such dedicated personnel resources may
be reduced.

1325

See Section VIII.D.2.b of this release.

1326

See Section VII.D.4 of this release discussing the cost associated with Rule 13n-8.

1327

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Senior
Business Analyst. Thus, the total ongoing estimated dollar cost will be $251 per SDR
and $2,510 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: (Senior Business Analyst at $251 per
hour for 1 hour) x 10 registrants = $2,510.

Disclosure

Under Rule 13n-10, before accepting any SBS data from a market participant or upon the
market participant’s request, each SDR is required to furnish to the market participant a
disclosure document containing certain information that reasonably will enable the market
participant to identify and evaluate the risks and costs associated with using the services of the
SDR. 1330 An SDR’s disclosure document must include the SDR’s criteria for providing others
with access to services offered and data maintained by the SDR; the SDR’s criteria for those
seeking to connect to or link with the SDR; a description of the SDR’s policies and procedures
regarding safeguarding of data and operational reliability; a description of the SDR’s policies
and procedures reasonably designed to protect the privacy of SBS transaction information; a
description of the SDR’s policies and procedures regarding its non-commercial and/or
commercial use of SBS transaction information; a description of the SDR’s dispute resolution
procedures; a description of all of the SDR’s services, including ancillary services; the SDR’s
updated schedule of dues, unbundled prices, rates, or other fees for all of its services, and any
discounts or rebates; and a description of the SDR’s governance arrangements.
a.

Benefits

Rule 13n-10 is intended to provide certain information regarding an SDR to market
participants prior to their entering into an agreement to provide SBS data to the SDR. To the
extent that multiple SDRs accept data for the same asset class, the disclosure document should

1330

See Section VI.I.2 of this release discussing Rule 13n-10.
397

enable market participants to make an informed choice among SDRs. The disclosure document
is necessary to inform market participants of the nature of the services provided by the SDR and
the conditions and obligations that are imposed on market participants in order for them to report
data to the SDR.
Rule 13n-10 is designed to further the Dodd-Frank Act’s goals by providing market
participants with applicable information regarding the operation of SDRs. The Commission
solicited comment, 1331 but did not receive any comments on the benefits related to this rule.
b.

Costs

The Commission anticipates that the primary costs to SDRs to complying with Rule 13n10 relate to the development and dissemination of the disclosure document. As discussed above,
the Commission estimates that the average initial paperwork cost associated with developing the
disclosure document and related policies and procedures will be 97.5 hours and $9,400 for each
SDR and the average ongoing paperwork cost will be 1 hour per year for each SDR. 1332
Assuming a maximum of ten registered SDRs, the aggregate one-time estimated dollar cost will
be $263,162.5 1333 and the aggregate ongoing estimated dollar cost per year will be $1,735 1334 to
comply with the rule.

1331

See Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77360, supra note 2.

1332

See Section VII.D.5 of this release discussing the cost associated with Rule 13n-10.

1333

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Manager and a Compliance Clerk. Thus, the total initial estimated dollar cost will be
$26,316.25 per SDR and $263,162.5 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: ($4,400 for
external legal costs + $5,000 for external compliance consulting costs + (Compliance
Manager at $283 per hour for 48.75 hours) + (Compliance Clerk at $64 per hour for
48.75 hours)) x 10 registrants = $263,162.5.

1334

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Manager and a Compliance Clerk. Thus, the total ongoing estimated dollar cost will be
$173.5 per SDR and $1,735 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: ((Compliance Manager

The Commission solicited comment on the costs related to Rule 13n-10. 1335 The
Commission specifically requested comment on the initial and ongoing costs associated with
drafting, reviewing, and providing the required disclosure document. 1336 The Commission did
not receive any comments on the costs related to this rule.

Chief Compliance Officer and Compliance Functions; Compliance
Reports and Financial Reports

Rules 13n-4(b)(11) and 13n-11 and the amendments to Regulation S-T require each
registered SDR to identify on Form SDR a person who has been designated by the board to serve
as CCO whose duties include preparing an annual compliance report, which will be filed with the
Commission along with a financial report. 1337 The CCO’s appointment must be approved by the
majority of the SDR’s board and the CCO must report directly to the senior officer of the SDR or
the board. As discussed above, the CCO is responsible for, among other things, establishing
procedures for the remediation of noncompliance issues identified by the CCO and establishing
and following appropriate procedures for the handling, management response, remediation,
retesting, and closing of noncompliance issues. 1338 No officer, director, or employee may
directly or indirectly take any action to coerce, manipulate, mislead, or fraudulently influence the
CCO in the performance of his or her duties under Rule 13n-11. 1339 The CCO is required to
prepare and sign an annual compliance report and submit the report to the board for its review
at $283 per hour for 0.5 hours) + (Compliance Clerk at $64 per hour for 0.5 hours)) x 10
registrants = $1,735.

be filed along with the financial report, which must be prepared pursuant to Rule 13n-11(f) and
filed with the Commission. The compliance report must be filed in a tagged data format in
accordance with the instructions contained in the EDGAR Filer Manual, 1340 and the financial
report must be provided as an official filing in accordance with the EDGAR Filer Manual and
include, as part of the official filing, an Interactive Data Financial Report filed in accordance
with Rule 407 of Regulation S-T. 1341
a.

Benefits

Rules 13n-4(b)(11) and 13n-11 are designed to help ensure that SDRs comply with the
federal securities laws, including Exchange Act Section 13(n), and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Although existing SDRs may already have CCOs in place, the rules will make this
standard practice for all registered SDRs, as mandated by the Exchange Act. 1342
As a result of Rules 13n-4(b)(11) and 13n-11, the Commission believes that data and
other records maintained by each SDR are more likely to be accurate and reliable. The
Commission believes that strong internal compliance programs lower the likelihood of noncompliance with securities rules and regulations. 1343 The designation of a CCO, who will,
among other things, take reasonable steps to ensure compliance with the rules and regulations
thereunder relating to SBSs, including each rule prescribed by the Commission, will help ensure
1340

See 17 CFR 232.301.

1341

See Section VI.J.5.c of this release discussing Rule 407 of Regulation S-T.

1342

See Exchange Act Section 13(n)(6), 15 USC 78m(n)(6).

1343

See DTCC 2, supra note 19 (agreeing with the Commission that “a robust internal
compliance function plays an important role in facilitating an SDR’s monitoring of, and
compliance with, the requirements of the Exchange Act (and rules thereunder) applicable
to SDRs”).
400

that each SDR complies with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The
prohibition against an SDR’s officer, director, or employee from directly or indirectly taking any
action to coerce, manipulate, mislead, or fraudulently influence its CCO increases the probability
that the CCO’s actions are based on accurate information and the compliance reports reflect the
independent judgment of the CCO; however, these prohibitions may also cause some SDRs or
SDR officers, directors and employees to implement additional controls in their interactions with
the CCO, potentially limiting the scope or timeliness of the information made available to the
CCO. To the extent that compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder results in more accurate data being maintained, publicly disseminated, and reported to
the Commission, the ability of the Commission to rely on the SBS data will improve. Finally,
strong compliance programs may help reduce non-compliance with the SDR Rules by SDRs;
non-compliance with, for example, the privacy requirements (Rules 13n-4(b)(8) and 13n-9), have
the potential of negatively impacting confidence in the overall SBS market.
Rule 13n-11(f) requires SDRs to file annual audited financial reports to the Commission.
This rule will enhance the Commission’s oversight of SDRs by facilitating the Commission’s
evaluation of an SDR’s financial and managerial resources. The financial reports will also assist
the Commission in assessing potential conflicts of interests of a financial nature arising from the
operation of an SDR.
Benefits will also accrue from requiring SDRs to file financial reports in an interactive
data format. This requirement will enable the Commission and, to the extent that the data is
made public, the public to analyze the reported information more quickly, more accurately, and
at a lower cost. In particular, the tagged data will make it easier to aggregate information

401

collected from SDRs and compare across SDRs and over time, which the Commission believes
is important to perform its regulatory mandate and legal responsibilities.
The Commission solicited comment on the benefits related to Rules 13n-4(b)(11) and
13n-11. 1344 The Commission specifically requested comment on the benefits that would accrue
from designating a CCO who would be responsible for preparing and signing an annual
compliance report and reporting annually to the board and on the benefits associated with the
financial reports. 1345 The Commission did not receive any comments on the benefits of these
rules.
b.

Costs

The establishment of a designated CCO and compliance with the accompanying
responsibilities of a CCO will impose certain costs on SDRs. As discussed above, the
Commission estimates that the average initial paperwork cost associated with establishing
procedures for the remediation of noncompliance issues identified by the CCO and establishing
and following appropriate procedures for the handling, management response, remediation,
retesting, and closing of noncompliance issues will be 420 hours and $40,000 for each SDR and
the average ongoing paperwork cost will be 120 hours for each SDR. 1346 In addition, each SDR
is required to retain a CCO in order to comply with the SDR Rules, at an annual cost of
$873,000. 1347 Assuming a maximum of ten SDRs, the aggregate initial estimated dollar cost per

1347

Data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry
2013, modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead,
suggest that the cost of a CCO is $485 per hour. Thus, the total ongoing estimated dollar
402

year will be $1,802,000 1348 and the aggregate ongoing estimated dollar cost per year will be
$9,130,800 1349 to comply with the rules.
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the average ongoing paperwork cost
associated with preparing and submitting annual compliance reports to the SDR’s board pursuant
to Rules 13n-11(d) and (e) will be 5 hours. 1350 Assuming a maximum of ten SDRs, the
aggregate ongoing estimated dollar cost per year will be $16,700 to comply with the rules. 1351
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the average ongoing paperwork cost
associated with preparing and filing financial reports pursuant to Rule 13n-11(f) and (g) and the
amendments to Regulation S-T will be 500 hours and $500,000 for each registered SDR. 1352
Assuming a maximum of ten SDRs, the aggregate ongoing estimated dollar cost per year will be
$5,990,000 to comply with the rules. 1353
cost will be $873,000 per SDR and $8,730,000 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: (CCO
at $485 per hour for 1800 hours) x 10 registrants = $8,730,000.
1348

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Attorney. Thus, the total initial estimated dollar cost will be $180,280 per SDR and
$1,802,800 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: ($40,000 for outside legal services +
(Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for 420 hours)) x 10 registrants = $1,802,800.

1349

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Attorney. Thus, the total ongoing estimated dollar cost will be $913,080 per SDR and
$9,130,800 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: ($873,000 for a CCO + (Compliance
Attorney at $334 per hour for 120 hours)) x 10 registrants = $9,130,800.

1350

See Section VII.D.6 of this release discussing the costs of Rule 13n-11.

1351

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Attorney. Thus, the total ongoing estimated dollar cost will be $1,670 per SDR and
$16,700 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for 5
hours) x 10 registrants = $16,700.

1352

See Section VII.D.6 of this release discussing the costs of Rule 13n-11.

1353

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Senior
Accountant. Data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities
Industry 2013, modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead,
403

As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the average ongoing paperwork cost
associated with filing annual compliance and financial reports with the Commission in a tagged
data format pursuant to Rules 13n-11(d), (f), and (g), and in accordance with the amendments to
Regulation S-T, will be 54 hours and $22,772 for each registered SDR. 1354 Assuming a
maximum of ten SDRs, the aggregate ongoing estimated dollar cost per year will be $368,120 to
comply with the rules. 1355
The Commission believes that existing SDRs may already maintain compliance programs
that are overseen by a CCO or an individual who effectively serves as a CCO. 1356 In addition,
CCOs may prepare compliance reports presented to senior management and/or the SDRs’ boards
as part of their current business practice. SDRs are currently not subject to regulation by the
Commission, and therefore, may need to enhance their compliance programs and compliance
reports to comply with Rules 13n-4(b)(11) and 13n-11. Thus, SDRs may experience costs in
enhancing their compliance programs and compliance reports to comply with Rules 13n-4(b)(11)
suggest that the cost of a Senior Accountant is $198 per hour. Thus, the total ongoing
estimated dollar cost will be $599,000 per SDR and $5,990,000 for all SDRs, calculated
as follows: ($500,000 for independent public accounting services + (Senior Accountant at
$198 per hour for 500 hours)) x 10 registrants = $5,990,000.
1354

See Section VII.D.6 of this release discussing the costs of Rule 13n-11.

1355

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Senior
Systems Analyst. Thus, the total ongoing estimated dollar cost will be $36,812 per SDR
and $368,120 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: ($22,772 for information technology
services + (Senior Systems Analyst at $260 per hour for 54 hours)) x 10 registrants =
$368,120.

1356

Cf. DTCC 2, supra note 19 (stating that it “has an established compliance infrastructure
for its businesses . . . which includes processes for establishing and implementing
required compliance policies and procedures and overseeing adherence to those
procedures and a mechanism for reporting, tracking, remediating and closing compliance
issues whether self-identified or identified through internal or external examinations” and
that “[t]he Commission’s proposed required practices are generally consistent with those
of” the commenter’s trade repository)
404

and 13n-11. Moreover, because the costs discussed above represent the costs of complying with
Rules 13n-4(b)(11) and 13n-11 without any existing compliance programs in place that are
overseen by a CCO or an individual who effectively serves as a CCO, existing SDRs that already
maintain such compliance programs may experience initial costs lower than those estimated
above. However, even if an SDR has an existing compliance program overseen by a CCO, it is
possible that officers, directors, and employees concerned about the prohibition in Rule 13n11(h) (prohibiting officers, directors, and employees of an SDR from directly or indirectly taking
any action to coerce, manipulate, mislead, or fraudulently influence the CCO) may want
expanded liability insurance coverage. In response, an SDR may seek to acquire additional
insurance coverage. The Commission acknowledges that it is possible, therefore, that Rule 13n11(h) may result in liability insurance rates that are above what they would have been in the
absence of the rule. The Commission is unable to estimate these costs given that it lacks specific
information regarding current insurance costs for SDRs, the amount of the demand that there will
be for increased coverage, and thereby the potential increases associated with the rule. The
Commission believes that after SDRs bring their compliance programs and compliance reports
into compliance with Rules 13n-4(b)(11) and 13n-11, however, the ongoing annual costs for
SDRs will likely be consistent with the estimates provided above.
The Commission solicited comment on these estimates related to Rules 13n-4(b)(11) and
13n-11. 1357 The Commission specifically requested comment on the initial and ongoing costs
associated with designating a CCO and the costs associated with any personnel who may be
necessary to support the CCO and create the annual compliance and financial reports. 1358 One

405

commenter stated that it is difficult to assess the incremental costs to SDRs of implementing
Rule 13n-11 regarding designation of a CCO and that even with an established compliance
infrastructure, the commenter believed that “it is likely that the new requirements of Rule 13n-11
will entail additional costs, potentially including additional personnel and systems” and the
“compliance responsibilities in an SDR will evolve (and likely increase) as the scope of
transactions reported to that SDR increase, which may also result in additional incremental
costs.” 1359 The Commission agrees with the commenter’s views; nevertheless the Commission
has attempted to quantify the costs of compliance with the rule, as discussed above.
c.

Alternatives

The Commission considered requiring that the compensation, appointment, and
termination of a CCO be approved by a majority of independent board members of an SDR, a
position urged by two commenters. 1360 As discussed above, the Commission believes that the
rules that are intended to minimize an SDR’s potential and existing conflicts of interest and to
help ensure that SDRs meet core principles are sufficient at this time. Consequently, the
Commission does not believe that requiring SDRs to have independent directors, and imposing
the associated costs on SDRs, is warranted at this time. For these same reasons, the Commission
does not believe that approval of a CCO’s compensation, appointment, and termination by a
majority of independent directors will provide substantially greater benefits than having a

1359

DTCC 2, supra note 19.

1360

See Better Markets 1, supra note 19 (recommending that the CCO’s compensation and
termination be approved by independent board members of an SDR). Similarly, one
commenter suggested that only public independent directors or directors with an
“Independent Perspective,” and not the full board, have “the authority and sole
responsibility to appoint or remove the CCO, or to materially change its duties and
responsibilities.” Barnard, supra note 19.
406

majority of the board approve compensation, appointment, and termination.
Similarly, the Commission considered requiring CCOs to report directly to independent
directors, as suggested by one commenter. 1361 For the reasons stated above, the Commission
does not believe that requiring independent directors, and therefore requiring CCOs to report to
independent directors, is warranted at this time. 1362
The Commission considered whether it should prohibit a CCO from being the general
counsel of an SDR or a member of the SDR’s legal department, as suggested by two
commenters. 1363 The Commission is not adopting this prohibition because, as discussed above,
the Commission believes that any potential conflicts of interest can be adequately addressed by
the SDR’s conflicts of interest policies and procedures, which are required to be established
under Rule 13n-4(c)(3). 1364 The Commission believes that SDRs should have flexibility in
appointing their CCOs and that these conflicts of interest provisions are sufficient to mitigate any
risks from not adopting the prohibition suggested by the commenter. Further, the Commission
believes that imposing such a prohibition could impose additional costs on SDRs by requiring
that they employ two different persons as general counsel and CCO, each position with its own
compensation.
The Commission considered reducing the amount of information required on the annual
compliance report. For example, the Commission could have not required any discussion of
recommendations for material changes to policies and procedures, as suggested by one
1361

See Better Markets 1, supra note 19.

1362

See Section VI.D.3.b.iii of this release discussing prescriptive governance requirements
and limitations.

407

commenter. 1365 The Commission believes, however, that the benefits of obtaining all of the
information required by Rule 13n-11(d) justify any burdens associated with providing such
information on the annual compliance report. The information will assist Commission staff in
assessing an SDR’s compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder, and information about recommendations for material changes to an SDR’s policies
and procedures may alert the staff to material compliance issues at an SDR. Moreover, only
recommendations for material changes will have to be described, which will impose a lesser
burden than requiring disclosure of every recommendation.
The Commission considered, as suggested by one commenter, 1366 harmonizing with the
CFTC’s approach 1367 and not adopting Rule 13n-11(f)(2)’s requirement that each financial report
be audited in accordance with the PCAOB’s standards by a registered public accounting firm that
is qualified and independent. Although the Commission understands that SDRs will incur costs
in hiring and retaining qualified public accounting firms, the Commission believes that obtaining
audited financial reports from SDRs is important given the significant role the Commission
believes that SDRs will play in the SBS market. The Commission believes that SDRs will
provide transparency to, and increase the efficiency of, the SBS market. The Commission
believes that SDRs will also be an important source of market data for regulators. Given the
critical nature of their role in the marketplace, the Commission believes that it is important to
obtain audited financial reports from SDRs in order to determine whether or not they have
sufficient financial resources to continue operations. While the Commission recognizes that
1365

See DTCC 2, supra note 19.

1366

See DTCC 5, supra note 19.

1367

See CFTC Rule 49.25, 17 CFR 49.25.
408

Rule 13n-11(f)(2) may, in some cases, be more costly than the CFTC’s requirement of quarterly
unaudited financial statements, the Commission believes that the additional burden, where it
exists, is justified by the benefits of requiring audited financial reports.
Finally, the Commission considered one commenter’s suggestion that there should be
“[c]ompetency standards to ensure that CCOs have the background and skills necessary to fulfill
their responsibilities.” 1368 The Commission believes that, as discussed above, such standards do
not need to be adopted by rule, but rather that SDRs should have flexibility in determining what
standards their CCOs should meet. 1369 The Commission believes that SDRs are in the best
position to judge the competency of their CCOs and select them accordingly.
7.

Other Policies and Procedures Relating to an SDR’s Business

The SDR Rules require SDRs to develop and maintain various policies and
procedures. 1370 Rules 13n-4(b)(8) and 13n-9 require each SDR to comply with certain
requirements pertaining to the privacy of SBS transaction information. 1371 Rule 13n-4(c)
requires each SDR to comply with certain core principles pertaining to market access to services
and data, governance arrangements, and conflicts of interest, including developing policies and
procedures related to these core principles. 1372 Rule 13n-5(b)(6) requires SDRs to establish
procedures and provide facilities to effectively resolve disputes. 1373

a.

Benefits

The privacy requirements set forth in Rules 13n-4(b)(8) and 13n-9 are intended to
safeguard transaction information provided to SDRs by market participants. These privacy
requirements make it less likely that the transaction information that market participants are
required to report will expose their trading strategies or unhedged positions, which could subject
them to predatory trading.
Rule 13n-4(c)(1), which relates to market access to services and data, requires that SDRs
impose fair, reasonable, and consistently applied fees and maintain objective access and
participation criteria. This rule is designed to help ensure that SDRs do not engage in
anticompetitive behavior and assuming that the SDR Rules promote competition among SDRs,
that the cost of an SDR’s core and ancillary services that are passed on to market participants are
competitive. Furthermore, the Commission believes that by requiring each SDR to permit
market participants to access specific services offered by the SDR separately, Rule 13n4(c)(1)(ii) may promote efficiency to the extent that it saves market participants from having to
purchase ancillary services that they do not want and will not use as a condition to using an
SDR’s data collection and maintenance services. Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(ii) may also promote
efficiency and lower costs to the extent that it promotes competition among SDRs and among
SDRs and third party service providers offering ancillary services.
The governance requirements in Rule 13n-4(c)(2) are designed to reduce conflicts of
interest in the management of SDRs. In addition, by requiring fair representation of market
participants on the board with the opportunity to participate in the process for nominating
directors and the right to petition for alternative candidates, the rule will help reduce the
likelihood that an incumbent market participant will exert undue influence on the board.
410

While the above requirements are designed to prevent and constrain potential conflicts of
interest, Rule 13n-4(c)(3) directly addresses conflicts of interest through targeted policies and
procedures and an obligation to establish a process for resolving conflicts of interest. This rule
will help mitigate the possibility that SDRs’ business practices and internal structures might
disadvantage a particular group of market participants.
The requirement in Rule 13n-5(b)(6) is designed to help ensure that SDRs maintain
accurate records relating to SBSs. 1374 In addition to helping to ensure the accuracy of data
maintained by SDRs, the requirement will provide a facility through which market participants
could correct inaccuracies in SBS data regarding transactions to which they are a party.
Collectively, the rules described in this section will help ensure that SDRs operate
consistently with the objectives set forth in the Exchange Act by providing fair, open, and not
unreasonably discriminatory access to market participants without taking advantage of the
SDRs’ access to transaction data that market participants are required to report to the SDRs.
The Commission solicited comment on the benefits related to Rules 13n-4(c), 13n5(b)(6), 13n-4(b)(8), and 13n-9. 1375 Other than one commenter noting that Rule 13n-5(b)(6) is a
key step in the effort to have accurate data at SDRs, 1376 the Commission did not receive any
comments on the estimated benefits of these rules.

See Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5)(B), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(B) (requiring an SDR to

the data that was submitted); Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5)(C), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(C)

The Commission anticipates that the costs to SDRs from Rules 13n-4(c), 13n-5(b)(6),
13n-4(b)(8), and 13n-9 will derive primarily from the costs of establishing, maintaining, and
enforcing the required policies and procedures.
The governance requirements in Rule 13n-4(c)(2) could impose costs resulting from
educating senior management and each director about SBS trading and reporting and the new
regulatory structure that will govern SBSs, which could slow management or board processes at
least initially. Existing SDRs may experience lower costs, however, to the extent that they have
already educated senior management and each director about SBS trading and reporting and the
new regulatory structure that will govern SBSs.
The requirement in Rule 13n-5(b)(6) will also impose costs on SDRs because SDRs are
required to establish procedures and provide facilities through which market participants can
challenge the accuracy of the transaction data and positions recorded in the SDRs.
Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(ii) may also impose costs on SDRs by requiring SDRs to offer services
separately. If SDRs would otherwise bundle their ancillary services with their data collection
and maintenance services, or vice versa, then the requirement that they offer services separately
may impose costs on SDRs. These costs include the cost of building the infrastructure to offer
services separately, the potential losses of economies of scope in providing bundled services, and
lost revenue from fees for services that market participants would otherwise be required to
purchase. Similarly, the rule may impose costs on third party service providers that would be
prevented from bundling their services with the services of an SDR.
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the average initial paperwork cost
associated with Rule 13n-4(c)(1) will be 367.5 hours and $35,000 and the average ongoing cost
412

will be 105 hours per year for each SDR. 1377 Assuming a maximum of ten SDRs, the aggregate
one-time estimated dollar cost will be $1,465,550 1378 and the aggregate ongoing estimated dollar
cost per year will be $320,890 1379 to comply with the rule.
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the average initial paperwork cost
associated with Rule 13n-4(c)(2) will be 210 hours and $20,000 for each SDR and the average
ongoing paperwork cost will be 60 hours per year for each SDR. 1380 Assuming a maximum of
ten SDRs, the aggregate one-time estimated dollar cost will be $901,400 1381 and the aggregate
ongoing estimated dollar cost per year will be $200,400 1382 to comply with the rule.
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the average initial paperwork cost
associated with Rule 13n-4(c)(3) will be 420 hours and $40,000 for each SDR and the average
1377

See Section VII.D.7 of this release discussing costs of Rules 13n-4(c)(1)(iii) and (iv).

1378

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Manager, an Attorney, a Senior Systems Analyst, and an Operations Specialist. Thus, the
total initial estimated dollar cost will be $146,555 per SDR and $1,465,550 for all SDRs,
calculated as follows: ($35,000 for outside legal services + (Compliance Manager at $283
per hour for 135 hours) + (Attorney at $380 per hour for 152.5 hours) + (Senior Systems
Analyst at $260 per hour for 40 hours) + (Operations Specialist at $125 per hour for 40
hours)) x 10 registrants = $1,465,550.

1379

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Manager, an Attorney, a Senior Systems Analyst, and an Operations Specialist. Thus, the
total ongoing estimated dollar cost will be $32,089 per SDR and $320,890 for all SDRs,
calculated as follows: ((Compliance Manager at $283 per hour for 38 hours) + (Attorney
at $380 per hour for 45 hours) + (Senior Systems Analyst at $260 per hour for 11 hours)
+ (Operations Specialist at $125 per hour for 11 hours)) x 10 registrants = $320,890.

1380

See Section VII.D.7 of this release discussing costs of Rule 13n-4(c)(2)(iv).

1381

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Attorney. Thus, the total initial estimated dollar cost will be $90,140 per SDR and
$901,400 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: ($20,000 for outside legal services +
(Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for 210 hours)) x 10 registrants = $901,400.

1382

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Attorney. Thus, the total ongoing estimated dollar cost will be $20,040 per SDR and
$200,400 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for
60 hours) x 10 registrants = $200,400.
413

ongoing paperwork cost will be 120 hours per year for each SDR. 1383 Assuming a maximum of
ten SDRs, the aggregate one-time estimated dollar cost will be $1,802,800 1384 and the aggregate
ongoing estimated dollar cost per year will be $400,800 1385 to comply with the rule.
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the average initial paperwork cost
associated with Rule 13n-5(b)(6) will be 315 hours and $30,000 for each SDR and the average
ongoing paperwork cost will be 90 hours per year for each SDR. 1386 Assuming a maximum of
ten SDRs, the aggregate one-time estimated dollar cost will be $1,352,100 1387 and the aggregate
ongoing estimated dollar cost per year will be $300,600 1388 to comply with the rule.
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the average initial paperwork cost
associated with Rules 13n-4(b)(8) and 13n-9 will be 630 hours and $60,000 for each SDR and
the average ongoing paperwork cost will be 180 hours per year for each SDR. 1389 Assuming a

See Section VII.D.7 of this release discussing costs of Rule 13n-4(c)(3).

1384

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Attorney. Thus, the total initial estimated dollar cost will be $180,280 per SDR and
$1,802,800 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: ($40,000 for outside legal services +
(Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for 420 hours)) x 10 registrants = $1,802,800.

1385

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Attorney. Thus, the total ongoing estimated dollar cost will be $40,080 per SDR and
$400,800 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for
120 hours) x 10 registrants = $400,800.

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Attorney. Thus, the total initial estimated dollar cost will be $135,210 per SDR and
$1,352,100 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: ($30,000 for outside legal services +
(Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for 315 hours)) x 10 registrants = $1,352,100.

1388

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Attorney. Thus, the total initial estimated dollar cost will be $30,060 per SDR and
$300,600 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for
90 hours) x 10 registrants = $300,600.

the aggregate ongoing estimated dollar cost per year will be $601,200 1391 to comply with the
rules.
The Commission solicited comment on the costs related to Rules 13n-4(c), 13n-5(b)(6),
13n-4(b)(8), and 13n-9. 1392 The Commission specifically requested comment on the initial and
ongoing costs associated with establishing and maintaining the policies and procedures required
by the rules, particularly as the costs apply to persons currently operating as SDRs. 1393 One
commenter believed that an interpretation of Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(i) that prohibits the use of the
“dealer pays” or “sell-side pays” model “would have the unintended consequence of significantly
increasing the costs for buy-side participants . . . .” 1394 Because, as discussed above, Rule 13n4(c)(1)(i) is not intended to prohibit an SDR from utilizing any one particular model, including a
“dealer pays” or “sell-side pays” model, the Commission does not believe that the rule will
necessarily increase costs for buy-side participants, as stated by the commenter. 1395 The
Commission further believes that if there is significant demand by buy-side participants with
reporting responsibility for a “dealer pays” model, then an SDR is likely to provide such a

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Attorney. Thus, the total initial estimated dollar cost will be $270,420 per SDR and
$2,704,200 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: ($60,000 for outside legal services +
(Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for 630 hours)) x 10 registrants = $2,704,200.

1391

The Commission estimates that an SDR will assign these responsibilities to a Compliance
Attorney. Thus, the total ongoing estimated dollar cost will be $60,120 per SDR and
$601,200 for all SDRs, calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for
180 hours) x 10 registrants = $601,200.

service.
A commenter to proposed Regulation SBSR suggested that SDRs should not be permitted
to charge fees to third parties acting on behalf of counterparties for accepting SBS transaction
information, as such fees would increase the cost of using an SB SEF or other third party. 1396
Although the Commission agrees that an SB SEF or other third party could pass along fees
charged by SDRs, the Commission does not believe that it is appropriate to determine who an
SDR can charge for its services. Rather, the Commission believes that SDRs should have
flexibility in determining how and whom to charge for their services, and that any costs
associated with such flexibility are justified by the benefits of allowing SDRs to develop
sustainable business models in an open, competitive environment.
The Commission believes that existing SDRs may already have in place policies and
procedures similar to the policies and procedures required by Rules 13n-4(c), 13n-5(b)(6), 13n4(b)(8), and 13n-9. Such persons are currently not subject to regulation by the Commission, and
therefore, may need to enhance their policies and procedures to comply with Rules 13n-4(c),
13n-5(b)(6), 13n-4(b)(8), and 13n-9. Thus, such persons may experience costs in enhancing
their policies and procedures to comply with Rules 13n-4(c), 13n-5(b)(6), 13n-4(b)(8), and 13n9. Moreover, because the costs discussed above represent the costs of creating policies and
procedures without any existing policies and procedures in place, existing SDRs that already
have policies and procedures may experience initial costs lower than those estimated above. The
Commission believes that after such persons bring their policies and procedures into compliance
with Rules 13n-4(c), 13n-5(b)(6), 13n-4(b)(8), and 13n-9, however, the ongoing annual costs for
such persons will likely be consistent with the estimates provided above.

Alternatives

As suggested by a commenter, the Commission considered (1) adding safeguards
specifically related to confidentiality of trading positions and (2) requiring SDRs to adopt
policies and procedures to limit access to confidential information to directors, officers,
employees, agents, and representatives who need to know such information in order to fulfill
their regulatory obligations. 1397 As discussed above, the Commission believes that Rules 13n4(b)(8) and 13n-9, as adopted, are broad enough to cover information about trading positions, so
no specific requirement regarding confidentiality of trading positions is necessary. 1398 The
Commission also believes that the rules are broad enough to allow SDRs, if they choose, to adopt
policies and procedures to limit access to confidential information to directors, officers,
employees, agents, and representatives who need to know such information in order to fulfill
their regulatory obligations. The Commission believes that the adoption of the specific policies
that were suggested by the commenter would prevent an SDR’s management from finding the
most cost effective method of meeting the privacy requirements in these rules.
The Commission considered, as an alternative to Rules 13n-4(c)(2) and (3), adopting, as
suggested by two commenters, prescriptive rules relating to governance (e.g., ownership or
voting limitations, independent directors, nominating committees composed of a majority of
independent directors). 1399 As discussed above, the Commission believes that rules that are
intended to minimize an SDR’s potential and existing conflicts of interest and to help ensure that

an SDR meets its core principles are sufficient and that prescriptive governance requirements are
not warranted at this time. 1400 If the Commission were to impose additional governance
requirements and limitations, SDRs would likely incur costs in addition to the costs already
imposed by the SDR Rules, which do not seem to be warranted at this time. For these reasons,
the Commission is not adopting the alternative to Rules 13n-4(c)(2) and (3) of more prescriptive
governance arrangements.
The Commission considered whether the resolution of disputes should be left primarily to
the SBS counterparties and third party service providers, which one commenter suggested. 1401
The Commission believes that the benefits of a dispute resolution procedure in Rule 13n-5(b)(6)
justify the possible issues cited by the commenter, such as duplication of services already
provided by third party service providers. As discussed above, there may be instances where a
third party service provider cannot resolve a dispute, and, in those situations, the cost of dispute
resolution through the SDR will be necessary to maintain the accuracy and quality of the SBS
data. 1402 The value of the SBS data depends on its accuracy and quality.
The Commission also considered prohibiting the commercial use of SBS data by SDRs
unless the parties to the SBS provide written consent. Three commenters, including two
commenters to proposed Regulation SBSR, also suggested that SDRs be prohibited from using
SBS data for commercial purposes. 1403 As discussed above, the Commission believes that
limiting the commercial use of SBS data would potentially limit the business models that SDRs

may develop, thereby reducing competition. 1404 Decreased competition may result in higher
costs for SDR services. Limiting the commercial use of SBS data would reduce SDRs’ potential
revenue streams, reducing the profitability and stability of SDRs. Further, as discussed above,
such a limitation may decrease transparency by preventing an SDR from releasing to the public
anonymized, aggregated reports of SBS data. 1405 Finally, the Commission believes that the SDR
Rules, including Rules 13n-4(c)(3) and 13n-9, are sufficient to reduce conflicts of interest and
protect the privacy of SBS data. For these reasons, the Commission is not adopting the
alternative of limiting the commercial use of SBS data.

Total Costs

Based on the analyses described above, the Commission estimates that Rules 13n-1
through 13n-11 and Form SDR will impose on registered SDRs an aggregate total initial onetime estimated dollar cost of $227,075,600.50. 1406 The Commission further estimates that Rules
13n-1 through 13n-11 and Form SDR will impose on registered SDRs a total ongoing annualized
aggregate dollar cost of $145,630,646.10. 1407 Finally, the Commission estimates that certain

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: ($801,688 ($793,840 + $3,840
+ $4,008) for Registration Requirements and Form SDR) + ($214,995,300 ($210,810,000

1407

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: ($55,440 for Registration
Requirements and Form SDR) + ($127,451,400 ($126,486,000 + $965,400) for SDR
Duties, Data Collection and Maintenance, and Direct Electronic Access) + ($790,051.10

non-U.S. persons may incur an aggregate total initial one-time estimated dollar cost of
approximately $7,600 1408 in determining the availability of the SDR Exemption (i.e., Rule 13n12).
Existing SDRs may experience costs lower than these estimates. Such persons may have
in place existing technology systems, policies and procedures, personnel, and compliance
regimes that they can use to comply with the SDR Rules. Because the estimates discussed above
represent the costs of compliance starting from scratch, an existing SDR will most likely
experience costs lower than these estimates.
Similarly, if such a person is registered with the CFTC as a swap data repository, the
person’s costs of complying with the SDR Rules will most likely be lower than the estimates
provided above because the person may be able to use its existing policies, procedures, and
operations to comply with the SDR Rules. As stated above, the Commission believes that on the
whole, the SDR Rules are largely consistent with the rules adopted by the CFTC for swap data
repositories. 1409 Consequently, a person registered with the CFTC as a swap data repository may
be able to use its existing policies, procedures, and operations to comply with the SDR Rules and
may not need to create policies, procedures, and operations from scratch.

$601,200) for Other Policies and Procedures Relating to an SDR’s Business) =
$145,630,646.10.

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: ($380 for one hour of an
Attorney’s time per person) x (20 non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR
using in-house legal counsel to determine whether an applicable MOU or arrangement is
in place).

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) 1410 requires Federal agencies, in promulgating

rules, to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. Section 603(a) 1411 of the
Administrative Procedure Act, 1412 as amended by the RFA, generally requires the Commission to
undertake a regulatory flexibility analysis of all proposed rules, or proposed rule amendments, to
determine the impact of such rulemaking on “small entities.” 1413 Section 605(b) of the RFA
states that this requirement does not apply to any final rule that an agency certifies will not “have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.” 1414
For purposes of Commission rulemaking in connection with the RFA, a small entity
includes: (1) an issuer or a person, other than an investment company, that, on the last day of its
most recent fiscal year, had total assets of $5 million or less and (2) a broker-dealer with total
capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior
fiscal year as of which its audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Exchange Act
Rule 17a-5(d), or, if not required to file such statements, a broker-dealer with total capital (net
worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last business day of the

1412

5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.

1413

Although Section 601(b) of the RFA defines the term “small entity,” the statute permits
agencies to formulate their own definitions. The Commission has adopted definitions for
the term small entity for the purposes of Commission rulemaking in accordance with the
RFA. Those definitions, as relevant to this rulemaking, are set forth in Rule 0-10, 17
CFR 240.0-10. See Final Definitions of “Small Business” and “Small Organization” for
Purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Exchange Act Release No. 18451 (Jan. 28,

preceding fiscal year (or in the time that it has been in business, if shorter); and is not affiliated
with any person (other than a natural person) that is not a small entity. 1415
In the Proposing Release, the Commission stated that it did not believe that any persons
that would register as SDRs would be considered small entities. 1416 The Commission stated that
it believed that most, if not all, SDRs would be part of large business entities with assets in
excess of $5 million and total capital in excess of $500,000. As a result, the Commission
certified that the proposed rules would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of
small entities and requested comments on this certification.
The Commission did not receive any comments that specifically addressed whether Rules
13n-1 through 13n-12 and Form SDR would have a significant economic impact on small
entities. Therefore, the Commission continues to believe that Rules 13n-1 through 13n-12 and
Form SDR will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. 1417 Accordingly, the Commission hereby certifies that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b),
Rules 13n-1 through 13n-12, Form SDR will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities.

§ 232.407 Interactive data financial report filings.
Section 407 of Regulation S-T (§ 232.407) applies to electronic filers that file Interactive
Data Financial Reports (§ 232.11) as required by Rule 13n-11(f)(5) (§ 240.13n-11(f)(5) of this
chapter). Section 407 imposes content, format, and filing requirements for Interactive Data
Financial Reports, but does not change the substantive content requirements for the financial and
other disclosures in the Related Official Financial Report Filing (§ 232.11). Rule 13n-11(f)(5)
specifies the circumstances under which an Interactive Data Financial Report must be filed as an
425

exhibit.
(a) Content, format, and filing requirements – General. Interactive Data Financial
Reports must:
(1) Comply with the content, format, and filing requirements of this section;
(2) Be filed only by an electronic filer that is required to file an Interactive Data Financial
Report pursuant to Rule 13n-11(f)(5) (§ 240.13n-11(f)(5) of this chapter) as an exhibit to a filing;
and
(3) Be filed in accordance with the EDGAR Filer Manual and Rules 13n-11(f)(5) and (g)
(§ 240.13n-11(f)(5) and (g) of this chapter).
(b) Content – categories of information presented. An Interactive Data Financial Report
must consist of only a complete set of information for all periods required to be presented in the
corresponding data in the Related Official Financial Report Filing, no more and no less, for the
following categories, as applicable:
(1) The complete set of the electronic filer’s financial statements (which includes the face
of the financial statements and all footnotes); and
(2) All schedules set forth in Article 12 of Regulation S-X (§§ 210.12-01 through 210.1229 of this chapter) related to the electronic filer’s financial statements.
Note to paragraph (b): It is not permissible for the Interactive Data Financial Report to
present only partial face financial statements, such as by excluding comparative financial
information for prior periods.
(c) Format – Generally. An Interactive Data Financial Report must comply with the
following requirements, except as modified by paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, as applicable,
with respect to the corresponding data in the Related Official Financial Report Filing consisting
426

of footnotes to financial statements or financial statement schedules as set forth in Article 12 of
Regulation S-X (§§ 210.12-01 through 210.12-29 of this chapter):
(1) Data elements and labels—(i) Element accuracy. Each data element (i.e., all text, line
item names, monetary values, percentages, numbers, dates and other labels) contained in the
Interactive Data Financial Report reflects the same information in the corresponding data in the
Related Official Financial Report Filing;
(ii) Element specificity. No data element contained in the corresponding data in the
Related Official Financial Report Filing is changed, deleted or summarized in the Interactive
Data Financial Report;
(iii) Standard and special labels and elements. Each data element contained in the
Interactive Data Financial Report is matched with an appropriate tag from the most recent
version of the standard list of tags specified by the EDGAR Filer Manual. A tag is appropriate
only when its standard definition, standard label, and other attributes as and to the extent
identified in the list of tags match the information to be tagged, except that:
(A) Labels. An electronic filer must create and use a new special label to modify a tag’s
existing standard label when that tag is an appropriate tag in all other respects (i.e., in order to
use a tag from the standard list of tags only its label needs to be changed); and
(B) Elements. An electronic filer must create and use a new special element if and only if
an appropriate tag does not exist in the standard list of tags for reasons other than or in addition
to an inappropriate standard label; and
(2) Additional mark-up related content. The Interactive Data Financial Report contains
any additional mark-up related content (e.g., the eXtensible Business Reporting Language tags
themselves, identification of the core XML documents used and other technology-related
427

content) not found in the corresponding data in the Related Official Financial Report Filing that
is necessary to comply with the EDGAR Filer Manual requirements.
(d) Format – Footnotes - Generally. The part of the Interactive Data Financial Report for
which the corresponding data in the Related Official Financial Report Filing consists of
footnotes to financial statements must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2)
of this section, as modified by this paragraph (d). Each complete footnote must be block-text
tagged.
(e) Format – Schedules - Generally. The part of the Interactive Data Financial Report for
which the corresponding data in the Related Official Financial Report Filing consists of financial
statement schedules as set forth in Article 12 of Regulation S-X (§§ 210.12-01 through 210.1229 of this chapter) must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this
section, as modified by this paragraph (e). Each complete schedule must be block-text tagged.

249.1500) or in any amendment thereto is or becomes inaccurate for any reason, whether before
or after the registration has been granted, the security-based swap data repository shall promptly
file an amendment on Form SDR updating such information. In addition, the security-based
swap data repository shall annually file an amendment on Form SDR within 60 days after the
end of each fiscal year of such security-based swap data repository.
(e) Each security-based swap data repository shall designate and authorize on Form SDR
an agent in the United States, other than a Commission member, official, or employee, who shall

section shall be considered a “report” filed with the Commission for purposes of sections 18(a)
and 32(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78r(a) and 78ff(a)) and the rules and regulations thereunder and
other applicable provisions of the United States Code and the rules and regulations thereunder.
§ 240.13n-2 Withdrawal from registration; revocation and cancellation.
(a) Definition. For purposes of this section, tag (including the term tagged) has the same
meaning as set forth in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T (17 CFR 232.11).
(b) A registered security-based swap data repository may withdraw from registration by
filing a withdrawal from registration on Form SDR (17 CFR 249.1500) electronically in a tagged
data format. The security-based swap data repository shall designate on Form SDR a person to
serve as the custodian of the security-based swap data repository’s books and records. When
filing a withdrawal from registration on Form SDR, a security-based swap data repository shall
update any inaccurate information.
(c) A withdrawal from registration filed by a security-based swap data repository shall
become effective for all matters (except as provided in this paragraph (c)) on the 60th day after
the filing thereof with the Commission, within such longer period of time as to which such
security-based swap data repository consents or which the Commission, by order, may determine
as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, or within such
shorter period of time as the Commission may determine.
(d) A withdrawal from registration that is filed pursuant to this section shall be
considered a “report” filed with the Commission for purposes of sections 18(a) and 32(a) of the

provisions of the United States Code and the rules and regulations thereunder.
432

(e) If the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that
any registered security-based swap data repository has obtained its registration by making any
false and misleading statements with respect to any material fact or has violated or failed to
comply with any provision of the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder,
the Commission, by order, may revoke the registration. Pending final determination of whether
any registration shall be revoked, the Commission, by order, may suspend such registration, if
such suspension appears to the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing on the
record, to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
(f) If the Commission finds that a registered security-based swap data repository is no
longer in existence or has ceased to do business in the capacity specified in its application for
registration, the Commission, by order, may cancel the registration.
§ 240.13n-3 Registration of successor to registered security-based swap data repository.
(a) In the event that a security-based swap data repository succeeds to and continues the
business of a security-based swap data repository registered pursuant to section 13(n) of the Act
(15 U.S.C. 78m(n)), the registration of the predecessor shall be deemed to remain effective as the
registration of the successor if, within 30 days after such succession, the successor files an
application for registration on Form SDR (17 CFR 249.1500), and the predecessor files a
withdrawal from registration on Form SDR; provided, however, that the registration of the
predecessor security-based swap data repository shall cease to be effective 90 days after the
publication of notice of the filing of the application for registration on Form SDR filed by the
successor security-based swap data repository.
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if a security-based swap data repository
succeeds to and continues the business of a registered predecessor security-based swap data
433

repository, and the succession is based solely on a change in the predecessor’s date or state of
incorporation, form of organization, or composition of a partnership, the successor may, within
30 days after the succession, amend the registration of the predecessor security-based swap data
repository on Form SDR (17 CFR 249.1500) to reflect these changes. This amendment shall be
deemed an application for registration filed by the predecessor and adopted by the successor.

analyze the data.
(6) Market participant means any person participating in the security-based swap market,
including, but not limited to, security-based swap dealers, major security-based swap

(c) Compliance with core principles. A security-based swap data repository shall comply
with the core principles as described in this paragraph.
(1) Market access to services and data. Unless necessary or appropriate to achieve the
purposes of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, the security-based swap data
repository shall not adopt any policies or procedures or take any action that results in an
unreasonable restraint of trade or impose any material anticompetitive burden on the trading,
clearing, or reporting of transactions. To comply with this core principle, each security-based
swap data repository shall:
(i) Ensure that any dues, fees, or other charges imposed by, and any discounts or rebates
offered by, a security-based swap data repository are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably
discriminatory. Such dues, fees, other charges, discounts, or rebates shall be applied consistently
across all similarly-situated users of such security-based swap data repository’s services,
including, but not limited to, market participants, market infrastructures (including central
counterparties), venues from which data can be submitted to the security-based swap data
repository (including exchanges, security-based swap execution facilities, electronic trading
venues, and matching and confirmation platforms), and third party service providers;
(ii) Permit market participants to access specific services offered by the security-based
swap data repository separately;
(iii) Establish, monitor on an ongoing basis, and enforce clearly stated objective criteria
that would permit fair, open, and not unreasonably discriminatory access to services offered and
data maintained by the security-based swap data repository as well as fair, open, and not
437

unreasonably discriminatory participation by market participants, market infrastructures, venues
from which data can be submitted to the security-based swap data repository, and third party
service providers that seek to connect to or link with the security-based swap data repository; and
(iv) Establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to review any prohibition or limitation of any person with respect to access to services offered,
directly or indirectly, or data maintained by the security-based swap data repository and to grant
such person access to such services or data if such person has been discriminated against
unfairly.
(2) Governance arrangements. Each security-based swap data repository shall establish
governance arrangements that are transparent to fulfill public interest requirements under the Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder; to carry out functions consistent with the Act, the rules
and regulations thereunder, and the purposes of the Act; and to support the objectives of the
Federal Government, owners, and participants. To comply with this core principle, each
security-based swap data repository shall:
(i) Establish governance arrangements that are well defined and include a clear
organizational structure with effective internal controls;
(ii) Establish governance arrangements that provide for fair representation of market
participants;
(iii) Provide representatives of market participants, including end-users, with the
opportunity to participate in the process for nominating directors and with the right to petition for
alternative candidates; and
(iv) Establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to ensure that the security-based swap data repository’s senior management and each member of
438

the board or committee that has the authority to act on behalf of the board possess requisite skills
and expertise to fulfill their responsibilities in the management and governance of the securitybased swap data repository, have a clear understanding of their responsibilities, and exercise
sound judgment about the security-based swap data repository’s affairs.
(3) Conflicts of interest. Each security-based swap data repository shall establish and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to minimize conflicts of interest in
the decision-making process of the security-based swap data repository and establish a process
for resolving any such conflicts of interest. Such conflicts of interest include, but are not limited
to: conflicts between the commercial interests of a security-based swap data repository and its
statutory and regulatory responsibilities; conflicts in connection with the commercial interests of
certain market participants or linked market infrastructures, third party service providers, and
others; conflicts between, among, or with persons associated with the security-based swap data
repository, market participants, affiliates of the security-based swap data repository, and
nonaffiliated third parties; and misuse of confidential information, material, nonpublic
information, and/or intellectual property. To comply with this core principle, each securitybased swap data repository shall:
(i) Establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to identify and mitigate potential and existing conflicts of interest in the security-based swap data
repository’s decision-making process on an ongoing basis;
(ii) With respect to the decision-making process for resolving any conflicts of interest,
require the recusal of any person involved in such conflict from such decision-making; and
(iii) Establish, maintain, and enforce reasonable written policies and procedures regarding
the security-based swap data repository’s non-commercial and/or commercial use of the security439

based swap transaction information that it receives from a market participant, any registered
entity, or any other person.
Note to § 240.13n-4: This rule is not intended to limit, or restrict, the applicability of other

facilities reasonably designed to effectively resolve disputes over the accuracy of the transaction
data and positions that are recorded in the security-based swap data repository.
(7) If a security-based swap data repository ceases doing business, or ceases to be
registered pursuant to section 13(n) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(n)) and the rules and regulations
thereunder, it must continue to preserve, maintain, and make accessible the transaction data and
historical positions required to be collected, maintained, and preserved by this section in the
manner required by the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and for the remainder of the
period required by this section.
(8) Every security-based swap data repository shall make and keep current a plan to
ensure that the transaction data and positions that are recorded in the security-based swap data
repository continue to be maintained in accordance with Rule 13n-5(b)(7) (§ 240.13n-5(b)(7)),

repository, amendments thereto, or withdrawal from registration.
[Note: The text of Form SDR does not, and the amendments will not, appear in the Code of

UNITED STATES
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Washington, D.C. 20549
FORM SDR
APPLICATION OR AMENDMENT TO APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION OR WITHDRAWAL FROM
REGISTRATION AS SECURITY-BASED SWAP DATA REPOSITORY UNDER
THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING AND FILING FORM SDR

455

1. Form SDR and exhibits thereto are to be filed electronically in a tagged data format through EDGAR with the
Securities and Exchange Commission by an applicant for registration as a security-based swap data repository, by a
registered security-based swap data repository amending its application for registration, or by a registered securitybased swap data repository withdrawing its registration, pursuant to Section 13(n) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rules 13n-1 and 13n-2 thereunder. The electronic filing requirements of Regulation ST will apply to all such filings.
2. With respect to an applicant for registration as a security-based swap data repository, Form SDR also constitutes
an application for registration as a securities information processor. An amendment or withdrawal on Form SDR
also constitutes an amendment or withdrawal of securities information processor registration pursuant to Section
11A of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Applicants for registration as a securities
information processor not seeking to become dually-registered as a security-based swap data repository and a
securities information processor, or registered securities information processors that are not dually-registered as a
security-based swap data repository and a securities information processor, should continue to file on Form SIP.
3. Upon the filing of an application for registration, the Commission will publish notice of the filing and afford
interested persons an opportunity to submit written data, views, and arguments. No application for registration shall
be effective unless the Commission, by order, grants such registration.
4. Individuals’ names shall be given in full (last name, first name, middle name).
5. Form SDR shall be signed by a person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the security-based swap data
repository.
6. If Form SDR is being filed as an application for registration, all applicable items must be answered in full. If any
item is not applicable, indicate by “none” or “N/A” as appropriate.
7. Disclosure of the information specified on this form is mandatory prior to processing of an application for
registration as a security-based swap data repository and a securities information processor. The information will be
used for the principal purpose of determining whether the Commission should grant or deny registration to an
applicant. Except in cases where confidential treatment is requested by the applicant and granted by the
Commission pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and the rules of the Commission thereunder, information
supplied on this form may be made available on the Commission’s website, will be included routinely in the public
files of the Commission, and will be available for inspection by any interested person. A form that is not prepared
and executed in compliance with applicable requirements may be deemed as not acceptable for filing. Acceptance
of this form, however, shall not constitute any finding that it has been filed as required or that the information
submitted is true, current, or complete. Intentional misstatements or omissions of fact constitute federal criminal
violations (see 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 15 U.S.C. 78ff(a)).
8. Rule 13n-1(d) under the Exchange Act requires a security-based swap data repository to amend promptly Form
SDR if any information contained in items 1 through 17, 26, and 48 of this application, or any amendment thereto, is
or becomes inaccurate for any reason. Rule 13n-1(d) under the Exchange Act also requires a security-based swap
data repository to file annually an amendment on Form SDR within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year of such
security-based swap data repository. Rule 13n-2 under the Exchange Act requires a security-based swap data
repository that seeks to withdraw from registration to file such withdrawal on Form SDR.
9. For the purposes of this form, the term “applicant” includes any applicant for registration as a security-based swap
data repository or any registered security-based swap data repository that is amending Form SDR or withdrawing its
registration as a security-based swap data repository. In addition, the term “applicant” includes any applicant for
registration as a securities information processor.
10. Applicants filing Form SDR as an amendment (other than an annual amendment) need to update any information
contained in items 1 through 17, 26, and 48 that has become inaccurate since the security-based swap data
repository’s last filing of Form SDR. An applicant submitting an amendment (other than an annual amendment)
represents that all unamended information contained in items 1 through 17, 26, and 48 remains true, current, and

456

complete as filed.
11. Applicants filing a withdrawal need to update any items or exhibits that are being amended since the securitybased swap data repository’s last filing of Form SDR. An applicant submitting a withdrawal represents that all
unamended items and exhibits remain true, current, and complete as filed.
12. Applicants filing an annual amendment must file a complete form, including all pages, answers to all items,
together with all exhibits. Applicants filing an annual amendment must indicate which items have been amended
since the last annual amendment, or, if the security-based swap data repository has not yet filed an annual
amendment, since the security-based swap data repository’s application for registration.
DEFINITIONS: Unless the context requires otherwise, all terms used in this form have the same meaning as in the
Exchange Act, as amended, and in the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
This collection of information will be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the
clearance requirements of 44 U.S.C. 3507. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control number. The Commission
estimates that the average burden to respond to Form SDR will be between 12 and 482 hours depending upon the
purpose for which the form is being filed. Any member of the public may direct to the Commission any comments
concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and any suggestions for reducing this burden. It is mandatory that a
security-based swap data repository file all notifications, updates, and reports required by Rules 13n-1 and 13n-2
using Form SDR.
