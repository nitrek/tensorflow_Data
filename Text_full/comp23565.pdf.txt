COMPLAINT
Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), for its complaint
against Defendants Thomas J. Connerton (“Connerton”) and Safety Technologies, LLC (“Safety
Tech”), alleges as follows:
SUMMARY
1.

This case involves a decade-long unlawful offering of unregistered securities to

investors who, together, have invested a total of over $2.3 million in Safety Tech, a company that
is purportedly developing a cut and puncture resistant surgical glove. Many of the investors do
not have sufficient investing experience and/or the financial means to participate in a risky and
speculative investment in an unproven company like Safety Tech. Further, since at least October
2013, Connerton has made material misstatements and omitted crucial information about Safety
Tech’s business and prospects when soliciting new investments. Specifically, he has
misrepresented that a lucrative deal to license or sell the company’s unproven technology is
imminent, when in fact there is no such deal under negotiation.
2.

In reality, Connerton has spent little money on research, development, and testing

Case 3:16-cv-00882-AWT Document 1 Filed 06/08/16 Page 2 of 16

that would be needed to develop the purported technology to the point of being ripe for any
licensing or sale. Connerton has instead spent the majority of investor money on his own salary
and personal expenses, such as rent and utilities for the apartment he shares with his fiancée.
The trend has worsened in 2016—despite raising approximately $132,500 from investors since
January 1, 2016, Connerton has spent nothing on research, development, or testing of the
purported technology, rendering illusory the prospect of any deal to license or sell the purported
technology.
3.

As a result of the conduct alleged herein, Defendants have violated, and unless

restrained and enjoined will continue to violate, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities
Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c), and 77q(a)], and Section 10(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5
thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 340.10b-5].
NATURE OF THE PROCEEDING AND RELIEF SOUGHT
4.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by

Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)] and Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act
[15 U.S.C. 78u(d)].
5.

The Commission seeks emergency preliminary relief, including a temporary

restraining order against further violations of the federal securities laws and an emergency asset
freeze to preserve any assets necessary to satisfy any eventual judgment against Defendants. The
Commission also requests an immediate accounting, expedited discovery, and an evidence
preservation order to facilitate the prompt resolution of this matter on the merits.
6.

The Commission also seeks a permanent injunction against Defendants, enjoining

them from engaging in the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this

2

instrumentalities of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or the mails.
DEFENDANTS
9.

Thomas J. Connerton, age 64, is a Connecticut resident. He is the founder,

president, and CEO of Safety Tech. He has no source of income other than money he receives
from investors in connection with Safety Tech. Connerton also has substantial personal
liabilities, including approximately $150,000 in state and federal tax liens.
10.

Safety Technologies, LLC, is a Connecticut limited liability company with its

principal place of business in Simsbury, Connecticut.
FACTS
A.

Safety Tech.
11.

Safety Tech was founded in 2006 to develop the purported invention of a

chemical engineer (“the chemical engineer”) who Connerton met in 2005. According to Safety
3

Case 3:16-cv-00882-AWT Document 1 Filed 06/08/16 Page 4 of 16

Tech’s securities offering materials from 2006, the company’s “first project is to develop, seek
patent protection for and commercialize a highly durable puncture and cut resistant material for
the surgical glove market and other related markets.” Safety Tech’s glove project is its only line
of business. To date, Safety Tech has obtained no patents and has not sold or licensed any
products or intellectual property. Its operating funds come entirely from raising money from
investors.
12.

The chemical engineer died in November 2008. Connerton, who has no formal

education or training in chemical engineering, stated in testimony before the staff of the
Commission that the chemical engineer’s death left him “with notes which were un-legible and
[which he] literally had to go back to [his] chemistry books to understand what it was that [the
chemical engineer] was involved with.” Since the chemical engineer’s death, Connerton has
been responsible for all of Safety Tech’s business activities and fundraising.
B.

Safety Tech Has Raised More Than $2.3 Million from Approximately 55 Investors
Through An Unlawful Offering of Unregistered Securities.
13.

Safety Tech began raising money in 2006 by selling unregistered securities to

individuals, most of whom Connerton personally solicited to invest in the Company. Safety
Tech has raised more than $2.3 million from about 55 investors since 2006, including about $1.4
million since June 2011 and $132,500 to date in 2016.
14.

Under the federal securities laws, securities offered for sale to the public

ordinarily must be registered with the Commission. In particular, the federal securities laws
impose requirements that potential investors—especially investors who lack investing experience
and/or the financial wherewithal to withstand a loss of their money—have full information upon
which to base their investment decisions.
15.

Of Safety Tech’s approximately 55 investors, six (6) are women Connerton met

4

Case 3:16-cv-00882-AWT Document 1 Filed 06/08/16 Page 5 of 16

through a well-known Internet dating service and another 14 are family members or friends of
those six women. Approximately 36% of Safety Tech’s investors and about 51% of the money
Connerton has raised tie back to Connerton’s online dating activities.
16.

Defendants have never registered Safety Tech’s securities with the Commission.

17.

On various occasions, Defendants instead claimed to have engaged in a “private

offering” that is exempt from the registration requirements imposed by the federal securities
laws. Defendants, however, have failed to comply with the rules that would permit such an
exemption.
18.

Among other failures, Defendants have failed to comply with the rules that,

among other things, require the sellers of securities in an exempt offering to (i) limit certain
offerings to $1 million, (ii) provide audited financial statements to certain investors “at a
reasonable time prior to the sale of securities,” and (iii) ensure that potential and actual investors
have the financial wherewithal or investing experience to participate in an unregistered securities
offering. Connerton has raised more than $1 million, does not maintain or provide the requisite
financial information to investors, has failed to even inquire whether prospective investors have
the financial wherewithal or investing experience to participate in an unregistered offering, and
has sold securities to investors who do not meet these requirements. For these and other reasons,
Defendants engaged in an unlawful unregistered offering.
C.

Connerton’s Pitch.
19.

Since at least October 2013, Connerton has made a variant of the following pitch

to prospective investors:
•

Connerton claims in written and oral communications that Safety Tech’s technology
makes surgical gloves more cut and puncture resistant, and more durable;

•

Connerton prepared a PowerPoint presentation which represents that the technology

5

Case 3:16-cv-00882-AWT Document 1 Filed 06/08/16 Page 6 of 16

is “low cost” and an “easy addition to glove manufacturing”;
•

In the same presentation, Connerton has represented that the technology is a
“revolutionary” “patent pending polymer additive” that “addresses a costly, unmet
need” in the surgical and exam glove markets; and

•

Connerton represents that multiple major glove manufacturers are interested in Safety
Tech’s technology and that a lucrative licensing deal or sale of the company is
imminent.

19.

Connerton has also repeatedly touted outsized investment returns, including the

following statements:

D.

•

Connerton has presented a document titled “Scenario Analysis” that predicts
returns to the company over ten years ranging from $33 million
(“conservative estimate”) to $1.7 billion (“optimistic estimate”). Connerton
further represented that, “[t]his is total validation of the assumptions in the
material development.” As Connerton knows, however, the scenarios were
prepared by a consultant for illustrative purposes, relied on numerous
assumptions, and were not meant to reflect actual predictions about the
business.

•

Connerton has also prepared a “Sell Sheet” that predicts a return between 9.1
to 36.4 times their investment

•

Connerton has further stated that he was once offered $30 million for the
technology but turned it down; that the technology is worth $60-200 million;
and that one prospective investor could expect a return on investment between
$7 million and $63 million.

Connerton Provides Outdated, Inadequate, and Incomplete Information to
Investors.
20.

Connerton provides to some investors a copy of an “Operating Agreement” dated

November 20, 2006, which purports to govern the rights and responsibilities of Safety Tech’s
management (i.e., Connerton) and its investors. On its face, the Operating Agreement requires
Safety Tech to maintain financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States (often referred to as “U.S. GAAP”), and to make those
financial statements available to investors on demand. In actuality, as Connerton well knows,
Safety Tech does not maintain such financial information. Neither Safety Tech nor Connerton

6

Case 3:16-cv-00882-AWT Document 1 Filed 06/08/16 Page 7 of 16

provides any financial statements—much less U.S. GAAP-compliant financial statements—to
prospective investors.
21.

In soliciting prospective investors, Connerton has shown various individuals a

document that purports to be a “Private Placement Memorandum” (“PPM”), and which includes
a variety of representations about Safety Tech and its securities offering. There are two versions
of the PPM, one dated in 2006 and the other in 2008. The PPM has not been updated since 2008,
but Connerton still uses these eight- to ten-year-old documents to solicit some investors.
Moreover, Connerton only showed some of his prospective investors a version of the PPM
during his pitch, and he does not generally let investors keep a copy.
22.

The 2006 and 2008 PPMs contain certain cautionary language about investing in

the company, including statements to the effect that the investor could lose all of his or her
money. Because he does not generally let investors keep a copy of a PPM, investors’
opportunity to review the approximately 82-page document is necessarily limited and Connerton
effectively conceals critical information about the risk of investing in an unproven company such
as Safety Tech. One investor who invested in the company on four occasions between 2012 and
2015 was never told that there was a chance she could lose her entire investment.
23.

On various occasions, Connerton has shown prospective investors a document,

dated August 2, 2006, which is appended to both the 2006 and 2008 PPMs. The document
purports to be a law firm opinion letter concerning a patent application and states, “we believe
the subject invention is useful and, based upon the results of our preliminary search, tentatively
appears to be novel as well.” However, Safety Tech filed three patent applications in 2007,
2008, and 2015, respectively. The subject matter of the 2015 patent application is different from
the subject matter analyzed in the 2006 opinion letter for which a patent was sought in the 2007

7

Case 3:16-cv-00882-AWT Document 1 Filed 06/08/16 Page 8 of 16

and 2008 applications. Both the 2007 and 2008 patent applications were rejected by the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office. Connerton, however, continues to show the 2006 and/or 2008
PPMs to investors, each of which includes the 2006 patent opinion letter.
24.

Connerton has represented to various investors, by direct statement and by

providing copies of the so-called Operating Agreement, that Safety Tech maintains and will
provide investors with current and accurate financial information about the company. For
example, in or about April 15, 2015, Connerton represented: “What I would really like to
emphasize is that we are an open book company meaning that any investor can look at the books
at any time. No Bernie Madof’s [sic] here!” In actuality, Connerton routinely denies investors’
requests for information about the financial condition of the company and, indeed, does not
maintain current or accurate books for the company.
25.

Other than its tax returns, Safety Tech does not keep financial records, and the

records it does keep are inaccurate and/or incomplete. For example:
•

No records of how investor money is spent. Connerton provides certain
financial information to a Certified Public Accountant to prepare tax returns,
but does not itemize how he spends investor money.

•

No records of information provided to prospective investors. Connerton
claims the company once maintained a log of PPM recipients, but he claims
the log was kept in a box in the corner of a barn before being destroyed by
water damage in fall of 2015.

•

Incomplete and inaccurate investor list. Safety Tech’s list of its investors is
incomplete and inaccurate, both as to the identities of investors and as to the
amounts they have invested.

•

Failure to properly record money received from investors. One investor
gave Connerton an additional $5,000 in October 2015, which Connerton
claims was an undocumented loan with no agreed terms. The investor—a 73year-old widow with limited investing experience —wrote “Investment” in
the memo line of her check, however, and understood the payment to be an
additional investment in Safety Tech.

E.

The Company Has Spent Most Investor Money on Connerton’s Personal
Expenses.
26.

Connerton has solicited investment in Safety Tech by representing that money

raised would be used to “fund the company . . . finish prototyping and demonstrations[, and]
secure [its] first commercial agreement.” Connerton has fueled investors’ expectations that their
money would be used to fund the business of the company by showing them the 2006 and 2008
PPMs, both of which reference a “use of proceeds” disclosure. In the 2008 PPM, however, the
page containing the use of proceeds disclosure is missing.
27.

The 2006 PPM’s use of proceeds disclosure purports to show the following

estimated expenses for an 18-month period after the 2006 PPM issued:
DESCRIPTION

ESTIMATED COST

Base technical development, including laboratory fees, materials,
facility rental fees and travel expenses

$55,000

$45,000

$50,000

Total

$950,000

In actuality, the company’s use of investor funds is inconsistent with the use of proceeds
disclosure in the 2006 PPM, Connerton’s representations to investors, and a reasonable
investor’s expectations.
28.

As Connerton well knew, Safety Tech’s spending since 2009 has differed

materially from the use of proceeds reflected in the 2006 PPM. Notably, the 2006 PPM

9

Case 3:16-cv-00882-AWT Document 1 Filed 06/08/16 Page 10 of 16

represents that approximately 22% of offering proceeds would be used for development of the
purported technology and 23% would be paid to Connerton. Safety Tech’s actual use of
proceeds from February 2009 through May 23, 2016, tells a different story:

Since 2009, Safety Tech has only spent about 7% of the money Connerton raised from investors
on research and development of the company’s purported technology, while Connerton has paid
himself at least 43% directly, and has spent an additional 13% on personal and non-business
expenses (including purchasing a car).
29.

From January 1, 2016 to present, Connerton has taken an even greater share of

investor money for himself. In that time, he has taken approximately $92,553 (or 66%) of
investor money for his own use:

Of the amounts paid to himself, Connerton spent $20,000 in March 2016 on an engagement ring
for his current fiancée. Connerton also withdrew an additional $12,000 in April 2016 after
learning that he and the company were under investigation. Most recently, Connerton accepted a
$30,000 investment from a new investor on May 13, 2016. Connerton paid himself $8,000 of
that amount between May 16 and 18, 2016, and spent an additional $2,868 on personal expenses
during the same timeframe. He then withdrew the remaining amount from Safety Tech’s
corporate bank account in a series of cashier’s checks written to himself by May 23 after Safety
Tech’s bank notified him that it would “no longer provide banking services to [Safety Tech] . . .
based on our costs for compliance, regulatory obligations and potential risks.”
30.

In 2016, other than paying preexisting liabilities to consultants and one investor,

Connerton has not spent any investor money on testing, research, or development of the
purported technology.
F.

Connerton Has Made Materially False Statements about the Company’s Business
and Prospects.
31.

When soliciting prospective investors, Connerton has made false and misleading

statements and has omitted critical information concerning the status of his business discussions
with glove manufacturers.
32.

On various occasions, Connerton has represented to investors that Safety Tech is

negotiating, or is on the verge of negotiating an imminent and lucrative licensing deal with major
manufacturers of surgical and medical exam gloves. For example:
•

In October 2013, Connerton emailed a supplier of synthetic latex that: “We
are in the process of initial negotiations with a number of potential partners
regarding the possible licensing of our technology . . . .” Connerton forwarded
the email to an investor on October 14, 2013, who subsequently gave
Connerton more money.

•

In September 2014, Connerton emailed a prospective investor who later
invested in the company, that “[o]ur sale of this technology now involves
11

Case 3:16-cv-00882-AWT Document 1 Filed 06/08/16 Page 12 of 16

discussions with companies such as [Company A], 3.3 billion in annual sales
and publically traded on the NYSE, Please Google them. They call me weekly
many times.” Company A, however, is not a glove manufacturer and has
never indicated interest in purchasing or licensing Safety Tech’ purported
technology.
•

In April 2016, Connerton forwarded an email to investors stating that “I am
receiving phone calls, even today, from other interested parties and companies
that I have offered . . . the right to sub-license . . . I am in a unique position in
that I have no lack of interest regarding my technology.”

•

In early May 2016, Connerton told another prospective investor who later put
$30,000 into the company on or about May 13, 2016, that four major glove
manufacturers each indicated that “they want it,” referring to Safety Tech’
purported technology, and that the deal under negotiation “[is] going to be an
exclusive license or a nonexclusive license.”

33.

Connerton’s representations regarding purported negotiations with glove

manufacturers were materially misleading. As Connerton well knew at the time he made these
representations, there was no licensing deal under negotiation, much less was any purported deal
imminent. None of the three glove manufacturers Connerton identified to investors has told
Connerton that it currently seeks to license or buy Safety Tech’s purported technology. Several
have communicated to Connerton that they might be interested in the purported technology,
provided Connerton can demonstrate to their satisfaction that it works. Each has communicated
to Connerton that independent testing of the purported technology—at Safety Tech’s expense—
is a prerequisite to even discussing any potential licensing deal. To date, however, Connerton
has not demonstrated to any of the glove manufacturers he identified to recent investors that the
purported technology works at all, much less that it can be incorporated into a commercially
viable product. At various times, Connerton has named a fourth glove manufacturer, but has
represented to at least one investor that Safety Tech will not transact business with that company.
34.

Connerton’s interactions with one of the major glove manufacturers that he has

identified to investors (“Manufacturer A”) are typical. In July 2013, Connerton was informed

12

Case 3:16-cv-00882-AWT Document 1 Filed 06/08/16 Page 13 of 16

that Manufacturer A had told a Safety Tech consultant that “nothing ST [Safety Tech] disclosed
to [Manufacturer A] was novel and that any test data [Safety Tech] provided was not compelling
to the engineers.” Yet, after July 2013, Connerton continued to tell prospective investors that
Manufacturer A is a company with which he is “in discussions” to license or sell the purported
technology, and did so as recently as the first week of May 2016. Connerton unilaterally
contacted Manufacturer A in early 2016 after nearly three years of silence, but has not provided
any new information that would change its 2013 assessment. There has been no negotiation of
any licensing “deal” between Safety Tech and Manufacturer A .
35.

Similarly, two other major glove manufacturers that Connerton has identified to

investors and with whom he has claimed to be in negotiations (“Manufacturer B” and
“Manufacturer C”) have received insufficient information from Connerton to evaluate his claims
about the purported technology. No “deal” to license or buy Safety Tech’s purported technology
is under negotiation with either glove manufacturer
36.

Connerton also falsely represented to one investor that he was offered $30 million

for Safety Tech’s purported technology, but turned the offer down. In fact, no potential licensee
or buyer has offered Defendants any such sum to license or purchase the purported technology.
