FOREWORD
A little over 25 years has passed since adoption of the first Federal
securities law which, like subsequent enactments, was designed to protect the interests of investors and of the public generally. On this
"silver anniversary" of the organization of the Securities and Exchange Commission to administer those laws, it is fitting in this 25th
Annual Report to review the causes, objectives and principal features
of the statutes under which the Commission is charged with responsibilities in the interest of protecting investors and the public.
The Federal securities laws were not designed to prevent investors
from losing money in the stock market j indeed, it is extremely doubtful whether any laws could do this in a free economy. These laws
seek, by requiring disclosure of the facts about issues of securities
offered in interstate commerce or traded on exchanges, by prohibiting
fraud in such transactions, and by other means, to secure the dissemination of accurate information to investors and to foster sound
securities markets. More fundamentally, they aim to require that
those who deal with the investments of the American people observe
high standards of conduct.
If the present financial markets are compared with those of thirty
years ago, it may reasonably be concluded that these basic objectives
have been realized. This is so notwithstanding the fact that the present level of economic and financial activity, with resulting opportunities for fraud and malpractice, puts the structure of Federal securities
regulation to a most severe test.
One of the basic objectives of the Federal securities laws in providing protection for investors was to bring about a restoration
of investor confidence in securities and the securities markets. Such
confidence had been severely shaken as a result of the stock market
debacle of 1929 and its aftermath. Restoration of investor confidence
was important not only to those in the securities industry whose livelihood depended upon it, but was of tremendous importance to our
whole economy. In order to grow and prosper, business and industry
require large amounts of capital for plant expansion, new equipment
and working capital, and the availability of such capital depends in
large measure upon the investing public's confidence in securities as a
safe and profitable medium for the investment of its savings. The
restoration and maintenance of investor confidence are thus intimately
related to industrial growth and a healthy economy.

FOREWORD

On September 1, 1929, the market value of all stocks listed on the
New York Stock Exchange amounted to $89 billion. By the middle
of 1932 their market value had declined to $15 billion. As of June
30, 1959, stocks listed on that Exchange had an aggregate market
value of almost $300 billion.
Also significant are the data with respect to the public offerings.
During the last 5 fiscal years (1955-59), there have been 4,336 registered public offerings of securities aggregating nearly $71 billion in
amount-or an average of 867 offerings amounting to $14 billion per
year. For the prior 20 fiscal years (1935-54), the number of registered offerings averaged 446 and were in the average amount of
$4:1h billion per year. Although figures for the years prior to 1934
are not strictly comparable, it 'appears that less than $400 million of
new issues were offered in the depression year 1933, while about $10
billion were offered in the peak year 1929, much of which proved
worthless.
It is interesting to note in this connection that, according to available data, business invested about $11 billion in new plant and equipment in 1929. Capital outlays by business averaged $4% billion per
year during the 3 years 1934-35-36, increased to an average of $10
billion during the years 1944-45-46 and reached an average of $30
billion in the years 1954-55-56. New capital investment amounted, to
a record $37 billion in 1957 and $30 billion in 1958; and it is anticipated
that such investments will increase to $33 billion in 1959. To complete the picture, gross national product, which amounted to $104 billion in 1929, averaged $73 billion per year for the period 1934-35-36,
$212 billion for 1944-45-46, and $393 billion for 1954-55-56. The
figure grew to $442 billion for each of the years 1957 and 1958, and is
expected to reach an all-time high of $485 billion for 1959.
A true measurement of the benefits which have derived from Federal
securities administration is of course impossible, but some indication
of the advancements made in behalf of investor protection appears
in a comparison of the financial community and the nature of its
operations today with that which existed prior to the federal
regulation of securities.
The picture of financial and corporate practices existing in the earlier era, as unfolded in congressional and other investigations, some
conducted by the Commission itself, demonstrated the need for legislation action. Responsible persons in financial institutions, corporate
executives and many others entrusted with the savings of investors,
to whom they owed a high degree of fiduciary care and responsibility,
had abused the trust thus reposed in them. With respect particularly
to the sale of new securities, the House of Representatives in its report

FOREWORD

xv

on the first legislative enactment in the securities field (Report :No.
85, 73d Congress, First Session) stated, in part:
"During. the post-war decade some 50 billions of new securities were
floated in the United States. Fully half or $25,000,000,000 worth of
securities floated during this period have become worthless. These cold
figures spell tragedy in the lives of thousands of individuals who invested
their life savings, accumulated after years of effort, in these worthless
securities. The flotation of such a mass of essentially fraudulent securities was made possible because of the complete abandonment by many
underwriters and dealers in securities of those standards of fair, honest
and prudent dealing that should be basic to the encouragement of investment in any enterprise. .Alluring promises of vast wealth' were freely
made with little or no attempt to bring to the investor's attention those
facts essential to estimating the worth of any security. High-pressure
salesmanship rather than careful counsel was the rule in this most dangerous of enterprises."

These and other abuses contributed to a collapse of values, and their
revelation seriously undermined the confidence of the investing public
in the capital markets and in securities as media of investment. The
orgy of speculation which had existed in the stock market, coupled
with the fraud, manipulation and other malpractices then prevalent,
could lead only to disaster.
One of the evils was the artificial stimulation of interest in, and the
manipulation of the market price of, a given security so that it might
be "dumped" on unsuspecting investors at the higher price and with a
handsome profit to the manipulator. "Pool" operations were numerous, the operators timing their purchases and sales in a manner which
created market activity at increasingly higher prices and thereby
stimulated participation by the investing public, whose purchases
further accentuated the market rise. When the price reached its
desired level, the pool operators "pulled the plug", dumping their
securities on the market at the higher price, whereupon the market
price slumped to its original level or lower. The operators also participated in "bear raids", and, assuming a short position in a particular stock, engaged in a series of transactions which drove the market
price of the stock down to a level at which they could cover their short
position at a profit.
These and similar operations resulted in a situation in which no one
could be sure that market prices for securities bore any reasonable relation to intrinsic values or reflected the impersonal forces of supply
and demand. In fact, the investigation record demonstrated that
during 1929 the prices of over 100 stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange were subject to manipulation by massive pool operations.
One of the principal contributing factors to the success of the manipulator was the inability of investors and their advisers to obtain
reliable financial and other information upon which to evaluate securi-

ties, and manipulators were further aided by the dissemination of
false and misleading information, tips and rumors which flooded the
market place.
There were other factors which were shown to have contributed to the fundamental weakness of the pre-SEC securities
market.
Principal among these was the extensive use of credit
to finance speculative activities or the purchase of stock on margin. Speculators ignored the fact that the yield on stocks purchased
on margin was far less than the interest on their debit balances with
brokers. There was almost no limit to the amount of credit which a
broker might extend to his customer. As a result, a slight decline in
the market price of securities could, and did, set off a chain reactionthe customer was sold out in a declining market at a loss because he
had insufficient funds to put up additional margin; such distress sales
further accentuated the market decline and caused other margin customers to be sold out; and brokers who had over-extended themselves
with banks in order to finance excessive speculation by customers were
hard-pressed for capital and some even became insolvent, thus further
endangering the position of other customers.
The misuse of corporate information by management officials and
other "insiders" was also common practice. Executive officers who
owed a high degree of fiduciary responsibility to the company and
its stockholders withheld vital information about the company, its
operations and earnings, while accumulating a personal position in its
stock, placing themselves in position to capitalize on any fluctuation
in the price of the stock when the news was released to the public.
Moreover, the entrenched position of management was fortified by
lax standards governing the solicitation of proxies by means of which
management perpetuated itself in power.
An extensive investigation of electric and gas utility holding companies conducted by the Federal Trade Commission, which has often
been termed the most comprehensive study of any industry undertaken by the Federal government, had disclosed widespread abuses in
the formation and operation of utility holding company systems,
including (1) inadequate disclosure to investors of the information
necessary to appraise the financial position and earning power of the
companies whose securities they purchase; (2) issuance of securities
against fictitious and unsound values; (3) overloading of operating
companies with debt and fixed charges, which tended to prevent voluntary rate reductions; (4) imposition of excessive charges upon
operating companies for various services such as management, construction work and the purchase of supplies and equipment; (5) the
control by holding companies of the accounting practices and rate,
dividend and other policies of their operating subsidiaries so as to

FOREWORD

XVII

complicate and obstruct State regulation; (6) the control of holding
companies and subsidiaries through disproportionately small investment; and (7) the extension of holding company system control and
domination over far-flung utility properties without regard to the
integration and coordination of related properties.
Starting with operating company common stocks, representing fractional investments in the properties themselves, the holding companies
issued billions of dollars of debt securities and preferred stocks and
pyramided holding company upon holding company in such a way
that control represented by the voting stock of the top company was
based on little or no actual investment in the operating properties at
the bottom level, at which level alone were generated the earnings and
income to support the entire system. The imposition of leverage
security upon leverage security had the result that a small percentage
increase in operating company income would be phenomenally magnified at the level of the top holding company's most junior equity
securities. But this factor of magnification worked in reverse when
income declined. Electric and gas operating companies actually suffered less during the depression days of the early 1930s than almost
any other substantial segment of our economy. Their operating
revenues dropped no more than about 15 percent from the peak levels
of the 1920s. That drop, however, was enough to bring down in ruins
many of the fantastic corporate superstructures that had been imposed
on top of the operating companies. Several of the largest holding
companies were forced into bankruptcy. The investing public which
had been induced to purchase their securities suffered tragic losses of
untold millions of dollars.
It has been estimated that, from 1924 to 1930, utility holding companies floated some $5 billion of securities, the great bulk of which
went not to build or improve utility properties but to purchase already outstanding voting securities of operating utility companies.
The businesses of some of the companies acquired had no remote relationship to that of an electric or gas utility and one system even included a baseball team. The build-up, without any economic justification, of huge utility empires stretching across the nation was exempilfied by one holding company which grew in gross assets from $6
million in 1923 to $1 billion in 1929, only to become insolvent and
require years for its reorganization and rehabilitation-not, however,
without tremendous losses to the investing public.
From September 1929 to April 1936, 53 utility holding companies
with about $1.7 billion of securities outstanding went into receivership
or bankruptcy. An additional 23 holding companies with about $535
million of outstanding securities defaulted on interest and offered re529523--59--2

XVIII

FOREWORD

adjustment plans. At December 1940, registered holding companies
had about $2.5 billion of preferred stock outstanding of which $1.4
billion had dividend arrearages amounting to $476 million.
The financial practices of the holding companies had also resulted
in serious injury to many of their operating subsidiaries. From
September 1929 to April 1936, 36 utility subsidiaries, with outstanding securities of $445 million, went into bankruptcy or receivership.
An additional 16 such companies with $152 million of outstanding
securities offered readjustment or extension plans after defaulting on
interest. Of preferred stocks of operating subsidiaries aggregating
about $1.6 billion at December 1940, some $453 million had dividend
arearages amounting to about $165 million.
Another investigation, conducted by the Commission in the mid1930's,of companies engaging in the business of investing, reinvesting
and trading in securities and which offer their own securities for
public sale in order to obtain investment capital, clearly indicated the
need for regulation of this important segment of our financial community. Here again, the evidence showed a callous disregard by certain management officials of their fiduciary obligations to investors
and, in many instances, a course of conduct which clearly constituted
fraud. Among the practices revealed by the Commission's investigation were the purchase and sale of portfolio securities by and between
the company, its management officials and other affiliated interests,
for the personal profit of the insiders. The sale of investment company shares through false and fraudulent representations was a
common practice.
This investigation also disclosed that no machinery existed for
enforcing fiduciary responsibilities of individuals and firms which
were engaged in the business of advising others, for compensation,
with respect to their purchases and sales of securities, and that
serious abuses were possible and probable.
Another Commission investigation disclosed practices which
evidenced a need for independent trustees to provide protection
of the interests of security holders in the areas of corporate reorganizations of insolvent corporations and the issuance and sale of
debt securities pursuant to mortgage and other indentures.
'Yith these exposures of malpractices Congress stepped into the
breach and imposed, upon those engaged in the purchase and sale of
securities, standards of conduct which should long since have been
universally recognized by them as basic to any proper relationship to
public investors. In fact, they were based upon the fundamental concepts of fiduciary obligation which the law already imposed on those
managing other people's money and securities.

FOREWORD

XIX

The first remedial measure, the Securities Act of 1933, dealt with
the capital formation process so essential to industrial growth. In
urging the passage of this legislation, which he characterized as the
"Truth in Securities" law, President Roosevelt stated that what was
sought was "a return to a clearer understanding of the ancient truth
that those who manage ... other people's money are trustees ... "
The primary aim of the legislation was to provide public disclosure
of all financial and other data bearing upon the worth of securities
so that they might be realistically evaluated by investors. It also
sought to outlaw fraud in the sale of securities under a broadened
concept of fraud not limited by technical common law definitions.
Disclosure under the Securities Act is accomplished in a two-step
process: (1) by filing a registration statement with the Commission
containing certain required financial and other data; and (2) by making available to purchasers and to investors who receive written offers
to sell through the mails, a prospectus containing all pertinent facts
upon which the company's operations may be appraised and its securities evaluated. Among other things, the prospectus must contain information with respect to the character, size and profitableness of the
business; the capitalization of the issuer; the purpose of the proposed
offering of securities and the use to which the proceeds are to be applied; outstanding options for the purchase of securities of the issuer;
remuneration of officers and directors, including bonus and profitsharing arrangements; contractual or other arrangements with management officials or other affiliated interests; pending or threatened
legal proceedings; and the underwriting and other terms of the offering. Moreover, the prospectus must include a balance sheet and
three-year earnings statement, certified by an independent public
accountant.
When the registration statement is filed, the securities covered
thereby may be offered for public sale, either orally or by means
of certain written instruments prescribed by Commission rules. But
the securities may not be sold until the registration statement becomes
or is made effective. The duration of this "waiting period", usually
several weeks, depends upon the degree of initial compliance with the
disclosure requirements. The waiting period provides an opportunity,
explicitly provided for in the statute and the Commission's rules, for
widespread dissemination in the financial community and among
dealers and the investing public, of the salient factual disclosures,
financial and otherwise, contained in the registration statement.
Thus, opportunity is given the investing public to be informed of
the essential facts about the company and the securities it proposes
to offer for public sale before the public investor is committed to their
purchase.

xx

FOREWORD

During this waiting period, also, the Commission conducts a
thorough examination of the registration statement and prospectus
to determine, as best it can, that all required facts have been disclosed, accurately and completely, and that there are no "half truths"
due to the omission to state facts required to be stated in order to
make not misleading the disclosures and representations made. If
in its examination the Commission finds that the registration statement is inaccurate or incomplete in respect of material fads, the
Commission may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, issue a
"stop order" suspending the registration statement, which operates to
bar distribution of the securities so long as the stop order remains in
effect. The order may be lifted when and if the registration statement is amended to correct the deficiencies upon which the stop order
was based. Normally, however, resort to the stop order procedure
is not essential to a determination of compliance with the disclosure
requirement, and the issuing company is advised of and given an opportunity to file any revision, correction or clarification of disclosures
which the examination may show to be necessary to an understanding
of the facts.
An analysis of an issuing company's balance sheet and earnings
statement is of paramount importance in the evaluation of securities.
The value of financial statements is directly dependent on the soundness of the accounting principles and practices observed in their
preparation and on the adequacy and reliability of the work performed by public accountants who certify as to their fairness. Uniformity in auditing practices and consistency in accounting presentation are essential to public reliance upon and an understanding of
the earnings and other data presented and to a proper comparison
with the financial statements of other companies. Therefore, a major
objective of the Commission has been to improve accounting and
auditing standards and to assist in the establishment and maintenance
of high standards of professional conduct by certifying accountants.
The accounting rules, decisions and opinions of the Commission,
in conjunction with authoritative pronouncements by professional
accounting societies and by other governmental agencies, have
achieved a substantial clarification and improvement in the accounting
and auditing principles and practices generally followed in the preparation of financial statements throughout the financial community,
whether or not the particular issuing company is directly subject to
the Commission's regulations. Moreover, the Commission's requirement that an accountant who certifies financial statements filed with
it shall be "independent" of his client, has extended and fortified the
ethical standards customarily observed by certifying accountants.

FOREWORn

XXI

The Commission's examination relates only to the accuracy and
adequacy of the disclosures. The Commission is not empowered to,
and does not, appraise the merits of the securities or otherwise pass
upon the soundness of the venture. In fact, the Act declares it to be
unlawful to represent to investors that the Commission has approved
or otherwise passed on the merits of registered securities or found the
registration disclosures accurate and complete. However, it should
be noted in this connection that heavy penalties attach to the filing
of registration statements which are false and misleading. Moreover, investors who suffer losses in the purchase of registered securities have important recovery rights (which they may pursue in Federal or State courts) if the disclosures contained in registration statements are false and misleading. 'Vhile the Commission cannot and
does not vouch for the accuracy and adequacy of registration disclosures, its examination, coupled with the penalties against false filings and the recovery rights of investors, tend to contribute to the
general reliability of the disclosures.
Dissemination of information contained in the registration statement is basic to the statutory objective of investor protection. This
is accomplished by the large-scale distribution of the prospectus to all
members of the underwriting and distributing or selling groups as
well as to prospective investors. The law requires the delivery of
the prospectus to any person to whom a written offer is made through
the mails, and to each and every purchaser. This dissemination of
information is supplemented by the extensive redistribution of the
registration disclosures by the various securities manuals and other
investment advisory and statistical services, which are readily available to all broker and dealer firms, trust departments and others.
Thus, new securities may be evaluated by a broad cross-section of the
investing public.
The registration process has been an effective instrument for the
restoration of investor confidence. The fad that there has been a
$15 billion average volume of public offerings of registered securities
during the past four years, and that capital expenditures during that
period have reached record heights, is eloquent testimony to the
smooth functioning of the capital formation processes today and of
the steady flow of private capital into industry.
The second enactment in the field of Federal securities regulation
was the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which sought to outlaw
misrepresentation, manipulation and other abusive practices in our securities markets and to establish and maintain just and equitable
principles of trade which would be conducive to open, fair and orderly
markets.

xxn

FOREWORD

The Congress recognized that the dearth of reliable financial and
other information in the pre-SEC days had made it difficult, if not
impossible, to evaluate adequately and realistically securities traded
on exchanges, and that this paucity of information facilitated the dissemination of false information about the issuing companies and their
securities and the manipulation of the prices of securities. Accordingly, the 1934 act extended the disclosure principle by requiring every
company which has securities listed on an exchange to register with
the Commission and to file annual and other periodic reports disclosing financial and other data which the investing public needs in evaluating the company's securities. A similar periodic reporting requirement is imposed by this la w upon the larger companies whose securities
have been registered for public offering under the Securities Act,
whether or not they are listed on an exchange. The Commission is
given authority to require that these financial statements be certified
by independent public accountants. On June 30, 1959, securities of
2,236 issuing companies were listed and registered on national securities exchanges. The volume of trading on the exchanges in these
securities during the year ended that date was about $50 billion, and
their aggregate market value at the year end was about $350 billion.
The very size of these figures is evidence of the importance to investors of reliable financial and other information with respect to the issuing companies and their securities. The data contained in the
reports of these companies receives widespread dissemination through
securities manuals, statistical and advisory services, the financial press
and otherwise, and has an important impact upon the evaluation of
their securities by the investing public.
The disclosure principle was further extended by two additional
provisions of this law, applicable to "insider" trading in listed securities and to the solicitation of proxies from the holders of such
securities. 'With respect to the former, the 1934 act requires that
insiders (officers, directors, and 10% owners) report regularly to
the Commission and the exchange their holdings of and transactions
in all equity securities of the particular issuer with whom they are
affiliated. The number of these reports of holdings and transactions
of insiders now exceeds 39,000 annually. Furthermore, in order to
curb the misuse of "inside" information by such persons which had
been so prevalent prior to enactment of the statute, insiders are made
liable to account to their companies for their profits on any purchase
and sale, or sale and purchase, which occurs within a six-month
period.
Moreover, management officialsof listed companies must disclose in
their solicitation of proxies basic financial and other information reflecting the company's financial condition and the results of its opera-

FOREWORD

XXIII

tions-information
which reflects management's stewardship. To
enable investors in such companies to vote intelligently upon all
corporate matters requiring stockholder approval, whether the election of directors, authorization for the issuance of additional securities, merger with another company or otherwise, the Commission has
promulgated a set of "proxy rules" which require disclosure of the
basic facts pertinent to the subject matter of the vote. In addition,
the form of proxy must give the stockholder freedom of action to vote
for or against different proposals, and may not bind him to vote on
an all-or-none basis.
The Commission's proxy rules also entitle independent or minority
stockholders to include, in management solicitations, any proper proposals which they wish to have put to a vote of the stockholders.
Under the rules, independent solicitations of proxies by minority
stockholders, including the solicitation of proxies for the election of
their own nominees to the board, are also facilitated.
The 1934 act also provides for the registration of stock exchanges
and of brokers and dealers who engage in the over-the-counter securities business. A prerequisite to stock exchange registration is a requirement that the rules of the exchange shall proscribe practices by
members which may not be just and equitable to public investors, and
the exchange must be empowered to suspend, expel or otherwise discipline members for violations of those rules. The Commission has a
residual power to see that exchange rules are modified or supplemented to accomplish these objectives. Today, 14 national securities
exchanges are registered with the Commission.
This system of self-regulation, which recognizes that exchanges are
vested with a public interest and that the exchanges themselves have
the primary responsibility for establishing, maintaining and enforcing just and equitable principles of trade, is an important factor in
the market place today. It also has its counterpart in the over-thecounter markets, contained in a 1938 amendment to the law providing
for the organization of associations of over-the-counter dealers which
would "police" their membership. One such institution, the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), has been organized
and now has over 4,000 members. It has adopted and enforces a code
of fair practice governing the conduct of its members and their relationships to investors.
As previously indicated, brokers and dealers must register with the
Commission before they may engage in the securities business in interstate commerce. At the end of the 1959 fiscal year, 4,907 brokers
and dealers were registered with the Commission. The Commission
may deny or revoke the registration of a broker-dealer in cases of
fraud in securities transactions, or other misconduct in the securities

XXIV

FOREWORD

business, where the Commission, after notice and opportunity for
hearing, finds such denial or revocation in the public interest. Likewise, the Commission may, on similar grounds, suspend or expel a
member from membership in the NASD or in a stock exchange.
The Commission maintains an active surveillance of securities trading practices, both on exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets.
It also has adopted numerous rules which establish standards of conduct governing the activities of brokers and dealers and prohibit acts
and practices inimical to the interests of investors. Two of these are
worthy of special note. One prohibits short selling on an exchange
which would tend to precipitate or accentuate a price decline. Another requires that brokers and dealers maintain at all times a minimum capital position in relation to their liabilities to other persons
so that the funds and securities of customers in their custody will not
be jeopardized. This rule minimizes the possibility that sudden reverses will cause a firm to become insolvent and thereby endanger
customers' free credit balances and securities held in custody. It may
be noted in this connection that the Commission carries on a program
of broker-dealer inspections to ensure compliance with its net capital
rule and otherwise to see that the activities of brokers and dealers are
conducted properly.
No less important to the stability and orderliness of the stock market
today are the rules of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System which regulate the amount of credit which brokers and banks
may extend on the purchase of listed securities by investors. The
margin requirement has fluctuated over the years from a low of 25
percent in 1934 to 100 percent (no margin) during the war years, in
accordance with that Board's view as to proper margin in light of the
over-all credit position of the Nation. By curbing excessive speculation, the rules have added a stabilizing influence in the market. The
necessity for frequent and drastic "margin calls" has thus been reduced, offering further stability to the market. The Commission has
the duty of enforcing compliance by brokers and dealers in securities
with the rules so established.
Both the 1933 and 1934acts authorize the Commission to take testimony under oath and to subpoena books and records for the purpose
of developing the facts with respect to possible securities violations,
and to seek Federal court orders of injunction against the continuance
of acts and practices violative of the laws or Commission rules thereunder. They also provide for criminal prosecution (through the
Department of Justice) of any individual, firm or corporation if evidence developed in the Commission's investigations establishes that
they have engaged in fraud, manipulation or other misconduct in
connection with the purchase and sale of securities or have otherwise
willfully violated the law.

The record of investigation and enforcement actions of the C0111mission is a formidable one, far too long to be recited here. That
record is detailed in the several annual reports which have been filed
by the Commission with Congress over the years. It may be noted
that many violations of the law are discovered and stopped before
any substantial damage to investors has occurred. In other cases, the
Commission's investigations have resulted in restitution of investors'
funds in substantial amount. Of perhaps even greater importance to
the investing public is the deterrent effect which the statutory sanctions and the Commission's enforcement powers have upon those who
might otherwise have, and exercise, a free hand to defraud innocent
investors.
The legislation designed to meet the problems posed by the abuses
disclosed in the investigation of the electric and gas utility industry
was embodied in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1933.
The principal objective of this statute was to free local operating
utility companies from the control and domination of absentee and
uneconomic holding companies, and to permit them to be regulated
more effectively by the States in which they operate. In 1930, 1;)
holding company systems controlled 80 percent of the privately
owned electric generating capacity in this country, and similar concentration existed in the gas utility field. As previously indicated,
these countrywide utility empires were put together with little regard
for efficient and economic service of electricity and gas to consumers
and without regard for the investors whose funds had been used to
concentrate a maximum of control and profit in the hands of a few.
The act called for a breakup of the huge utility combines and,
generally speaking, sought to restrict the operations of utility holding
companies to one or more systems whose operations are integrated
and confined to a single State and States contiguous thereto. It also
had as one of its major objectives the simplification of the corporate
and capital structures of holding company systems and the redistrihution of voting power among security holders on a fair and equitable
basis.
In 1940, when the statutory program of integration and simplification actually got under way, 12 of the registered systems each conducted retail operations in 10 or more States, and 17 additional systems operated in 5 to 9 States. At one time or another since 1938,
these systems contained a total of 2,387 companies, many engaged in
miscellaneous unrelated nonutility businesses, and many being subholding companies serving no demonstrable economic function.
Drastic surgery was called for to simplify these structures, to restore
some semblance of sane and sensible corporate and capital structures
and to redistribute voting power and control on a fair and equitable

XXVI

FOREWORD

basis consistent with a realistic evaluation of the rights of the various
and conflicting interests of security holders.
The volume and complexity of the corporate and capital structures
which "ere required to be simplified, and the nature and scope of
the geographical dispersion of the properties required to be integrated presented extremely difficult and novel problems which it was
the task of the Commission to resolve. Opponents of the legislation
had asserted that the law would cause dumping and forced liquidation
of securities, demoralizing the market therefor, and they characterized the integration and simplification requirements as a "death sentence" for the utility industry. The Congress, on the other hand,
contemplated that this program should not destroy any legitimate
investment values, and the Commission was given a mandate to bring
about the required integration and simplification in keeping with
that objective.
The opposition of industry which marked the passage of this reform
measure was continued after its enactment. Most of the larger companies refused to register with the Commission, as the law required,
and it was not until the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality
of the registration requirement in 1938 that these companies bowed to
the registration requirement. They continued, however, to resist the
law's integration and simplification requirements.
The act contemplated that industry would be given an opportunity
to propose voluntary plans which would effectuate the objectives of
integration and simplification, but it also wisely empowered the Commission to take necessary action to that end if the industry failed so
to do. For the most part, at least initially, the industry was unyielding, and it became necessary for the Commission to invoke its power
to issue administrative orders directing compliance with the requirements of the law. Of course, such orders could only be issued after
notice and opportunity for hearing and after the development of an
evidentiary record. Many of the orders requiring integration and
simplification were challenged in the courts, on constitutional and
other grounds, but all were ultimately sustained.
After the Commission had thus established the general pattern
of compliance, holding company systems came forward with voluntary plans for divestment of nonretainable properties and securities
of nonretainable subsidiaries. Such plans had to comply with the
statutory mandate in this respect and had to be fair and equitable to
all affected security holders. Plans proposed for simplification of
corporate and capital structures also had to be tested in the same manner. In ruling upon these plans, the Commission developed the socalled "investment value" doctrine under which the claims of security
holders are evaluated for purposes of reorganization on u going-con-

FOREWORD

cern basis rather than on the liquidation basis followed in reorganizations in equity receivership and bankruptcy proceedings where the
claims are treated as matured. Under the investment value doctrine,
which was duly sustained by the courts, plans of reorganization were
approved which accorded participation to senior claimants upon the
basis of the present worth of their securities on a going-concern basis,
and similarly to junior security holders on the basis of their secondary claim to future earnings, even though they would not have had
a right to participate if the senior claims were evaluated upon the
basis of their liquidation preferences.
Compliance with the integration and simplification requirements
took various forms. They included mergers and consolidations,
separation of large systems into smaller, integrated systems, divestment of non utility properties unrelated to the utility business, sale of
nonretainable utility properties to other systems with whose properties they could be integrated, sale of the securities of nonretainable
subsidiaries to the public at competitive bidding or pursuant to a
rights offering to stockholders of the parent company and distribution of securities pro rata among stockholders.
The fundamental economic soundness of the act and the methods
prescribed for its administration have been demonstrated by the results achieved, and the directive of Congress that the program could
and should be effectuated without injury to investors has been carried
out. Although tremendous values were salvaged by integration and
simplification, that process unavoidably entailed the realization of
losses by many investors who had purchased securities on the basis
of anticipated values which had been but a mirage, or had been dissipated by the holding companies themselves. All the damage could
not possibly be undone--the dollar amount of securities which had
been issued was in some instances vastly in excess of the values that
could be realized by the salvage and rebuilding process.
The integration and simplification program represented the most
comprehensive undertaking ever assumed by the Government to rehabilitate an entire major industry. In the process, the number of
companies now comprising the 18 active registered holding company
systems has been reduced to 176-and only 3 of the systems operate in
more than 4 States and none operates in more than 9. Today, the
securities of the divested companies and of those registered companies
which have completed their integration and simplification programs
have an excellent market acceptance. The utility industry as a whole
is enjoying financial health and stability, and has been able to finance
expansion programs of unprecedented proportions largely out of new
money raised from the public sale of securities. It is interesting to
note in this connection that a study made by the Commission in 1951

XXVIII

FOREWORD

of the market values of the common stocks of 12 holding companies
between the dates of their registration with the Commission and September 24, 1951, showed that in each instance the market value of the
company's stock increased during that period and in almost all instances the rate of increase substantially exceeded the rate of increase
in the Dow Jones utilities averages. Holders of utility preferred
stocks have similarly benefited in that all dividend arrearages have
been satisfied and the holders have been accorded securities and cash
representing the fair value of their investments.
In actuality, then, the feared integration and simplification provisions of the law have been vindicated and those who condemned
the act have come to praise it. That which was once denounced as a
death sentence to the progress of the utility industry is now generally
regarded as having been the means of its regeneration .
. The 176 companies which remain subject to the Commission's continuing; jurisdiction under the act must comply with its regulatory
provisions governing their purchase and sale of utility securities and
properties, dividend payments (in circumstances where such payment
might result in a corporate abuse), intercompany loans, solicitation
of proxies, and insiders' transactions. The act also forbids registered
holding companies to charge for services to their subsidiaries and requires that all services performed for any company in a holding company system by a mutual or subsidiary service company be rendered
at cost, fairly and equitably allocated.
'With respect to the issuance and sale of securities, the act generally
provides that the Commission shall not authorize their sale unless
it finds that the security meets certain tests, including the requirement
that the security must be reasonably adapted to the earning power of
the company and its issuance necessary and appropriate to the economical and efficient operation of the issuer's business and not detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers.
The Commission has adhered to the policy of requiring sound capital
structures containing adequate common stock equity. The Commission also must find that fees, commissions and other remuneration
paid in connection with the sale are not unreasonable.
It is recognized that the cost of capital is an important element
of expense affecting utility rates and that utility companies are under
a duty to obtain their capital at the lowest cost consistent with a sound
financial structure. One of the evils disclosed by the investigation
was the absence of arms-length bargaining in the sale of securities and
utility assets, which was in large measure an outgrowth of the "traditional banker" relationships between certain large investment banking firms and particular holding company systems. Such relationships had given these bankers a virtual monopoly over the financing

FOREWORD

of system companies and had generally resulted in exorbitant underwriting commissions.
To implement the statutory objective that underwriting fees and
commissions be reasonable in amount, to eliminate investment, banker
control and to assure the maintenance of competitive conditions, the
Commission in 1941 adopted a rule under the act which generally
requires that securities of registered holding companies and their
subsidiaries be sold by means of competitive bidding. Since the
adoption of that rule, there has been active competition among investment bankers for the purchase of utility securities. Approximately $11 billion of utility securities of various classes have been sold
by means of competitive bidding under the rule in the past 17 years.
The rule allows an exception from competitive bidding under special
circumstances and upon a showing that a negotiated underwriting or
a direct placement would be more advantageous and that competitive
conditions are otherwise maintained. Some $2.3 billion of securities
have been excepted from the rule since it was adopted.
The effect of the competitive bidding rule actually extends beyond
the limited number of companies subject to its requirements, for the
prices obtained and the underwriting spread paid by these companies
in their offering and sale of securities through competitive bidding
have set the standard for all security offerings, whether or not subject
to the rule. Competitive bidding is regularly required by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Power Commission, and
many State regulatory commissions. This technique was in effect in
some areas before 1941, but it is clear that its adoption by the SEC
has been instrumental in achieving the wide acceptance which is now
given to it. Moreover, it has been employed by a number of utility
companies who were under no compulsion to do so. There can be little
doubt that the competitive bidding rule has been responsible in a substantial degree for the noticeable decrease in the cost of flotation of
securities over the past two decades.
In furtherance of the statutory objectives of economy in the raising
of capital and the protection of the interests of investors, consumers
and the public, the Commission has from time to time promulgated
other rules and policy statements governing the financing of registered
system companies. Notable among these are statements of policy governing "protective provisions" which must be included in mortgage
indentures pursuant to which debt securities are issued and sold and
in corporate charters governing the rights and interests of preferred
stockholders. 'With respect to bond indentures, for example, the
bonds must be redeemable at any time at reasonable redemption premiums, certain asset and earnings tests must be met if a company
wishes to issue additional bonds, a sinking fund is required as well as

xxx

a renewal and replacement Coyenant which, in effect, requires the COIU.
pany to expend for property additions an amount reflecting the depreciation taking place in the mortgaged properties, and certain restrictions are imposed upon the acquisition of properties subject to a
prior lien and upon the amount of common stock dividends the
company may pay.
With respect to preferred stock, the charter must include provisions
that dividends shall be cumulative, that the preferred shall be redeemable at any time at a reasonable redemption premium, and that the
preferred shareholders are entitled to elect a majority of the members
of the board of directors in the event of the accumulation of a year's
arrearages in the payment of dividends on the preferred. Furthermore, the payment of dividends upon the common stock must be restricted if the common stock equity falls below a certain prescribed
percentage of the company's total capitalization and surplus, and a
favorable vote of the holders of a certain percentage of the outstanding
preferred shares is required before certain corporate actions affecting
their interests may be taken.
It is apparent that the accomplishments under the Holding Company
Act and particularly in connection with the vast integration and
simplification program have been considerable. 'Vhile the integration
and simplification programs for some ten of the registered systems
have not been completely effectuated, the Commission is hopeful that
the remaining problems, some of a more or less serious nature, may
soon be resolved and the overall program of utility integration and
simplification consummated. The continued expansion of utility systems, of course, including the creation of new holding companies
through the purchase of utility securities or the acquisition by existing registered systems of the assets or securities of other nonaffiliated
companies, has created and will from time to time continue to create
new problems of integration and simplification.
A number of holding company systems will continue to be subject
to the Commission's jurisdiction under the act for an indefinite period.
The many aspects of their financial and related activities will call for
the continued exercise of the Commission's jurisdiction, as in the past,
to assure that the public interest is protected and to guard against the
recurrence of the evils which gave rise to the enactment of the law.
In addition, new technological developments, such as the use of atomic
energy, the pooling together of facilities by various nonaffiliated systems for the purpose of effecting economies in the generation of electric
energy and other similar challenges will no doubt continue to command the Commission's attention in the years to come.
The Holding Company Act authorized the Commission to conduct
a study and investigation of investment trusts. After 5 years of in-

FOREWORD

XXXI

tensive and exhaustive inquiry into the entire industry, the Commission recommended comprehensive legislation for its regulation.
Vigorous opposition to the extent of the regulation proposed in the
original bill led to conferences between the Commission and industry
representatives, resulting in a compromise statute which passed both
Houses of Congress unanimously as the Investment Company Act of
1940. This unanimity was no doubt due in large part to the Commission's expose of the sordid history of the organization and operation of certain investment trusts and to a recognition on the part of
the more responsible element in the industry that Federal regulation
was not only necessary in the interest of investor protection but was
also essential to the full acceptance by the public of investment companies as a feature of our financial system.
The Commission's study showed that investment companies had
all too often been organized and operated in such a way as to further
the selfish interests of the sponsors and insiders at the expense of the
stockholders to whom they owed a high fiduciary duty. Subordination of the interests of stockholders took many forms, In some cases,
the promoters, management officials and controlling persons unloaded
worthless securities and dubious investments upon the investment company, or took for their own account profitable ventures offered to the
company. In others, the investment company financed clients of insiders or companies in which insiders were personally interested. Insiders also engaged in practices which permitted them to obtain large
profits without any risk by trading in the securities issued by the investment company, to the pecuniary detriment of' its investors. They
also engaged in practices which increased their distribution profits
and management fees and resulted in substantial dilution of the investors' interests. Many other abuses came to light, including sales
and promotional literature designed to create the false impression that
investment companies were not unlike savings banks and insurance
companies, except that they were not limited to legal investments.
The sales load in some types of companies exceeded 30 percent of the
net amount invested.
The 1940 act seeks to obtain a degree of independence in the board
of directors and to prohibit self-dealing and the taking of excessive
commissions or profits by affiliated persons or companies. It seeks
to achieve greater participation
by stockholders by requiring
them to act on basic policies, to restrict the types of securities which
may be issued by investment companies and to guard against inadequate and unfeasible capital structures, to require transmission of
informative reports to stockholders, including financial statements
certified by independent accountants when the Commission so prescribes, and to eliminate improper selling practices. Persons guilty
of securities frauds are barred from serving- as officers and directors.

XXXII

FOREWORD

Underwriters, investment bankers and dealers may not constitute
more than a minority of the board of directors.
Basic to Commission regulation under this law is the requirement
that companies engaged in investing, reinvesting and trading in securities register with the Commission and file periodic financial and
other reports. The registration statement must include a declaration
of policy by the investment company on various aspects of its business,
including its investment policy, and the company may not deviate from
its stated policy without the consent of the holders of a majority of
its outstanding voting securities. Transactions with affiliated persons
and companies are prohibited, although the Commission, upon application by the company, may grant an exemption from such prohibition
if it finds that the terms of the transaction are fair and reasonable,
that no "over-reaching" on the part of any individual is involved and
that the transaction is consistent with the company's established policies and with the intent and purposes of the law. A registered investment company must, subject to Commission rules, maintain its
assets under a custodianship agreement with a bank or a member of
a national securities exchange, or under a safekeeping arrangement
with a bank. Officers and employees who have access to the assets of
the company or authority to direct their disposition must be bonded.
The act also empowers the Commission, where necessary, to seek
court injunctive orders to prevent transactions, acts and practices in
contravention of its provisions or rules of the Commission thereunder.
If the activity constitutes gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust
in the management of investment companies, the Commission may
apply to the court for removal of management officials responsible
therefor, for the appointment of trustees or receivers where necessary
to preserve the company's assets and for an order compelling the
restitution of funds to stockholders.
In one case, for example, the controlling stockholder caused the
investment company to liquidate capital assets to meet interest requirements and pay current expenses, including salaries and rentals to
himself, and to acquire control of a race track. In an action initiated
by the Commission, the court appointed a receiver and enjoined the
controlling stockholder and other defendants from serving as officers
and trustees of the company. Similarly, in another action brought by
the Commission an officer'who caused an investment company to make
unsecured loans to various business corporations he controlled was
enjoined from serving any investment company in any capacity in the
future. Injunctions and appointments of receivers have been obtained
where the sales literature falsely stated that the investment company
was guaranteed against loss by the United States Government and
where the officers and directors attempted to unload worthless securities upon the investment company.

FOREWORD

XXXIII

An important aspect of the Commission's administration of this
law has been its insistence upon the elimination of abusive practices
in the offering and sale of investment company securities. Several
years ago some companies were found to be employing sales literature
of a misleading character, such as representations that a particular
security was as safe an investment as a United States savings bond.
Leading members of the industry cooperated with the Commission in
a study of the sales literature and sales practices being employed.
Following this study, the Commission issued a Statement of Policy
setting forth various types of advertising and sales literature considered to be in violation of the law, and the industry has cooperated
with the Commission in administering it.
In the administration of the act, the Commission must rule upon
various applications by investment companies for exemptions from
specified provisions. The exemption most frequently sought concerns
transactions involving the purchase and sale of property or securities
between investment companies and affiliated interests. In order to
receive an exemption, the applicant must establish to the satisfaction
of the Commission that the terms of the proposed transaction are fair
and reasonable and do not involve overreaching. Many difficult problems of evaluation and potential conflict of interest are presented in
these cases. Since 1940, more than 1,200 exemption applications have
been acted upon by the Commission.
The growth of investment companies since 1940 has been phenomenal. At June 30, 1941, 436 companies with aggregate assets of
$2.5 billion were registered with th~ Commission. The number of
registered companies has varied since that date, with a low of 352
in 1947 and a present high of 512. The aggregate assets of the 512
companies at June 30, 1959, was $20 billion, or eight times the size
of the 436 companies in 1941. The Congress recognized that investment companies might become so large as to raise problems concerning
"concentration of control of wealth and industry" and other questions,
and the act directs the Commission to conduct a study of such problems and to report the results thereof to Congress. Such a study is
now in progress.
In a recent decision of the Supreme Court, it was held that "variable
annuity" contracts were "investment contracts" subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under the Securities Act and the Investment
Company Act. As a result, these contracts must satisfy the registration and disclosure requirements of the Securities Act, and the issuing
companies must register as investment companies and comply with
the other provisions of the Investment Company Act. The Commission is now endeavoring to resolve the problem of fitting this type of

FOREWORD

investment company into the pattern of regulation which the 1940
act established.
Closely related to the Commission's surveillance of over-the-counter
securities dealers and of investment companies is its administration
of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The regulatory provisions
of that act, however, touch only a few aspects of a field not yet adequately covered. Although modeled on the broker-dealer registration
provisions of the 1934 act, and dictated by certain abuses indicated by
the Commission's investment trust study, it has few "regulatory
teeth." It does not give the Commission the same control over the
activities of the investment advisers (including power to impose sanctions) now applicable to brokers and dealers, and is considered to be
largely a mere "census-taking" statute. The most serious defect in
the current statute is the inability of the Commission to inspect the
books and records of registered investment advisers, to prescribe
what books and records shall be maintained or to require the filing
of reports. In light of market conditions existing today, it would
appear contrary to the public interest to allow such a condition to
continue. As part of its current legislative program, the Commission
has proposed amendments to the law to include adequate regulatory
provisions with respect to investment advisers.
Prior to the Commission's investigation of investment trusts, it
undertook a study of protective and reorganization committees.
This study resulted in two additional Congressional enactments, the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and chapter X of the National Bankruptcy Act (1938 revision).
This study concerned itself ;vith the events which led to the insolvency of debtor companies, and in particular with the activities
of protective and reorganization committees organized to protect the
interests of the various classes of creditors and security holders and
to participate in the reorganization of the debtor corporation. Numerous instances came to light where the indenture trustee, whose
primary responsibility was to protect the interests of the holders of
indenture securities, had basic conflicts of interest, including divided
loyalties as between the debtor and its management officials on the one
hand and the interests of public investors on the other. Such conflicts precluded any effective action by the trustee to safeguard the
interests of investors prior to default or to see that their rights were
asserted in a timely and proper fashion in the event of default.
The Trust Indenture Act seeks to protect the purchasers of bonds,
debentures, notes and similar debt securities when sold in amounts
exceeding $1 million, by prescribing certain minimum standards governing the provisions of indentures. It requires the indenture to spell
out the rights of the holders of the securities and to provide reasona-

FOREWORD

ble standards of diligence and loyalty applicable to the indenture
trustee, and to facilitate its actions to protect the investor. The emphasis of this law is upon an effective and "independent" trustee
whose interests do not conflict with those of investors and upon eliminating indenture provisions which might exculpate the trustee against
dereliction in carrying out duties and responsibilities prescribed by
the indenture.
The provisions of this act and the Securities Act are so integrated
that registration under the latter act of securities to be issued under
a trust indenture is not permitted to become effective unless the indenture conforms to the standards of the Trust Indenture Act. Like
registration statements, trust indentures are examined by the Commission for compliance with the law. The Commission may issue an
order refusing qualification if the indenture does not conform to the
prescribed standards or if the trustee has any conflicting interests.
Once an indenture is qualified, enforcement of its terms is left to
the trustee and the indenture security holders.
The report of the Commission's investigation also had shown serious abuses in the functioning of protective committees and the manner
in which insiders used such committees to control reorganization proceedings for their personal benefit and to the detriment of public security holders.
The basic thrust of chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act (the Chandler
Act) was to eliminate the practical control of reorganization proceedings by inside groups and self-constituted committees and to require,
in all cases in which the debtor's indebtedness exceeds $250,000, the
appointment by the court of a disinterested trustee, whose attorney
must also be independent. It is the function of the trustee to assume charge of the debtor's operations and proceed with the preparation of a plan for its reorganization. He may investigate the
acts of the prior management and institute recovery actions where
the facts justify such action. Although protective committees and
other representatives of security holders are permitted to participate,
their activities are subject to strict court review and control. Fees
for services in reorganization proceedings are also subject to court
approval, which serves to prevent unwarranted and excessive fees to
special groups while providing fair and reasonable compensation to
those whose services can be shown to have benefited the estate.
Furthermore, chapter X provides that the Commission may participate in corporate reorganization proceedings if requested or approved
by the court, so as to aid the court and the independent trustee by
rendering expert and independent advice and assistance on all import.ant phases of the proceeding. It operates in an "advisory" capacity, and has the right to be heard on all matters arising in the

XXXVI

FOREWORD

proceeding, but no right to appeal. It usually undertakes intensive
legal and financial studies related to the company, its operations, its
indebtedness and other outstanding securities, possible claims against
management officials or controlling persons, the prospects for the
company's future operations and the possibility of a successful
reorganization.
If the indebtedness of the debtor exceeds $3 million the court must,
and if less than that amount it may, submit to the Commission all
plans of reorganization deemed worthy of consideration. The Commission may thereupon prepare and file with the court its "advisory
report" which analyzes the plan or plans in detail and recommends
for or against court approval, depending upon whether the Commission considers that the plan provides fair and equitable treatment to
all interests affected and is feasible. In some instances the Commission's recommendations are presented orally to the court through its
counsel.
The Commission's report is in no way binding upon the court, which
may either reject the plan or approve it and submit it to a vote of
creditors and affected security holders. In the latter event, a copy or
summary of the Commission's advisory report is transmitted to security holders along with the plan, so that they may be informed of the
Commission's analysis of and views on the fairness and feasibility of
the plan before casting their votes for or against the plan.
Since September 1938 the Commission has participated in chapter X proceedings for the reorganization of 457 debtor companies
(371 principal debtors and 86 subsidiaries thereof) with stated assets
of more than $3.5 billion and indebtedness of nearly $2.5 billion.
Over 60 of these proceedings are still pending. The proceedings have
involved the reorganization and rehabilitation of companies engaged
in a variety of industries and businesses, including agriculture, mining, manufacturing, financial and investment, merchandising, real
estate, construction and allied industries, transportation and communication, service, and utilities. In these proceedings, the Commission
has issued a total of 40 advisory reports and 37 supplemental reports.
In most other cases, its views and recommendations on the fairness
and feasibility of the reorganization plans were presented orally by
Commission counsel.
The assistance rendered by the Commission in corporate reorganization proceedings has been favorably noted almost without exception by Federal courts, although they do not always follow the Commission's recommendations. The Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit had the following to say about the Commission's advisory services 4 years ago:
"We regard the service being rendered by the Commission to the Courts in
connection with the reorganization of corporations to be most valuable, if

FOREWORD

XXXVII

not indispensable, for the proper disposition of this vital segment of court
business according to the Congressional intent. The Commisslon affords
the necessary expert knowledge, the skill, and the uniform approach which
individual judges cannot have; and to the district judges in particular, the
assistance is unique in its usefulness, and not otherwise to be obtained."
21st Annual Report, p. 89.

More recently, a district court judge made the following comment
on the role of the Commission following a hearing on fee allowances
in which the Commission had objected to allowances in the requested
amounts exceeding $4 million and where the Court approved allowances of $2,068,000, some $250,000 above that recommended by the
Commission:
"Though I have been forced to differ from the recommendations of the SEC
in many of the instances, I wish to pay tribute to the careful and helpful
analysis that the Commission made of the claims. Indeed, I take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the active and intimate participation of
the Commission and its counsel in the reorganization proceedings. If any
proof were needed of the wisdom of Congress in providing for representation of the public by the SecuritIes and Exchange Commission in reorganization proceedings, it has been furnished in this case. I would have felt helpless without the aid given unstintingly by counsel for the Commission.
Each has cheerfully rendered, at the usual modest salary of a public servant,
services equal in value to those of any to whom awards are made by this
decision." In the Matter of Third Avenue Transit Corporation, S.D.K.Y.
Kos. 85851,86410,86412, 86413,86537, unreported, (1958).

Upon appeal, the allowances were further reduced to a figure only
$30,000 more than the Commission initially recommended, or an ultimate saving to the debtor estate and its security holders of nearly $2%
million.
This report began with a discussion of "investor confidence." As
indicated herein, all available signs would seem to bear out the fact
that investor confidence has been largely restored. In fact, it may be
noted that recent estimates place the number of public investors today
at 12,500,000, nearly double the 1952 total. The record volume of
securities successfully offered for public sale, taken together with the
recent rise in the volume of trading on the New York Stock Exchange
to the highest level in the Commission's history, is adequate evidence
of the restoration of investor confidence.
But the impact of the Federal securities laws and their administration has been felt no less by financial institutions, corporate executives, professional people, and other elements in the financial COInmunity than by investors. It can reasonably be said that these acts
and their administration have generally fostered improved standards
of business conduct among all groups in their relationship to stockholders and investors. 'While this no doubt has been dictated in part
by enlightened self-interest, it nonetheless has contributed substantially to investor confidence.

xxxvm

FOREWORD

This, as we have seen, has had its desired effect, for the capital
formation processes have successfully served their purpose of being a
conduit for the flow of investors' savings into industry in ever increasingvolume.
While the Commission can view with pardonable pride the record
of its contribution to the interests of the investing public, it cannot
rest on the record of its past accomplishments. In a dynamic economy such as this nation is experiencing, new problems of investor protection are constantly arising. The very fact that securities are being
offered for public sale in record volume and that exchange trading in
securities has reached a high level, plus the fact that more and more
people have surplus savings, some of which is being used for investment and speculation in securities, are in and of themselves adequate
reasons for the Commission not to become complacent. A. boiling
stock market not only attracts new investors, some of whom have
neither the resources nor the knowledge 'and skill to speculate in the
stock market, but also attracts a fringe element, ever ready to take
unfair advantage of the innocent and unsuspecting investor. A substantially increased record of law enforcement actions by the Conunission within the past year leaves no doubt of this latter fact.
Nor would we suggest that the investing public might reasonably
become complacent. It cannot be overemphasized that nothing in the
securities laws or their administration can keep the market price of
securities from fluctuating, down as well 'as up. No reasonable person would wish it otherwise. It is, therefore, incumbent upon individual investors and their advisers to exercise care and even restraint
in their analysis, evaluation and purchase of securities.
It is most essential that investors exercise extreme care in their
dealings with unknown brokerage firms and their salesmen, particularly those who telephone long-distance with "pie-in-the-sky"
promises that the investor can double or triple his money overnight,
without risk of loss, through the purchase of stock of a particular
company. Common sense would dictate that such a promise is utterly
fantastic and ridiculous. Unfortunately, foresight is never quite so
good as hindsight, particularly when the promise of quick and easy
profits is dangled before one's eyes, as many investors have learned
to their sorrow.
The Commission would like to take this occasion to express its
thanks and appreciation to a capable, industrious, and efficient staff,
both past and present.
In the 1949 Task Force Report on "Regulatory Commissions" by
the first "Hoover Commission," the Commission was characterized as
"an outstandt"ng eeamvple of the independent commleeion. at ite best."

FOREWORD

XXXIX

The statement, of course, applied to the Commission and its work
more than 10 years ago and was surely well-deserved. However, it
is no less applicable, we submit, to the excellent 'York of a most competent staff during the past 10 years.
The volume of Commission business in recent years, in nearly all
phases of its activities, has been on the increase. An example of this
is to be found in the record of Securities Act registration statements
filed with and examined by the Commission. In the 26-year administration of that act, a total of 15,930registration statements were filed
which proposed offerings of securities aggregating $167 billion in
amount. The past 6 years alone accounted for 5,561of the filings and
$81 billion of the total amount. That the staff has been able to carry
on effectively under a tremendous increase in the volume of Commission business is a tribute to its ability and conscientious devotion to
duty.

PART I
CURRENT PROBLEMS BEFORE THE COMMISSION
The foreword to this report has described the nature of the laws
administered by this Commission, the abuses in the securities markets
which led to their enactment and some of the problems encountered in
administering these laws during the past quarter century. During the
1959 fiscal year these laws were put to their severest test for during
that year the nation witnessed the highest level of activity in the securities markets since the organization of the Commission in 1934.
This increase in market activity created complex enforcement problems, required the adoption of new regulatory measures and techniques
and imposed heavy administrative burdens upon the staff of the Commission. The effects of surging securities markets upon the activities
of the Commission are described in detail later in this report. This
section briefly sets forth some of the more important problems created
by these conditions and the impact of these problems upon the work
of the Commission.
The following salient statistics reveal the remarkable increase in activity in the securities markets and the tremendous growth of public
interest and participation in those markets:
The total amount of new securities for which registration statements were filed with the Commission in fiscal 1959 totaled $16.6
billion, only $300 million less than the record amount filed in fiscal
195-8.
During fiscal 1959 the Commission processed 1,119 registration
statements, the largest number of registration statements ever to be
processed in a single year in the history of the Commission.
The number of broker-dealers registered with the Commission rose
to 4,907, an increase of almost 1,000 registrants since 1951, and the
number of representatives registered with the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc., on .June 30, 1959 was '7'7,91'7,the largest
number in its 20-year history.
The aggregate market value of all stocks on all stock exchanges,
which never exceeded $100 billion between 1933 and 1945, reached
$337.'6billion on June 30, 1959, almost three times the market value
of all stocks on exchanges during the first decade of the Commission's
history.
The reported volume of trading on the Kew York Stock Exchange
increased from a daily average of 2 million shares in February 1958,
to a peak of 4,100,000 shares in October and November 1958, the
highest daily average for any month since June 1933.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The number of holders of shares of publicly owned corporations, according to estimates by the New York Stock Exchange, increased
from 6,490,000 in 1952 to 12,500,000 in 1959, the largest number of
public shareholders in the nation's history.
The number of registered investment companies increased from 367
in 1952to 512 in 1959, and"the total assets of investment companies increased from $6.8 billion in 1952 to $20 billion in 1959.
A number of factors appear to be responsible for this increase in
activity and interest in the securities markets. Among these are the
attractiveness of these markets for financing new corporate enterprises
and the expansion of old ones, the emphasis upon capital gains in selling equity securities, the fear of inflation, the growing participation
in the market of the large institutional investor and an unfortunate
tendency among some persons to use the stock market as a medium
for gambling. However, the principal concern of the Commission is
not with the cause of this activity but with insuring that the securities
markets, however active, are fair, orderly and honest, that prices in
these markets express the free interplay of supply and demand and
that decisions by investors to buy or sell are made in the light of full
disclosure of all material facts. The discharge of these statutory responsibilities by the Commission is complicated in present securities
markets by the participation of a large number of inexperienced investors and by broker-dealers and promoters unfamiliar with, or contemptuous of, the ethical and legal obligations owed to investors.
Fraud in the Sale of Securities

Active and rising markets have raised the expectations of a substantial segment of the public that it is possible for the unsophisticated
investor to reap large and quick profits. In this atmosphere opportunities for fraud and manipulation multiply. Investors become less
concerned with the facts about the issuer and the investment characteristics of its securities than with the allure of a possible "killing"
described to them by an unknown salesman over the telephone. They
become more susceptible to baseless tips and rumors, thus facilitating
a variety of deceptive and manipulative practices.
This atmosphere has attracted into the business of selling securities
not only the confidence man, the petty swindler and the corporate
plunger, but also an outright criminal element. These persons have
seized upon the technique of selling securities to unsuspecting customers through the use of boiler rooms. The term "boiler room" refers
to a firm engaged in the sale of securities primarily over the long distance telephone, to persons with whom the firm has had no previous
contact and by high pressure methods ordinarily accompanied by
gross misrepresentation and other fraudulent devices.
Boiler rooms may operate not only from the large financial cen-

TWENTY-FIFTH

tel'S but also in other locations around the country. There has been
a noticeable increase, for example, in migratory operators moving
from state to state. In some promotions several boiler rooms may be
used to sell the spurious issue in widely scattered areas around the
country, each boiler room being assigned to saturate its particular
region. Not infrequently the long distance telephone salesmen for
the boiler room establish themselves in hotel rooms, apartments and
alleged business offices.
In many cases, the security sold by a boiler room is unknown and
worthless. To create the appearance of an active over-the-counter
market for the security, the promoter will place with numerous
brokers and dealers, orders for the purchase and sale of small
amounts of the security at prices set by him, or arrange to have
others do this, with the result that such brokers and dealers will publish quotations for the security at the prices specified in the orders.
The salesmen for the boiler room are now able to refer in their sales
"pitch" to a market price for the security which the unsuspecting
investor can independently verify. 'When the distribution of the promoter's holdings is completed, however, the orders are withdrawn and
the "market" disappears.
In his telephone sales pitch, the boiler room salesman usually promises rapid increases in the market price of the security and no risk
of loss in its purchase; he may make numerous misrepresentations concerning the issuer and its future prospects; he may urge purchases
notwithstanding statements on the part of the customer that he cannot afford to do so; and he may advise the customer, of whose financial situation he knows nothing, to sell valuable securities in order to
purchase the spurious boiler room security being offered.
The Commission has found that resort to the civil injunction and administrative proceeding, no matter how vigorously employed, is not
completely effective in halting the operation of boiler rooms. Promoters easily find another worthless issue and either establish or
use an existing boiler room as a vehicle for a new fraudulent promotion. The Commission believes that only criminal prosecution will
effectively stop those who show such a contemptuous disregard for
the law. The Commission has, therefore, placed increased emphasis
in its work upon the prosecution of such offenders. In fiscal 1959 the
Commission referred to the Department of Justice 45 cases for criminal
prosecution, one of the highest number of referrals in the Commission's history, and referrals are continuing at approximately the same
rate in fiscal 1960.
A large portion of the Commission's staff is now engaged in investigating, developing, and assisting in the prosecution of criminal actions.
Such activity requires careful and painstaking work usually over a
period of many months. Investors must be identified and inter529,5~9---4

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

viewed. Books and records of brokers, dealers and others must be
examined and analyzed. The information thus obtained then has to
be developed in a form permitting its introduction into evidence in
legal proceedings.
Emphasis upon developing criminal cases means that the Commission with its limited resources has had to utilize staff personnel who
would otherwise devote their full attention to other urgent enforcement and regulatory problems. The Commission believes, however,
that its policy of pressing for criminal prosecution of violators of the
Federal securities laws is the most effective deterrent to fraud in the
sale of securities and must be vigorously pursued.
In addition to its enforcement program against boiler rooms, the
Commission has sought through a broad publicity campaign to alert
investors to the risks involved in the purchase of securities from unknown high-pressure salesmen. Posters warning investors of boiler
room operators have been widely distributed, spot radio and television
announcements carrying similar warnings have 'been prepared to be
broadcast in cooperation with The Advertising Council, and brochures
listing protective measures that an investor should take before making
a purchase have been prepared for wide public distribution.
Manipulation in the Securities Markets

In April 1959 the Commission issued a statement warning investors
to exercise extreme caution and self-restraint when considering the
purchase of securities upon the basis of tips and rumors,'
Price fluctuations were occurring in certain securities on the exchanges and in
the over-the-counter markets without apparent economic reason. Also
there appeared to be a considerable amount of speculation on the part
of public investors.
These conditions facilitated the manipulation of
securities prices and boded eventual losses to investors.
Officials of
the leading exchanges also joined in warning investors, and brokerage
houses urged their customers to exercise caution in purchasing
unknown securities.
In volatile markets where prices are susceptible to swift and wide
changes on the basis of rumors, manipulation is facilitated and the
task of enforcement becomes increasingly difficult. The Commission
has therefore had to place greater emphasis upon the detection and
prevention of manipulation and a substantial number of investigations
are now in progress. Some of these investigations have resulted in
indictments and it is anticipated that certain other cases now under
investigation will also lead to criminal prosecution.
Exemptions From Registration and Prefiling Publicity

One of the areas of evasion of the registration and prospectus
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 is the claiming of exemp'~ecllr1ties Exchange Act Rell'IlsP No. 5927 (Apr. 7,1959).

TWENTY-FIFTH

tions which, in fact, are not available. The attempt to use these
exemptions to- evade registration requirements usually occurs where
the issue, or the sales procedure to be employed, would not stand the
light of the full disclosure requirements of registration.
In order to
narrow this area of evasion, the Commission has consistently sought
through its participation in litigation involving claimed exemptions,
through its own decisions and through its rule-making power, to define
and clarify the proper limits of certain of these exemptions.
One of
the significant developments in this area has been the recent amendment by the Commission of Rule 133.
Under Rule 133, which embodies an interpretation of long standing,
the issue of securities in connection with certain types of corporate
mergers, consolidations, reclassifications of securities and acquisitions of corporate assets is not deemed to constitute a "sale" of securities to stockholders of corporate parties to the transactions.
This
rule has the effect of exempting these transactions from the registration requirements, but not from the anti-fraud provisions, of the
Securities Act. The rule provides no exemption for subsequent distribution of such securities.
Because of the substantial number of
transactions ostensibly effected in reliance upon the rule but which
involved violation of the registration requirements, the Commission
amended Rule 133 to restate the purpose and effect of that rule and to
clarify its application and limitations.
In addition, the Commission
adopted a new registration form to provide an expeditious registration
procedure for securities issued in a transaction within Rule 133 where
such registration is required and where the issuer has solicited proxies
under the Commission's proxy rule with respect to such transaction."
In three significant cases the courts have further delineated the
boundaries of exemptions from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. A frequently used device for evasion has been the
abuse of the intrastate exemption under section 3 (a) (11) of the
act. The issuer may attempt to use a resident of the state as a nominee for non-resident beneficial owners or the alleged sales to residents
may he merely a step in a planned interstate distribution.
In S.E.O.
v, Hillsborough Investment Corporation, et al.3 the Court upheld the
limitation on the scope of that exemption, long viewed as applicable
by the Commission, that a single sale to a non-resident, directly or
indirectly, destroys the intrastate exemption for the entire issue,
including the securities sold only to residents.
Various devices have been used in an attempt to avoid registration
on the claim that a distribution is within the "private offering" exemption under section 4(1) of the act. The Commission and the
courts have consistently rejected a numerical test as a conclusive basis
• Securities Act Release No. 4115 (July 6, 1959).
• D. New Hampshire No. 1965 (Dec. 11, 1958>.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

for determining the availability of that exemption. In GiUigan, Will
& 00. et al. v, B.E.O.,' the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
further held that even if a numerical test did exist, persons claiming
the exemption would have the burden of establishing a reasonable and
bona fide belief that the total number of individuals involved in the
placement would remain within that limit. The Court also concluded
that the private offering exemption was not available to a dealer who
assertedly acquired securities for "investment" where the dealer speculatively purchased unregistered securities in the hope that the financially weak issuer had "turned the corner" and then unloaded the
securities on an unadvised public when he later determined that their
purchase was an unsound investment.
The third case dealt with the exemption under section 4(1) of the
act for trading transactions-s-an exemption frequently claimed by
boiler rooms. In B.E.O. v. Oulpepper et al.,5 the Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit held that a broker-dealer who engages in steps
necessary to consummate a public distribution is an "underwriter"
within the meaning of the act even though the broker-dealer has no
privity with the issuer or a control group.
Another area of evasion of the registration requirements is the use
of publicity with respect to an issuer or its securities prior to the filing
of a registration statement. In two cases coming before it last year,
the Commission undertook to set forth the precise limitations on prefiling publicity under section 5 ( c) of the Securities Act of 1933.6
In these opinions, the Commission pointed out that the statutory procedure for disseminating information about the issue prior to the
time of sale is exclusive and that it "cannot be nullified by recourse to
public relations techniques to set in motion or further the machinery
of distribution before the statutory disclosures have been made and
upon the basis of whatever information the distributor deems it expedient to supply." 1
Regulation of the Exchanges

During the fiscal year 1959,the Commission took a more active regulatory role with respect to exchange activities. A Commission investigation found, for example, that on the American Stock Exchange floor
trading activities were accentuating market swings particularly in
issues susceptible to extreme price fluctuations because of a small floating supply. At the suggestion of the Commission that Exchange
adopted a rule designed to prevent floor traders from making purchases of stock at successively higher prices and to restrict the impact

of their trading upon the market for active and volatile issues," The
Commission also questioned the activities of certain specialists on
that Exchange, particularly off-floor transactions by specialists in securities in which they were registered.
At the suggestion of the Commission, that Exchange adopted a number of additional rules relating
to specialists for the purpose of restricting their dealings so far as
practicable to those reasonably necessary to permit them to maintain
a fair and orderly market in the securities in which they are registered.
The regulation of commission rates on the exchanges was the subject of the Commission's attention during fiscal 1959. In line with
the suggestions of the Commission, the New York Stock Exchange in
March 1959 reduced minimum commissions on small value transactions
and instituted a broad study in consultation with the staff of the Commission into the costs of effecting exchange transactions,"
Regulation of the Over-the-Counter Markets

The increase in new offerings traded over-the-counter and the phenomenal growth in the number of broker-dealers registered with the
Commission and of representatives registered with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., evidence the growing interest in
over-the-counter securities. The Commission is seeking to ascertain
what changes, if any, may be occurring in the distribution and trading
practices of the over-the-counter market as a result of this growth.
In recent securities markets, there has been a strong underlying public demand for so-called "glamor" stocks. These securities often sell
at a substantial premium on the first day of trading.
Most of these
issues are low-priced, have no public market prior to the offering and
often involve companies in the electronics, missile and related defense
fields. In some instances, promoters have changed the name of the
company and its operating divisions to suggest some connection with
these activities.
The Commission, after the end of the fiscal year, instituted a broad
inquiry into the genesis and distribution of some of these issues to determine, among other things, whether some of these issues have been
generated primarily to enrich the promoters, underwriters and others ;
whether artificial restraints have been imposed upon the floating supply of these issues in order to raise the market price; and whether certain practices have developed in connection with the distribution and
marketing arrangements for these issues which violate provisions of
the federal securities laws."

Inspection of Investment Companies

The rise in the number of new investment companies and the tremendous growth of the industry led the Commission several years
ago to develop a program for the routine inspection of investment
companies. Since there has been no additional staff available for this
purpose and in view of the increased workload of regular administrative business, the Commission has been able to conduct inspections
only on a pilot basis for the past few years. It is hoped, however, that
additional personnel will be made available so that the inspection
program will move forward more rapidly in the future and that a
realistic cycle of inspections can be instituted and maintained.
The inspections made by the Commission to date, limited in number though they have been, have shown the urgent need for this
method of assuring compliance with the Investment Company Act.
In some cases failures to comply with the act or improper practices
were discovered and corrective action requested and taken. In one
case, the violations were serious in nature and resulted in a stop-order
proceeding under the Securities Act and the issuance of an opinion
and stop-order. Apart from bringing to light improprieties or fraudulent conduct, the institution of routine inspections should prove to be
particularly beneficial to the newly organized or smaller investment
company in complying with the requirements of the Investment Company Act.
Other Factors in the Securities Markets

Under the statutes which it administers, the Commission has the
duty to conduct inquiries into the securities markets not only for
the purpose of enforcement but also to ascertain facts to aid in the
adoption of rules and regulations and for making appropriate legislative recommendations. In dynamic and changing markets, the
Commission must continually reassess the statutes and the rules and
regulations which it administers in light of new knowledge. For
example, the Commission has instituted an inquiry into the problems
created by the growth in the size of investment companies for the
purpose of determining whether the increased size of investment companies has created problems requiring remedial Iegislation,"'
Another inquiry of somewhat less importance but of interest to the
public is one into the "put" and "call" market. This little known
and little explored area of the securities market is now being studied
by the Commission to ascertain, among other things, who writes these
options, how they are marketed and who purchases them.

PART II
LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES
Statutory An1enchnents Proposed by the Commission

Proposals to amend 87 provisions of the Federal securities laws were
submitted by the Commission to the 85th Congress in July and August
1957. These proposals were introduced in both the Senate and the
House of Representatives, and the bills were referred to committee,
but no action was taken on the bills during the 85th Congress.'
During the latter part of 1958 the Commission reexamined these
recommendations for legislation and made some modifications, deleting
certain proposals and adding others. The modified proposals, which
would amend the Securities Act of 1933, The Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the Investment Company
Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, were then submitted in the 86th Congress to the Committee on Banking and Currency, United States Senate, and the Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives.
These Committees
have the duty of exercising watchfulness over the execution of the
securities laws under section 136 of the Legislative Reorganization Act
of 1946.
The Commission's proposals were introduced in the Senate by
Senator A. Willis Robertson, Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency, for himself and for Senator Homer E. Capehart,
as S. 1178, S. 1179, S. 1180, S. 1181, and S. 1182. In the House of
Representatives, Representative Oren Harris, Chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, introduced companion
bills, H.R. 5001, H.R. 2480, H.R. 5002, H.R. 2481, and H.R. 2482.2
Basically the Commission's proposals, the more significant of which
are briefly described below, are intended to strengthen the safeguards
and protections afforded the public by tightening jurisdictional provisions, correcting certain inadequacies revealed through administrative experience and facilitating criminal prosecutions and other enforcement activities.
.The proposed amendments to the Securities Act of 1933 would
clarify the jurisdictional basis of the civil liability provisions of the

statute; extend existing civil liabilities and provide criminal liability
with respect to documents filed with the Commission pursuant to
Commission rules in connection with exempt offerings; increase from
$300,000 to $500,000 the size of offerings which may be exempted
from registration under section 3 (b) of the statute; and make it clear
that a showing of past violations is a sufficient basis for injunctive
relief and that aiders and abettors may be responsible in civil and
administrative proceedings,"
The proposed amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
would make comparable changes with respect to injunctive relief and
liability of aiders and abettors. In addition, changes proposed in that
statute would make it a violation or the act to embezzle monies or
securities entrusted to the care of an exchange member or a registered
broker or dealer; clarify and strengthen the statutory provisions relating to manipulation and to the financial responsibility of brokers
and dealers; authorize the Commission by rule to regulate the borrowing, holding or lending of customers' securities by a broker or dealer;
make it clear that attempts to purchase or
securities are covered
by the antifraud provisions of the statute; revise the provisions relating to broker and dealer registration with respect to (a) the basis
on which action for denial or revocation may be taken, (b) the sanctions which may be imposed by the Commission, (c) the conditions
under which an application for registration may be withdrawn, and
(d) the postponement of the effectiveness of an application for registration; authorize the Commission to suspend or withdraw the registration of a securities exchange when the exchange has ceased to meet
the requirements of its original registration; clarify the Commission's
authority to suspend a security from exchange trading where there
has been a failure to comply with the act and where otherwise necessary in the public interest; prohibit trading in the over-the-counter
market for limited periods where the public interest and the protection
of investors so requires; provide that an insolvent broker or dealer
may be adjudicated a bankrupt in an injunctive proceeding instituted
by the Commission; and provide for a monetary :forfeiture for each
day that certain reports required under the act are delinquent.
The changes proposed in the Trust Indenture act of 1939 are designed primarily to conform this statute to recommendations made
under the Securities Act.
The proposed amendments to the Investment Company Act of 1940
would require an investment company to state as matters o:f fundamental policy, which generally could not be changed without the
consent of its stockholders, the extent to which it intends to invest
in particular types of securities and such other basic investment
objectives as it represents it will emphasize; strengthen the provi-

sions requiring It minimum number of independent or nonmanagement directors; limit the extent to which a face-amount investment
company can include preferred and common stock in its "qualified
investments" ; make clear the application of the statute to an "advisory
board"; and modify the exception for companies subject to regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission and clarify the exceptions applicable to companies engaged in banking, insurance, small
loan, factoring, discount or real estate businesses.
The proposed changes in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940would
expand the basis for disqualification of a registrant because of prior
misconduct; authorize the Commission by rule to require the keeping
of books and records and the filing of reports; permit periodic examinations of a registrant's books and records; empower the Commission
by rule to define and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent
fraudulent practices; extend criminal liability for willful violation
of a rule or order of the Commission; and revise the provisions relating to the postponement of effectiveness and the withdrawal of
applications for registration.
Many minor amendments of these statutes are also proposed.
Hearings on the bills were held before the Subcommittee on Securities of the Banking and Currency Committee of the Senate, on
June 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24, and 25, 1959, and before the Subcommittee
on Commerce and Finance of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives on June 3, July 8
and 9 and August 4, 1959. The Commission and staff members presented testimony at the beginning of the hearings before each committee, and again after interested industry representatives and others
had been heard. As a result of conferences with industry representatives, similar to those held in connection with the formulation of the
legislative recommendations in the 85th Congress, and as a consequence of comments and suggestions made during the course of the
hearings by members of Congress and witnesses, the Commission made
certain modifications in its proposals. These modifications did not
represent abandonment of the original proposals, but essentially constituted clarification and statutory specification of matters in conformity with the original intention of the Commission.
The Commission also advised the Committees that it had no objection to three amendments to the Investment Advisers Act proposed
during the hearings by certain investment advisers and their representatives. One would modify the definition of the term "control"
in the statute, the second would grant the Commission authority to
provide exemptions from the statute, and the third would modify the
conditions under which an investment adviser may call himself an
"investment counsel."

Other Legislative Proposals

Various other bills to amend the securities laws were introduced,
and the Commission submitted comments to the committees of Congress. These bills, except for H.R. 4025 and H.R. 5543, renewed
proposals made in previous sessions of the Congress. No hearings
were held on the bills, which are discussed briefly below.

John B. Bennett introduced an identical bill, H.R. 6294. Both bills
would amend section 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which
now provides an annual fee for registration of exchanges of one fivehundredths of 1 percent of the aggregate dollar amount of stock exchange transactions, equal to 2 cents per $1,000. Under the bills this
exchange registration fee would be increased to a rate of 5 cents per
$1,000 and there would be a similar registration fee for brokers and
dealers of 5 cents per $1,000 on transactions effected otherwise than
on a national securities exchange,"
2. Disclosure of Beneficial Ownership of Registered Securities in
Election Contests.-On January 9, 1958, Senator Homer E. Capehart
introduced S. 132, a bill directed to identifying beneficial owners of
securities in proxy contests. The bill would add to section 14 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 a provision making it unlawful for
any person to give or to attempt to give a proxy to vote a registered
security at any annual or special meeting for the election or removal
of directors, with respect to which proxies are solicited by opposing
nominees, unless (1) such person is the beneficial owner of the security, or (2) the name and last known address of the beneficial owner
appears on the proxy. In addition, the bill would make it unlawful
for any person knowingly to exercise or attempt to exercise any proxy
in violation of this provision,"
3. Reporting Requirement of Beneficial Owners of Registered
Securities and Officers and Directors of Issuers Thereofv-c-On January 28, 1959, Senator Homer E. Capehart introduced S. 736, which
would amend section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to
require every beneficial owner of more than 5 percent (instead of 10
percent as now provided) of any class of any equity security which
is registered on a national securities exchange to file reports of his
securities holdings and transactions with the Commission,"

H.R. 1028 was introduced by Representative Abraham Multer on
January 7,1959. This bill would amend section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require officersand directors of any issuer
of registered securities to report periodically the extent to which, and
the purposes for which, their holdings of such securities are pledged.
4. Proposals Relating to Exempt Offerings and Civil Liabilities
in Connection Therewith.- Two bills designed to impose additional
civil liabilities in connection with exempt offerings under section 3 (b)
of the Securities Act of 1933 were introduced in the first session of the
86th Congress. On January 7, 1959, Representative Leonard Farbstein introduced H.R. 93, a bill which would augment existing provisions for civil liabilities by providing for specific liability on the
part of those responsible for untrue statements of material facts or
omissions to state material facts in any statements or document filed
with the Commission in connection with an exempt offering under
section 3 (b) . This bill is identical with the proposal embodied in the
Commission's legislative program/ except that the Commission proposal also encompasses false filings pursuant to section 3 (c) of the
statute.
On February 17, 1959, Representative .Iohn R. Bennett introduced
H.R. 4568, a bill which would raise the exemptive ceiling under section
3(b) from $300,000 to $500,000 and would make applicable to such
exempt offerings the strict civil liabilities now pertaining solely to
registered offerings. 8
5. Repeal of Exemption for Intrastate Offering.-H.R. 884, introduced by Representative Abraham Multer of New York, would remove the exemption provided by section 3(a) (11) of the Securities
Act for a security offering confined to the residents of the state within
which the issuer is both incorporated and doing business. The Commission has not submitted its views on this proposal.
6. Reduced Sales Load for Certain Purchases of Investment
Company Shares.-As
a consequence of the Commission's promulgation on December 2,1958, of rule 22d-1 under the Investment Company Act,9 Representative Edward W. Hiestand introduced H.R.
4025 and H.R. 5543, both of which would amend section 22( d) of the
statute to authorize quantity purchases of investment company shares
by certain retirement associations at reduced sales loads. Prior to the
adoption of rule 22d-1 several associations of individuals, which
would not be exempted under the provisions of the rule, had received
the benefit of a smaller sales load in connection with certain quantity

purchases and had been advised by the Commission's staff that it
would not recommend that any action be taken in respect of such purchases. Both H.R. 4025 and H.R. 5543 are designed to restore the
earlier interpretation.
A substantial amount of time was directed to matters pertaining
to other legislative proposals referred to the Commission for comment
and to congressional inquiries. During the fiscal year 1959 a total of
76 legislative proposals were analyzed. In comparison, 58 proposals
were analyzed during fiscal 1958 and 33 during fiscal 1957. In addition, numerous congressional inquiries relating to matters other than
specific legislative proposals were received and answered.
Congressional Hearings

In addition to the hearings in connection with the Commission's
legislative program discussed above, the Commission presented to the
House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce a general discussion of the Commission's activities and the particular problems
currently facing the Commission.
The Commission appeared before the Subcommittee on Legislative
Oversight of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce in September and November 1958 and again in June 1959.10
The Commission also appeared on May 13, 1959, before the House
Select Committee on Small Business to testify concerning the Commission's role in administering the laws governing the operation of
small business investment companies.

PART III
REVISION OF RULES, REGULATIONS AND FORMS
The Commission made a number of changes during the 1959 fiscal
year in its rules, regulations and forms under the various statutes
administered by it. Other changes which the Commission published
in preliminary form for the purpose of obtaining public comments
thereon were pending at the end of the fiscal year. The changes
made during the fiscal year and those pending at the end of the year
are described below.'
Changing conditions, methods and procedures in business and in
the financial practices of business make it necessary for the Commission to maintain a continuing review of its rules, regulations
and forms. Certain members of its staff are assigned to this task.
Changes are also suggested, from time to time, by other members of
the staff engaged in the examination of material filed with the Commission, and by persons outside of the Commission who are subject
to the Commission's requirements or who have occasion to work with
those requirements in a professional capacity such as underwriters,
attorneys, accountants, and other representatives. With relatively
few exceptions, provided for by the Administrative Procedure Act,
proposed changes in rules, regulations and forms are announced to
the public and interested persons are invited to submit their views
and comments thereon. These views and comments are carefully
reviewed by the staff and by the Commission and are very helpful
in connection with the Commission's consideration of proposed
changes.
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
Amendment of Rule 133

Shortly after the end of the fiscal year the Commission adopted
certain amendments to rule 133.2 The modification of this rule has
been under consideration for some time and has been mentioned in
1 The rules and regulations
of the Commission are published in the Code of Federal
RegUlations, the rules adopted under the varrous Acts adnnnfsterad by the Commtsston
appearing in the following parts of title 17 of that Code:

previous annual reports of the Commission," Rule 133 provides in
general that for the purpose of determining the application of the
registration and prospectus provisions of the Securities Act, no
"offer" or "sale" shall be deemed to be involved so far as stockholders
of a corporation are concerned where, pursuant to the provisions
of a statute or the certificate of incorporation, there is submitted to
a vote of such stockholders a plan involving a statutory merger, consolidation, reclassification of securities or transfer of assets of the
corporation in consideration of the issuance of securities of another
corporation. The general purpose of the amendments to the rule is
to make it clear that under certain circumstances securities distributed
by persons receiving them in connection with such transactions may
be required to be registered under the act. For example, the amended
rule provides that where one company is merged into another company, a stockholder in control of the merged company who receives
securities of the surviving company with a view to making a distribution of such securities to the public shall be deemed to be an
underwriter and registration of the securities is required before the
distribution can be made. However, registration is not required
with respect to securities sold in certain brokers' transactions as
defined in the rule.
In connection with the amendment of rule 133, a new Form S-14
was adopted :for the registration of certain securities issued in a rule
133 transaction. TIllS form is discussed below at p. 20.
Amendment of Rule 135

This rule, as originally adopted, provided that a notice or other
communication sent by an issuer to its security holders to inform
them of the proposed issuance of rights to subscribe to additional
securities would not be deemed to offer any security issue for sale if
such notice was sent in conformity with the rule. The principal
requirements were that the notice be sent within 60 days prior to
the record date, state that the offering will be made only by the
prospectus and in addition contain only certain specified information necessary to inform the security holders of the forthcoming
offering. The purpose of the rule was to enable an issuer to furnish
certain factual information to its security holders in advance of
making the actual offering.
The rule was amended during the fiscal year to permit the sending
of similar notices where an issuer proposes to offer securities to its
own security holders, or to the security holders of another issuer in
exchange for securities presently held by them, and also where the
issuer proposes to make an offering of securities to its employees or
to the employees of an affiliate."

Proposed Rule Changes Relating to Assessable Stock

During the 1958 fiscal year the Commission invited public coniments on a proposed new rule 136 and certain proposed amendments
to rule 140 with respect to assessable stock and the levying of assessments thereon. 5 The general purpose of these proposals was to make
it clear that the Securities Act of 1933 applies to the levying of
assessments on assessable stock to the same extent that it applies to
other securities. Action on these proposals was deferred pending further study of the matter. During the 1959 fiscal year the Commission
published revised proposals with respect to the rules referred to and
also a proposed exemption Regulation F,6 which were adopted shortly
after the close ofthe fiscal year,"
The new Regulation F, which provides an exemption from registration under the act for assessments and delinquent assessment sales
in amounts not exceeding $300,000 in anyone year, requires the filing
of a simple notification giving brief information with respect to the
issuer, its management, principal security holders, recent and proposed assessments and other security issues. This notification could
be prepared in a relatively short time by any officer of the company
who is familiar with the company's affairs and there is no fee or
charge for its filing. The filing may be made by mailing the notification to the appropriate regional officeof the Commission.
The only information which a company is required to send to its
stockholders, or otherwise publish, is a statement of the purposes
for which the proceeds from the assessment are proposed to be used.
This information may be included in the notice of assessment given
by mail or otherwise published as required by State law. If the issuer
should employ any other sales literature in connection with the assessment, copies of such literature must be filed with the Commission.
Proposed Rule 144

During the fiscal year the Commission invited public comments on
a proposed rule relating to certain transactions by the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The proposed rule, to be
designated rule 144, would have defined the term "transactions by an
issuer not involving any public offering," in section 4(1) of the act,
to include certain activities of the Bank. After the close of the fiscal
year, the Commission announced that it had discontinued consideration of the proposed rule since there appeared to be no present need
for it.s

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The proposed rule would also define the term "distribution" in section 2 (11) of the act as not applying to such transactions by the bank
or by any dealer who is acting on an agency basis pursuant to a written contract with the bank.
The matter was still under consideration at the end of the fiscal
year.
Adoption of Rule 151

TIlls rule defines the term "public offering" to exclude under certain conditions the offering of stock of small business investment
companies to small business concerns pursuant to the requirements
of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958.9
Under section 304(d) of the Small Business Investment Act, whenever a small business investment company provides capital to a small
business concern through the purchase of the latter's convertible debenture bonds, the small business concern is required to purchase stock
of the small business investment company in an amount equal to not
less than 2 percent nor more than 5 percent of the capital so provided,
in accordance with regulations of the Small Business Administration.
Those regulations specify certain minimum amounts of such stock
which a small business concern is required to purchase depending
upon the amount of capital which it obtains from a small business
investment company through the issuance of convertible debenture
bonds.
The new rule provides that a public offering of capital stock of a
small business investment company is not deemed to be involved where
the offer or sale is made in connection with the purchase of debenture
bonds from a small business concern pursuant to the requirements of
the Small Business Investment Act, the amount of stock involved is
the minimum required by that act and the regulations thereunder in
connection with the particular transaction, and the stock is acquired
by the small business concern for investment and not with a view to
its distribution.
Amendment of Rule 434A

This rule permits the use of summary prospectuses which omit in
part or summarize information set forth in the more complete prospectus required to be used in connection with the offering and sale
of securities. Summary prospectuses may be used in the form of
newspaper advertisements, circulars, etc. as a screening device to locate persons interested in receiving a copy of the complete prospectus.
The rule was amended during the fiscal year to permit the use of
summary prospectuses by a larger group of issuers." The rule as previously in effect permitted the use of summary prospectuses only by

registrants which file reports under sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The amended rule permits the use of
summary prospectuses by certain other registrants which do not file
such -reports but which meet certain standards as to size, earnings,
and the publication of reports.
Adoption of Regulation E

The Commission during the fiscal year adopted a new regulation,
designated Regulation E, which provides a conditional exemption
from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 for securities of
small business investment companies which are licensed under the
Small Business Investment Act of 1958 or which have received the
preliminary approval of the Small Business Administration and have
been notified by the Administration that they may submit an application for such a license." The new regulation, which exempts issues not in excess of $300,000 from registration under the act, was
adopted pursuant to the new section 3 (c) which was added to the
Securities Act by section 307 (a) of the Small Business Investment
Act.
Regulation E is similar in many respects to the general exemption
for certain securities, other than those of investment companies, provided by Regulation A. It requires the filing of a notification with
the Commission and, except in the case of offerings not in excess of
$50,000, the filing and use of an offering circular containing certain
specified information.
In general, information is required in the
offering circular as to the business and investment policies of the
issuer, its management and its financial condition. The financial
statements required must be prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and practices but need not be certified
by independent public accountants. Provision is made for the suspension of an exemption in a particular case if the Commission finds
that any of the terms and conditions of the regulation have not been
met or complied with.
Adoption of Form N-S

During the fiscal year the Commission adopted a new form, designated Form N-5, for the registration under the Securities Act of 1933
of securities to be issued by small business investment companies which
are licensed under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 01'
which have received the preliminary approval of the Small Business
Administration and have been notified by the Administration that they
may submit an application for such a license." This form is also to
be used for the registration statements of such companies filed pursuant to section 8 (b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ..

The new form is a combination form which enables It small business
investment company to register under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 and at the same time to register securities for a public offering
under the Securities Act of 1933 by means of a single registration
statement. If a company has already registered under the Investment
Company Act, the form may be used for subsequent registration under
the Securities Act. If a company desires to register under the Investment Company Act prior to registering securities under the Securities
Act, the form may be used for this purpose also.
Adoption of Form S-14

In connection with the adoption of amendments to rule 133/3 the
Commission also adopted a new Form S-14.H This form is designed
to provide a simplified registration procedure for securities issued
in a rule 133 transaction where such registration is required and where
the issuer has solicited proxies under the Commission's proxy rules
with respect to such transaction. The form provides that the prospectus may consist chiefly of the information set forth in the proxy
statement supplemented by the necessary underwriting and distribution data and pertinent information regarding developments .in the
registrant's business subsequent to the rule 133 transaction.
THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACF OF 1934
Adoption of Rule 16b-8

The Commission during the fiscal year adopted a new rule under
section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.15 This section
of the act provides that profits obtained by certain holders of the
stock of a listed company from purchases and sales, or sales and purchases, of any equity securities of such company (other than exempt
securities) within any 6-month period may be recovered by the
company or by any security holder on its behalf.
The new rule, designated rule 16b-8, exempts from section 16(b)
under certain conditions the receipt from an issuer of shares of stock
having general voting power and registered on a national securities
exchange upon the surrender of an equal number of shares of stock
of the same issuer which do not have such voting power and are not so
registered, where the transaction is effected pursuant to the provisions
of the issuer's certificate of incorporation for the purpose of making
an immediate sale of the shares so received.
The conditions of the rule, briefly summarized, are that the person
so receiving such shares is not an officer or director of the issuer or a
person who was a beneficial owner immediately prior to the transaction of more than 10 percent of a registered equity security of the

offering, sale, and distribution or gift of such shares; and that no
shares of the class surrendered or any other shares of the class received
are acquired by the person effecting the transaction within six months
before or after the date of the transaction.
Amendment of Form 8-K

The Commission during the fiscal year adopted certain amendments to Form 8-K, which is the form prescribed for current reports
filed pursuant to sections 13 and 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.16 The amendments relate to the item of the form which
requires information in regard to matters submitted to a vote of
security holders, either at a meeting of such security holders or otherwise. The purpose of the amendments was to clarify the item with
respect to the circumstances under which the information specified
in the item is required to be furnished.
The Commission also invited public comments on certain other
proposed amendments to Form 8-K designed to bring to the attention
of investors promptly information regarding material changes
affecting the company or its affairs where it appears that the changes
are of such importance that they should be reported promptly and not
deferred, to the end of the fiscal year," The amendments relate to
matters such as the pledging of securities of the issuer or its affiliates,
changes in the board of directors otherwise than by stockholder action,
the acquisition or disposition of significant amounts of assets and
transactions with insiders. Shortly after the end of the fiscal year
the time for submitting comments on these proposed changes was
extended to August 15, 1959.1s
THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940
Adoption of Rule 3e-l

In connection with the adoption of rule 151 under the Securities
Act,19the Commission also adopted a new rule 3e-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 defining the term "public offering", for
the purposes of section 3(c) (1) of that act, to exclude under certain
conditions, the offering of stock of small business investment companies to small business concerns pursuant to the requirements of the

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Small Business Investment Act of 1958.20 Section 3(c) (1) of the
Investment Company Act provides that any issuer whose outstanding
securities (other than short term paper) are beneficially owned by
not more than 100 persons and which is not making and does not
presently propose to make a public offering of its securities is not an
investment company within the meaning of the act. Since the requirements of the Small Business Investment Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder require that a small business investment
company in its role as a provider of capital continually stand ready
to sell its stock to small business concerns, a continuous disposition of
stock by such investment companies may possibly be interpreted to be
a "public offering." The Commission, therefore, adopted rule 3c-1 to
effectuate the purposes and objectives of the Small Business Investment Act without adversely affecting the public investor interest.
The terms and conditions of the rule 3c-1 definition are substantially
the same as those contained in rule 151.
Adoption of Rule IOf-3-Permitting
Syndicates

Acquisition of Securities of Underwriting

To alleviate the problems and administrative burdens involved in
processing individual applications for relief pursuant to section 10(f}
of the act, the Commission, in December 1958, adopted rule 10£-3
exempting certain limited acquisitions of securities by registered investment companies during the existence of an underwriting syndicate where such acquisitions are not made from affiliated underwriters," Notice of the proposed rule was issued in July 195822
and the comments received were unanimously in favor of the adoption of the rule, although a number of suggestions for its modification
were included.
Section 10(f) of the act provides that an investment company,
unless exempted by rule, regulation or order, is prohibited from purchasing a security during the existence of an underwriting syndicate,
if any of the principal underwriters are affiliated persons of the investment company. Before the adoption of rule 10f-3, investment
companies were required in all such cases to obtain an exemptive
ruling by the Commission prior to the purchase of such securities
or to purchase them conditioned on obtaining an exemptive order
within such periods of time as a particular underwriter might be
willing to ~rant even though extending beyond the date of the public
offering. The new rule permits the investment company to make
such purchases under certain conditions without the necessity of obtaining an order of exemption.

relief filed pursuant to section 10(f) over the years, the Commission
was in a position to determine what conditions and safeguards should
be imposed in such situations to insure the protection of investors.
These include limitations with respect to the consideration paid, as
related both to the amount of the offering and the assets of the investment company. In addition, underwriters' commissions may not
exceed stated amounts, no purchase may be made from an affiliated
underwriter, and the offering must be effectively registered under the
Securities Act of 1933. These conditions are designed to permit purchases where the circumstances are such as to make it likely that the
purchases would be consistent with the protection of investors. Purchases that do not meet the strict conditions of the rule may, nevertheless, be exempted by order upon application where the statutory
standards are satisfied.
Adoption of Rule 22d-I-Relating
Securities

to Variations in Sales Load of Redeemable

Section 22(d) prohibits a registered investment company, its principal underwriter, or a dealer from selling redeemable securities of
the company to any person except at a current public offering price
described in the prospectus. Rule 22d-l was adopted by the Commission in order to settle and codify administrative interpretations
of the provisions of section 22 (d) and to provide by rule exemptions
from its provisions which would obviate the necessity for numerous
individual applications." Thus, the burden is removed from the industry of preparing applications under section 6(c), and the Commission need not process such exemptions, in cases identical to those
where such relief had previously been granted. The result of the rule
is to ensure uniform compliance with the provisions of section 22 (d) .
The rule was the product of a comprehensive review of the legislative history of section 22(d) of the act, and all past administrative
interpretations and exemptive orders issued under that section. One
of the most important objectives of the rule was to determine the question of the availability of a quantity discount (i.e., a reduced sales
charge for sales exceeding an established amount) for persons who
were banded together for the purpose of making purchases as a group.
The rule permits the granting of quantity discounts and does not
insist that the amount of securities must be determined as of a single
point of time. In this respect the rule follows previous Commission decisions which had permitted a sales load discount to be based
upon shares previously acquired and then owned plus the shares being
purchased. Purchases made within a period of not more than 13
months pursuant to a "letter of intent" may also be aggregated for
ascertaining the quantity entitled to a discount but the agreement
,. Investment

Company Act Release No. 2798 (Dec. 2, 19(8).

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

under which such purchases are made must assure that the lower price
is justified by the quantity actually purchased and that adjustments
will be made if required. In each of these instances, the inclusion of
shares of other mutual funds is permitted if the same principal undervvriterisinvolved.
The rule, however, requires uniform prices to individual investors
and prohibits quantity discounts to groups of individuals, except in
the case of a family unit. A trustee or other fiduciary may obtain a
quantity discount for a single trust estate of which there are more than
one beneficiary, but quantity discounts may not be allowed on the
aggregate of sales to a trustee or representative acting for more than
one account or more than one trust. The rule specifically provides that
the term "any person" shall not include a group of individuals whose
funds are combined directly or indirectly for the purchase of shares,
whether jointly or through a representative or agent of the gT.QUp.The
rule in this respect reflects a stricter interpretation than prior Commission views under which quantity discounts had been extended to
trustees, custodians, or agents acting on behalf of members of an
organization.
The rule permits sales at reduced prices to tax exempt organizations, following Commission decisions in the past granting such exemptive treatment. Sales at net asset value or with a lower load are
also permitted to be made to officers, directors, and employees of the
investment company, its underwriter and investment adviser, but written assurance must be given that the purchases are for investment
purposes and that the securities will not be resold except through
the usual redemption or repurchase procedure. Sales to employee
pension or benefit plans are included within the exemption afforded
by the rule.
With respect to the reinvestment of distributions the rule permits the limitation of reinvestment privileges to participants in a
systematic investment or dividend reinvestment plan provided all
shareholders are offered the opportunity to participate in the dividend
reinvestment plan at any time. All stockholders must be notified of
the availability of the dividend reinvestment privilege once each
year by a statement in the annual report or other document.
The rule has been helpful in stabilizing the pricing methods of
the mutual funds. The need for individual exemptive orders has
been substantially eliminated, thus lightening the burdens on the
companies and the Commission to that extent. The provisions of
the rule are, of course, subject to review by the Commission, and specific applications for relief may still be submitted.

Adoption of Form N-5-Registration
Companies

ANNUAL REPORT

25

Form for Small Business Investment

As previously indicated," the new Form K-5 is a combination
form which enables a small business investment company to register
under the Investment Company Act pursuant to section 8 (b) and
at the same time to register securities for a public offering under
the Securities Act of 1933 by means of a single registration statement. If a company has already registered under the Investment
Company Act the form may be used for subsequent registration
under the Securities Act. If a company desires to register under
the Investment Company Act prior to registering securities under
the Securities Act, the form may also be used for that purpose.

PART IV
AD:MINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Securities Act of 1933 is designed to provide disclosure to
investors of material facts concerning securities publicly offered for
sale by use of the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce,
and to prevent misrepresentation, deceit, or other fraudulent practices in the sale of securities. Disclosure is obtained by requiring
the issuer of such securities to file with the Commission a registration statement and related prospectus containing significant information about the issuer and the offering. These documents are available for public inspection as soon as they are filed. The registration
statement must become "effective," however, before the securities may
be sold to the public. In addition the prospectus must be furnished
to the purchaser at or before the sale or delivery of the security. The
registrant and the underwriter are responsible for the contents of
the registration statement. The Commission has no authority to
control the nature or quality of a security to be offered for public
sale or to pass upon its merits or the terms of its distribution.
Its
action in permitting a registration statement to become effective does
not constitute approval of the securities, and any representation to
a prospective purchaser of securities to the contrary is made unlawful
by section 23 of the.act.
DESCRIPTION OF mE

REGISTRATION PROCESS

Registration Statement and Prospectus

Registration of any security proposed to be publicly offered may
be effected by filing with the Commission a registration statement on
the applicable form containing the prescribed disclosure. 'When a
registration statement relates, generally speaking, to a security issued
by a corporation or other private issuer, it must contain the information, and be accompanied by the documents, specified in schedule A
of the act; when it relates to a security issued by a foreign government, the material specified in schedule B must be supplied. Both
schedules specify in considerable detail the disclosure which should
be made available to an investor in order that he may make an informed decision whether to buy the security. In addition, the act
provides flexibility in its administration by empowering the Commission to classify issues, issuers and prospectuses, to prescribe appropriate forms, and to increase, or in certain instances vary or diminish,
the information required to be disclosed in the registration statement,
26

TVVENTY-FIFTH A~AL

REPORT

27

as the Commission deems appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors.
In general the registration statement of an issuer other than a
foreign government must set forth such matters 3S the names of persons who participate in the direction, management, Or control of the
issuer's business; their security holdings and remuneration and the
options or bonus and profit-sharing privileges allotted to them; the
character and size of the business enterprise, its capital structure, past
history and earnings and financial statements certified by independent
accountants; underwriters' commissions; payments to promoters made
within 2 years or intended to be made; acquisitions of property not in
the ordinary course of business, and the interest of directors, officers
and principal stockholdlers therein; pending or threatened legal
proceedings; and the purpose to which the proceeds of the offering are
to be applied. The registration statement of a foreign government
must contain comparable information in regard to the underwriting
and distribution of the securities being registered, the natural and
industrial resources of the country, its revenues, obligations and expenses, a description of the securities being registered, and similar
matters. The prospectus constitutes a part of the registration statement and presents the more important of the required disclosures.
Examination Procedure

The staff of the Division of Corporation Finance examines each
registration statement for compliance with the standards of accurate
and adequate disclosure and usually notifies the registrant by an informal letter of comment of any material respects in which the statement appears to fail to conform to those requirements. The regisrant is thus afforded an opportunity to file a curative amendment.
In addition, the Commission has power, after notice and opportunity
for hearing, to issue a "stop order" suspending the effectiveness of a
registration statement. In certain cases, such as where a registration
statement is so deficient as to indicate a willful or irresponsible failure
to make adequate disclosure, no letter of comment is sent and the
Commission either institutes an investigation to determine whether
stop-order proceedings should be instituted or immediately institutes
stop-order proceedings. Information about the use of this stop-order
power during 1959 appears below under "Stop Order Proceedings."
Time Required to Complete Registration

Because prompt examination of a registration statement is important to industry, the Commission completes its analysis as promptly
as possible. Congress provided for 20 days in the ordinary case
between the filing date of a registration statement or of an amendment thereto and the time it may become effective. This waiting
period is designed to provide investors with an opportunity to become familiar with the proposed offering. Information disclosed in

28

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the registration statement is disseminated during the waiting period
by means of the preliminary form of prospectus. The Commission
is empowered to accelerate the effective date so as to shorten the
20-day waiting period where the facts justify such action. In exercising this power, the Commission is required to take into account
the adequacy of the information respecting the issuer theretofore
available to the public, the facility with which investors can understand the nature of and the rights conferred by the securities to be
registered, and their relationship to the capital structure of the
issuer, and the public interest and the protection of investors. The
note to rule 460 under the act indicates, for the information of interested persons, some of the more common situations in which the Commission believes that the statute generally requires it to deny acceleration of the effective date of a registration statement.
The number of calendar days which elapsed from the date of .filing
to the effective date of the median registration statement with respect to the 925 1 registration statements that became effective during
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1959, was 28. The number of such
calendar days in the 1958 and 1957 fiscal years was 24 and 23,
respectively.
These 28 calendar days for the median registration statement in
the 1959 fiscal year were divided among the three principal stages
of the registration process as follows:
(a) from the date of filing the registration statement to the date
of the staff's letter of comment, 17 days;
(b) from the date of the staff's letter of comment to the date of
filing the first material amendment after such letter, 6 days;
and
(c) from the date of filing the first material amendment after
the staff's letter of comment to the effective date of registration, 5 days. Holidays as well as Saturdays and Sundays
are included in these numbers of days.
The increase in elapsed time is a reflection of the substantial increase in the number of registration statements filed, as indicated
below, and of the fact that a large number of these statements related
to new or unseasoned ventures which required relatively more time
and effort in making an appropriate review.

COMMISSION

Securities to be sold for cash for account of the issuer amounted
to $12.1 billion in 1959, a decrease of $1.2 billion over the previous
year. This reflects a 23 percent decrease, about $1.6 billion, in the
volume of debt securities, partially offset by a small incre-ase in the
volume of common stock. Debt securities made up $5.3 billion of
the 1959 volume, preferred stock $400 million and common stock $6.4
billion. Investment company securities showed a sharp increase in
1959 and accounted for 60 percent of the total for common stock
compared with less than one-half in fiscal 1958.
The number of statements, total amounts registered, and a classification by type of security for issues to be sold for cash for account
of the issuing company is shown for each of the fiscal years 1935
through 1959 in appendix table 1. ~fore detailed information for
1959is given in appendix table 2, while 5-year summaries of such information for the 25-year period appear in part II of appendix table 1.
The amount of securities registered by investment companies increased almost 50 percent in 1959 over the previous year while that
registered by communication companies decreased 80 percent. Among
the smaller groups, the trade group aggregate showed an outstanding
increase. Securities classified by industry, registered for cash sale

RESULTS OBTAINED BY THE REGISTRATION PROCESS

The staff's examination of registration statements often results
in significant changes being effected in order that adequate disclosure
will be made to the investing public. These changes cover a wide
range of subject matters. Examples of disclosures made as a result
of the staff's examination are set forth below.
Disclosure of Speculative Features

A registrant organized to produce electronic equipment filed a
registration statement for 175,000shares of common stock (par value of
75~per share) to be offered at $5 a share, the underwriting commission
to be $1 per share. Examination of the registration statement revealed that certain speculative features of the proposed offering had
not been adequately disclosed.
The prospectus, as filed, stated that the book value of the company's
shares prior to the offering was approximately 96 cents but that after
the offering it would be approximately $1.86per share. The registrant
was required to include a further statement that such increase would
be contributed by the public investors. The registrant was further
required to disclose that the underwriters at a total cost of $75 had
acquired 75,000 shares of the company's stock representing 15 percent
of the total amount of such stock to be outstanding, whereas if all
of the shares offered were sold, public investors would pay $875,000
for 35 percent of the stock to be outstanding.
The company was also required to point out in the prospectus that:
(1) it proposes to operate in fields where large expenditures for research and development are considered normal and necessary; (2)
competition is intense, there being many companies, some with substantially greater resources than the registrant, conducting research
and development work in the same general areas; (3) because of
research and development work being done, it is possible that one or
more of the registrant's proposed products may became obsolete before

TWENTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

33

production is started or at any time thereafter; and (4) only actual
production can determine the cost at which any of registrant's proposed products can be produced and only marketing can determine
the prices at which they can be sold and the extent of the demand for
them.
Disclosure as to Use of Proceeds

.A company engaged in the business of acquiring and developing
oil and gas properties filed a registration statement covering $1,500,000
of 6 percent convertible debentures due 1969, to be offered initially to
its stockholders by means of subscription rights. The underwriter
agreed that within 6 business days after the termination of the rights
offering it would purchase or find purchasers for debentures not taken
down by stockholders so that the company would receive the proceeds
from at least $400,000 principal amount of debentures. The underwriter also agreed to use its best efforts for 60 days after the termination of the rights offering to find purchasers for debentures not taken
down by stockholders .
.As originally filed, the prospectus indicated that the great bulk of
the net proceeds was to be used for acquisition of new properties and
development of properties then held. However, an analysis made by
our staff of the financial position of the company and its future cash
needs disclosed that the company was in a precarious cash position,
that on the basis of the prior year's operations cash requirements
during the next 18 months would be substantially in excess of the
amount of cash that would be generated during that period and that
therefore the purpose of the offering was not to acquire and develop
properties, but to remedy the company's serious financial situation .
.As a result of numerous comments made by the staff, the prospectus
was extensively revised and there was set forth in the forepart thereof,
a one and one-half page statement regarding the proposed offering
and the company's financial problems, including the following categorical statements :
1. The purpose of the offering was to alleviate the company's
shortage of working capital;
2. The company had a working capital deficit of $488,635;
3. Current liabilities included $87,835 of notes payable given for
past due accounts payable;
4. Past due accounts payable and past due notes payable amounted
to $256,572 and $86,335 respectively;
5. The total amount of funds required to remedy the working capital deficit and retire long term debt maturing within the next 18
months was $1,195,204;
6. Since, on the basis of the previous year's financial report, the
company's operations would generate only $335,000 of cash during

34

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the next 18 months, cash requirements would exceed cash generated
by $860,000;
7. The minimum principal amount of debentures required to be
sold to meet the company's present and anticipated cash needs was
$1,050,000;
8. Past due accounts and notes payable which might not be paid if
sufficient funds were not realized through sale of the debentures
might be enforced through legal proceedings;
9. No priority would be accorded the debenture holders as to principal or interest vis-a-vis other general creditors in the event the
company's cash needs were not met through the sale of debentures or
otherwise.
'While a skilled financial analyst, after study and analysis, might
have been able to deduce some of the information set forth above,
none of the statements recited was contained in the prospectus as
originally filed. It is fair to assume that the average investor would
have been materially misled by the prospectus as originally filed.
Revision of Summary of Earnings

A corporation which had both domestic and foreign subsidiaries
filed a registration statement containing financial statements which
failed to reflect significant losses from the operations of one of the
foreign subsidiaries. After our staff determined this fact during the
course of the examination procedures and discussed it with the corporation's representatives, the financial statements were appropriately
amended to include provisions for the foreign subsidiary's losses.
The effect of such revision was to reduce net income for 1956, 1957,
and 1958by approximately $164,000,$88,000,and $10,000respectively.
After this revision net income per share for the 3 years was $0.06,
$0.04 and $0.09 per share, or reductions of approximately 76, 70, and
10 percent, respectively.
Disclosure as to Operations

A company engaged in the development and production of certain
electronic equipment filed a registration statement covering 240,000
shares of common stock at the par value of 75 cents a share. The offering price was $6 per share and the underwriting commission was
$1 a share. In reviewing the registration statement it was noted that
the proposed offering was to be made on an extremely high priceearnings ratio and price-book-value ratio. Accordingly the registrant was required to amend the prospectus to state that the price of
the shares being offered had been arbitrarily determined by the board
of directors and did not bear any relationship to assets or earnings of
the company. It was further required to be pointed out that the
offering price was 312 times the unaudited earnings per share for the
last fiscal year and 13.2 times the net tangible book value on the basis
of the company's balance sheet.

TWENTY-FIFTH

35

ANNUAL REPORT

With respect to the company's operations, the company was required to state in regard to one of its lines of business that it had at
all times operated substantially below production capacity and that
during a recent month, for example, it operated at about 7.5 percent
of such capacity, leaving 92.5 percent of its capacity idle. The company was further required to point out that it had not yet engaged
regularly in the production of certain machinery for commercial use
and had no assurance as to the size of the market for such machinery
or the acceptability of the company's products in such market.
STOP ORDER PROCEEDINGS

Section 8 (d) provides that if it appears to the Commission at any
time that a registration statement contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
the Commission may institute proceedings looking to the issuance of a
stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement.
Where such an order is issued, the offering cannot lawfully be made,
or continued if it has already begun, until the registration statement
has been amended to cure the deficiencies and the Commission has
lifted the stop order.
The following table indicates the number of proceedings under section 8 (d) of the act pending at the beginning of the 1959 fiscal year,
the number initiated during the year, the number terminated and the
number pending at the end of the year:

Shortly after the end of the fiscal year stop orders were issued in

and a third proceeding was dismissed. The two proceedings in which
stop orders were issued are included in the proceedings described
below.
Comico Corporation.-Comico
Corporation is a Delaware corporation organized in 1957 for the purpose of exploiting a deposit
of silica material located in Arkansas and held under a leasehold assigned to the company by its promoters. The company filed a registration statement covering a proposed public offering of 750,000
shares of common stock at $2 per share. The Commission instituted
lOne of these proceedings, Woodland Oil & Gas Co. Ine., was described in the Commission's 24th Annual Report, p. 40.
1i29i5~

36

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

investigative hearings to determine whether a stop order should issue.
Following these hearings and prior to the effective date of the registration statement the Commission instituted stop order proceedings.
Prior to the institution of the stop order proceedings, the registrant
filed an application for withdrawal of the registration statement which
was denied by the Commission.
The registration statement contained a lengthy and optimistic discussion of the uses and markets for the minerals in the registrant's
leasehold. The Commission found this statement materially misleading, among other things, because it was not based upon any factual engineering or market survey. The Commission found that the
registration statement was also misleading for failure to disclose prior
unsuccessful attempts to develop the property leased by the registrant
and for failure to fully and adequately disclose the proposed use of the
proceeds of the offering, the compensation to underwriters and the
interests of management in transactions with the registrant. Moreover, the registration statement failed to indicate clearly that the
management would receive 660,000 shares of the registrant's stock
for $25,000, whereas the public would be asked to pay $1,500,000 for
750,000 shares. Other deficiencies included the failure to disclose
the provisions of the lease and the obligation to pay unusually high
royalties, and the failure to set forth clearly in one place the speculative feature of the registrant's business and securities. The Commission issued a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement,"
Diversified Oil and Mining Corporation.- This company was organized as a spin-off from Shawano Development Corporation and
engaged principally in the acquisition of interests in and the operation of oil and gas properties. It filed a registration statement covering a proposed public offering of 2,500,000 shares of $1 par 6 percent
convertible, noncumulative, preferred stock, and warrants to purchase
at $2 per share 500,000 shares of the company's 10 cent par common
stock. The securities were to be offered in units of 25 shares of preferred stock and 5 warrants at a price of $25.50 per unit.
The statement of matters to be considered at the hearing in a stop
order proceedings challenged the adequacy and accuracy of the information disclosed in the registration statement in numerous respects, including information given with respect to the proposed plan
of distribution, the use of the proceeds, the description of the business
and securities of the registrant, transactions with the promoters and
possible liabilities for the previous sale of unregistered securities.
Prior to the commencement of the hearing, the registrant submitted a
stipulation in which it waived a hearing and the post-hearing procedures provided for in the Commission's rules of practice and con• Securities Act Release No. 4050 (Apr. 27, 1959).

Fort Pierce Port & Terminal Company.-This
company was organized in 1956 primarily for the purpose of acquiring harbor front
property at Fort Pierce, Fla., to be developed and operated as a deepwater port facility. The company filed a registration statement covering a proposed public offering of 2,138,500 shares of its $1 par common stock at $1.25 per share.
The company's properties, consisting of 3,000 feet of harbor front
and certain other properties on nearby Causeway Island and on the
mainland, were acquired by promoters of the company (including
Joseph C. Mackey, board chairman, and H. A. Ramsey, president)
with the intention of selling them to the company. The promoters'
cost was $155,000 in cash and the assumption of mortgages aggregating $608,750. The properties were transferred to the company at an
appraised value of $1,838,500, the company assuming the $608,750 of
mortgages and issuing $1,229,500 par value of stock to the promoters.
Subsequently, the company acquired 64.4 acres of submerged lands
from the State of Florida for $3,220.
Various references in the prospectus to the appraised value of the
company's properties were questioned by the Commission's staff including the $430,000 appraised value of the property acquired from
the State of Florida for $3,220. According to the staff there appeared
to be a lack of adequate basis for the values determined by the appraisal. The properties acquired from the promoters were carried in
the company's balance sheet at the appraised valuation ($1,838,250)
contrary to generally accepted accounting principles, and the prospectus failed to contain proper disclosures with respect, among other
things, to (1) the competitive traffic situation in relation to the port
development project, including the results of a study of the facilities
made in 195'7 by the U.S. Army Engineers; and (2) the speculative
feature of the proposed offering. The Commission instituted stop
order proceedings with respect to the registration statement.'
Prior to completion of the proceedings, the company filed an application for withdrawal of the registration statement.
In its application the company conceded "certain inaccurate statements of material facts and certain omissions of material facts" and agreed that
correction would be made in any new registration statement which
might be filed by the registrant, although the company stated that it
did not intend to proceed with its stock offering at that time. The
Commission concluded that withdrawal would not be inconsistent

with the public interest and the protection of investors and consented
to the withdrawal of the registration statement,"
Funeral Directors Manufacturing and Supply Company.-This
registrant was organized in Kentucky in 1954 for the purpose of
manufacturing plastic grave vaults and plastic and aluminum caskets.
It filed a registration statement covering a proposed offering of 199,907 shares of the registrant's common stock at $100 per share. The
registration statement represented that registrant owned no property
but that, depending on the success of the offering, it intended to purchase or construct warehouses and plants and factories.
The Commission found that the registration statement contained
material misstatements and omissions of material facts with respect
to the state of the development work necessary to effect volume production of the registrant's products and failed to disclose the length
of time it would take to effect full production. The registration
statement also failed to list two officers employed by the registrant
and stated that the remuneration to be paid registrant's officers had
not been determined or authorized when, as a matter of fact, such
remuneration had been authorized and the registrant had incurred
a substantial contingent indebtedness to its officers. The registration statement also stated that there were no agreements to recompense any promoter for past or future services when, in fact, registrant was indirectly indebted to a promoter, who was the president
of the registrant, for accrued rents, utilities, and services.
A post-effective amendment to the registration statement not only
failed to correct the previously existing deficiencies but was itself deficient in additional material respects.
At the close of the case presented by the Commission's staff, the
registrant admitted that the disclosures made in the registration statement and in the post-effective amendment were inadequate and that
material events and changes which had occurred since the statement
became effective were not disclosed in the post-effective amendment.
The registrant consented to the issuance of a stop order by the
Commission,"
Industro Transistor Corporation.- The registrant was organized in New York in December 1953 and engaged in the manufacture
and sale of transistors. It filed a registration statement in 1958 covering a proposed public offering of 135,000 shares of lO-cent par value
common stock and, in addition, 36,000 transferable 5-year warrants
for the purchase of 1 share of common stock per warrant and the

pending the effectiveness of the registration statement.
.Among the
deficiencies found to exist are those described below.
The prospectus failed to contain an adequate and accurate statement with respect to the volume of the registrant's production, the
amount of sales to the customers listed in the prospectus, the registrant's competitive position in the industry and the nature of its sales
and distribution arrangements.
The financial statements included in
the prospectus were not prepared in accordance with the Commission's requirements and good accounting practice. For example, sales
returns were not shown as a deduction from sales but were treated as
purchases of raw material.
The income statement showed a net profit
from operations for a 4-month period of over $17,000 whereas, if it
had been properly prepared, it would have shown a substantial loss.
The prospectus failed to disclose that the compensation of the
underwriter included the difference between the exercise price of the
36,000 warrants which the underwriter was to receive and the market
price of the stock. The prospectus was also misleading in stating
that the underwriter was to pay 1 cent for each warrant, whereas it
does not appear that any arrangement was made for such payment, in
addition, the prospectus failed to state the possible adverse effect upon
the registrant and its security holders of the granting of warrants to
the underwriter and to certain other persons, and to state adequately
and accurately the purposes for which proceeds from the sale of the
securities were to be used.
The Commission issued a stop order suspending the registration
statement shortly after the end of the fiscal year." Subsequently, the
registrant amended the registration statement to make appropriate
disclosure in accordance with the Commission's decision and the Commission lifted its stop order, thus permitting the registration statement to become effective,"
Managed Funds Incorporated.-The
registrant, an open-end management type investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, was organized under the laws of Delaware in
1946. The promoters were Hilton H. Slayton, Hovey E. Slayton, and
Thomas W. Ruth. Hilton Slayton was president and a director, and
Hovey Slayton was a vice president and a director, of the registrant.
The registrant filed a registration statement under the Securities Act
of 1933 in 1954 and subsequently registered additional securities by
amendment as permitted by section 24( e) of the Investment Company
Act. The Commission instituted proceedings under the Securities Act
to determine whether a stop order should issue suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement.

• Securities Act Release No. 4120 (July 24,1959).

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

The proceedings developed the fact that although Slayton Associates, Inc., all of the voting stock of which was owned by Hilton and
Hovey Slayton, was under contract with the registrant to act as its
investment advisor and had been paid for such services, it had entered
into a contract with Stephen :M:. Jaquith, a registered representative
of a brokerage firm, under which Jaquith was to perform the services
of investment advisor for the registrant. For his services, Jaquith
and his firm received substantial compensation in the form of commissions on securities transactions. A portion of these commissions
were, at the direction of Hilton Slayton, credited to two other individual's, one his brother-in-law and the other a director of the registrant and the Slayton's former attorney. This contract with J aquith was not disclosed in the registration statement nor had it been
approved by the stockholders of the registrant as required by the
Investment Company Act.
The record showed that the board of directors gave scant attention
to the management of the registrant; made no effort to be informed
concerning registrant's policies and whether such policies were being
followed; made no decisions concerning purchases and sales of portfolio securities and generally permitted the registrant to be managed
by the Slay tons without consultation with or approval by the board
as a whole. None of this was disclosed in the registration statement.
The prospectus represented that the operations of the registrant were
under the supervision and direction of its board of directors and
failed to point out that the Slay tons were assuming the functions of
the board of directors in directing the operations of the registrant.
The prospectus represented that the principal objective of the registrant was capital growth, that such investment policy would result
in normal turnover of portfolio securities and that dividends would
be paid quarterly based on the receipt of income or profits on securities held. These representations were materially misleading since the
registrant did not follow the stated policies but instead followed the
policy of investment for the purpose of providing a flow of cash to
its stockholders at a high uniform rate and engaged in a policy of
excessive portfolio turnover.
The prospectus was also misleading in failing to disclose that the
registrant's policy of realizing capital gains for the purpose of making
quarterly distributions to shareholders was deleterious to the position
of the shareholders in several respects. First, it required a high rate
of portfolio turnover which resulted in the payment of large amounts
of brokerage commissions and the payment of higher prices on the
repurchase of identical securities immediately after their sale. Second,
it further reduced the invested capital of shareholders who reinvested
their distributions, since a sales load was charged on such reinvestment. Third, it did not take into consideration whether proper

TWENTY-FIFTH

41

management would require the sale of securities in which net unrealized depreciation existed and thus avoid making distributions which
were taxable to shareholders. Fourth, as noted above, the policy of
distributing capital gains quarterly was not consistent with the objective of capital growth of the portfolio.
It was registrant's policy to place a portion of the orders for transactions in portfolio securities with broker-dealers who sold its shares.
Reciprocal business in the volume of eight or nine million dollars was
directed to approximately 36 dealers for the fiscal year ended November 30,1958. The Commission held that the prospectus should have
disclosed that brokerage transactions were directed to broker-dealers
who had sold shares of the registrant. In addition, the prospectus
should have disclosed that obligations for merchandise and services
rendered to the registrant's underwriters and investment advisors
were being satisfied by directing to the suppliers brokerage commissions on transactions in the portfolio securities of the registrant. These
disclosures should have accompanied the statements in the prospectus
of the amount of sales load reallowed to dealers to make these statements not misleading.
On the basis of the Commission's findings, a stop order was entered
shortly after the end of the fiscal year suspending the effectiveness
of the registration statement."
Mon-O-Co Oil Corporation.-Registrant,
a Montana corporation,
was organized in 1940 and engaged in the acquisition of oil and gas
leases and exploration for oil and gas. It filed a notification and offering circular under regulation A in March 1957 for the purpose of
obtaining an exemption from registration with respect to an offering
to its stockholders, pursuant to preemptive rights, of 4,000 stock units,
each unit consisting of one share of class A stock and 24 shares of class
B stock at $75 per unit and an offering of 14,474stock units in exchange
for certain working interests held by public investors. The Commission thereafter temporarily suspended the exemption. In July
1957, the registrant filed a registration statement covering the same
offering plus an additional offering of 4,000 stock units to the stockholders. Prior to the effective date of the registration statement, the
Commission instituted stop order proceedings which were consolidated
with proceedings to determine whether the order suspending the
regulation A exemption should be vacated or made permanent.
The Commission determined that the regulation A exemption should
be permanently suspended, on the grounds, among other things, that
the offering circular contained false and misleading statements of
material facts and that the amount of the offering exceeded the maximum amount of $300,000permitted for offerings under regulation A.
With respect to the stop order proceedings, the Commission found
• Securities Act Release No. 4122 (July 30,1959).

42

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

that the geologist's report included in the prospectus contained an
excessive estimate of recoverable reserves of oil, and that the registration statement was also materially deficient in the description of
the registrant's other properties, in stating the total estimated
expenses of the offering and in stating the purposes for which the
proceeds were to be used. It also found that the material in the prospectus was poorly organized and that much of the information contained in it was not presented in clear and understandable fashion.
Material relating to the same subject matter was scattered throughout
various sections of the prospectus, with the result that the ordinary
investor would have great difficulty in ascertaining the essential elements of the registrant's business and the merits of the proposed offering without referring to numerous portions of the prospectus and
making independent calculations and conclusions as to the facts. The
speculative features of the offering were not accurately and adequately
disclosed, and there were a number of other deficiencies in the registration statement.
The Commission refused to permit the registration statement to be
withdrawn and issued a stop order suspending its effectiveness."
Texas Glass Manufacturing Corporation.- The registrant, a
Texas corporation, was organized in 1952 to engage in the manufacture of window and heavy sheet crystal glass. The company's
only property consisted of a plant site in Bryan, Tex., donated by
that city and the deed for which was held in escrow contingent upon
the execution of a contract to construct a plant. The registrant filed
a registration statement in 1957 covering a proposed public offering
of 2,700,000 shares of its $1 par value common stock at $2 per share,
plus 300,000shares subject to certain options at $1 per share. Amendments were subsequently filed which, among other things, changed
the number of shares being registered. The Commission instituted
stop order proceedings with respect to the registration statement in
July 1957.
The Commission found that the registration statement contained
many deficiencies, some of which were highly material and some of
which, while relatively less important, were indicative of a genera]
lack of care in the preparation of the registration statement. Thus,
the registration statement contained materially misleading statements
with respect to the company's stage of development, the kind of glass
which it proposed to manufacture, the processes to be used in manufacturing glass, the source of raw materials and the nature of the
market for the registrant's products. For example, it was stated that
the company would produce its glass on machines and by methods
that are unique and less time consuming, whereas it appeared that the
10

TWENTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

43

machines and methods proposed to be used are those commonly known
and employed by the glass industry.
The registration statement indicated that certain previous sales of
the company's stock were exempt from registration under section
3 (a) (11) of the act, whereas it appeared that no exemption was available and that there was a contingent liability on the part of the company for such sales which liability was not reflected in the company's
financial statements. The prospectus also indicated that 80 percent
of the proceeds from the sale of the stock would be placed in an escrow
fund to be returned to investors should the company fail to raise
enough funds to carry out its plans, but no further information was
given with respect to the nature of any escrow agreement or the circumstances under which such fund would be returned to investors. The
prospectus also set forth statements with respect to costs applicable
to plant construction contracts without indicating that such contracts
had not yet been executed. The registration statement also included
hypothetical figures purporting to show production costs and revenues
for the proposed plant and setting forth a substantial figure as the
annual net profit, even though the company had not yet engaged in
any business. There were also other deficiencies in the disclosures
provided in the registration statement.
In view of the numerous and serious deficiencies in the registration
statement the Commission issued a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement.P
EXAMINATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission is authorized by section 8(e) of the act to make
an examination in order to determine whether a stop order proceeding should be instituted under section 8 (d). For this purpose the
Commission is empowered to subpoena witnesses and require the
production of pertinent documents. Six such examinations were
initiated during the 1959 fiscal year. None were pending from the
previous fiscal year. In two cases the examinations led to stop order
proceedings under section 8 (d) . Four examinations were pending
at the close of the fiscal year.
The Commission is also authorized by section 20 (a) of the act to
make an investigation to determine whether any provisions of the
act or of any rule or regulation prescribed thereunder have been or are
about to be violated. Investigations are instituted under this section
as an expeditious means of determining whether a registration statement is false or misleading or omits to state any material fact. The
following table indicates the number of such investigations with which
the Commission was concerned during the fiscal year.

EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION OF SMALL ISSUES

Under section 3(b) of the Securities Act, the Commission is empowered to exempt, by rules and regulations and subject to such terms
and conditions as it may prescribe therein, any class of securities from
registration under the act, if it finds that the enforcement of the
registration provisions of the act with respect to such securities is
not necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors by reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of the public offering. The statute imposes a maximum limitation of $300,000upon the size of the issues which may be exempted by
the Commission in the exercise of this power.
Acting under this authority the Commission has adopted the following exemptive regulations:
Regulation A:
General exemption for United States and Canadian issues up to
$300,000.
Regulation A-M :
Special exemption for assessable shares of stock of mining companies
up to $100,000.
Regulation A-R:
Special exemption for first lien notes up to $100,000.
Regulation B:
Exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights up
to $100,000.
Regulation B-T:
Exemption for interests in oil royalty trusts or similar types of trusts
or unincorporated association up to $100,000.
Regulation F :
Exemption for assessments on assessable stock and for assessable stock
offered or sold to realize amount of assessment thereon, up to
$300,000.'"

Under section 3(c) of the Securities Act, which was added by section 307(a) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, the Commission is authorized to adopt rules and regulations exempting
securities issued by a company which is operating or proposes to
operate as a small business investment company under the Small
Business Investment Act. During the fiscal year the Commission,
acting- pursuant to this authority, adopted a new regulation E, which
12

ANNUAL

REPORT

exempts upon certain terms and conditions limited amounts of securities, not in excess of $300,000, issued by any small business investment company which has received a license or a notice to proceed from
the Small Business Administration.
This regulation is substantially
similar to the one provided by regulation A under section 3 (b) of
the act.
Exemption from registration under section 3 (b) or 3 (c) of the act
does not carry any exemption from the civil liabilities for false and
misleading statements imposed by section 12(2) or from the criminal
liabilities for fraud imposed by section 17 of the act.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A

The Commission's regulation A permits a company to obtain not
exceeding $300,000 (including underwriting commissions) of needed
capital in any 1 year from a public offering of its securities without
registration if the company complies with the regulation.
Regulation A requires the filing of a notification with the appropriate
regional office of the Commission, supplying basic information about
the company, certain exhibits, and except in the case of a company
with an earnings history which is making an offering not in excess of
$50,000, an offering circular which is required to be used in offering
the securities.
During the 1959 fiscal year, 854 notifications were filed under regulation A, covering proposed offerings of $170,241,400, compared with
732 notifications covering proposed offerings of $133,889,109 in the
1958 fiscal year. Included in the 1959 total were 42 notifications
covering stock offerings of $9,460,253 with respect to companies
engaged in the exploratory oil and gas business and 59 notifications
covering offerings of $11,314,184 by mining companies.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Most of the offerings which were underwritten were made by commercial underwriters, who participated in 251 offerings in 1959, 185
offerings in 1958, and 252 offerings in 1957. The remaining cases
where commissions were paid were handled by officers, directors, or
other persons not regularly engaged in the securities business.
Suspension of Exemption

Regulation A provides for the suspension of an exemption thereunder where, in general, the exemption is sought for securities for
which the regulation provides no exemption or where the offering is
not made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the regulation or in accordance with prescribed disclosure standards. Following the issuance of a temporary suspension order by the Commission,
the respondents may request a hearing to determine whether the temporary suspension should be vacated or made permanent.
U no
hearing is requested within 30 days after the entry of the temporary
suspension order, and none is ordered by the Commission on its own
motion, the temporary suspension order becomes permanent.
During the 1959 fiscal year, temporary suspension orders were
issued in 87 cases as compared with 88 in the 1958 fiscal year. Of the
87 orders, 2 were later vacated. Requests for hearing were made in 26
cases. In 11 of such cases the requests were later withdrawn, and as
of June 30, 1959, the proceedings in the remaining 15 cases were still
pendingY The names of the companies involved in the orders issued
during the 1959 fiscal year 'are set forth in table 7 of the appendix.
As indicated in the 24th annual report, 11 cases were pending as of
June '30, 1958, in which a hearing was requested after a temporary
suspension order had been issued. In four of such cases the issuers
withdrew their hearing requests and consented to the entry of permanent suspension orders and in three cases permanent suspension orders were entered by the Commission after hearings. The remaining
four cases were pending on June 30, 1959.
Certain of the above cases are summarized below to illustrate the
misrepresentations and other noncompliance with the regulation which
led to the issuance of suspension orders.
Brookridge Development Corporation.-The
temporary suspension order alleged that the terms and conditions of regulation A were
not complied with in that the notification failed to disclose all sales
of unregistered securities by the issuer or any principal security
holder within one year prior to filing. It was asserted, moreover, that
the amount of securities proposed to be offered and the amount sold
during the past year in violation of section 5 of the act would exceed
the regulation A $300,000 limitation. It was also alleged that the
offering circular was materially misleading in failing to disclose:
.. Shortly after the end of the fiscal year, the suspension orders in three of these cases
were made permanent.

TWENTY-FIFTH

REPORT

47

(1) Options to which officers of the issuer were entitled; (2) security
holdings of the officers and directors; and (3) the effect of the
underwriter's participation in the market on the price of the issuer's
securities. In addition, the offering circular was alleged to be materially misleading in its inclusion of $176,478.86described as "Investment in Subsidiaries" in the December 31, 1958, consolidated balance
sheet, and by the inclusion in the consolidated income statement of
dividends received from subsidiaries. The Commission's order further
averred that the use of the offering circular without appropriate disclosure would be in violation of section 17 of the Securities Act of
1933. The issuer requested a hearing, but this request was subsequently withdrawn and the suspension order became permanent with
the lapse of time.
Empire Oil Corporation.- The order temporarily suspending the
regulation A exemption alleged that the terms and conditions of
regulation A had not been complied with in that escrow arrangements
for certain shares had not been made with an independent escrow
agent and information was not supplied as to the issuer's predecessors
and affiliates. Moreover, it was asserted, the offering circular was
materially misleading in failing to disclose information with respect
to the offering of securities for additional properties, the net production of crude oil and natural gas, estimated oil reserves, and
existing or threatened litigation against the issuer. Also, the offering
circular was alleged to be materially misleading in its use of appraisal
valuations. Violation of section 17 of the Securities Act, in addition,
was asserted. No hearing was requested, and the suspension order
became permanent with the lapse of time.
Florida National Development Corporation.- The temporary
suspension order alleged that the regulation A terms and conditions
had not been complied with in that, among other things, the $300,000
ceiling was exceeded and the issuer failed to disclose that one MacElrod was a promoter or predecessor, or both, of the issuer. The
issuer's offering circular was averred to be false and misleading in
its failure to disclose: (1) the exact amount paid for the issuer's
properties and whether such properties were acquired by the issuer
in arms-length transactions; (2) the facts surrounding certain brokerage commissions; (3) the circumstances concerning a $759,660
mortgage and note; and (4) the status of an option on 1,860 acres
of land. Further, the financial statements included in the offering
circular were materially misleading. The temporary suspension order
also asserted violation of section 17 of the Securities Act. No hearing
was requested and the temporary suspension order became permanent
with the lapse of time.
Gob Shops of America.-The Commission temporarily suspended
the regulation A exemption because it had reason to believe that the

48

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

issuer's notification failed to comply with the terms and conditions
of regulation A and that the offering circular contained false and
misleading statements concerning the market and the market price of
the stock and the underwriter's activities in the maintenance, domination and control of the market and market price of the stock. A
hearing was held at the issuer's request. The issuer moved to dismiss
the proceedings on the ground that its withdrawal had become effective and in the alternative requested that withdrawal be permitted,
asserting that its failings involved "inadvertent and empty infractions of technical rules or mistaken acts." The Commission held that
there was no right under the circumstances to withdrawal of a noti.fication and denied the motion to dismiss. The Commission concluded
that the omission to state that the price of the stock was artificially
inflated and that the market was not free and open was a serious
deficiency. Accordingly, the issuer's request for withdrawal was
denied and a permanent suspension order was entered by the
Commission.>
Inspiration Lead Company, Inc.-The
temporary suspension
order alleged numerous deficiencies in the issuer's offering circular
concerning, among other things, the issuer's past operations, are reserves, mining costs, and assets. A hearing was held pursuant to the
issuer's request. At the hearing the issuer conceded that the offering
circular was inadequate and incomplete in a number of respects, but
asserted that the deficiencies were the result of inadvertence and mistake and asked that it be permited to withdraw its filing for the
purpose of revision and correction. The Commission, however, found
the deficiencies and omissions to be serious and extensive. It stated,
"We have previously indicated that an opportunity to amend a de.ficient filing cannot be permitted to impair the required standards of
careful and honest filings or to encourage a practice of irresponsible
or deliberate submission of inadequate material to be followed by
correction of deficiencies found by our staff in its examination." The
Commission concluded that there was not such a showing of good
faith or other mitigating circumstances in connection with the deficiencies as to justify a further opportunity to present an adequate
tiling in lieu of a permanent suspension. The issuer's request for
withdrawal was denied and an order was issued permanently sus.
pending the exemption."
Macinar, Inc.-The
order of temporary suspension in this case
alleged that the notification failed to disclose that Automatic Table
Co. was an affiliate of the issuer; that it failed to disclose securities sold
by Paul Gaston, an affiliate; and that the $300,000regulation A ceiling
would have been exceeded by the offering. It was also averred that
the offering circular contained untrue statements of material facts

and failed to disclose required information concerning a note payable
in the sum of $17,400 held by the wife of the issuer's principal security holder. Moreover, there was a failure to set forth the issuer's
assumption of an affiliate's $12,854.82 note and to disclose all material
transactions of officers, directors, and controlling persons with the
issuer, its predecessors, and affiliates. The issuer filed a request for
hearing and a motion to vacate the temporary suspension order. Both
the request for hearing and the motion to vacate were subsequently
withdrawn and the temporary suspension order became permanent.
Sports Arenas (Delaware ) Inc.-The temporary suspension order
asserted that the issuer failed to disclose all promoters, controlling
persons and affiliates and their backgrounds; that the aggregate public
offering price of the securities and the aggregate gross proceeds actually received from the sale of securities to the public exceeded the
$300,000 regulation A limitation; that an offering circular was not
used in the offering of shares to the public; that certain sales material
was used which was not filed with the Commission; and that the issuer
failed to file a complete and accurate report of sales as required by
regulation A. The issuer's offering circular, in addition, was alleged
to be materially misleading in its failure to disclose the method of
offering, whereby the issuer's securities would be sold to the public
at a price higher than the $1.25 stated offering price, and to disclose
the profits of those participating in the distribution. Violation of
section 17 of the Securities Act was also alleged. No hearing was
requested and the suspension order became permanent.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1959, 160 offering sheets were
filed pursuant to regulation B and were examined by the Oil and Gas
Section of the Commission's Division of Corporation Finance. During the 1958 fiscal year, 109 offering sheets were filed and during the
1957 fiscal year, 133 were filed. The following table indicates the
nature and number of Commission orders issued in connection with
such filings during the fiscal years 1957-59. The balance of the offering sheets filed became effective without order.

Reports of sales.-The Commission requires persons who make
offerinzs under regulation B to file reports of the actual sales made
pursuant to that regulation. The purpose of these reports is to aid
the Commission in determining whether violations of law have occurred in the marketing of such securities. The following table shows

LITIGATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

The Commission is authorized by the Securities Act to seek injunctions in cases where continued or threatened violations of the act are
indicated. Many such actions were brought by the Commission
during the past year. Generally these involved violations of both
the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the act.
Litigation Involving Violations of the Registration and Anti-Fraud Provisions

Among the more important of such litigation was a complex of
four cases involving the sale of common stock of General Oil and
Industries, Inc. in violation of the registration and anti-fraud provisions. The company was originally organized in 1931 under the
name of Pacific Gold Placers, Inc. All of its stock was issued prior
to July 27, 1933, the effective date of the Securities Act. In 1958
the company was purchased by one Sidney B. Josephson, who changed
its name, and increased the capitalization by 2 million shares. Thereafter, the complaints alleged, Josephson, a defendant in all of the
cases, caused many of these unregistered shares to be sold in interstate commerce to the public by means of various misrepresentations.
The Commission brought suits against A. G. Bellin Securities Corp.,"
Stratford Securities Co., Inc.,17 Phoenix Securities Corp.," Stanley
Brown," registered broker-dealers, and numerous individual defendants, along with Josephson, to enjoin the sale of these securities.
Orders of preliminary injunction have been entered in the first two
cases for violation of the registration provisions, and the cases set
for hearings."

Two cases involved the sale of Canadian Javelin Limited stock in
violation of both the antifraud and registration provisions of the act.
In the first case," the Commission brought suit against Canadian
Javelin, European Fiduciary Corp., and various officers and employees of these corporations. The complaint charged the defendants with
selling the securities by telephone and through the mails in the United
States without filing a registration statement. It further charged
that the securities were being sold by concealing the identity of the
sellers, the consideration being paid to the brokers and dealers for
recommending the securities, and also by misrepresenting their value.
The corporations and three of the defendants consented to entry of
final judgment enjoining further sales." In the second case," a U.S.
investment adviser and an associate were charged with similar violations in the sale of Canadian Javelin. A permanent injunction was
entered against them by consent.
In another case involving the sale of Canadian securities in this
country,24the Commission charged Philip Newman Associates, a registered broker-dealer, with selling securities of the Monarch Asbestos
Co., Ltd., through the mails and by telephone to persons in the United
States without filing a registration statement. The Newman firm
and its officers were also charged with misrepresenting the securities
with respect to the value of the stock and the business expectations
of the company. A permanent injunction was entered against the
Newman firm and its officers and employees by consent, and a preliminary injunction was granted as to Monarch Asbestos and others
by default.
In S.E.O. v. L08 Angeles T1'U8tDeed and Mortgage Exchange et al.,
264 F. 2d 190 (C.A. 9, 1959), the district court granted the Commission's motion for a preliminary injunction and the appointment of a
receiver in an action brought by the Commission based on violations
of the registration and fraud provisions of the Securities Act and
the Securities Exchange Act in connection with the sale of trust deeds
on individual parcels of property. See the 24th Annual Report at
pages 51-52 for a discussion of the district court action. The judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,
which did not reach the issue of whether the trust deeds constituted
securities. It felt that this question, as well as others, including the
matter of the appointment of a receiver, should await trial on the
merits, particularly since the Court believed that certain procedural
errors had occurred on the hearing. Accordingly, the Court remanded the case for trial, and trial was pending at the end of the
fiscal year.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

As in past years, many cases involved fraud in the sale of securities of mining companies. In SE.O. v. Gotham Securities 25 the
Commission's complaint charged the defendants with fraud in the
sale of Saskalon Uranium and Oil, Ltd. common stock. The purchasers were told that they would "reap rich rewards," that the shares
would be listed on a national exchange, and that the company was
about to pay a dividend. A permanent injunction was entered against
the defendants by consent.
Permanent injunctions were also entered against the Lincoln Securities COrp.26and its officers and salesmen, for fraud in the sale of
shares of Shoreland Mines, Ltd., a Canadian mining company. Judgment was entered upon consent of defendants. In S.E.O. v. Del
Marva Oil and Gas, et al.21 a final judgment was entered by consent
against five oil and gas companies and their controlling stockholders.
The judgment permanently enjoined defendants from making misleading statements of the value of mining properties, the ownership
of leases, the probability of discovery of oil, etc. In S.E.O. v, Scott
Taylor and 00., Inc.28 a temporary restraining order has been issued
to restrain the sale of shares of Atomic Mining Corp., a Canadian
corporation, pending a hearing of the case. A temporary restraining
order has also been issued in S.E.O. v, Webster Securities 00rp.2'iI to
restrain sales of stock of Goldfield Mines Co. of Nevada. In S.E.O.
v, Gravity Science Foundation, et al.,so the complaint charged defendant with selling investment contracts and undivided interests in
oil and gas leases without registering under the Securities Act. Vari0us misrepresentations concerning the operations of the company were
also alleged to have been made. The Commission moved against the
sale and offering of investment contracts without registration in
S.E.O. v. The Donna-June 00.81 Inthis case the investment contracts
were represented by limited partnership interests plus a profit-sharing
agreement. In both cases, a permanent injunction was ordered with
consent of defendants.
Two important cases involved failure of defendants to meet the
prospectus requirements of the 1933 act. In S.E.O. v, North American Finance 00.,82 the complaint charged defendant with offering for
sale 500,000 shares of common stock by transmitting through the mails
a prospectus which did not meet the statutory requirements. The
Commission alleged, among other things, that numerous misrepresentations were made as to the value of the shares, that the Commis.. U.S.D.C. S.D.N.Y. No. 886-58 •

sion had approved the price at which the securities were being sold,
and that the stock was insured. The case is particularly significant in
that it is the first to hold that a prospectus does not meet the requirements of section 10(a) of the Securities Act if the financial statements therein represent that an accountant is independent when in
fact he is not. A permanent injunction was entered upon consent of
defendants. A permanent injunction was entered against Universal
Drilling Co., Inc. and its president, Louis J. Roussel 33 restraining
defendants from transmitting any prospectus relating to the sale of
common stock in Universal until the prospectus met the requirements
of the Securities Act. Counsel for these defendants informed the
court of their intention to make an offer of rescission to customers
who purchased the stock from the defendants J. H. Lederer Co., Inc.
and Jean R. Veditz Co., Inc., registered broker-dealers. The court
continued the restraining order previously entered against the latter,
to prevent dissipation of funds until determination of the Commission's application for appointment of a receiver. A permanent injunction was also entered by consent in S.E.C. v, Universal Service
Corp.34for violation, inter alia, of the prospectus provisions.
A permanent injunction by consent was entered against the VariPao Corporation for numerous fraudulent representations in violation
of the 1933 act.'5 In a companion case, the Commission later succeeded in obtaining a permanent injunction against the defendant
I. B. Morton & Co., InC.36 for violation of the antifraud provisions of
the 1933 act and the registration provisions pertaining to broker-dealers in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Two other dealers in
Vari-Pac stock were also enjoined from making further offers or sales.
In S.E.C. v, O.T.C. Enterprises, Inc. the defendants were offering
shares in a company purportedly developing a spaceship to fly through
the universe utilizing "free energy." A public inaugural flight of the
prototype at Oklahoma City, scheduled for April 19, 1959, failed to
materialize. Otis T. Carr, president of the company, publicly announced that a space craft designed by him would be constructed in
which a flight to the moon would ba made on December 7, 1959, returning to earth on December 15, 1959. In addition to selling shares
to hundreds of investors, the promoters obtained additional income by
selling plans for the spaceship and toy models at prices ranging from
$5 to $10 a piece, and by organizing groups to study unidentified
flying objects. They also attempted to promote a Space City, to be
located near Washington, D.C., and to maintain direct contact with
communities on other planets and stars. At least half a million dollars was obtained from hundreds of investors. Final judgment was

enjoined were: S.E.O. v. General Associates, Inc.,ss S.E.O. v, The

In S.E.O. v, Aruida Oorporation 45 the Commission's complaint
charged two broker-dealers with violation of section 5(c) of the
Securities Act prohibiting public offerings of securities before the
filing of a registration statement. In enjoining any further violation,
the court held that the issuance of a press release giving a number of
facts concerning the development of Arvida Corporation and the
proposed stock offering, and the convening of a press conference
at which additional facts were given, including the proposed price,
constituted an offer to sell within the meaning of the act and was in
violation of the act because a registration statement covering the
securities offered had not been filed with the Commission. Judgment
was entered upon consent of defendants. In related broker-dealer
proceedings (see p. 103, infra) the Commission also concluded that
defendants had violated the registration provisions of the 1933 act
willfully, but held that no sanction was required in the public interest
under the particular circumstances of the case. Securities Exchange
Act Release No. 5870 (February 9, 1959). After the institution of
these proceedings a registration statement was filed and became
effective.
In a case still pending," the Commission has brought suit to enjoin
John Addison, Niles White, White, Green & Addison Associates, Inc.,
Trans-world Mining Corporation, Murchison Ventures, Inc., and
numerous individual officers and employees, from further violating
the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, and to enjoin
the defendants, their banks and depositories from dissipating or disbursing the assets or funds of these defendants, and particularly the
sum of $146,625found in a suitcase left by Addison in a public carrier
terminal. The Commission's complaint charges that since 1955 the

mineral rights, by use of the mails and in interstate commerce, without having first registered with the Commission. In a supporting
affidavit filed with the complaint, it was alleged that Addison and his
associates obtained loans from approximately 400 individuals in 23
States, the total of such loans amounting to nearly $1 million. A
preliminary injunction has been entered and the sum of $146,625 ordered impounded in the registry of the Court pending a hearing on the

In the Hillsborough case, supra, the court granted a preliminary
injunction against defendants Hillsborough Investment Corporation
and Roger Mara, its manager. The defendant corporation, incorporated in New Hampshire, advertised in the newspapers, offering
to sell its stock to New Hampshire residents. A few advertisements
contained no such limitation. About a dozen sales were made to
nonresidents, in some cases after being held in the name of a resident
for 30 days. Defendants resisted the motion for a temporary injunction on the ground that a small number of interstate sales, where no
future interstate sales were contemplated, should not take the issue
out of the intrastate exemption contained in section 3(a) (11) of the
1933 act. The court held that even a single sale to a nonresident,
whether directly or through the device of selling to a resident intermediary, destroyed the exemption as to the whole issue, and required
registration in order to make future sales to residents.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The Mono-Kearsage Oonsolidated Mining Oompany case, supra,
was an action by the Commission to enjoin sales of that company's
stock without registration by broker-dealers and others who had received the stock from transferees of the company who were in control of the company. The defendants contended that they did not
know of the control relationship.
The Court, in granting an injunction, held that defendants were underwriters within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, that the term "underwriter" includes anyone who purchases from a person directly or indirectly controlling an
issuer, or in common control with the issuer, with a view to public
distribution of the securities of the issuer, that the defendants were to
be held to have knowledge of those facts which they could obtain upon
reasonable inquiry. The Court said further:
Probably the facts directly known by them were sufficient to acquaint them
with the true situation.
If not, they were sufficient to impose upon them the
duty of making further inquiry. Under the circumstances, they were not entitled
to rely solely on the self-serving statements of Pennington and the other Canadians denyiug those facts which would have indicated that they were representing controlling persons, or were under common control with an issuer. With
all these red flags warning the dealer to go slowly, he cannot with Impunity
ignore them and rush blindly on to reap a quick proflt. He cannot close his eyes
to obvious signals which if reasonably heeded would convince him of, or lead
him to, the facts and thereafter succeed on the claim that no express notice
of those facts was served upon him. 167 F. Supp. 248, 259 (D. Utah, 1958).
Litigation Relating to SlOP Order Proceedings

In Oolumbia General Investment 00. v. S.E.0.,58 the Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed a Commission stop order pursuant to section 8 (d) of the Securities Act suspending the effectiveness
of Columbia's registration statement and denying Columbia's application for withdrawal prior to the effective date of the registration
statement.
Relying on Jones v. S.E.O., 298 U.S. 1 (1936), Columbia
contended that the request for withdrawal divested the Commission
of jurisdiction to issue the stop order. In upholding the Commission's
order, the Court distinguished the Jones case on the fact that in the
instant case 1,800 members of the public held 63,000 shares of the same
class of securities covered by the registration statement.
The Court
noted that these stockholders and members of the investing public who
might trade in these securities are proper subject of the official concern
of the Commission. Moreover, the Court stated that since Jones a
significant change in the law had taken place and it could no longer
be said, as it was in Jones, that withdrawal was the concern of the
registrant alone. Under the 1954 amendments to the act a registrant
may now make offers to sell after filing but before registration.
The

Court ruled that, if a registrant has an unfettered right to withdraw
under these conditions, then the machinery of the Commission could
easily be employed as an instrument of fraud. The Court rejected
Columbia's contentions that the filing of a substantive amendment
terminates, for the purposes of stop order proceedings, the legal
significance of the original registration statement.
Participation as Amicus Curiae

In Woodward v. Wright, 266 F. 2d 108 (C.A. 10, 1959), the Commission filed a brief amicus curiae in an appeal from a judgment for
the defendant-sellers of an undivided interest in oil and gas rights.
The action was based on the civil liability provisions of section 12
of the Securities Act, and while the lower court found that the sellers'
prospectus contained a material false statement, it barred recovery
since the purchasers had failed to show their reliance on the misrepresentation. After concluding that the contract of sale conveyed
fractional undivided interests in oil and gas and hence securities, the
Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case to the district court
on the ground that the evidence brought the appellants within the
liability provisions of section 12(2). The court rejected the district
court's ruling and agreed with the Commission's position that Congress did not impose upon a plaintiff the burden of proving reliance
as a condition of recovery under section 12(2). The court refused
to permit recovery under section 12(1) holding on the particular facts
that a public offering had not been made.
In 07'e8well-Keith, Ina. v. Willingham, 264 F. 2d 76 (C.A. 8, 1959),
the Commission also filed a brief as amicus curiae. This was a private
suit wherein the plaintiff involved section 12(2) of the act to rescind
a commitment for securities claiming fraudulent misrepresentations
were made. The defendants filed motions for dismissal for want of
jurisdiction stating that neither the misrepresentations nor the delivery of the securities was made by use of the mails or interstate
commerce. The trial court upheld this contention; however this
holding was overruled on appeal where the court held, as urged by
the Commission, that the section 12(2) "remedy is available if the
mails or interstate commerce is used in any manner in consummating
the sale" and that "payment of the consideration is part of the
consummation of the sale."

the registration and regulation of brokers and dealers doing business
in the over-the-counter market, contains provisions designed to prevent
fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative acts and practices on the
exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets and authorizes the
Federal Reserve Board to regulate the use of credit in securities
transactions. The purpose of these statutory requirements is to ensure
the maintenance of fair and honest markets in securities.

Commission Rate Study

On February 20, 1959, the Commission announced the completion
by its staff of a study of commission rates charged by members of the
New York Stock Exchange undertaken as a result of an increase in
commission rates adopted by the Exchange on May 1, 1958.1 The
study was made in view of the responsibilities and duties imposed
upon the Commission by section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 with respect to the rules of national securities exchanges
including rules relating to the fixing of reasonable commission rates,"
In line with suggestions of the Commission, the Exchange took
steps falling into three general areas. First, the Exchange reduced
commission rates on transactions ranging from $100 to $2,400 by approximately 5 percent. These modifications were suggested in view
of the fact that the May 1958 percentage increases on transactions
from $100 to $2,400 were relatively greater than the average percentage increase. The Exchange also eliminated the so-called "round
turn" commission rate under which a reduced rate was granted to persons whose purchase and sale of the security was completed within
14 days. It was the view of the Commission that this type of transaction was not entitled to a special discount and the Exchange felt
this rate had not achieved its desired objective.
Following the action of the New York Stock Exchange other
registered national securities exchanges, including the American Stock
Exchange, adopted a schedule of commission rates identical with that
of the New York Stock Exchange.
Second, it was decided that an Exchange committee would study
the use of a so-called volume or block discount for transactions involving multiple round lot units. The Exchange also agreed to study
the possibility of further developing its income and expense survey
of member firms as a source of data in connection with commission
rates and to work with the staff of the Commission and consultants
employed by the Exchange to prepare an outline for the basis of a
cost study being made by the Exchange.
Third, the Exchange amended its rules to provide that any proposed constitutional amendment to change commission rates or other
charges would be announced 30 days in advance of action by the
Board of Governors of the Exchange. Also, it was agreed that the
Commission would be advised of any steps taken by the Exchange
looking toward changes in commission rates or other charges.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Activities of Floor Traders and Specialists

As a result of a study made by the staff of the Commission of the
activities of floor traders and specialists on the American Stock Exchange, certain steps have been taken by that Exchange to impose
further controls upon the activities of these members. The Commission concluded from the study that further restrictions were necessary
upon floor trading activities on that Exchange; that these restrictions
should prevent floor traders from stimulating public interest in a stock
by active and concerted buying; and that floor traders should be restricted from aggravating demand in present markets where many
issues on the Exchange are peculiarly susceptible to extreme fluctuations because of a small floating supply. The Commission permitted
the Exchange to put into effect on an experimental basis for six months
a rule which the Exchange believes will minimize the undesirable
features of floor trading, yet preserve certain asserted benefits," The
effect of the rule is to impose restrictions upon floor trading purchases
in a rising market.
In line with suggestions of the Commission, the Exchange has also
taken certain steps to regulate further the activities of specialists.
Several new rules relating to specialists have been adopted, the most
important of which makes subject to Exchange approval all off-floor
transactions, with certain limited exceptions, by specialists in securities in which they are registered.
The Exchange also has instituted
a program for making periodic inspections of specialist dealer transactions in the securities in which they are registered.
Under the program specialists will be required to report to the Exchange several
times each year the details of their dealings for unannounced periods
selected at random by the Exchange.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES

A member of a national securities exchange or a broker or dealer
may not effect any transaction in a security on an exchange unless the
security is registered on that exchange under the Securities Exchange
Act or is exempt from such registration.
In general, the act exempts
from registration obligations issued or guaranteed by a State or the
Federal Government or by certain subdivisions or agencies thereof and
authorizes the Commission to adopt rules and regulations exempting
such other securities as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate to exempt in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Under this authority the Commission has exempted securities
of certain banks, certain securities secured by property or leasehold
interests, certain warrants and, on a temporary basis, certain securities
issued in substitution for or in addition to listed securities.

ANNUAL REPORT

Section 12 of the Exchange Act provides that an issuer may register
a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission and
the exchange an application which discloses pertinent information concerning the issuer and its affairs, including information in regard to
the issuer's business, capital structure, the terms of its securities, the
persons who manage or control its affairs, the remuneration paid to its
officers and directors, the allotment of options, bonuses and profitsharing plans, and financial statements certified by independent accountants.
Form 10 is the form used for registration by most commercial and
industrial companies. There are specialized forms for certain types
of securities, such as voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit
and securities of foreign governments.
Section 13 requires issuers having securities registered on an exchange to file periodic reports keeping current the information furnished in the application for registration.
These periodic reports
include annual reports, semiannual reports, and current reports. The
principal annual report form is Form 10-K which is designed to keep
up to date the information furnished in Form 10. Semiannual reports
required. to be furnished on Form 9-K are devoted chiefly to furnishing mid-year financial data. Current reports on Form 8-K are required to be filed for each month in which any of certain specified
events have occurred such as changes in control of the registrant,
important acquisitions or dispositions of assets, the institution or
termination of important legal proceedings and important changes
in the issuer's capital securities or in the amount thereof outstanding.
Statisties Relating to Registration of Securities on Exchanges

As of June 30,1959, a total of 2,236 issuers had 3,808 classes of securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges, of which
2,631 were classified as stocks and 1,177 as bonds. 1,294: issuers had
1,512 stock issues and 1,124:bond issues listed and registered on the New
York Stock Exchange. Thus, 58 percent of the issuers, 57 percent of
the stock issues and 95 percent of the bond issues were on the New
York Stock Exchange.
During the 1959 fiscal year, 73 issuers listed and registered securities for the first time on a national securities exchange, while registration of all securities of 73 issuers was terminated.
The total number of applications for registration of classes of securities on national
securities exchanges filed during the 1959 fiscal year was 203.
The following table shows the number of annual, semiannual, and
current reports filed during the fiscal year by issuers having securities

Stock Exchange

At the time of passage of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
stock prices were rising from their low point, reached in 1932, and a
substantial recovery occurred through 1936. Indices turned downward with the stock market decline in 1937. Share volumes on the exchanges dropped from 962 million in 1936 to 221 million in 1942 and
dollar volumes thereof from $23.6 billion in 1936 to $4.3 billion in
1942. Thereafter, recovery set in. For the calendar year 1958, the
exchange turnover reached 1.4 billion shares with $38.4 billion dollar
volume of sales, and for the first 6 months of 1959, the turnover

reached nearly a billion shares with over $28 billion dollar volume.
The number of stocks listed on the registered exchanges fell from
2,961 in 193'7to 2,584 in 1945, and recovered to 2,643 on June 30,1959.

Shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange reached half a billion in 1926, 1 billion in 1929, 2 billion in 1948, and 5 billion in 1958.
A further increase to 5.46 billion shares listed on this Exchange during the first 6 months of 1959 brings the total shares available for
trading on all exchanges to around '7.5billion as of June 30, 1959.
Assets of Domestic Companies with Common Stocks on Exchanges

The assets of all domestic companies having common stocks on the
stock exchanges were roughly equal to the $291.4 billion market value
of such common stocks on December 31, 1958. The equivalence owes
to the preponderance of industrial stocks on the exchanges; it is not
unusual for industrial stocks to sell for as much as or more than
reported assets. The assets included about $280.8 billion for domestic companies with common stocks listed on registered exchanges and $11.4 billion for domestic companies with common stocks
unlisted on the exchanges or listed on the exempted exchanges. The
$280.8 billion listed aggregate included $266 billion on the New York
Stock Exchange," $9.8 billion on the American Stock Exchange, and

$5 billion exclusively on regional exchanges. The $11.4 billion unlisted and exempted aggregates included $8.2 billion on the American
Stock Exchange and $3.2 billion exclusively on regional exchanges.
The assets represent a conglomerate of individual and consolidated
company reports and various treatments of such matters as reserves
for depreciation.
Foreign Stock on Exchanges

The market value on December 31, 1958, of all shares and certificates
representing foreign stocks on the stock exchanges was reported at
about $12.5 billion, of which $11.1 billion represented Canadian and
$1.4 billion represented other foreign stocks. The market values of the
entire Canadian stock issues were included in these aggregates. Most
of the other foreign stocks were represented by American depositary
receipts or American shares, only the outstanding amounts of which
were used in determining market values.
Comparative Over-the-Counter

Statistics

Annual over-the-counter transactions of as much as $200 billion
United States Government bonds, centered in the offices of 5 banks
and 12 specializing dealers, are about 5 times the total bond and stock
volumes on all the stock exchanges, and earn for the over-the-counter
industry the distinction of being the world's largest securities market.
Government bonds have in the past been actively traded on stock exchanges, reaching $2.9 billion per annum on the New York Stock Exchange in the 1919-20 price recovery, but the last significant Exchange volume was reported 20 years ago, in 1939, and current volumes
on the Exchange are around $100,000 per annum.
Securities representing upward of $50 billion State and local government debt are, with few exceptions," sold only over the counter.
These bonds are usually issued in serial form, with a comparatively
small amount for each maturity date, and have a specialized market
owing to their tax-exemption features.
Corporate bond sales on the stock exchanges are only about $1.5
billion per annum, much less than those over-the-counter.
The over-the-counter potential for dealing in stocks is enormous,
since there are perhaps a million corporations whose shares might
come into the market. 6 However, less than 1 percent of these corporations appear to have the size and share distribution to command a continuing public market for their stocks. The following over-the• There 18 activity on the New York Stock Exchange in New York City Transit as or

counter data are derived from a continuing survey of the standard
security manuals, the National Quotation Bureau Services, and reports to the Commission.
Somewhat over 700 domestic banks have stocks with 300 or more
reported holders which are not on any stock exchange. Practically all
are common stocks. Their aggregate market value on December 31,
1958, was about $15 billion, which was close to 10 percent of the $155
billion assets on that date of the issuing banks. The corresponding
market value of bank stocks on stock exchanges aggregated about $237
million for 24 issues,"
About 300 domestic insurance companies have stocks with 300 or
more reported holders which are not on any stock exchange. Nearly
all 'are common stocks. The aggregate market value of their quoted
stocks on December 31, 1958, was about $11.5 billion, which was close
to 40 percent of their $29 billion assets on that date. The corresponding value of insurance stocks on stock exchanges aggregated about
$1.6 billion for 17 issues of 16 issuers.
About 500 issuers are registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, and their aggregate assets are about $20 billion. On December 31, 1958, 39 of these issuers, with about $2.2 billion net asset
value, had stocks on stock exchanges with about $1.9 billion aggregate
market value," Over-the-counter market or redemption values of the
remaining issuers' securities would bear a close correspondence to
their approximate $17.8 billion net asset value.
About 2,500 additional domestic industrial, utility, and miscellaneous issuers have stocks with 300 or more reported holders which are
not on any stock exchange. The aggregate market value on December 31, 1958, of their shares was about $32.5 billion. About $2.5 billion consisted of preferred stocks. The $30 billion common stocks
were of companies with aggregate assets of about $39 billion on that
date. Nearly all widely-held railroad stocks and a preponderance of
widely-held utility and industrial stocks are on exchanges.
In all, some 3,500 domestic corporate issuers (excluding registered
investment companies) 9 have stocks with 300 or more reported hold• Of the 22 bank stocks remaining on stock exchanges on June 30, 1959, 1 was listed
and registered, and 5 were listed and exempted from registration, on the Washington
branch of the Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange, and 16 were listed on the exempted
Richmond, Wheeling, and Honolulu Exchanges.
8 With 2 exceptions, all investment trust shares on the stock exchanges are ot closed-end
issuers. Purchases and sales of closed-end investment trust shares are ordinarily made in
the open market such as a stock exchange affords. Holders of open-end Investment trust
shares ordinarily buy them from distributors and redeem them at their Ilquldatlng values.
The 2 open-end issuers on stock exchanges are Coca Cola International Corporation and
General Capital Corporation, whose shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and
the Boston Stock Exchange respectively, with no exchange volume reported during 1958 In
either Issue.

ers which are not on any stock exchange, and whose aggregate market value on December 31, 1958, was approximately $59 billion. The
assets of the issuers having over-the-counter common stocks aggregated about $223 billion on that date, of which nearly 70 percent
($155 billion) was of banks.
As in case of issuers having securities on stock exchanges/a the
number of such issuers of over-the-counter stocks has not changed
greatly in recent years. The constant additions are substantially offset by losses through new listings on stock exchanges, mergers, sales
of assets, liquidations and reduction in number of shareholders in some
instances." Share price changes have kept pace with those of stocks
on stock exchanges. Aggregate share values of $238.8 billion on stock
exchanges on December 31, 1955, were about 5.3 times the $45 billion
over-the-counter values as computed for that date in our 22d Annual
Report (1956), and the $312.7 billion stock exchange values on December 31, 1958, were similarly about 5.3 times the $59 billion overthe-counter values as above computed.
The domestic over-the-counter stock values of $59 billion, as computed above, included $15 billion of stocks of banks, which report to
their own regulatory agencies. Of the $44 billion of other stock

$3.3 billion over-the-counter stocks of issuers reporting because they
have other securities listed on registered exchanges.
Taking into account the share values of registered investment companies which do report, and those of banks which do not report to
the Commission, it is evident that the total values of shares of domestic issuers reporting to the Commission is more than half of the
total domestic over-the-counter share values, as above computed.
DELISTING OF SECURITIES FROM EXCHANGES

Pursuant to rule 12d2-1(b) under section 12(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act, applications may be made to the Commission by issuers
to withdraw their securities or by exchanges to strike any securities
from listing and registration on exchanges. The Commission may
not deny such 'applications if made in accordance with the appropriate exchange rules, but may impose such terms as it may deem
necessary for the protection of investors.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1959, the Commission granted
applications by issuers and exchanges to remove 39 stock issues and
1 bond issue from listing and registration pursuant to rule 12d2-1 (b) .
There were 41 removals, since 1 stock was delisted from 2 exchanges.
The number of issuers involved was 37. The removals were as follows:

.This stock was also dellsted from the American Stock Exchange.

The applications by exchanges were based in general upon the
ground that the issues were no longer suitable for exchange trading,
by reason of reduced public holdings, small values, few holders, inconsequential trading volumes on the exchanges, or a combination of these
factors. Some of the issuers were not operating, or were in process
of liquidation. Failure to file reports with the exchange was cited
in three instances. In six of the applications made by exchanges it
was stated that the issuers had requested the action.
The five applications by issuers were for removal of stocks from
various regional exchanges. The stocks remained listed on other
exchanges where the principal trading volume therein occurred.

TWENTY-FIFl'H

ANNUAL

REPORT

From July 1, 1936, through June 30, 1959,13there have been 533
delistings of securities on application of exchanges and 279 on application of issuers. Delistings from the New York Stock Exchange
numbered 282 pursuant to its applications and 6 pursuant to applications by issuers. Delistings from the American Stock Exchange numbered 58 pursuant to its applications and 25 pursuant to applications
by issuers. Delistings from the regional exchanges numbered 193
pursuant to their applications and 248 pursuant to applications by
issuers. Thus, about 2 percent of the New York Stock Exchange
delistings, 30 percent of the American Stock Exchange delistings, and
56 percent of the regional exchange delistings were pursuant to applications by issuers.
As indicated above, delisting applications filed by exchanges are
ordinarily based on lack of adequate public interest in the security
issues concerned. The usual exchange application cites diminution
in number of holders and publicly held shares or the moribund condition of the issue or issuer. The reduction in the number of holders
and publicly held shares frequently results from acquisitions involving an offer of exchange into other listed shares of the same or another
issuer. In some cases, a company will have sold its assets for cash
and distributed all but small final payments in liquidation. The specific reason given in an application in case of a moribund condition
may be that the issuer has failed to file reports required by the listing agreement and registration, or has discontinued transfer and registrar facilities, or faces insolvency proceedings. Some exchanges,
upon learning that an issuer has determined to delist an inactively
traded issue, will make the application as a matter of good public
relations, stating that it is made at the request of the issuer by reason
of its inactivity on the Exchange. The New York Stock Exchange,
as the leading exchange in number of listings and number of removals,
has developed and published criteria on the basis of which it will consider initiation of a delisting application.
(See 24th Annual Report,
p. 63.) Some of the stocks delisted upon its application have remained or become listed on other exehanges.> One of the stocks
delisted upon its application has since become prominent," In general, however, there are very few instances of substantial public interest
in securities after their delisting upon application by exchanges.
Delistings upon application by issuers fall into three classes: those
which have little value, those which remain listed on other exchanges,
Comparable data are not ava.lIable for the period prior to July I, 1936.
"Examples inclnde Kalamazoo Stove and Furnaee Company and DTM Corporation stocks
remaining on Midwest Stock Exchange, and Spear I< Company, Clopay Corporation, and
Davega Stores Corporation stocks which became llsted on the American Stock Exchange.

was nearly all owned by Amerex Holding Corporation, increased from nnder 100 to over

and those which are good over-the-counter material. Upon the market break in 1937 and the subsequent drying up of exchange activity,
from 962 million shares in 1936 to 221 million in 1942, and from $23.6
billion to $4.3 dollar volume respectively, there was a plethora of
issuer applications. In this period, the Commission frequently required issuers to notify their stockholders of the pending application
and to advise them of their right to be heard. Response of the holders
was inconclusive," but the contents of the notifications were made the
cause of denials or dismissals in some instances. For some time after
the low point of the decline in share volumes was reached in 1942,
the flow of delisting applications by issuers continued, and the Commission in three cases during the period 1944-46 required important
issuers to put their decisions to a vote of stockholders." However,
volumes on the exchanges were recovering. New delisting applications by issuers dropped to an average of about 7 per annum in the 15
years to June 30,1959, compared to over 21 per annum in the 8 years
to June 30, 1943. Notifications to stockholders were required in only
a few instances after 1943, the last being in 1954; no voting requirement has been ordered by the Commission since 1946. On occasion,
either voluntarily or in compliance with a rule of an exchange, issuers
have put the matter of delisting to vote of their stockholders before
submitting applications. Since 1947, the Commission has held hearings on delisting applications only if requested by an interested party,
and only three such hearings have been held since that date, all on
delisting applications of the New York Stock Exchange.
Most of the delistings pursuant to applications by issuers during the
period have been with respect to issues having little value or issues
remaining listed on other exchanges," Excluding a number of openend investment company stocks, originally listed to qualify for sale
under blue sky laws and not suitable for exchange trading, issues
having a current market value of around $500 million have been
removed to over-the-counter trading by delistings pursuant to applications by issuers during the period." The reporting requirements
of the Commission pursuant to section 13 of the Securities Exchange
Act seem not to have been much of a factor in the deliberations of the
issuers with respect to delisting, since about $400 million of the market
.. The letters received were about equally divided tor and against delfstlng, and personal
appearances at the hearings were few in number.
17 In none of these cases did the Issuer pursue Its dellstlng
application further after
imposition of the voting requirement.
18 Dellstlngs on application
of issuers during the period originally comprised about 117
with no substanttaf trading value, DIS remaining listed on other exchanges, and 67 which
became good over. the-counter trading material. Since dellstlng, about halt of the 67 lastmentioned Issues have been exchanged into listed stocks of other companies or passed out
of existence In other ways.

Section 19 (a) (4) authorizes the Commission summarily to suspend
trading in any registered security on a national securities exchange
for a period not exceeding 10 days if, in its opinion, such action is
necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors and the
public interest so requires. The Commission has used this power
infrequently in the past. However, during the 1959 fiscal year the
Commission found it necessary and appropriate in connection with
three pending proceedings under section 1'9(a) (2) to use its authority
summarily to suspend trading in securities registered on a national
securities exchange. Only one of these suspensions remained in effect
at the end of the fiscal year.
UNUSTED TRADING PRIVILEGES ON EXCHANGES

The classical method by which stock exchanges evolved was for a
group of local brokers to commence trading in any available securities.
For more than half a century after the historic 1792 meeting under
the buttonwood tree, any security could be called up for trading on
the New York Stock Exchange at the pleasure of any member. By
1856, vote of a majority of members present came to be required for
the placing of a security on the list to be called, but upon payment of

a 25-cent "fine" any member could have any other security temporarily inserted. Unlisted trading on the New York Stock Exchange
was finally abolished in 1910, upon the recommendation of the New
York Governor's Committee on Speculation in Securities and Commodities (the "Hughes Committee") and because most of the stocks
in the unlisted department were in any event becoming listed.
The leading regional stock exchanges began trading in much the
same way. For example, the rule on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange as late as 1876 was that "members may call up the various
stocks of any chartered company, whether on the regular list or not."
As their growth in trading volumes and prestige enabled them to
impose formal listing agreements and listing fees upon issuers, many
of these exchanges came to abolish unlisted trading entirely, as the
New York Stock Exchange has done, or to restrict it to issues listed
upon other leading exchanges,"
A resolution adopted by the Boston Stock Exchange in 1869 provided that "securities dealt in at the
New York or Philadelphia Stock Exchanges may be called once,
after the regular list, without charge ... " The rule on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange by 1932 was that no securities could be admitted to unlisted trading which were not listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, New York Curb Exchange, as it was then styled, Boston
Stock Exchange, Pittsburgh Stock Exchange, or Chicago Stock
Exchange.
The American Stock Exchange (known as the New York Curb
Exchange until 1953) is the principal center of exchange trading on
an unlisted basis. In 1931-32 it had over 1,800 stock and 850 bond
issues on its unlisted roster. As a result of the New York State Attorney General's examination of unlisted trading practices, the number was substantially reduced during 1933-34 by removal of issues
inactively traded on the Exchange. The New York Produce Exchange
provided facilities for security trading from 1928 to 1935, and had
about 750 stock and 150 bond issues available for unlisted trading. The
New York Real Estate Securities Exchange operated from 1929 to
1941, and had about 100 stock and 200 bond issues available for trading on an unlisted basis. A number of other- exchanges on which
unlisted trading occurred ceased to operate in the early days of the
%1 The listing process has had a long evolntlon.
As early as 1847, the New York Stock
Exchange called for transfer books to be located in New York City. Its Committee on
Stock List, created in 1869, promulgated rules protecting against forgery and over-issuance
of securities, and sought to obtain statements of condition and Iists of officers of issuers.
The regular files of printed I1sting statements date from 1884. By 1900, the Exchange had
commenced to can upon applicants for agreements to publish detailed statements and
annual reports. The issuers' agreements with the Exchange became more comprehensive
over the years, providing for periodic earnings statements, independent auditing, prompt
notifications of issuer actions a1I'ecting their security holders, etc. With the advent of
the Commission, the requtrements of the listing agreements were supplemented by the
requirements for registration along with I1sting.

Commission. The net number of securities admitted to unlisted
trading on the exchanges prior to 1934 is not available, but clearly ran
into thousands.
Under section 12(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 22 the
Commission may approve applications by national securities exchanges
to admit securities to unlisted trading privileges without action on the
part of the issuers, if it finds such admissions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Such
admissions impose no duties on issuers beyond any they may already
have under the act. Section 12(f) provides for three categories of
unlisted trading privileges. Clause (1) provides for continuation of
unlisted trading privileges existing on the exchanges prior to March
1, 1934. Clause (2) provides for granting by the Commission of
applications by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges in securities
listed on other exchanges. Clause (3) provides for granting by the
Commission of applications for unlisted trading privileges conditioned, among other things, upon the availability of information substantially equivalent to that required to be filed by listed issuers.
Included under clause (1) of section 12(f) are securities which had
unlisted trading privileges on some exchanges prior to March 1, 1934,
and (a) were also listed and registered on some other exchange or
exchanges, or (b) were admitted only to unlisted exchange trading.
Issuers of securities in group (a) are subject to the statutory reporting
requirements by reason of the listing and registration of their securities. Issuers of securities in group (b) mayor may not be issuing
public reports. Of the issues in group (b), only 246 stock and 20
bond issues remained in that status as of June 30, 1959. The attrition has been due to many factors. Bond and preferred stock
issues have been retired. Companies have merged or liquidated.
Marginal exchanges opening around the 1929 peak of market activity
ceased operations thereafter. Many leading common stocks traded
on an unlisted basis have subsequently been listed or exchanged for
listed stocks of merging companies.
The stocks with only unlisted trading privileges on the exchanges
had an aggregate market value of $21.4 billion as of December 31,
1958. Standard Oil (New Jersey) held 52.5 percent of this total in
stocks of Creole Petroleum Corporation, Humble Oil & Refining Company, Imperial Oil Limited, and International Petroleum Company,
Limited. An additional 1'7.5percent of the total was of 58 issues of
.. The original bills proposed abolition ot unlisted trading on stock exchanges. The
proposals were opposed by the American Stock Exchange and other smaller exchanges
as presenting too sharp a transition.
Congress directed the Commission to study the
problem and submit its recommendations, which was done In a "Report on Trading In
UnllBted Securities upon Exchanges," dated January 3, 1936. The recommendations
were adopted and the present section 12(t) was enacted In May 1936.

55 issuers reporting as fully as though they were listed, by reason of
registrations under the Securities Act, the Public Utility Holding
Company Act, the Investment Company Act, or because the issuers
in some cases had other securities listed on registered exchanges. The
residue in public hands of such unlisted stocks accordingly amounted
to only about $6.5 billion, and of this amount, about $4.2 billion was
of '1'0Canadian and other foreign stocks and American depositary
receipts for foreign shares. The reported volume of trading on the
exchanges in stock admitted to unlisted trading only, for the calendar
year 1958, was about 32.3 million shares or about 2.5 percent of the
total share volume on all the exchanges. Over 90 percent of this 32.3
million share volume was on the American Stock Exchange.
Unlisted trading privileges on exchanges in issues listed and registered on other exchanges, granted under clause (1), are for the life
of the issue, while those granted under clause (2) are only for the
duration of the issue's listing and registration on another exchange."
The number of unlisted trading privileges 24 granted under clause
(1), in issues listed on other exchanges, were 991 in stocks and '1'5
in bonds on December 31, 1935. Similar privileges were thereafter
granted under clause (2) for 1,410 stock issues and 8 bond issues.
Mergers of exchanges, mergers of issuers, etc., have reduced the number of such privileges, which as of June 30, 1959, comprised 1,492 in
stocks and 1 in bonds. The reported volume of trading on the exchanges pursuant to these unlisted trading privileges for the calendar
year 1958 was about 38.7 million shares or about 3 percent of the total
share volume on all the exchanges. About 15 percent of this 38.7
million share volume was on the American Stock Exchange and 85
percent was on the regional exchanges.
On June 30, 1959, unlisted trading privileges existed pursuant to
clause (3) of section 12(f) in only 12 bond and 4 stock issues, and 2 of
the stock issues have also become listed on other exchanges. There
have been no applications under clause (3) since 1949.
Applications for Unlisted Trading Privileges

Applications by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges in stocks
listed on other exchanges, made pursuant to clause (2) of section 12(f)
of the Securities Exchange Act, were granted by the Commission
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1959as follows:
.. Ordinarily, delisting occurs npon termination of the existence of an issue, and so the
unlisted trading privileltCS therein, whether under clause (1) or clause (2), also end,
Occasionally, however, an unlisted trading privilege on one exchange granted under clause
(1) has continued after the issue has been dellsted from another exchange upon application by the issuer or by the exchange or because a listing was dropped upon merger of
exchanges. Corrently, 4 such unlisted trading privileges continue in stocks which were
formerly listed on other exchanges .
.. The number of trading privileges is greater than the number of Issues because there
may be trading privileges in an issue on more than one exchange.

Rule 12f-2 under section 12(f) of the Securities Exchange Act
provides that when a security admitted to unlisted trading on an
exchange is changed in more than certain stipulated minor respects,
the exchange may apply for Commission determination that the unlisted trading privileges may continue on the ground that the changed
security is substantially equivalent to the security theretofore admitted to unlisted trading privileges. During the fiscal year the
Commission granted applications by the American Stock Exchange
for continuance of unlisted trading under this rule in three stock
issues and two bond issues.
BLOCK DISTRIBUTIONS

REPORTED BY EXCHANGES

Rule 10b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in substance
prohibits any person participating or otherwise financially interested
in the primary or secondary distribution of a security from paying
any other person for soliciting a third person to buy any security of
the same issuer on a national securities exchange. This rule is an
antimanipulative rule adopted under section 10(b) of the act which
makes it unlawful for any person to use any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of Commission rules prescribed in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Paragraph (d) of rule 10b---2exempts transactions where compensation is
paid pursuant to the terms of a plan, filed by a national securities
exchange and declared effective by the Commission, authorizing the
payment of such compensation in connection with the distribution.
The Commission in its declaration may impose such terms and conditions upon such plan as it deems necessary or appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors.
At the present time two types of plans are in effect to permit a
block of securities to be distributed through the facilities of a national
securities exchange when it has been determined by the exchange that
the regular market on the floor of the exchange cannot absorb the
particular block within a reasonable time and at a reasonable price
or prices. These plans have been designated the "Special Offering
Plan," essentially a fixed price offering based on the market price,

76

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

and the "Exchange Distribution Plan," which is a distribution "at
the market." Both plans contemplate that orders will be solicited off
the floor but executed on the floor. Each plan contains certain antimanipulative controls and requires specified disclosures concerning the
distribution to be made to prospective purchasers.
In addition to these two methods of distributing large blocks of
securities on national securities exchanges, blocks of listed securities
may be distributed to the public by a "Secondary Distribution" on
the over-the-counter market, after the close of exchange trading. The
exchanges generally require members to obtain the approval of the
exchange before participating in such secondary distributions.
The following table shows the number and volume of special offerings and exchange distributions reported by the exchanges having
such plans in effect, as well as similar figures for secondary distributions which exchanges have approved for member participation and

Manipulation

The Exchange Act describes and prohibits certain forms of mauipulative activity in any security registered on a national securities
exchange. The prohibited activities include wash sales and matched
orders effected for the purpose of creating a false or misleading
appearance of trading activity in, or with respect to the market for,
any such security; a series of transactions in which the price of such
security is raised or depressed, or in which actual or apparent active
trading is created for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales of
such security by others; circulation by a broker, dealer, seller, or
buyer, or by a person who receives consideration from a broker, dealer,
seller or buyer, of information concerning market operations conducted for a rise or a decline in the price of such security; and the
making of any false and misleading statement of material information
by a broker, dealer, seller, or buyer regarding such security for the
purpose of inducing purchases or sales. The act also empowers the

Commission to adopt rules and regulations to define and prohibit the
use of these and other forms of manipulative activity in any security
registered on an exchange or traded over the counter.
The Commission's market surveillance staff in its Division of Trading and Exchanges in Washington and in its New York Regional
Office and other field officesstudies the tickertape quotations of securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange and on the .American
Stock Exchange, the sales and quotation sheets of the various regional
exchanges, and the bid and asked prices published by the National
Daily Quotation Service for about 6,000 unlisted securities for any
unusual or unexplained price variations or market activity. The
financial news ticker, leading newspapers, and various financial publications and statistical services are also closely followed.
When unusual or unexplained market activity in a security is
observed, all known information regarding the security is examined
and a decision made as to the necessity for an investigation. Most
investigations are not made public so that no unfair reflection will
be cast on any persons or securities and the trading markets will not
be upset. These investigations, which are conducted by the Commission's regional offices, take two forms. A preliminary investigation
or "quiz" is designed to discover rapidly evidence of unlawful activity.
If no violations are found, the preliminary investigation is closed. If
it appears that more intensive investigation is necessary, a forma]
order of investigation, which carries with it the right to issue subpoenas and to take testimony under oath, is issued by the Commission.
If violations by a broker-dealer are discovered, the Commission may
institute administrative proceedings to determine whether or not to
revoke his registration or to suspend or expel him from membership
in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or from a.
national securities exchange. The Commission may also seek an injunction against any person violating the act and it may refer information obtained in its investigation to the Department of Justice
recommending that persons violating the act be criminally prosecuted.
In some cases, where State action seems likely to bring quick results
in preventing fraud or where Federal jurisdiction may be doubtful,
the information obtained may be referred to State agencies for State
injunction or criminal prosecution.
The Commission is much concerned with indications of increased
manipulative activity in present securities markets. Accordingly, the
Commission has placed greater emphasis in its enforcement work
upon the detection and prevention of manipulation and a substantial
number of investigations are now in progress in this area.26
Active securities markets are particularly susceptible to manipulation because of the ease with which public interest can be generated.

Devious schemes may be employed to take advantage of this public
interest. These include schemes to increase the quoted over-thecounter prices for relatively obscure issues being distributed without
registration in asserted reliance upon some exemption, or the creation
of fictitious markets for such issues. Such schemes are not uncommon
in connection with distributions effected by "boiler rooms." These
activities when conducted with ingenuity through numerous intermediaries are difficult to detect. Persons engaged in, or proposing
distribution of a security not outstanding in the hands of the public
may place orders for the purchase 'and sale of small amounts of a
security with numerous brokers and dealers, or arrange to have others
do this, with the result that such brokers and dealers will publish
quotations for the security at prices specified in the orders, thus
creating the appearance of an active over-the-counter market for the
security, when in fact no such market exists except as generated by
the distributors. When the distribution is completed, the orders are
withdrawn and the "market" disappears.
The investigation and prosecution of a manipulation case requires
careful and painstaking work usually over a period of many months.
Investors must be identified and interviewed, books and records of
brokers, dealers and others must be examined and analyzed, and the

When securities are to be offered to the public, their markets are
watched very closely to make sure that the price is not unlawfully
raised prior to or during the distribution. One thousand and fifty-five
registered offerings having a value of $15,657 million and 854 offerings exempt under section 3 (b) of the Securities Act, having a value
of about $170 million were so observed during the fiscal year. Two
hundred and seventy-four other offerings, SUCh.as secondary distri-

butions and distributions of securities under special plans filed by the
exchanges, having a total value of $715 million, were also kept under
surveillance.
Stabilization

When, in 1934, the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act were
being drafted, Congress concluded that at times it would be necessary
to stabilize offerings of securities in order to raise funds for industry
and to protect existing investors while doing so. But rather than set
stabilizing standards as a matter of law, Congress delegated to the
Commission the authority to adopt rules to govern this little-understood function.
When the Commission was organized, one of its first tasks was to
study the subject of stabilizing, decide what was improper and consider the adoption of rules. The principal difficulty has been that
stabilizing is a form of market manipulation. The problem was to
retain the benefits while removing those antisocial practices which
might cause loss to investors. The Commission proceeded slowly, as
many new facets of the problem were revealed, and it was difficult to
devise a simple formula which had the particularity required in a
rule binding on all who dealt in securities, without literally strangling the business.
Until it gained more expertise in the field, the Commission encouraged issuers, underwriters and their counsel to consult with it and the
staff concerning problems which might arise in this area. Each such
problem was judged on its own merits in the light of whether or not
the interests of investors might be adversely affected. As the Commission gained experience, general principles were laid down. It was
held, among other things, that stabilizing was not improper if it did
no more than prevent or retard a price decline during an offering; that
stabilizing purchases should be confined to the fewest transactions
necessary to accomplish such a purpose; that stabilizing levels must
be based on an existing independent market and not some level believed desirable by the person stabilizing; and that it was improper
for a stabilizer to follow a rise in price too closely. Releases were issued from time to time to publicize the Commission's viewpoint with
regard to stabilizing. In addition, the Commission expressed its
viewpoint in its decisions and opinions.
From time to time it was suggested that what had now become a
rather extensive list of settled practices be codified in specific rules,
but in various conferences, the industry claimed that any code must
necessarily be too rigid to allow for changing conditions.
However, on December 30, 1952, the Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives recommended
that the "Commission should earnestly and expeditiously grapple
with the problem of stabilization with the view of either the early

80

EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

promulgation of rules publicly covering these operations, or of recommending to the Congress such changes in legislation as its experience
and study show now to be desirable."
The Commission therefore
undertook to codify the stabilizing practices which had been developed
over the years.
The Commission requested and obtained the assistance of the securities industry in formulating its stabilizing rules. .An ad hoc committee of the public was formed. This committee conferred with and
submitted proposals to the staff, which were considered by the Commission together with the recommendations of the staff and views obtained in a public hearing held prior to the adoption of the rules.
The rules as finally adopted are extremely technical. They have,
however, served well their purpose of facilitating distributions and
preventing unlawful manipulations.
Rule 10b-6 restricts the trading
activities of those who issue or participate in the distribution of securities. Rule 10b-7 governs the times, methods and prices at which
stabilizing transactions are permissible. Rule 10b-8 deals with the
peculiar problems arising in an offering of securities through rights.
The Commission is continuously reexamining the effect of these rules
and if it appears necessary, it will amend them to conform to any
developing practice of the industry which appears to be in the public
interest.
During 1959 stabilizing was effected in connection with stock offerings aggregating 32,097,212 shares having an aggregate public offering price of $770,503,662 and bond offerings having a total offering
price of $129,038,300. In these offerings, stabilizing transactions resulted in the purchase of 710,015 shares of stock at a cost of $18,146,077
and bonds at a cost of $2,938,340, and 4,461 stabilizing reports showing purchases and sales of securities effected by persons conducting
the distribution were received and examined during the fiscal year.
INSIDERS' SECURITY HOLDINGS AND TRANSACTIONS

Section 16 of the act is designed to prevent the unfair use of confidential information by directors, officers and principal stockholders by
giving publicity to their security holdings and transactions and by
removing the profit incentive in short term trading by them in equity
securities of their company. Such persons by virtue of their position
may have knowledge of the company's condition and prospects which
is unavailable to the general public and may be able to use such information to their personal advantage in transactions in the company's
securities. 'Provisions similar to those contained in section 16 of the
act are also contained in section 17 of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 and section 30 of the Investment Company Act
of 1940.

Ownership Reports

Section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires every person
who is a direct or indirect beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of
any class of equity securities (other than exempted securities) which
is registered on a national securities exchange, or who is a director or
officer of the issuer of such securities, to file reports with the Commission and the exchange disclosing his ownership of the issuer's equity
securities. This information must be kept current by filing subsequent
reports for any month in which a change in his ownership occurs.
Similar reports are required by section 17 (a) of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of officers and directors of public utility holding companies and by section 30(f) of the Investment Company Act
of officers, directors, principal security holders, members of advisory
boards and investment advisers or affiliated persons of investment
advisers of registered closed-end investment companies.
All ownership reports are available for public inspection as soon as
they are filed at the Commission's office in Washington and reports
filed pursuant to section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act may
also be inspected at the exchanges where copies of such reports are
filed. In addition, for the purpose of making the reported information available to interested persons who may not be able to inspect
the reports in person, the Commission summarizes and publishes such
information in a monthly "Official Summary of Security Transactions
and Holdings," which is distributed by the Government Printing
Office on a subscription basis. Increasing interest in this publication
is evidenced by the increase in the total circulation from a rate of about
6,000 at the end of the 1958 fiscal year to more than 8,000 at the end of
the 1959 fiscal year.
During the fiscal year, 39,275 ownership reports were filed. This
represents a considerable increase over the 33,126 reports filed during
the 1958 fiscal year. The following table shows details concerning
reports filed during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1959.

Recovery of Short-Swing Trading Profits by Issuer

In order to prevent insiders from making unfair use of information
which may have been obtained by reason of their relationship with a
company, section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, section 17(b)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and section 30(f) of the
Investment Company Act provide for the recovery by or on behalf
of the issuer of any profit realized by insiders from certain purchases
and sales, or sales and purchases, of securities of the company within
any period of less than 6 months. The Commission has certain exemptive powers with respect to transactions not comprehended within
the purpose of these provisions, but is not charged with the enforcement of the civil remedies created thereby.
REGULATION OF PROXIES
Scope of Proxy Regulation

Under section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 12(e) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and 20(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940the Commission has adopted regulation
14 requiring the disclosure in a proxy statement of pertinent information in connection with the solicitation of proxies, consents and
authorizations in respect of securities of companies subject to those
statutes. The regulation also provides means whereby any security
holders so desiring may communicate with other security holders
when management is soliciting proxies, either by distributing their
own proxy statements or by including their proposals in the proxy
statements sent out by management.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminary form prior to the date of the proposed solicitation.
Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed disclosure
standards, the management or other group responsible for its prepa28 Form U-17-1 is used for initial reports and Form U-17-2 for reports of changes of

form in which it is furnished to stockholders.
Statistics Relating to Proxy Statements

During the 1959 fiscal year 1,975 proxy statements in definitive form
were filed under the Commission's regulation 14 for the solicitation of
proxies of security holders; 1,959 of these were filed by management
and 16 by nonmanagement groups or individual stockholders. These
1,975 solicitations related to 1,814 companies, some 150 of which had
more than one solicitation during the year, generally for a special
meeting not involving the election of directors.
There were 1,790 solicitations of proxies for the election of directors,
152 for special meetings not involving the election of directors and 33
for assents and authorizations for actions not involving a meeting of
security holders or the election of directors.
In addition to the election of directors, the decisions of security
holders were sought through the solicitation in the 1959 fiscal year
of their proxies, consents and authorizations with respect to the
following types of matters:

During the 1959 fiscal year, 48 stockholders submitted a total of 156
proposals which were included in the 99 proxy statements of 99 companies under rule 14a-8 of regulation 14.
Typical of such stockholder proposals submitted to a vote of security
holders were resolutions relating to amendments to charters or by-laws
to provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors, limitations on the granting of stock options and their exercise by key
employees and management groups, the sending of a post-meeting
report to all stockholders, changing the place of the annual meeting
of stockholders and the approval by stockholders of management's
selection of independent auditors.

posals submitted by 25 individual stockholders. The principal reasons
for such omissions and the numbers of times each such reason was
involved (counting only one reason for omission for each proposal
even though it may have been omitted under more than one provision of rule 14a-&) were as follows:
(a) 1&proposals related to the ordinary conduct of the company's
business;
(b) 17 proposals involved the election of directors';
(c) 13 proposals concerned a personal grievance against the company;
(d) 11 proposals were not a proper subject matter under State law;
(e) 5 proposals were resubmitted after not having received sufficient affirmative votes at a previous meeting; and
(f) 1 proposal was not submitted timely.
Ratio of Soliciting to Non-Soliciting Companies

Of the 2,236 issuers that had securities listed and registered on
national securities exchanges as of June 30, 1959, 1,985 had voting
securities so listed and registered. Of these 1,985 issuers, 1,544 or
78.7 percent, solicited proxies under the Commission's proxy rules
during the 1959 fiscal year for the election of directors.
Proxy Contests

During the 1959 fiscal year, 19 companies were involved in proxy
contests when nonmanagement persons filed detailed statements as
participants, or proposed participants, under the requirements of
rule 14a-11 when proxies are to be solicited from stockholders for the
election of directors. A total of 259 persons, including both management and nonmanagement, filed such statements in 11 cases for control
of the board of directors and in 8 cases for representation on the
board.
Management retained control in 8 of the 11 contests, opposition
nominees won in 2, and 1 was settled by negotiation. Of the 8 cases
where representation on the board was involved, management retained
all places on the board in 5 and in the other 3 cases nonmanagement
persons were elected to the board.
REGULATION OF BROKER-DEALERS AND OVER-THE-COUNTER
MARKETS
Registration

The Securities Exchange Act requires under section 15(a) that
brokers and dealers, with certain exceptions, using the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce to engage in securities transactions on the over-the-counter market must register with the Commission. Brokers and dealers whose business is exclusively intrastate
or exclusively in exempt securities are not required to register.

Proceedings

Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act provides that the
Commission shall revoke a firm's broker-dealer registration or deny
broker-dealer registration to an applicant if, after appropriate notice
and opportunity for hearing, it finds such action is in the public interest and that the registrant or applicant or any partner, offic-er,director or other person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled
by such broker-dealer or applicant is subject to one or more of the disqualifications set forth in the act. In addition, pending final determination whether any registration shall be revoked, the Commission
shall by order suspend such registration if after appropriat-e notice
and opportunity for hearing, suspension shall appear to the Commission to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors.
The disqualifications referred to above, are briefly:
(1) conviction in the past 10 years of a felony or misdemeanor
involving the purchase or sale of securities or any conduct
arising out of business as a broker-dealer;
(2) willful false or misleading statements in the application or
documents supplementing the application;
(3) injunction by a court of competent jurisdiction from engaging in any conduct or practice in connection with the purchase or sale of securities; and

86

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

(4) willful violation of any of the provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act or any of the
Commission's rules and regulations thereunder.
Under section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act brokers and
dealers may be suspended or expelled by the Commission from membership in a national securities association, and under section 19(a) (3)
from national securities exchanges, for violations of the federal securities laws or the regulations thereunder. Registration may not be
denied to an applicant absent evidence of misconduct specified in the
act. Other factors, such as bad reputation or character, lack of
experience in the securities business or even conviction of the applicant of a felony unrelated to securities transactions, do not constitute
statutory grounds for denial of registration as a broker-dealer.
Section 15A (b) (4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934provides
that in the absence of the Commission's approval or direction, no
broker or dealer may be admitted to or continued in membership in
a national securities association if the broker or dealer or any partner,
officer, director or controlling or controlled person of such broker or
dealer was a cause of any order of revocation or suspension or expulsion from membership which is in effect. An individual named as
such a cause often is subject to one or more statutory disqualifications
under section 15(b) and his employment by any other broker-dealer
thus could also become a basis for broker-dealer revocation proceedings against the new employer.

Administrative proceedings in which action was taken during the year
included the following:
SU8pension Proceeding8

During the past year the Commission suspended the registration of
several broker-dealers pending final determination as to whether their
registrations should be revoked. Since suspension has the effect of
stopping all securities business by the registrant, this sanction is imposed only in the most serious type of cases where the Commission
finds, on the evidence adduced at a hearing, that such action is required, in the public interest and for the protection of investors.
A. G. Bellin Securities Corp.-The
registrant was found, in connection with the sale of unregistered stock in General Oils & Industries, to
have made false and misleading statements regarding, among other

88

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

things, prospects of profits, payment of dividends, increase in market
price, listing on exchange, merger, interest of officials of prominent
oil companies in General, and the issuers' ownership of and production
from oil and gas properties. In addition, registrant was preliminarily
enjoined from selling stock of General.
The Commission, on the basis of these findings, held that a sufficient
showing had been made to require suspension of registration in the
public interest and for the protection of investors. In determining
this the Commission stated, " ... we are required ... to suspend
registration where the record before us on the suspension issue contains a sufficient showing of misconduct to indicate the likelihood that
after hearings on the revocation issue registrant will be found to have
committed willful violations or any of the other grounds prescribed
with respect to the revocation in section 15(b) will be established, and
that revocation will be required in the public interest.": "The Commission also stated that under the suspension. provision, "... we are
only directed to inquire into the question of whether the public interest
or the protection of investors warrants suspension, and there is no requirement that suspension be based upon findings of willful violation
or the other grounds specified with respect to revocation." 30 At the
close of the fiscal year revocation proceedings were pending against
registrant.
Herman Bud Rothbard, doing business as Jonathan & Company.-Rothbard
admitted that he filed a false and misleading financial statement with his application for registration, violated the net
capital rule, failed to amend his registration "to disclose transfer of
control of his business, failed to file a required financial report, and
maintained materially deficient books and records and he consented
to suspension of his broker-dealer registration. The Commission concluded that suspension was appropriate in the public interest and for
the protection of investors." In addition, on June 30,1959, the Commission revoked Rothbard's registration.
This is discussed in more
detail later in this report.
Jean R. Veditz Co., Inc.-Registrant
consented to suspension of its
broker-dealer registration. The Commission found suspension to be
appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors.
The order instituting proceedings charged registrant, Jean R. Veditz,
its president and sole stockholder, and Ben Goldstein, its sales manager, with violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in the offer and sale of stock of Universal Drilling Company.
Registrant and Veditz were stated in the order to have been enjoined

of securities. Revocation proceedings against registrant were pending at the end of the fiscal year."
Philip Newman Associates, Inc.-In the latter part of 1958 registrant's books showed sales through the use of the mails of 124,520
unregistered shares of the common stock of Monarch Asbestos Co.,
Limited. Evidence at the suspension hearing established that, to
induce purchase of this stock, registrant made numerous false representations, including among other things, that Monarch was an operating company with highly profitable production, and that Monarch's
asbestos mine was adjacent to that of Johns-Manville Corporation and
contained asbestos superior to that produced by the latter. It was also
falsely represented that Johns-Manville Corporation had determined
to acquire or to merge with Monarch and that the market price of
Monarch stock had risen and would increase from $5 to $16 per share
in from 1 to 6 months. The Commission held that there had been a
sufficient showing of willful violations by registrant, including a
course of conduct replete with fraud, to make it necessary and appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors that
registrant's registration be suspended until final determination on the
question of revocation. Proceedings on the question of revocation of
registrant's broker-dealer registration were pending at the end of the
fiscal year. 33
Alexander Dvoretsky, doing business as Dennis & Company.The Commission found on the basis of stipulations entered into by
Dvoretsky that he employed individuals who were permanently enjoined from engaging in certain securities practices and that he willfully violated provisions of the Securities Exchange Act and rules
thereunder in that his application for registration denied existence
of such injunctions and that he failed to file any correcting amendment to the application to state their existence. He was also found
to have willfully violated the Commission's net capital rule and books
and records requirements. These violations, the consent and the
record so far made, were held to be a sufficient showing to require suspension of registration in the public interest and for the protection of
investors. At the end of the fiscal year proceedings to revoke
Dvoretsky's registration were still pending."
Denial Proceedings

Kelly Rubenstein, Inc.-William
Rubenstein, president and a director of applicant, was found by the Commission to have willfully
made. a false and misleading statement in the broker-dealer application of Washington Securities Corporation. Both Rubenstein and
Washington were found to have willfully violated section 15(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and rule 15b-2 thereunder in not

promptly filing an amendment correcting the inaccuracy of this information. In addition, the Commission found that Rubenstein, while
president, treasurer and a director of Keith Richard Securities Corp.
caused that firm to willfully violate Commission rules concerning
keeping of books and records. Under all the circumstances, the Commission found it in the public interest to deny the application of
applicant and found Rubenstein to be a cause of the denial. However, the order stated that the above findings did not necessarily mean
that Rubenstein was permanently barred from registration or from
employment by a registered broker-dealer in a supervised capacity
upon a proper showing."
Alan Russell Securities, Inc.-The
Commission denied brokerdealer registration to applicant and named Nathan L. Batterman and
amos Maiers as causes of the denial. The action was based on a permanent injunction issued by the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York against applicant, Batterman and
Maiers. The decree, entered by consent, enjoined applicant, Batterman and Maiers from making untrue and misleading statements in
connection with the sale of International Ceramic Mining Limited
stock in violation of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act.36
Leonard Burton Corporation.-Broker-dealer
registration was
denied applicant and Leonard Burton was named the cause of denial
based on willful violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act.
The Commission found that Leonard Burton while employed as a
securities salesman by Steven Randall & Co., Inc. made misleading
representations in connection with the offer or sale of Texas Union
Oil Company stock. Burton represented that there would be no commissions on the sale of the stock and failed to state that Steven Randall & Co., Inc. was selling the stock as principal. Burton also
presented an optimistic picture of large and quick increases in the
market value of the stock based on actual production without apprising investors of the speculative and contingent factors known by
him. The statement that a stock is likely to go up was deemed to
imply, " ... that there is an adequate foundation for such prediction
and there are no known facts which make such a prediction dangerous
or unreliable." The Commission rejected registrant's allegation that
the practicalities of merchandising the stock excused the registrant
from the requirements of disclosure necessary to render the statements
made not misleading."

Washington
Securities Corporation.The Commission denied
broker-dealer registration to applicant and named Joseph Freundel
as a cause of denial. Freundel, president, director and sole stockholder of applicant, was permanently enjoined, with others, on August
19, 1958, by the United States District Court for the District of New
Jersey from making untrue or misleading statements in connection

broker-dealer registration was revoked by the Commission on findings of fraud in the sale of securities,
sales of unregistered securities, making of false records, failure to
keep required records, failure to file promptly an amendment to the
registration application, filing of an amendment containing a false
statement and failure to file a report of financial condition for 1957
as required.
The Commission found that registrant and Joseph Leo Gruber, Jr.s
president of registrant, sold over 23,000 unregistered shares of Eagle
Oil and Supply Company to at least 32 investors. In connection with
some of these sales Gruber and registrant made false representations
regarding a stock split, dividends, sales quotas and expected profits.
The Commission found Gruber to be a cause of the revocation."
John D. Ferris, doing business as Ferris & Co.-The Commission
found that Ferris engaged in the securities business without disclosing that he was insolvent, issued bad checks, failed to pay for securities sold and delivered, and failed to meet his obligations arising from
the purchase and sale of securities. In addition, registrant failed to
furnish a customer a confirmation of sale, failed to comply with the
net capital rule, failed to maintain accurate and current books and
records and failed to file a report of financial condition for 1956. Accordingly, the broker-dealer reg-istration of Ferris was revoked. The
Commission held, "The conduct of a securities business involves implied representations of solvency and a readiness and ability to meet
all attendant obligations as they arise and to consumate transactions
in the usual manner in accordance with trade custom." By failure to
disclose his insolvency and repeated failure to meet his responsibilities
in connection with his securities transactions, Ferris was heIc1to have

use customer's funds in connection with the purchases and sales of
securities, filed a false financial report, failed to comply with the net
capital rule, failed to keep accurate books and records, and failed to

$28,240, which had been obtained upon the false representation that
registrant would use funds for the purpose of purchasing securities
for the customers. The Commission named Sills as a cause of the
order of revocation."

In connection 'With all of these sales, Keller failed to disclose to the
customers the prices paid for the securities or the current market
price established by other broker-dealers. In addition, Keller failed

books and records, and to amend his application for registration to
disclose employment of a person subject to a court injunction. Also,

by the Commission on findings that registrant solicited and effected
securities transactions without disclosing it was insolvent. Bruce A.
Johnston, registrant's president and controlling stockholder, induced
customers with whom he was in a relationship of trust and confidence
to lend him funds and securities for purposes of supplying capital
to registrant and sold to other customers shares of stock in registrant,
and failed to inform any of these customers of the registrant's operating losses and insolvency. Alan D. Selditch, general manager of
registrant's securities department, made false and misleading statements in the offer and sale of registrant's stock to two customers in
violation of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Acts. He
represented that registrant was in good shape, had a capitalization
of $100,000, was expanding and would pay dividends, none of which
was true. Registrant was found to have failed to keep accurate

Whitney Phoenix Company, Inc.-The Commission revoked.the
broker-dealer registration of registrant and found Strabo V. Claggett,
president and director of registrant, a cause of the order of revocation.
Registrant and Claggett offered and sold stock of Selevision weStern, Inc. nVestern) and its parent, Selevision Corporation of America (Selevision) by means of false and misleading information in
wilful violation of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Acts.
The Western offering circular and other sales literature falsely stated
that registrant had increased its stock holdings in Selevision by purchase of an additional 65,000 shares and contained optimistic statements regarding Selevision's business prospects and future operations, but failed to disclose that Selevision had recently discontinued
an important part of its business. Also, Claggett falsely stated to
two purchasers of Selevision's stock that the stock would double or
triple in price and, "that things were rolling along like a house afire."
Registrant sold Western's securities pursuant to a filing with the
Commission under regulation A. However, in the offer and sale
of these securities, it used letters soliciting the purchase of the stock
which were not filed with the Commission as required. In addition,
registrant sold the stock in jurisdictions other than those indicated in
the filing. Since it failed to comply with the provisions of regulation
A, the exemption from registration was not available and the sale
and delivery of Western stock by registrant and Claggett was in
wilful violation of the registration requirements of the Securities Act
of 1933.
In addition, registrant violated the net capital rule, failed to comply with record requirements and refused to permit inspection of its
records,"
Herman Bud Rothbard, doing business as Jonathan & Co.-The

expelled him from membership in the National Association of 'securities Dealers, Inc. The Commission had previously suspended
his broker-dealer registration."

stated that ED COR was operating at a profit and that a dividend
might be expected when in fact EDCOR had suffered losses and had
an earned surplus deficit. Based on these findings the Commission
held that Rothbard wilfully violated the antifraud provisions of the
Securities Acts.

person who controlled registrant, was Chairman of the Board of each

Carl M. Loeb, Rhoades & Co.-Dominick
& Dominick.- The
Commission instituted broker-dealer revocation proceedings against
registrants, based upon offers to sell or solicitation of offers to buy
securities of the Arvida Corporation (Arvida) in violation of section 5 (c) of the Securities Act of 1933. Registrants were the prime
underwriters of the offering. Prior to the filing of a registration
statement with the Commission, a partner of one of the registrants,
with the consent of the other and of the issuer, composed a release
for use in the New York papers. The release stated, among other
things, that Arthur Vining Davis, holder of considerable real estate
in Florida, was going to convey some 100,000 acres of properties, described in the release as in an area of the Gold Coast in three named
Florida counties, to Arvida, that Arvida would have assets of over
100 million dollars, and that within 60 days there was going to be a
public offering of Arvida's securities through an investment banking
group headed by registrants. In addition, newspaper reporters were
called to the office of one of the registrants, were told that the offering
price would be in the vicinity of $10 or $11 per share and were given
further information about Davis and his career. The information
contained in the release, together with the additional information furnished orally, appeared in three New York newspapers on September
19, 1958, and in numerous other news media throughout the country.
A limited survey indicated that for the two business days of September 19 and 22, Loeb, Rhoades received indications of buying interest amounting to $500,000 with a total of 101 securities firms expressing an underwriting interest in the offering. Loeb, Rhoades made
notations of seIling group interest on the part of about 25 securities
dealers. In addition, registrants received, prior to September 30, at
least 58 expressions of interest from members of the public, including at least 17 specific orders to buy. Arvida did not file a registration statement under the Securities Act until October 27, 1958.
The Commission concluded that publicity, prior to the :filing of a
registration statement, by means of public media of communication,
with respect to an issuer or its securities, emanating from brokerdealer firms who as underwriters or prospective underwriters have
negotiated or are negotiating for a public offering of the securities
of such issuer, must be presumed to set in motion or to be a part of
the distribution process and therefore to involve an offer to sell or a
solicitation of an offer to buy such securities prohibited by section

5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. Therefore, the Commission held
the press release and meeting and resultant publicity wilfully violated
section 5(c) of the Securities Act. However, under all the circumstances, including registrant's excellent reputation, and the fact that
they acted on reliance of counsel and that no investors appeared to
have been injured, the Commission found that no sanction was necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors."
A related action brought by the Commission in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which a
consent decree was entered permanently enjoining violation of section 5 (c) by Arvida, registrants, and others, is discussed at p. 54,
supra.
First Maine Corporation.-Registrant,
in violation of section 5(c)
of the Securities Act of 1933, was found to have offered to sell or to
have solicited offers to buy unregistered securities of Life Insurance
Securities Corporation (LISCO) for a period of over 3 months before
a registration statement was filed with the Commission. Burton M.
Cross and Herbert L. Rackliff, president and beneficial owner of
equity securities of registrant, respectively, were found to have caused
registrant to distribute by mail, notices, circulars and other publicity
which constituted the illegal offers to sell or solicitations of offers to
buy LISCO's stock. In addition, registrant, Cross and Rackliff were
found to have violated section 5 (b) (1) of the Securities Act by transmitting improper prospectuses after LISCO's registration statement
was filed.
Also registrant, Cross and Rackliff were held to have made false
and misleading statements of material facts in offering the securities
of LISCO, thereby violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act. The Commission found that the material distributed by
registrant contained two general themes, (1) the attractiveness of
stock of life insurance companies in which it was stated LISCO
would invest, and (2) the knowledge, experience, ability and competency of LISCO's officers and directors, particularly Cross. This
literature was materially misleading in stressing the investment opportunities of life insurance companies without disclosing that the
funds of investors would be invested in a casualty insurance company
organized by Cross and Rackliff and not yet in operation. The
information in regard to the experience of LISCO's management was
misleading for failure to state that the active officers have had only
very limited experience with an operating insurance company.
The Commission, in view of the nature of the violations, ordered
that registrant be suspended from the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., for 20 days and that Cross and Rackliff be named
causes of the suspension. 80

ANNUAL REPORT

Net Capital Rule

The Commission has adopted under section 15(c) (3) of the Securities Exchange Act rule 15c3-1, commonly known as the net capital
rule, which is intended to provide safeguards for securities and funds
of customers dealing with broker-dealers by limiting the amount of
indebtedness which may be incurred by a broker-dealer in relationship
to net capital. A broker-dealer subject to the rule may not allow
his "aggregate indebtedness" to be more than twenty times his "net
capital," as those terms are defined in the rule.
When it appears, from an examination of reports filed with the
Commission or through inspection of books and records, that a brokerdealer is in violation of the net capital rule, an opportunity is generally afforded the registrant to correct such capital deficiencies.
Failure promptly to bring the capital position into compliance with
the rule may result in injunctive action to restrain further violations
or the institution of proceedings to determine whether or not the
registrant's broker-dealer registration should be revoked. Violations
of the net capital rule were alleged in 13 injunctive actions filed by the
Commission in the last fiscal year and in 22 revocation proceedings.
Broker-dealers participating in "firm commitment" underwritings
must have sufficient net capital to permit participation in the underwriting for the amount they have agreed upon. The staff, in order
adequately to protect issuers and customers of broker-dealers participating in such underwritings, carefully analyzes the latest information concerning the capital position of such a broker-dealer in order
to determine if assumption of the new obligations involved in the
underwriting is possible without violating the net capital rule. The
Commission will refuse to accelerate the effectiveness of registration
statements filed under the Securities Act when it appears that any of
the underwriters would, by virtue of commitments in the underwriting, be in violation of the net capital rule. Broker-dealers named as
underwriters in offerings of securities registered with the Commission
who appeared to be inadequately capitalized to fulfill their commitments and, at the same time, remain in compliance with the net capital
rule, were informed of the potential violation of the rule and the effect
this would have upon the pending registration statement.
Such
broker-dealers either obtained sufficient additional capital, comply
fully with the rule, reduced their commitments in the underwriting
to such an extent as to participate in the underwriting without violaing the rule, withdrew as underwriters, or participated in the underwriting on a "best efforts" basis only.
Financial Statements

Under section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, the Commission has promulgated rule 17a-5 requiring the filing of periodic financial statements by registered brokers and dealers. Under this rule,

106

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

every financial report filed must be certified by a certified public accountant or a public accountant who is in fact independent, with certain limited exemptions applicable to situations where certification
does not appear necessary for customer protection. Thus, under certain conditions, a member of a national securities exchange need not
file such a certified report. Also, if since his previous report a broker
has limited his securities business to soliciting subscriptions as an
agent for issuers, transmitted funds and securities promptly, and has
not otherwise held funds or securities for or owed monies or securities
to customers, he is exempt from the certification requirement. An exemption from the certification requirements is also given a brokerdealer who, from the date of his last report, has only bought and sold
evidences of indebtedness secured by liens on real estate and has not
carried margin accounts, credit balances, or securities for securities
customers.
The requirements for filing financial reports enable the Commission
and the public to determine the financial responsibility of brokerdealers and enable the staff to analyze the reports in order to determine whether the registrant is in compliance with the Commission's
net capital rule. Revocation proceedings are instituted against registrants who :fail to make the necessary filing. However, it is the practice of the Commission to first inform a registrant of his obligations
under rule 17a-5 prior to taking such action against him. During the
past fiscal year, 4,560 reports of financial condition were filed, an increase of 87 over fiscal 1958.
Broker-Dealer Inspections

Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act provides for regular
and periodic inspections o:f registered broker-dealers. The Commission has continued to place emphasis on this program to insure a more
adequate protection of investors. Inspection serves to assure compliance by broker-dealers with the securities acts and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission. The inspection device is one
of the most useful instruments at the Commission's disposal in protecting investors and preventing and detecting violations of the Federal securities laws.
Generally, inspections involve, among other things: (1) review of a
broker-dealer's pricing practices; (2) a determination of financial
condition; (3) a review of the safeguards used in handling customers'
funds and securities; and (4) a determination of whether adequate
disclosures relating to transactions are made to customers.
In addition, the inspectors also determine whether brokers and
dealers keep their books and records in compliance with the Federal
securities laws and conform to the margin and other requirements of
Regulation T as prescribed by the Federal Reserve Board. Furthermore, a check is made to see if excessive trading in customers' accounts

TWENTY-FIFTH

107

ANNUAL REPORT

involving "churning" or "switching" has occurred. Inspections often
turn up evidence of sale of unregistered securities or the use of fraudulent practices, including the use of improper sales literature or sales
methods. Frequently, the inspections enable the Commission to nip
in the bud situations which if not corrected, could result in loss to
customers.
In 1956, the Commission inaugurated a policy of increasing the
number of inspections over that of previous years. The same policy
has been followed in the past fiscal year. Inspections completed during the year numbered 1,47l.
In determining whether to institute action against a broker-dealer
found to be in violation of the statutes or rules as a result of an inspection, consideration is given to the nature of the violations and to
the effect such violations may have upon members of the public. It is
not the Commission's policy to take formal action against brokerdealers for every violation. For example, inspections frequently
reveal various inadvertent violations which are discovered before becoming serious and before customers' funds or securities are endangered. Where no harm has come to the public in such situations,
the matter is usually brought to the attention of the registrant and
suggestions made to correct the improper practices. If the violation
appears to be willful and the public interest or the protection of
investors is best served by formal action, the Commission promptly
institutes the appropriate proceedings.
The following table shows the various types of violation disclosed
as a result of the inspection program during the fiscal year 1959:

The principal stock exchanges, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and some of the States each have somewhat similar
but not identical inspection programs to that of the Commission.
Each agency conducts its inspections, examinations or audits in
accordance with its own procedures and with particular reference to
its own regulations and jurisdiction. Inspections by other agencies
cannot be adequate substitutes for Commission inspections since they
are not primarily concerned with the detection and prevention of
violations of the Federal securities laws and the Commission's regula-

108

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

tions thereunder. However, the inspection programs of these other
organizations do afford added protection to the public. For this
reason, the Commission and certain other inspecting agencies maintain
a program of coordinating inspection activities to obtain the widest
possible coverage of brokers and dealers and to avoid unnecessary
duplications of inspection. By this program, each inspecting agency
makes available to all such agencies advice that it has started a particular inspection but the reports or findings of such an inspection
are not exchanged between the parties. Information discovered in
the course of such inspections or examinations indicating serious violations of regulations administered by another agency may, however,
be called to the attention of such other agency. The program does
not prevent the Commission from inspecting any firm recently inspected by another agency and such inspections are made whenever
there exists good cause.
Agencies now participating in this coordination program include
the American Stock Exchange, the Boston Stock Exchange, the Midwest Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc., the New York Stock Exchange, the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange, and the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange.
SUPERVISION OF ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
SECURITIES DEALERS, INC.

Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("the Maloney
Act") provides for the registration with the Commission of national
securities associations and establishes standards for such associations.
The rules of such associations must be designed to promote just and
equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices and to meet other statutory requirements. Such
associations serve as a medium for the cooperative self-regulation of
over-the-counter brokers and dealers. They operate under the general
supervision of this Commission which is authorized to review disciplinary actions and decisions which affect the membership of members, or of applicants for membership, and to consider all changes in
the rules of associations. The National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. ("NASD") is the only Association registered under
the act.
In adopting legislation permitting the formation and registration
of such associations, Congress provided an incentive to membership
by permitting such associations to adopt rules which preclude a member from dealing with a nonmember, except on the same terms and
conditions as the member affords the investing public. The NASD
has adopted such rules. Accordingly, membership is necessary to
the profitable participation in underwritings and over-the-counter

TWENTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

109

trading since members may properly grant price concessions, discounts
and similar allowances only to other members. Loss or denial of
membership due to expulsion or suspension or other ineligibility due
to a statutory disqualification, or to failure to meet standards of
qualification established in N.ASD rules, thus imposes a severe economic sanction .
.At June 30, 1959, there were 4,018 N.ASD members, an increase of
198 during the year, as a result of 542 admissions to and 344 terminations of membership. .At the same time, there were registered with
the N.ASD as registered representatives 77,917 individuals, including
generally all partners, officers, traders, salesmen and other persons
employed by or affiliated with member firms in capacities which involved their doing business directly with the public. The number of
registered representatives increased by 12,603 during the year as a
result of 19,071 initial registrations, 11,043 re-registrations and 17,511
terminations of registrations.
The membership and registered representative figures as of June 30, 1959, both represent all-time high
marks.
NASD Disciplinary

Actions

The N.ASD furnishes the Commission summaries of decisions on all
disciplinary actions against members and registered representatives
of members. Each such decision is considered by the Commission's
staff to determine whether the underlying facts indicate conduct in
violation of the statutes administered by the Commission or the rules
thereunder and whether the Commission should, on its own motion,
call up a particular case for review. This staff consideration often
includes an examination of the .Association's complete file on a particular case. Where such action appears warranted by the available
facts, independent Commission inquiry or action is initiated through
the appropriate regional office.
During the fiscal year the N.ASD forwarded to the Commission 248
disciplinary decisions on 209 formal complaint cases. It is not unusual for there to be more than one decision on a particular case for
all decisions of District Business Conduct Committees are appealable
to or reviewable by the Board of Governors which may affirm, modify,
or reverse such decisions or remand them for reconsideration. Final
.Association decisions were reported to the Commission during the
year in 175 formal complaint cases.
Each formal complaint must rest on allegations that a member firm
had violated specified provisions of the N.ASD Rules of Fair Practice,
although registered representatives of members and other persons
controlling or controlled by members may also be cited for violations
or for having been the cause of violations. Of the 175 decided cases,
103 were based on complaints solely against members. Eight such
complaints were dismissed on findings that the allegations had not

110

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

been sustained, whereas in 95 cases it was found that the alleged violations had occurred, and a penalty was imposed on the member. The
remaining 72 cases involved allegations of violations against the member firms concerned and 108 of their registered representatives or
associates. Two such complaints were dismissed as to the two members and three individuals concerned and 21 others were dismissed as
to the members involved, while 11 other individuals were found not
to have been guilty of the alleged violations. Violations were found
and a penalty was imposed on 49 members and 94 individual associates of members involved in this category of complaints. In all,
there were disciplinary decisions adverse to 144 members and to 94
registered representatives.
The penalties imposed included censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of the member or suspension Or revocation of the registration
of a registered representative and in some cases a finding that an individual had been a cause of an expulsion, suspension or revocation. In
many instances more than a single penalty was imposed and in a substantial majority of the cases some or all of the costs of the proceedings were assessed against those found to have acted improperly.
Thus 31 members were expelled; 4 were suspended for periods
ranging from 1 week to 18 months; the registrations of 28 registered
representatives were revoked and 9 were suspended, also from 1 week
to 18 months; and 16 individuals were held to have been the cause of
an expulsion, suspension, or revocation. Moreover, 88 members were
assessed fines as were 10 registered representatives, in amounts varying in each category from $25 to $5,000. The minimum penalty of
censure was imposed on 18 members and 18 registered representatives.
In the fiscal year the Association collected a total of $77,658.66 as a
result of fines and costs imposed in disciplinary actions. In some
cases, of course, fines or costs imposed on an expelled member or a
revoked representative are never paid.
In addition to disciplinary action by formal complaint procedure,
as described above, action was also taken against members pursuant
to the Minor Violation Procedure, provided in the Association's Code
of Procedure for Handling Trade Practice Complaints, for the disposition of disciplinary cases where the facts are not in dispute and
where the matter involves minor or technical violations of the rules
with no significant damage to customers or other parties. Under this
procedure a member charged with violation of the rules may waive a
hearing, admit the violations as alleged and accept a penalty not in
excess of censure and a fine of $100. A member's rights of appeal
are preserved as is the right of the Board of Governors to review
action by a District Business Conduct Committee. A member, however, is not required to follow the Minor Violation Procedure and may
elect to face formal charges and to require a hearing.

TWENTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

111

The Association reported to the Commission during the year the
disposition of 31 complaints pursuant to Minor Violation Procedure.
In 20 cases fines were imposed in amounts ranging from $25 to $100
and aggregating $1,325 and in 8 other cases the only penalty imposed
was censure. In another case after the member admitted alleged
violations and paid a fine of $100 under Minor Violation Procedure,
the Board of Governors remanded the case to the appropriate committee for formal complaint treatment on the grounds that minor
violation treatment was inappropriate where a member was charged
with the repetition of acts for which it had previously been disciplined. The remand resulted in the filing of a formal complaint
and a finding of violations for which a fine of $200 was imposed.
In two other cases members rejected Minor Violation Procedure
and required the filing of formal complaints. In one such case, the
member demonstrated to the committee's satisfaction at a hearing that
it had not acted improperly and the committee dismissed the complaint. In the remaining case, the member rejected an offer to admit
alleged violations and to pay a fine of $25. A formal complaint was
then filed and the district committee found violations and imposed
a $25 fine. The member appealed this decision to the Board of Governors which affirmed the findings of violations and increased the
penalty to a fine of $300 plus costs.
Commission Review of NASD Disciplinary Action

Section 15A(g) of the act provides that disciplinary actions by the
NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its own motion or
on the timely application of any aggrieved person. The effectiveness
of any penalty imposed by the NASD is automatically stayed pending determination in any matter which comes before the Commission
for review. At the beginning of the fiscal year, two such review cases
had been pending before the Commission. During the year eight other
such petitions were filed and three cases were disposed of, leaving
seven petitions pending at the year end.81
The Commission dismissed an application filed by Samuel B. Franklin & Company seeking review of disciplinary action by the Association which had found that the firm had violated the Association's
Rules of Fair Practice by selling securities to, and purchasing securities from, customers at prices which were not fair in view of all the
relevant circumstances."
An NASD District Committee had censured
the firm, fined it $1,000 and assessed costs amounting to $773.80. The
81 Tbe pending cases concerned applications filed by Sterling Securities Co., Marc Sterling, et al, (File 16--1A77) ; Raymond G. Challklan (File 16-1A79) ; A. J. Grayson & Co .•
Ine, and Albert J. Grayson (File 16-1A80) ; Gerald M. Greenburg and Robert Leopold

and Franz Bachmann (File 16-1A85).. After the close of the fiscal year, the L. C. Fisher
appltcatlon was remanded to the NASD for reconsideration on the joint request of the
NASD and Fisher .

112

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

NASD Board of Governors on appeal affirmed this action and assessed
an additional $153.29 in connection with the costs of the appeal.
According to the Commission's decision, the basic facts were not in
dispute. Out of 731 transactions in which Franklin & Co. as principal sold securities to customers during the period between January
and May 1956, not including sales of investment company shares and
other securities sold in a public offering pursuant to a prospectus, 642
transactions involved markups in excess of 5 percent. The company,
as principal, purchased securities from customers in 428 transactions
and in 159 of these transactions its markdown exceeded 5 percent. In
the 642 sales transactions the markups were more than 10 percent in
549 instances, more than 15 percent in 402 cases, more than 20 percent
in 260 transactions, and ranged from 30 to 62 percent in 99 cases. On
its 159 purchases from customers, the markdown in 68 transactions
exceeded 10 percent, in 32 it exceeded 15 percent, in 20 it exceeded
20 percent, and in 6 cases it ranged from 30 to 37 percent. In discussing the gross dollar amount of transactions, the Commission
pointed out that of the 731 sales, 498 were in the $100-$500 category,
and 108 each involved more than $500, and that of these 606 transactions, the markups were 30 percent or more in 55 cases and in excess
of 20 percent in 184 cases. The price range of the securities sold was
less than 10 cents per share in 127 transactions, less than 50 cents in
477 transactions, and less than $1 in 499 transactions.
These markups were computed on the basis of the firm's own cost
on same day or contemporaneous purchases of shares of the same
securities except that, in a relatively small number of instances where
such information was not available, the computations were made on
the basis of quotations obtained from the National Daily Quotation
Service. The markdowns on the firm's purchases from customers
were computed on the basis of same day or contemporaneous sales by
the firm of shares of the same securities for its own account.
The applicant urged, among other things, that most of the transactions involved purchases or sales of so-called "penny" stocks selling
for less than $1 per share; that in most cases the dollar value of a
transaction was small; that the NASD 5 percent markup policy should
not be applied to low priced securities sold in small dollar transactions; that it was justified in charging an amount over cost sufficient to cover expenses; and that its markups over cost were not
greater than the differences between the published bid and asked
quotations on typical penny stocks.
In its findings and opinion the Commission concluded that Franklin
& Co.'s pricing practices clearly were unreasonable, at least in those
transactions where the markups or markdowns were greater than 20
percent, as there was no showing of special circumstances such as unusual expenses, extraordinary services to customers or acquisition of

TWENTY-FIFTH

inventory at special concessions. The Commission sustained the
NASD finding that the firm had purchased and sold securities at
prices which were not fair under all the relevant circumstances and
which were not reasonably related to current market prices, that such
conduct was inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade
and that the penalties imposed were not excessive, having due regard
to the public interest."
Two other applications for review of Association disciplinary action were dismissed by the Commission, consideration having been
stayed pending determination of administrative proceedings against
the parties concerned. These petitions had been filed by Batkin &
CO.54and Churchill Securities Corp.55 Dismissal of the petitions as
moot followed action by the Commission revoking the broker-dealer
registration of Batkin & Co. and expelling it from the Association S6
and similar action as to Churchill Securities Corp."
Commission Review of NASD Action on Membership

Section 15A(b) of the act and the by-laws of the NASD provide
that, except where the Commission finds it appropriate in the public
interest to approve or direct to the contrary, no broker or dealer may
be admitted to or continued in membership if he, or any controlling
or controlled person, is under any of the several disabilities specified
in the statute or the by-laws. By these provisions Commission approval is a condition to the continuance in Association membership
of any broker-dealer who, among other things, controls a person whose
registration as a broker-dealer has been revoked or who was found to
have been a cause of a Commission order of revocation.
A Commission order approving or directing admission to or continuance in Association membership, notwithstanding a disqualification under section 15A (b) (4) of the 'act or under an effective Association rule adopted under that section Orsection 15A (b) (3), is generally
entered only after the matter has been submitted to the Association
by the member or applicant for membership. Where, after consideration, the Association is favorably inclined, it ordinarily files with the
Commission an 'application on behalf of the petitioner. A brokerdealer whose application is refused Association sponsorship, however,
may file an application directly with the Commission. The Commission reviews the record and documents filed in support of the application and, where appropriate, obtains additional evidence. At the
beginning of the fiscal year one such petition was pending before the

Commission; during the year six petitions were filed and three were
disposed of; and four were pending at the year end.
The three disqualified individuals whose employment was thus approved were: William A. Spanier," formerly president of Bennett,
Spanier & Co., Inc., a firm revoked as a broker-dealer and expelled
from the NASD by the Commission on May 28, 1952, on findings that,
among other things, it had engaged in manipulative activities and had
sold unregistered securities; S9 Kenneth E. Goodman," formerly sole
stockholder of Kenneth E. Goodman & Co., a firm similarly revoked
and expelled by the Commission on April 23, 1958, on :findings that it
had falsely stated its bank balance on its books and had effected securities transactions in violation of the Commission's net capital rule; 91
and Leonard H. Whitaker,92 whose registration as a broker-dealer had
been revoked by the Commission in 1952 because of certain securities
violations, including, among other things, the sale of unregistered
securities and conversion to his own use of a payment from a customer
for securities." Whitaker's employment by another NASD member
firm had earlier been approved by the Commission under specified
conditions. 94 This second approval petition was necessary because
Whitaker had changed employers. In each case the Commission found
it appropriate in the public interest to approve the NASD applications in view of all the circumstances, including the lapse of time and
supervision of the representatives.
LITIGATION UNDER TIlE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

In order to protect the public, the Commission is authorized to institute actions to enjoin broker-dealers and other persons from engaging in activities which violate the provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Some of these activities also violated provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and are discussed above.
Anti-Fraud Litigation

In discharging its obligation to prevent frauds upon the public, the
Commission filed a number of complaints during the past year. Final
judgment enjoining Louis E. Wolfson from further violating the antifraud and antimanipulative provisions of the Exchange Act was obtained." This case is discussed at length in the 24th Annual report.96

defraud the public and to manipulate the market of .American Motors
stock; that he and his associates caused to be published in a financial
newspaper an article stating that they owned 460,000 shares of that
stock at a time when they had disposed of 200,000shares, and that they
later caused an article to be published stating that Wolfson had disposed of one-quarter of his 400,000 shares and would sell the rest during the coming months. Wolfson, according to the complaint, omitted
to disclose that he had disposed of all his holdings in American Motors,
had in fact sold short, and was attempting to buy stock to cover his
short position. Judgment against Wolfson was entered by consent.
In E.E.O. v, Wilkes,91 the Commission's complaint charged violations of the short selling and antifraud provisions of the Exchange
Act and the Commission's rules in that defendant caused four brokerdealers to sell for his account on the American Stock Exchange an
aggregate of 29,100 shares of Hazel Bishop, Inc. common stock, by
falsely representing to the brokers that he owned such stock. A final
decree enjoining further violations of the act was entered on consent
of defendant,"
Three cases involved violations of the Exchange Act with regard
to over-the-counter sales. In E.E.O. v. McDonald 99 the complaint
alleged that the corporate defendant broker-dealer accepted moneys
and securities and represented that it would fulfill its obligation to
deliver securities or moneys due when in fact it could not and did not
intend to do so. Affidavits filed in support of a motion for a temporary
restraining order alleged, among other things, that a broker-dealer
firm had paid defendant $50,000 for the purchase of securities which
were never delivered, that employees of defendant stated that members
of the public had paid more than $250,000 for securities which were
not delivered, and that the Dayton Aviation and Radio Equipment
Corp., which had engaged defendant as underwriter for its offering
of some 500,000 shares of common stock, had received proceeds from
the sale of only 274,200 shares although in fact the whole issue had
been sold. A permanent injunction was obtained by default against
the firm and its president.
In E.E.O. v. Oampbell1°O and in E.E.O. v. Rosen 101 the Commission
charged defendant brokerage firms with accepting customers' orders
and deposits of money and securities upon the representation that
they were ready and able to meet all obligations, when in fact they
were insolvent and unable to meet current liabilities. Permanent
injunctions were entered in both cases,

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Cases under the Net Capital Rule

The "net capital rule" provides an important protection to investors
against loss of securities or monies, due to financial straits of brokerdealers, by requiring every broker-dealer to limit his aggregate indebtedness to all persons to 2,000 per centum of net capital. During
the year injunctions were obtained to enjoin broker-dealers from further violations of the net capital rule in S.E.O. v. Trigg,102 S.E.O.
v. Wagner,103 S.E.O. v. Sano?04 S.E.O. v. The Ohristopher Oorp.,105
8.E.O. v. Empire State Mutual Sales, !'lUJ./06 and 8.E.O. v. Green.107
In the Empire State and Green cases, and in S.E.O. v. Aronson 108
and S.E.O. v. Oa1'1'oll109the Commission charged defendants with violations of the fraud and record-keeping provisions of the Exchange
Act, as well as the net capital rule.
M. J. Shuck v. S.E.O., 264 F. 2d 358 (C.A. D.C., 1958), involved a
petition for review of a Commission order denying withdrawal and
revoking petitioner's registration as a broker-dealer. The Commission's revocation was based on findings that petitioner had been enjoined by a district court from violating the Commission's net capital
rule and that revocation would be in the public interest. The Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in affirming the Commission's
order, held, first, that the Commission had observed the fundamental
purposes of section 9(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act and,
second, that under the circumstances of this case, the Commission
properly found revocation was in the public interest. Service on the
petitioner of the temporary restraining order and the Commission's
complaint in the action for the preliminary injunction as well as the
issuance of the injunction itself met the requirement in 9 (b) that
written notice of the facts warranting a revocation be sent to the licensee prior to the agency proceeding. The Court stated that the
record shows that even prior to the district court proceedings the
Commission's staff had discussed with Shuck the matter of compliance.
In addition, the court proceedings, the Court held, afforded petitioner
a further opportunity to demonstrate compliance.
Moving to the merits of the case, the Court concluded that it is not
required that the injunction contain an express finding of wilfulness
as petitioner had contended where revocation is based on the entry
of an injunction. Evidence of wilfulness, however, might be considered by the Commission in applying the public interest criterion.
The record of Shuck's action in the past supported the Commission's

findings that the violation of the net capital rule was not unintentional
or inadvertent. This past record coupled with the District Court's
finding that Shuck would not maintain the required standards in the
future could properly justify the Commission's revocation for the
future protection of the investing public. Nor did the Court feel that
Shuck's expressed wish to withdraw from the securities business or
his alleged satisfaction of creditors precluded the Commission from
taking this step. The Court stated that the Commission could hold
its hearing which would reflect the facts shortly after they occurred
and take prompt and appropriate action without waiting until Shuck
re-entered into business. The Court of Appeals restated its ruling
in Hughes v, B.E.Opo that wilfulness means "no more than that the
person charged with the duty knows what he is doing."
Litigation Involving Broker-Dealer Registration and Reporting Requirements

Gilligan, Will &: 00., et alp V. B.E.O., 267 F. 2d, 461 (C.A. 2, 1959)
involved a petition for review of the Commission's order suspending
Gilligan, Will & Co. for 5 days from the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. for violations of section 5 of the Securities Act
and finding James Gilligan and William Will causes of the order.v'
Petitioners challenged the Commission's findings that they were underwriters with respect to 1955 and 1956 transactions in CrowellCollier debentures and stock. The Court upheld the findings and
conclusion of the Commission that the resale of securities contemplated and executed by petitioner was a distribution or public offering
and hence petitioners were underwriters.
The Court rejected petitioners' argument that they took for investment where they intended
to retain the stock only if the issuer continued to operate profitably.
Some of the cases brought by the Commission involved failure of
the defendants to file the reports required by the Exchange Act. In
B.E.O. V. Alexander L. Guterrna, and F. L. Jacobs 00.112 the complaint
sought to enjoin the company and its then president and controlling
stockholder, Guterma, from continuing to violate the antifraud and
reporting requirements of the 1934 Act and the antifraud and registration requirements of the 1933 act. After Guterma resigned and
disposed of his interest in the company, the new management consented to entry of a mandatory injunction ordering the company to
prepare and file with the Commission all information, documents
and reports required by the act.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Upon application of the Commission the District Court at New
York City appointed receivers for the assets of the company. Immediately thereafter a petition for reorganization under chapter X
of the Bankruptcy Act was filed and is now pending in the District
Court at Detroit, Mich. The Commission is participating in these
proceedings.
In B.E.O. v. Interworld T. V. Fiime, bW.,113 the court entered a
mandatory injunction requiring the filing of reports on Forms 8-K,
9-K, and lo-K and restraining future violations of the reporting
requirements. In a companion case, B.E.O. v. Guild Films 00.,114
the court ordered reports to be filed correcting a previously filed
Form 10-K and enjoined future violations.
A mandatory injunction was entered by consent in B.E.O. v, Peruvian Oil Concessione 00., Inc.,l1s requiring the company to file annual
reports for fiscal 1955, 1956and 1957.
In B.E.O. v. First Lewis Oorporationr" defendant was charged
with failing to make available for examination by representatives of
the Commission the books and records required to be kept by the
Exchange Act. The Court enjoined the defendant from doing business in securities while failing to make such books and records available. A permanent injunction was also entered in B.E.O. v, Bradford,117for failure to make available books and records and for failure
to file a report of the financial condition of a brokerage firm.
Proxy Litigation

The Commission appeared as plaintiff in one case of proxy litigation. In B.E.O. v. Central Founa1'Y 00., et al.,us the Commission obtained a court order delaying the effect of votes cast by stockholders of
the company at the Annual Meeting, charging both management and
the opposing Independent Stockholders Protective Committee with
violations of the proxy rules. The management filed a notice of appeal from the order and the case was set for hearing on the Commission's complaint. However, before any further action was taken, the
next Annual Meeting was held from which the stockholders' faction
emerged victorious by a substantial margin. Neither side was charged
with illegal practices in connection with the second meeting. The
management faction then stipulated to dismissal of its appeal. Thereupon the Commission stipulated to dismissal of its complaint.

mission found it necessary to bring a contempt action to enforce an injunction order previously obtained. The respondents were found in
civil contempt for failure to file the semi-annual report of the company required under the Exchange Act. The respondents consented
to payment of a $2,500 fine by the individuals. The company had
earlier paid $3,000 compensatory damages.
Participation as Amicus Curiae

As noted in the last annual report, the Commission filed briefs in
two cases in which the validity of rule 16b-3, insofar as it exempts
the exercise of stock options from section 16(b) of the Exchange Act,
was brought into question. In the first of these cases, Perlman v.
Timberlake, the judge of the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York declared in dictum that the rule is
invalid, but held that the defendants were protected from liability because of their good faith reliance upon the rule. The other case, Van
A.alten v, Hurley, now pending before another judge of the same
court, has not yet been decided.v"
In Taylor, et al. v, Janigan (USDC D. Mass, No. 85-1056), the
case arose out of the purchase by the President of Boston Electro Steel
Casting, Inc. of substantially all of the outstanding stock from the
shareholders. The plaintiffs brought suit under section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act and rule 10b-5 thereunder, charging that they were
induced to sell by defendant's misrepresentation.
The defendant
moved to dismiss on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction and failure
to state a cause of action. Defendant also argued that 28 U.S.C.
~
1331, which requires a $10,000 amount to be in controversy, governs
the implied right of action under the Exchange Act and the rules
under it.
The Commission filed a brief amicus curiae. The court supported
the Commission's arguments, denying the motion to dismiss. The
court stated that section 10(b) and rule 10b-5 gave rise to the cause of
action and to Federal jurisdiction, and that interveners need not comply with the requirement as to amount in controversy, because section
27 of the Exchange Act grants jurisdiction without reference to
amount.
1>0 After the close of the year the United States District Court for the Southern District
of Texas held, In Oontinental Oil 00. v, Perute, that the rule Is within the Commission's
exemptive authority.
The opinion expressly declined to accept the rationale of the
Timberlake case. In addition, the Van Aa/ten case was decided on JUly 30, 1959, but the
trial judge held that It was unnecessary to decide the validity of the rule, and declined
to express an opinion.

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOWING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935
The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 provides for the
regulation by the Commission of interstate public-utility holding
company systems engaged in the electric utility business or in the
retail distribution of gas. The matters dealt with embrace intricate
and complex questions of law and fact, and generally involve one or
more of three major areas of regulation. The first of such areas covers
those provisions of the act, contained principally in section 11 (b) (1),
which require the physical integration of public-utility companies and
functionally related properties of holding company systems, and those
provisions, contained principally in section 11 (b) (2), which require
the simplification of intercorporate relationships and financial structures of holding company systems. The second area of regulation
covers the financing operations of registered holding companies and
their subsidiaries, the acquisition and disposition of securities and
properties, and certain accounting practices, servicing arrangements
and intercompany transactions. The third area of regulation includes
the exemptive provisions of the act, the provisions covering the status
under the act of persons and companies, and those regulating the
right of a person affiliated with a public-utility company to acquire
securities resulting in a second such affiliation.
The staff functions under the act are performed in the Branch of
Public Utility Regulation of the Division of Corporate Regulation.
COMPOSITION OF REGISTERED HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMSSUMMARY OF CHANGES

On June 30,1959, there were 21 registered holding company systems
subject to regulation under the act. Of these, 3 systems, namely, (1)
Cities Service Company, (2) Electric Bond and Share Co., and (3)
Standard Gas and Electric Co., do not own as much as 10 percent of
the voting securities of any public-utility company operating within
the United States. The remaining 18 systems are referred to herein
as "active registered systems."
Included in the 18 active registered systems there were 19 registered
holding companies of which 13 function solely as holding companies
and 6 function as operating companies as well as holding companies,'
, In one of these systems there are two registered holding companies.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

During the fiscal year the Commission granted an exemption to
Central Public Utility Corporation, a registered holding company.
The exemption was granted pursuant to section 3(a) (5), which affords
exemption to companies having no domestic public-utility companies.
Further discussion of this matter is at page 132 of this report. Also
during the fiscal year American Electric Power Company, Inc., a
registered holding company, sold the assets of a subsidiary, The
Seneca Light & Power Company, to Ohio Power Company, another
subsidiary of American Electric Power. New England Electric
System disposed of one subsidiary, Pequot Gas Company, by sale
to a nonaffiliate.
While most of the section 11 problems existing at the time of the
passage of the act have been resolved, there still remain a substantial
number of issues which have not as yet been determined. Examples
are: In its order under section 11(b) (2) with respect to Cities Service
Company the Commission required that company to eliminate the
minority interest in its subsidiary, Arkansas Fuel Oil Corporation,
or to dispose of its holdings therein. A proceeding which is pending
before the Commission with respect to this matter is discussed at page
132 of this report. In its order under section 11(b) (1) with respect
to The Columbia Gas System, Inc., the Commission reserved jurisdiction concerning the retainability in the system of the properties of ten
companies (subsequently reduced to six) and in this connection there
is a proceeding pending before the Commission which is discussed at
page 126 of this report. There is a problem under section 11(b) (1)
of the act with respect to Consolidated Natural Gas Co. relating principally to the retainability of nonutility pipe-line properties. With
respect to Delaware Power & Light Co. there exists the question of
whether the gas and electric facilities are retainable under common
control. The Commission, by order dated April 14, 1950, directed
the disposition of the gas properties of Blackstone Valley Gas &
Electric Co., a subsidiary of Eastern Utilities Associates. This system
has pending before the Commission a plan designed to accomplish
the disposition of the gas properties required to be divested. That
matter is discussed at pages 126-127 of this report. There is pending
before the Commission an application filed by Electric Bond and
Share Company for an exemption pursuant to section 3 (a) (5) and
this matter is discussed on page 133 of this report. In the Middle
South Utilities, Inc., system there exist problems with respect to the
retainability of certain gas and transportation properties and the
elimination of a minority interest in a subsidiary. National Fuel
Gas Co. system has oil, real estate, and gas transmission businesses,
the retention of which has not been determined. There is also a
problem relating to a minority interest in one of its subsidiaries.

TWENTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

123

There is pending before the Commission a proceeding under section
l1(b) (1) of the act with respect to New England Electric System to
determine whether the system's gas properties are retain able together
with its electric properties," In addition there exists a problem in
respect of the minority interests in the common stock of five subsidiaries. There is a problem under section 11 (b) (1) of the act which
has not been resolved whether Utah Power & Light Co. may retain
its subsidiary, The Western Colorado Power Co.
The maximum number of companies subject to the act as components
of registered holding company systems at anyone point of time was
1,620 in 1938. Since that time additional systems have registered and
certain systems have organized or acquired additional subsidiaries,
with the result that 2,387 companies have been subject to the act as
registered holding companies or subsidiaries thereof during the period
from June 15, 1938, to June 30, 1959. Included in this total were
216 holding companies (holding companies and operating-holding
companies), 1,023 electric and gas utility companies and 1,148 nonutility enterprises.
From June 15, 1938, to June 30, 1959, 2,064 of
these companies have been released from the regulatory jurisdiction
of the act or have ceased to exist as separate corporate entities. Of
the remaining 323 companies, 176 are members of the 18 active systems
listed in the table on page 121 and 147 are members of the additional
3 systems named above at page 120, which are also subject to regulation
under the act.
Of the above-mentioned 2,064 companies 924 with assets aggregating
approximately $13 billion at their respective dates of divestment have
been divested by their respective parents and are no longer subject
to the act as components of registered systems. The balance of 1,140
companies includes 777 which were released from the regulatory jurisdiction of the act as a result of dissolutions, mergers and consolidations
and 363 companies ceased to be subject to the act as components of
registered systems as a result of exemptions granted under sections 2
and 3 of the act or the grant of orders pursuant to section 5 (d) of the
act finding such companies had ceased to be holding companies.
DEVELOPMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL REGISTERED SYSTEMS

There is discussed below each of the active registered systems
the other systems in which there occurred during the fiscal year
significant developments other than financing transactions.
financing activities of registered holding companies and their
sidiaries are treated below in a separate section of this report.

A. DEVELOPMENTS IN ACTIVE REGISTERED

SYSTEMS

American Electric Power Company, Inc.

At December 31, 1958, this system had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of some $1,391 million. The system had consolidated
operating revenues of about $296,547,000 for the calendar year 1958.
Although no significant corporate changes took place in the system
during the fiscal year, there was substantial activity with respect to
its expansion program and the financing arrangements therefor. This
system is the largest electric holding company system subject to the
act having generating capability of 5,432,000 kw. During the fiscal
year Ohio Power Company acquired the assets of The Seneca Light
& Power Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of American Electric,"
The system carries on research along many avenues of technology
and, during the fiscal year, continued to concentrate on nuclear research
and development based upon a long-term, rather than a short-term,
approach to the usefulness of atomic power. Three system companies
are members of the East Central Nuclear Group which consists of
14 utility companies in the general Ohio Valley area. This group
is in the process of developing a program involving research and
development of a high-temperature, gas-cooled, heavy water-moderated, pressure-tube reactor of 50,000 kw. capacity .. The AEP system's contribution to this project's pre-operational research and development is expected to be approximately $1,650,000 over a 5-year
period. If the reactor proves economically feasible and is built, an
additional contribution for post-operational
work is expected to
amount to about $650,000, likewise spread over a subsequent period
of 5 years. American Electric Power Co., Inc., is also a member of
Nuclear Power Group, Inc., and, as such, continues to derive technological and practical experience from the research and design activities in Commonwealth Edison Company's 180,000-kw. boiling-water
reactor being installed at Dresden, Ill. The plant is expected to be
in operation in 1960. Nuclear Power Group is contributing $15 million of the research and development cost of this plant, of which the
AEP system's share is approximately $3 million.
The system's service corporation designed and engineer the power
plants of Ohio Valley Electric Corp. American Electric owns 37.8
percent of the voting securities of OVEC, which, with its wholly
owned subsidiary, Indiana-Kentucky
Electric Corp., furnishes elec
tric power to an installation of the Atomic Energy Commission near
Portsmouth, Ohio. There was pending before the Commission at the
close of the fiscal year the issue of whether the acquisition of OVEC's
stock by American Electric and other sponsoring companies meets the
standards of section 10 of the act. This issue and the organization

American Natural Gas Co.

This registered holding company and its subsidiary companies, as
at December 31, 1958, had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves,
of approximately $693,121,000. The system had consolidated operating revenues of about $204,543,000 for the calendar year 1958.
On April 7, 1958, the Commission issued its findings and opinion
and order directing American Natural to take appropriate steps to
eliminate its outstanding $25 par value $6 nonredeemable preferred
stock from the holding company system.' In November 1958. American Natural filed a plan under section 11 (e) of the act to eliminate
such preferred stock by a payment of $32.50 per share to the holders
thereof. Public hearings on the plan have been concluded. Briefs
and replies thereto have been filed. Oral argument was heard on May
19,1959, and the matter was pending before the Commission for decision at the end of the fiscal year.
Central and South West Corp.

This registered holding {;ompany and its subsidiaries, as at December 31, 1958, had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, amounting to approximately $628,684,000. The system had total consolidated
electric operating revenues of about $146,806,000 for the calendar year
1958.
Three system subsidiaries are members of Texas Atomic Energy Research Foundation which consists of a group of 11 electric utility
companies in Texas. The Foundation was organized in 1957 for the
purpose of engaging in research in the atomic energy field as applied
to the generation of electric power. These system subsidiaries are
committed to contribute a total of about $1 million, of a combined
total of $10 million, for the research program which has for its object
studying heavy hydrogen or fusion reactions at high temperature
under controlled conditions. Two system subsidiaries have joined
with 13 other electric utility companies in the formation of Southwest
Atomic Energy Associates which, for research and development purposes is financing the construction of an epithermal thorium power
reactor.
The Columbia Gas System, Inc.

This registered holding company and its subsidiaries, at December
31, 1958, had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of about
$1,150,600,000. The consolidated gross operating revenues for the
calendar year 1958 were approximately $427,443,000.
During the fiscal year Columbia's wholly-owned subsidiary, Columbia Gulf Transmission Company, acquired the assets of Gulf Inter4

state Gas Company, a nonaffiliated company, in exchange for 3,574,337
shares of common stock of Columbia and the assumption by Columbia
Gulf Transmission Company of Gulf Interstate's liabilities, including
$141,400,000 of its publicly-held first mortgage pipeline bonds," The
assets acquired consist principally of 389 miles of pipeline which is
used to gather gas purchased by the Columbia system in Louisiana,
and 845 miles of transmission line, which is used to transport such gas
to eastern Kentucky where it is delivered to other facilities of the
Columbia system.
The Columbia system follows the policy of having its publicly-held
securities solely at the holding company level and the assumption of
the Gulf Interstate Gas Company bonds by a subsidiary of Columbia
was a departure from this policy, which, if allowed to continue, would
have resulted in the system having substantial amounts of long-term
debt at two separate levels, creating a pyramiding of system securities,
which was one of the evils the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935 was designed to prevent. To correct this situation, Columbia
has exchanged its debentures for the Columbia Gulf debentures,"
As indicated at page 132 of the 22d Annual Report there was pending before the Commission a motion filed by Columbia requesting
the release of jurisdiction with respect to the retain ability of certain
properties controlled by the system. Both the Division of Corporate
Regulation and Columbia have filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Division recommended that the Commission
should not, on the basis of the record so far made in the proceeding,
find the properties involved are retainable,
Columbia submitted that
the properties involved are properly a part of its integrated gas system or are reasonably incidental thereto and are retainable.
The
matter was pending at the close of the fiscal year.
Eastern Utilities Associates

TIllS registered holding company and its subsidiary companies, as
at December 31, 1958, had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves,
of about $105,396,000 and its consolidated operating revenues for that
year were approximately $33,059,000.
On April 4, 1950, the Commission issued an order directing EUA
to sever its relationship with the gas properties of its subsidiary,
Blackstone Valley Gas Company.'
In 1956 Valley Gas Co. was
incorporated for the purpose of acquiring and operating such gas
properties.
In February 1957, an application-declaration
was filed
covering several transactions designed to effectuate compliance with
the Commission's order of April 4, 1950. Included in the transactions was a proposal that EUA issue 25-year debt securities. The

Division of Corporate Regulation opposed the issuance of the longterm debt securities by EUA and on December 15,1958, the Commission published its findings and opinion in which it concluded that the
proposed bonds could not be approved," On February 6, 1959, EUA
filed a plan, pursuant to section 11(e) of the act, designed to accomplish the disposition of the Blackstone Gas properties, but which did
not include the issuance of long-term debt securities by EUA. Hearings on the plan were concluded and the matter was before the Commission for decision at the close of the fiscal year.
Middle South Utilities, Inc.

This registered holding company and its subsidiaries, as of December 31, 1958, had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, amounting to approximately $699,861,000. The system had total consolidated operating revenues for the year 1958 of above $182,927,000.
Hearings were held in 1957 with respect to issues related to the acquisition by certain companies, including Middle South, of the capital
stock of Electric Energy, Inc., an electric generating company which
has a long-term contract for the sale of firm power to an installation
of the Atomic Energy Commission. During the hearings, Middle
South, as a result of negotiations with Kentucky Utilities Company,
entered into a formal contract to sell its 10 percent stock interest in
EEl. Middle South filed a declaration under section 12(d) of the
act and rule 44 thereunder (file No. 70-3595), requesting Commission
permission to sell its stock interest in EEl and Kentucky filed an
application under section 10 of the act (file No. 70-3596) requesting
Commission approval to acquire such interest. The Middle SouthKentucky proposed transactions were consolidated with the pending
proceedings and a supplemental hearing was held.
On November 28, 1958, the Commission issued its findings and
opinion and order, pursuant to section 10, approving the acquisitions
by Union Electric Company, Illinois Power Company, and Kentucky
Utilities Company of their proposed respective interests in the EEl
stock. In addition, the Commission permitted Middle South's declaration for the sale of its interest in EEl to become effective,"
New England Electric System

This registered holding company and its subsidiaries, as at December 31, 1958, had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves of about
$600,135,000and, for that year the consolidated operating revenues
amounted to approximately $166,959,000.

NEES holding company system satisfied the integration standards of
section l1(b) (1) of the act.10 The hearing was initially devoted exclusively to the issue of whether or not the electric operations of the
NEES system constitute those of a single integrated public-utility
system within the meaning of section l1(b) (1). On February 20,
1958, the Commission issued its findings and opinion and order in
which it held that the electric properties of the NEES holding company system satisfied the standards delineating an integrated publicutility system." At the close of the fiscal year, there was pending for
further hearing and determination the question of whether the NEES
system may retain all or any of its gas properties.
In July 1958, NEES filed a plan under section 11 (e) of the act to
eliminate the minority interests in the common stocks of those of its
subsidiaries engaged solely in the electric business. Proceedings were
instituted by the Commission under section 11 (b) (2) for the purpose
of determining whether the existence of the public minority interests
in these subsidiaries constituted an unfair and inequitable distribution
of voting power and the two proceedings were consolidated for hearing and determination."
On May 14, 1959, the Commission approved
the plan 13 and on June 15, 1959, the plan was approved and ordered
enforced by the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts,"
The system holds a 30 percent stock interest in Yankee Atomic
Electric Company, which is constructing an atomic electric plant. The
organization of Yankee and its initial financing transactions are discussed at pages 162-164 of the 22d .Annual Report, and steps in the
formulation of Yankee's overall financing program are discussed on
pages 130-131 of the 23d .Annual Report. During the fiscal year the
Commission approved the permanent financing of Yankee 15 and the
plant is scheduled for completion in 1960. The total capital requirements of Yankee, including construction costs and working capital,
are estimated by Yankee at $57 million, of which $20 million will consist of first mortgage bonds, $17 million of unsecured promissory
notes and $20 million of common stock.

126-129 of the 23d Annual Report. In the Commission's order authorizing the acquisition of OVEC's securities, jurisdiction was expressly reserved to determine at an appropriate future time whether
the companies subject to the act could retain such securities."
On
November 19, 1956, the Commission reopened the proceeding and ordered a hearing in respect of the reserved issues." Hearings have
been completed and at the close of the fiscal year, the matter was in
process of preparation for submission to the Commission.
Ohio Edison and Pennsylvania Power and 12 other electric utility
companies are members of East Central Nuclear Group formed about
2 years ago to formulate plans for undertaking a program of nuclear
research and development. In December 1957, this group and Florida West Coast Nuclear Group presented a proposal to the Atomic
Energy Commission for research and development on a partnership
basis with that agency of a 50,OOO-kw.high-temperature gas-cooled,
heavy-water-moderated reactor of the pressure-tube type. It will be
designed as a prototype of a natural uranium 200,000 kw. reactor.
Subject to necessary regulatory approvals, Ohio Edison and Pennsylvania Power may be obligated to expend approximately $425,000
per year over the 1958-62 period in connection with preoperational
research and development.

which is to be owned equally by Alabama and Georgia. The estimated cost of the station, scheduled for completion in 1962, is $161
million and is to be financed by the issuance and sale of $105 million
of first mortgage bonds to the public, the balance to be supplied as
common equity by the owner companies. During the past fiscal year
the Commission approved the first issuance and sale of first mortgage
bonds of SEGCO in the principal amount of $25 million. The Commission noted in its findings and opinion that while SEGCO would not
be consolidated with Alabama or Georgia for the purpose of financial
reporting, nevertheless, for purposes of financial analysis, the Commission considered it appropriate to impute 50 percent of the outstanding publicly-held securities and of the surplus of SEGCO to
Alabama and 50 percent to Georgia."
On November 4, 1955, the Commission rescinded its previously issued order authorizing the issuance and acquisition of up to 55,000

of the Atomic Energy Commission. On November 28,1958, the Commission issued its findings and opinion and order granting approval of
the applications of Union Electric Company to acquire 40 percent, of
Illinois Power to acquire 20 percent, and of Kentucky to acquire 20
percent, of the common stock of Electric Energy, Inc., pursuant to
section 10 of the act and released the jurisdiction previously reserved
under that section. The Commission dismissed the application of
Central Illinois Public Service Company to acquire 20 percent of the
EEl stock on the ground that it was not, and would not become, as a
result of the proposed acquisition, an affiliate of EEl and of any other
public-utility company and that, absent such an affiliated relationship,
no approval of the acquisition of the common stock of EEl need be
obtained."
On March 26, 1956, Union Electric filed an application for exemption from the provisions of the Holding Company Act pursuant to
section 3 (a) (2) thereof. On January 13, 1959,Union Electric filed an
amendment to bring the exemption application up to date. The matter was pending at the close of the fiscal year.
In the fiscal year there were four cases before the courts arising out
of objections by J. Raymond Dyer, a stockholder of Union to solicitation of proxies by the company's management and by solicitation by
Dyer. For a discussion of the background of this litigation see the
24th Annual Report at pages 119-120. On April10, 19[;9,the Court
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the Commission's orders
entered in March 1958 allowing a declaration filed by management
to become effective as a basis for proxy solicitation for the 1958 stockholder's meeting." The Court rejected all of Dyer's numerous contentions On the merits and held that within the scope of its review
functions, there is nothing which the Commission did or failed to do
which would entitle petitioners to have the orders reversed. Moreover, the Court found that the questions presented had not become
moot or inoperative because the stockholder's meeting had been held.
As set forth in the 24th Annual Report, Dyer had filed a petition for
certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States to review the
Eighth Circuit's dismissal as moot of his petition for review of the
Commission's orders relating to Union's 1957 meeting." On May 18,
1959,the Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment and
remanded the case to the Eighth Circuit for further consideration in
view of that Court's opinion in the 1958 proceeding." At the end of
the fiscal year the case was pending before the Court for a decision on
the merits. In addition, Dyer has filed a petition to review the Com:n 32 S.E.C. 202 (1951).

B. DEVELOPMENTS IN OTHER SYSTEMS
Central Public Utility Corporation

This company registered under the act as a holding company in
1938, at which time the system consisted of 47 operating companies
located in 19 States and in areas outside of the United States. In
order to effectuate compliance with section 11 (b) of the act, the system consummated a number of section l1(e) plans and on June 1,
1955, filed an application for exemption under section 3(a) (5) of the
act, stating that it had disposed of all its domestic public-utility
subsidiaries and had substantially simplified its capital structure.
On April 3, 1959, following several amendments to and a hearing OIl
the application, the Commission issued an order granting Cenpuc an
exemption from the act,25subject to a number of terms and conditions,
which included consummation of a proposed consolidation of Cenpuc
with one or more companies within 6 months of the date of the order
(subsequently extended for 1 month) and the right of Cenpuc shareholders objecting to the consolidation to receive $28 per share in lieu
of shares of the consolidated corporation.
Cenpuc agreed that the
consolidation, in and of itself, would constitute a change of circumstances within the meaning of section 3 (c) of the act; thus, the Commission may revoke the exemption if the circumstances existing after
the consolidation prove to be detrimental to the public interest or the
interest of investors. Subsequent to the exemption order, Cenpuc
publicly announced and filed proxy material with the Commission
relating to a proposed consolidation of itself, Consolidate Electronics
Industries Corp., and Philips Industries, Inc. into a new corporation to be named Consolidated Electronics Industries Corp. and into
whose shares Cenpuc's capital stock would be converted on a share for
share basis. The Commission, after examining the proxy material,
released the jurisdiction which it had reserved thereover. On October 16, 1959, following the requisite stockholder approval, the proposed consolidation was consummated.
Cities Service Co.

On September 20, 1957, the Commission issued an order pursuant
to section 11 (b) (2) of the act requiring Cities to eliminate the 48.5
percent minority interest in Arkansas Fuel Oil Corporation or to dispose of its holdings of 51.5 percent," Cities, Ark Fuel and a stockholder of Ark Fuel petitioned the United States Court of Appeals

for the Third Circuit for review of the order. On July 22, 1958, the
Court affirmed the order of the Commission."
On September 18,
1958, Cities filed a plan pursuant to section 11 (e) for the purpose of
eliminating the minority interest in Ark Fuel. The plan provided
for division of the assets of Ark Fuel into two new campanies, one to
be owned by Cities and the other by the minority interest. Subsequently, the plan was withdrawn and a new plan filed providing for
the exchange of one share of Cities common stock for each 2.4 shares
of Ark Fuel common stock. Hearings on the latter plan were commenced on March 31, 1959, and were still in progress at the close
of the fiscal year.
Electric Bond and Share Company

Electric Bond and Share Company, which no longer holds as much
as 5 percent of the outstanding voting securities of any domestic
public-utility company, has pending before the Commission an application, filed pursuant to section 3 (a) (5) of the act, for exemption as
a holding company from provisions of the act. In the event such
exemption is granted, it is the intention of the company to convert
its status to that of an investment company and register under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. The proceeding on the exemption
application involves a number of very difficult and complex issues,
among which is the question as to whether Bond and Share, through
its wholly-owned engineering and consulting service company subsidiary, Ebasco Services, Incorporated, exercises controlling influence over, or is affiliated with, certain public-utility and holding
company clients of Ebasco which formerly were controlled by Bond
and Share. Hearings were concluded on March 26, 1959, and the matter was under advisement for decision by the Commission at the close of
the fiscal year.
Standard Gas and Electric Company

Standard Gas and Electric Company, a registered holding company,
was formerly a subsidiary of Standard Shares, Inc. On September
23, 1958, the Commission granted an application of Standard Shares
under section 5 (d) of the act for an order declaring it not to be a
holding company and its registration as such thereupon ceased to be
in effect.28 Standard Shares, formerly known as Standard Power and
Light Corp., upon the issuance of such order, completed its registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 and is subject to the requirements of that act and to the Commission's jurisdiction thereunder.

11(b) (2) of the act to liquidate and dissolve. Each of these registered
holding companies is in a position to effectuate dissolution except that
there exist undetermined questions relating to Federal income taxes
for the years 1942 through 1950.
Other Matters

As previously reported at pages 114-115 of the 23d Annual Report,
International Hydro-Electric System ("IHES")
was reorganized
pursuant to section 11(d) of the act and IHES is now registered as
an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940
and subject to the Commission's jurisdiction thereunder. The only
remaining matters under the Holding Company Act are fees and expenses to be awarded in connection with the reorganization. After
hearings, oral argument was heard by the Commission and the matter
was pending for decision at the end of the fiscal year.
There are also pending before the Commission applications for the
allowance of fees and expenses in connection with a plan filed and
consummated by The United Corporation pursuant to section 11(e)
of the act for its conversion into an investment company. Hearings
on such applications have been held, oral argument heard, and the
matter was under advisement for decision by the Commission at the
close of the fiscal year.
FINANCING OF ACTIVE REGISTERED
COMPANIES AND THEIR

PUBLIC UTILITY
SUBSIDIARIES

HOLDING

During the fiscal year 1959 active registered holding companies and
their subsidiaries sold to the public and to financial institutions, pursuant to authorizations granted by the Commission under sections 6
and 7 of the act, 25 issues of long-term debt and of stocks aggregating
$477 million." This is in contrast to fiscal year 1958 when there were
36 such issues with aggregate gross sales value of $583 million." All
but five 31 of the active registered holding company systems sold longterm debt or stock to the public in varying amounts and of various
types in fiscal 1959.
The following table presents by systems the financing by active
registered holding companies and each of their subsidiaries classified
by amounts and types of securities .
.. Debt securities are computed at their principal amount and stocks are taken at gross
proceeds to the company.
30 In fiscal 1959, all of the securities wei e sold to provide new capital.
In fiscal 1958,
two issues of debt securities, aggregating $36 million, were sold to refund other debt
securities carrying a higher Interest rate.
31These are Delaware Power & Light Company, Granite City Generating Company,
Philadelphia Electric Power Company, Union Electric Company, and Utah Power & Light
Company. Because of the nature of their business Granite City and Philadelphia required
no new capital, and Delaware, Union and Utah met their financial requirements through
the issuance of short-term notes.

In addition to common stock issued for cash listed in the above
table, The Columbia Gas System, Inc., through a subsidiary, exchanged with the public 3,574,373shares of its stock in connection with
the acquisition by the subsidiary of the assets of Gulf Interstate Gas
Company, a nonaffiliated natural gas pipeline company. The market
value of the stock at the time of issuance was approximately $78 million. This issuance was excepted from the competitive bidding requirements of rule 50, the Commission concluding that compliance
with competitive bidding was not necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers to
assure the receipt of adequate consideration or the reasonableness of
the fees or commission to be paid with respect to such issuance. Details of the transaction are more fully discussed at page 125 hereof.
The table also does not reflect the issuance of short-term notes to
banks by any of the system companies, nor does it include intrasystem financing represented by the issuance of securities by subsidiaries
to their holding companies. These issuances also required authorization by the Commission except in the case of the issuance to banks
of short-term notes having a maturity of less than 9 months where the
aggregate amount did not exceed 5 percent of the total capitalization of the company as defined in section 6 (b) of the act. The issuance of such securities is exempted by that section 6 (b).
It may be noted from the table that the total of $477 million is
made up of $194 million bonds, $80 million debentures, $18 million

preferred stock, and $185 million common stock. No bonds were sold
during the first half of the fiscal year; the three debenture issues
aggregating $80 million were sold during that period.
Competitive Bidding

All but 3 of the 25 issues sold for cash and listed in table I were
offered at competitive bidding pursuant to the requirements of rule
50.32 An order granting exception from competitive bidding was
entered in only one of the three instances, the other two being automatically excepted by paragraph (a) (1) rule 50.33 General Public
Utilities Corp., a registered holding company, issued and sold 530,000
shares of its $5 par value common stock for $20 million. This was a
nonunderwritten rights offering in connection with which it was
proposed that the unsubscribed shares would be sold through brokers
on the New York Stock Exchange. Although it appeared that the
sale of the unsubscribed shares would be exempt under paragraph
(a) (4) ,34 the Commission granted the company an exception from
the provisions of the rule to the extent it might become applicable to
the transaction."
Consolidated Natural Gas Company, also a registered holding company, sold 821,256 shares of its $10 par value common stock for $39
million. This was also a nonunderwritten rights offering to its stockholders and was automatically excepted from the competitive bidding
requirements by the provisions of paragraph (a) (1) of the rule. It
was not proposed that the unsubscribed shares be sold.
The remaining issue not sold through competitive bidding was the
issuance of $15 million of common stock by Yankee Atomic Electric
Company, a subsidiary of New England Power Company, which in
turn is a subsidiary of New England Electric System, a registered
holding company. New England Power Company purchased $4,800,000 of the issue and Montaup Electric Company, a subsidiary of
Eastern Utilities Associates, a registered holding company, purchased
$720,000thereof. The remainder of $9,480,000was purchased by the
other nine owner companies of Yankee Atomic Electric Company.
Since this stock was offered to existing stockholders, which had agreed
to subscribe for their pro rata share the transaction was excepted from
the rule pursuant to paragraph (a) (1) thereof.
During the period from May 7, 1941, the effective date of rule 50,
to June 30, 1959, a total of 767 issues with a sales value of $10,957
million were sold at competitive bidding under the rule. Those totals

Protective Provisions of First Mortgage Bonds and Preferred Stocks of Public
Utility Companies

In passing upon issuances of first mortgage bonds and preferred
stocks of public-utility companies, the Commission examines the
mortgage indenture and charter provisions to determine whether or
not there is substantial conformity with the applicable Statements of
Policy which were adopted by it in 1956.39 These Statements of
Policy represent substantially a codification of certain principles or

n The total number of issues in the table is 224 as compared with a total of 241 issues reported in the 23d Annual Report (page 137) for the penod ending June 30, 1957. In preparing the earlier report an exception was
counted as to each issue of securities.
Insome cases one order of exception was issued although the securities
were sold from time to time in seperate issues. To eliminate such duplication, the above table is prepared on
the basis of the number of exceptions granted from competitive bidding.
In addition, In the table in the 23d Annual Report there was a duplication in the number of exceptions
granted for issues of preferred stock. As a result, the total figure of 38 in the above table Is the same as in the
earlier table although there was one exception granted for preferred stock (Brockton Edison Co ) during the
fiscal year 1958 described at pages 127-128 of the 24th Annual Report.

policies prescribed for the protection of investors in these securities
developed on a case-by-case basis over a period of years, as modified
in the light of experience and comments received from interested
persons who had been invited to submit their views. Conformity
with the Statements of Policy is required except where deviations are
clearly warranted by the circumstances of a particular case."
During fiscal year 1959 applications or declarations with respect
to 17 first mortgage bond issues aggregating $248,950,000principal
amount, and three preferred stock issues with a total par value of
$10 million, were filed by public-utility companies under the act."
The Statement of Policy with respect to first mortgage bond issues
requires a restriction, under certain circumstances, on the distribution of earned surplus to common stockholders. In the case of 6 of
the 17 bond issues with respect to which applications were filed during
the fiscal year, existing indenture provisions adequately conformed
with this requirement of the Statement of Policy. In the case of nine
issues, an additional restriction was required and was either proposed
by the issuer or evolved in informal discussions between the Commission's staff and representatives of the issuer. The two remaining bond
issues were proposed by two newly-organized companies having no
previous records of earnings or dividends. In both cases, the indenture contained certain restrictions against future distributions of
earned surplus to holders of the common stock, all of which, in each
instance, was jointly held by groups of other utility companies. To
avoid unnecessary rigidity, the restrictive dividend provisions generally included the further provision that the restrictions could be
modified upon application of the issuer to, and approval by, the CommISSIOn.

A further provision contained in the Statement of Policy regarding
first mortgage bonds relates to the renewal and replacement of depreciable utility property which is subject to the lien of the mortgage.
It requires, in essence, that the issuer construct additions to its property, or else deposit cash or bonds with the indenture trustee, in an
amount which on a cumulative basis will provide for the replacement
in cash or property of the dollar equivalent of the cost of the depreciable mortgaged property during its estimated useful life. The Statement of Policy provides that the requirement be expressed as a
percentage of the book cost of depreciable property, except that if the
existing indenture provision expresses the requirement on a different
.. .Application of the Statements of Polley to filings from the effective date thereof to
June 30, 1958, are discussed In the 23d .Annual Report (pages 141-43) and the 24th
.Annual Report (pages 128-31).
41 Of the
17 bond Issues as to which applications or declarations were filed during the
fiscal year, 12 were Issued and sold to the public or financial Institutions during the fiscal
year as indicated in the table on p, 135, above: 3 were Issued and sold after the close of the
fiscal year; 1 Issue was withdrawn after approval by the Commission; and 1 issue was
sold to the issuer's holding companies and not to the public.

basis, as, for example, in terms of operating revenues, no change will
be required if the company can demonstrate that the existing provision provides an amount at least equal to a requirement based on
the book cost of depreciable property. As in the case of earned surplus restrictions, the Commission, in the interest of flexibility, has
permited the issuer to insert a provision under which the issuer, upon
application to, and approval by, the Commission may modify the
percent of depreciable property requirement.
Of the 17 bond issues, the indentures of 12 expressed the renewal
and replacement fund requirement as a percent of depreciable propeity which was deemed to be appropriate; the indentures of 4 expressed the requirement as a percent of revenues and were found
acceptable by the Commission since they appeared to afford at least
as much protection to the bondholders as would be afforded by an appropriate percent-of-property formula; and the indenture of the remaining 1 bond issue contained no renewal and replacement fund requirement in view of another requirement of the indenture-unusual
for an electric utility company-for a 100 percent cash sinking fund
repayment of the bonds by the maturity date thereof."
During the fiscal year 1959, the Commission has continued to adhere to the principle, set forth in the Statements of Policy for both
bonds and preferred stocks, that the securities be freely refundable at
the option of the issuer upon reasonable notice and payment of a
reasonable redemption premium, if any.43 An exception was made
by the Commission in the case of Yankee Atomic Electric Company,
a new company organized for the purpose of building and operating
an experimental nuclear power plant in New England. In light of
the unusual circumstances of the construction and financing of the
plant, the Commission approved an indenture covenant providing
that none of the company's proposed $20 million principal amount
of first mortgage bonds could be redeemed for refunding purposes
during the period of plant construction; that during a 5-year period
thereafter the bonds could be refunded only upon payment of redemption premiums higher than customary under the Commission's
usual standards; but that following such 5-year period the bonds
would be freely refundable by the company upon payment of the
normal lower scale of redemption premiums."
Continuing studies made by the Commission's staff of electric and
gas utility bond issues sold at competitive bidding indicate that restrictions on free refundability of bonds have had no significant bear.. The usual sinking fund provision for electric utlllty bonds, wblch generally have a
30.year maturity, provides for annual sinking fund payments aggregating, over the life
of the Issue, approximately 30 percent of the principal amount of the bonds .
•• The significance of the refunding privilege, both as a matter of conformity with the
standards of the act and as a matter of practical finance, was discussed at Rome length
In the 24til Annual Report, at page 130.
.. Holding Company Act Release No. 14025 (June 12,1959),

ing upon the interest cost to the issuer." The staff's studies also indicate that the presence or absence of a restriction on free refundability has not affected the number of bids received by an issuer at
competitive bidding or the ability of the winning bidder to market
the bonds. These findings were based on an examination of all electric and gas utility bond issues (including debentures) sold at competitive bidding between May 14, 1957, and June 30, 1959, by companies subject to the Holding Company Act as well as those not so
subject. It was on the former date that a public-utility company not
subject to the Holding Company Act instituted a practice, which has
been followed in competitive bidding by various other public-utility
companies not subject to the Holding Company Act, of including a
provision prohibiting the issuer, during a period of years, generally
five, from refunding its outstanding bonds at lower interest rates.
During the above period, there was a total of 178 electric and gas
utility bond issues offered at competitive bidding, aggregating
$3,763 million principal amount. The refundable issues numbered
137 and accounted for a total of $2,507 million, while the nonrefundable issues-all except 1 being nonrefundable for a period of 5 years,
and the one being nonrefundable for a period of 7 years-numbered
41 and totaled $1,256 million principal amount. The number of
refundable issues thus represented 77 percent of the total number of
issues, while, in terms of principal amount, the refundable issues
accounted for 66.6 percent.
The weighted average number of bids received on the refundable
issues was 4.56, while on the nonrefundables it was 4.27. The median
number of bids on both groups was the same-i.e., 4. With respect to
the success of the marketing of the bond issues, an issue was considered
to be successfully marketed if at least 95 percent of the issue was sold
at the syndicate price up to the date of termination of the syndicate.
On this basis, 75.2 percent of the refundable issues were successful,
while 73. 2 percent of the nonrefundables were successful. In terms
of principal amount, 73.0 percent of the refund ables were successful,
while 74.7 percent of the nonrefundables were successful. Extension
of the comparison to include the aggregate principal amounts of all
issues which were sold at the applicable syndicate prices up to the
termination of the respective syndicates, regardless of whether particular issue met the definition of a successful marketing, indicates
that 89.2 percent of the combined principal amount of all the refundables were so sold, as compared with 89.1 percent for the nonre:fundables. The substantially similar statistics developed in respect of the
two groups of bond issues support the Commission's policy of requir-

ing free refundability of utility bond issues subject to the Holding
Company Act.
In the 24th Annual Report, mention was made (at page 131) of a
comprehensive study of redemption provisions of corporate bonds
being conducted at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce
of the University of Pennsylvania, and that a member of the staff
of the Commission was serving on an advisory committee with respect to such study. A preliminary draft report on the study was
completed shortly after the close of fiscal year 1959.
Of the three preferred stock issues with an aggregate par value of
$19 million with respect to which applications or declarations were
filed during the fiscal year, two issues had charter provisions in substantial conformity with the Statement of Policy. The other issue
failed to conform in certain respects relating to, among other things,
restrictions against (a) amending the charter in a manner adverse to
the preferred stockholders, (b) mergers or consolidations, (c) reacquisitions by the issuer of any of its outstanding preferred stock,
and (d) issuance or assumption of short-term unsecured debt.
Accordingly, the Commission, in approving the proposed issue of
preferred stock, conditioned its order so as to require the necessary
investor protection."

PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED
The role of the Commission under chapter X of the Bankruptcy
Act, which provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the
United States district courts, differs from that under the various statutes which it administers in that the Commission does not initiate
chapter X proceedings or hold its own hearings. It has no authority
to determine any of the issues in these proceedings. However, at the
request of the judge or on the Commission's own motion, if approved
by the judge, the Commission may participate in such proceedings in
order to provide independent, expert assistance to the court and investors on matters arising in such proceedings and, where the Commission considers it appropriate, it may file advisory reports on reorganization plans. Thus, the facilities of the Commission's technical
staff and its disinterested recommendations are simply placed at the
service of the judge and the parties, affording them the views of disinterested experts in a highly complex area of corporate law and
finance. The Commission pays special attention to the interests of
public security holders, who may not otherwise be effectively represented.
In any case where the scheduled indebtedness of a debtor corporation does not exceed $3 million, the judge under section 172 of chapter
X may, before approving any plan of reorganization, submit such plan
to the Commission for its examination and report. If the indebtedness
exceeds $3 million, the judge must submit the plan to the Commission
before he may approve it. "Wherethe Commission files a report, copies
of it, or a summary thereof, must be sent to all security holders and
creditors when they are asked to vote on the plan. The Commission
has no authority to veto or require the adoption of a plan of reorganization and is not obligated to file a formal advisory report on a
plan.
The Commission's advisory reports on plans of reorganizations are
usually widely distributed and serve an important function. However, they represent only one aspect of the Commission's activities in
cases in which it participates. The Commission, as a party to a chapter
X proceeding, is actively interested in the solution of every major
issue arising therein and the adequate performance of its duties re142

'l'WENTY-FIFTH

143

quires that it undertake in most cases intensive legal and financial
studies. Even in cases where the plans are not submitted to the Commission and no report is filed, the Commission must consider various
reorganization proposals of interested parties while plans are being
formulated, and be prepared to comment fully upon all plans that are
the subject of hearings for approval or confirmation.
In the exercise of its functions under chapter X the Commission
has endeavored to assist the courts in achieving equitable, financially
sound, expeditious and economical readjustments of the affairs of
corporations in financial distress. To aid in attaining these objectives the Commission has lawyers, accountants and financial analysts
in its New York, Chicago and San Francisco regional officeswho keep
in close touch with all chapter X hearings and issues. Supervision
and review of the regional officers'chapter X work is the responsibility
of the Division of Corporate Regulation of the Commission, which
also handles the actual trial work in cases arising in the Atlanta and
Washington, D.C., regional areas.
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

The Commission actively participated in 49 reorganization proceedings involving 69 companies (48 principal debtor corporations and
21 subsidiaries of those debtors) during the past fiscal year.' The
stated assets of these 69 companies totaled approximately $583,626,000
and their indebtedness totaled approximately $540,501,000. The proceedings were scattered among district courts in 18 states, as follows:
11 proceedings in New York, 6 in Illinois, 5 in Kentucky, 4 in Nevada,
3 in Pennsylvania, 2 each in Florida, Texas and Oklahoma, and 1 each
in Washington, Iowa, Virginia, Maryland, North Dakota, New Jersey,
Louisiana, Connecticut, Colorado, and Utah, During the year, the
Commission entered its appearance in 14 new proceedings under
chapter X involving companies with aggregate stated assets of approximately $62,037,000and aggregate indebtedness of approximately
$39,165,000. They involved the rehabilitation of companies engaged
in such varied businesses as uranium mining, motion picture production, hotel and country club operations, and the manufacturing of
precision instruments, building materials and miscellaneous product s.
Proceedings involving 4 principal debtor corporations were closed
during the year. At the end of the year, the Commission was actively
participating in 45 reorganization proceedings involving 67 companies.
THE COMMISSION AS A PARTY TO PROCEEDINGS

The Commission has not considered it necessary or appropriate that
it participate in every chapter X case. Apart from the fact that the
1 The appendix contains
a complete list of reorganization proceedings in wbieb the Commission participated as a party during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1959.

144

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE CO,MMISSION

administrative burden of participating in every one of the approximately 90 cases instituted during the fiscal year would be unsurmountable with its present staff, many of the cases involve only trade or bank
creditors and a few stockholders.
The Commission has sought to
participate principally in those proceedings in which a substantial
public investor interest is involved. This is not the only criterion,
however, and in some cases involving only limited public investor interest, the Commission has participated because an unfair plan had
been or was about to be proposed, the public security holders were not
adequately represented, the reorganization proceedings were being
conducted in violation of important provisions of the act, other facts
indicated that the Commission could perform a useful service or the
judge requested the Commission to participate.
PROCEDURAL

MATrERS

The Commission, when a party in chapter X proceedings, has been
diligent to urge upon the court the procedural safeguards to which all
parties are entitled. The Commission also attempts in its interpretation of the statutory requirements to encourage uniformity in the
construction of chapter X and the procedures thereunder.
Prior to the filing of an involuntary petition for the reorganization
of the F. L. Jacobs Oompany in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Michigan," the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York appointed receivers for the d~btor
company to preserve its assets and to protect the interests of the stockholders, creditors, employees and the general public. This receivership grew out of an extensive investigation by the Commission's New
York regional officewith regard to possible violations of the Securities
Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. An injunction
to restrain the receivers was issued by the United States District Court
in Michigan on March 23, 1959. The receivers petitioned that court to
dismiss the chapter X petition on the grounds that it was collusively
filed and that the debtor's principal place of business was New York,
or in the alternative, to transfer the proceeding to New York. The
Commission participated in the hearing to develop the facts regarding
the debtor's place of business.
'
The court held that the petition was properly filed and denied the
relief requested. An appeal by the receivers was pending in' the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit at tile close of
the fiscal year.
There was also a venue problem in the proceeding involving Verdi
Development Oompany, whose common stock was withdrawn in 1958
from listing and trading on the San Francisco Mining Exchange by
Commission order.
• In the Matter oj F. L. Jacob« Company

(No. 42235).

TWENTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

145

The debtor filed a petition for reorganization in the United States
District Court of Nevada and the Commission filed a motion to transfer the case, on the ground that the company's principal place of business was not, as alleged, in Nevada. This motion became moot because
the Court dismissed the petition. A new petition, filed in the Central
District of Utah, was approved,"
The appeal in the Selected Investments case 4 involved the questions
whether public investors in a trust fund were creditors, despite provisions in their "certificate bonds" consistent with those of an equity
security, and whether the separate entities of the trust fund and the
corporation controlling it could be disregarded where the corporation's
only business was the management of the fund and where, in the sale
of the certificate bonds to public investors, the corporation had led the
investors to believe that they were lending their money to it. The
Commission supported the trustee in successfully urging the Court
of Appeals to affirm the District Court's order approving the petition
for reorganization."
In the Shanoano Development Oorporation case," the Commission
sought the removal of the president of the debtor as additional trustee
on the ground that he was a substantial stockholder and creditor of
the debtor, and so was not a disinterested person as required by sections 156 and 158 of chapter X. In addition, it was urged that no
operations were being conducted by the debtor and hence there was
no need for an operating trustee. The additional trustee resigned
after the Commission's motion was filed.
Under the act, the trustee's counsel, like the trustee himself, must
be disinterested, since each plays a key role in the reorganization.
In the previously mentioned J Mobs case the Commission took the
position that the attorney for the trustees was not disinterested. The
Commission stated that the trustees' attorney had actively collaborated
with the attorney for the debtor who had referred to him two of the
three petitioning creditors, that he had first appeared as attorney
for the petitioning creditors, and that these facts indicated the existence of a materially adverse interest. The attorney resigned while
a decision on an application for his removal was pending.

distribution of one-third of the assets of the debtor to the creditors.
The Commission, joined by certain creditors, objected on the ground
that a liquidation of such a substantial portion of an estate undergoing a reorganization could be accomplished only pursuant to a
plan of reorganization, but the judge overruled these objections. The
Commission joined a creditor on a motion for a stay to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. The appellant's request that no supersedeas bond be required was supported by the
Commission on the ground that to require a bond in a matter such as
this would in effect defeat the right of creditors and stockholders to
take appeals under chapter X." On January 30, 1959, the Court of
Appeals stayed the distribution, but the matter became moot with
the confirmation of a plan of reorganization in July 1959.
In the Swan Fi1Wh Oil Oorporation case," the court had enjoined
Doeskin Products, Inc., a former subsidiary of the debtor, from transferring any of the stock or assets of Keta Gas & Oil Company, which
had been a wholly-owned subsidiary of the debtor. There had been a
purported transfer of 1,140,390shares of Keta to Doeskin in exchange
for 800,000 shares of Doeskin stock. The trustees secured an order
requiring Doeskin to show cause why it should not be required summarily to turn over the Keta stock and its assets to the trustees.
Doeskin and Keta moved the court to vacate this order on the grounds
(1) that the court lacked jurisdiction over Keta-; and (2) that since
Doeskin had a substantial adverse claim to the Keta stock and assets,
summary jurisdiction did not lie. Evidence at the hearings indicated
the Keta stock and assets were turned over to Doeskin in an unauthorized manner and that consequently Doeskin had no valid claim to the
stock and assets. The Commission contended that Doeskin knew or
should have known of the unauthorized nature of the transaction, and
that under these circumstances, the reorganization court had summary
jurisdiction to determine the question of title. The court denied the
trustees' motion for a summary order and an appeal was taken. The
Commission filed a brief expressing the view that the trustees' position
was correct."
In the Ludman. Corporation. case," certain creditors petitioned the
court to adjudicate the debtor a bankrupt. As a result of the Commission's representation that there was a good possibility the company
could be successfully reorganized, the reorganization proceeding was

of Equitable Plan Company (S.D. Cal., Cen. Div. No. 86096-BH),
where the trustee petitioned the court for authority to pay a dividend of 20% on unsecured
pre-chapter X debts of $9,725,083 which would have amounted to 83% of the debtor's
cash and 33% of Its current assets.
The Commission took the position that this
proposed dividend would be a payment out of funds provided by liquidation of loans and
not from the earnings of the company and was in effect a liquidation without a plan.
A dividend of 10% was approved by the court.

continued. A plan was subsequently filed with the court and referred
to the Commission for an advisory report, which was under consideration at the end of the year.
TRUSTEE'S

INVESTIGATIONS

A complete accounting for the stewardship of corporate affairs by
the old management is a requisite under the Bankruptcy Act and
chapter X. One of the primary duties of the trustee is to make a
thorough study of the debtor to assure the discovery and collection of
all assets of the estate, including claims against directors, officers, or
controlling persons who may have mismanaged the company's affairs,
diverted its funds to their own use or benefit, or been guilty of other
misconduct. The staff of the Commission participates in the trustee's
investigation so that it may be fully informed as to all details of the
financial history and business practice of the debtor. The Commission views its duty under chapter X as requiring it to call the attention
of the trusteee, or the court if necessary, to any matters which should
be acted upon.
In the Texas Portland Oement Oompany case," the Commission
participated in an extensive investigation under section 167 by
the trustees into the tangled financing of the debtor and related
questions. The debtor had initially sold 500,000shares of unregistered
stock to residents of Texas. It issued approximately 400,000 additional shares in bonuses, commissions for assistance in procuring loans,
and special transactions with promoters and creditors. At the suggestion of counsel for the Commission the trustees secured injunctions
against the transfer of most of the additional shares by the holders
thereof, pending determination of the validity of their issuance and
other questions involved."
The trustee's investigations in the reorganization proceedings involving Selected Investments Corporation and Selected Investments
Trust Fwrul,14 disclosed that the debtor had been subjected to fraudulent mismanagement by its officersand directors. The trustee obtained
a judgment against these corporate insiders for approximately $12
million in damages, on which some recovery has been had, and suits
are pending against the bonding companies for the balance."

PROTECTIVE

COMMITTEES

The Commission has constantly been alert to insist upon the honesty
of fiduciaries in their relationship to the estate and to investors, and

has always sought to disqualify security holder committees subject to
a conflict of interest from acting in chapter X proceedings.
In the above mentioned Selected Investments T1'U8t Fund and Selected Investments Uorporation case, a committee formed to represent
certificate holders of the trust fund, had solicited from public investors
$1 for each $1,000 of thrift certificates. Commission counsel objected
to this solicitation and the court required the committee to return all
funds received." After the committee qualified as a duly constituted
committee, representing approximately 3,000 certificate holders whose
claims exceed $16 million, it applied to the court for permission to
solicit contributions from certificate holders to finance its activities.
The Commission contended that the committee should be denied the
right to make mass solicitations, recommending that the committee
make appropriate arrangements for the financing of its activities by
contributions from its members or individual security holders. The
Commission's contention was upheld.
In the Texas Portland Oement Oompany case," a common stockholders' committee, composed of a New York attorney and four of his
relatives, attempted to solicit powers of attorney from stockholders
generally. The Committee members had acquired their stock in one of
the transactions being investigated by the trustees, in settlement of a
relatively small cash advance to the debtor, and the committee chairman was asserting a large unliquidated claim against the debtor for
services and expenses allegedly rendered in procuring a mortgage commitment which the debtor had rejected. The Commission joined with
the trustees in opposition to recognition of this committee, on the
ground of the conflict between the interests of its members and those
of common stockholders generally.
The District Court ruled that
the committee was disqualified to act as a representative of stockholders. There has since appeared in the proceedings another common stockholders' committee, composed of local stockholders who
acquired their shares in the original public offering.
Some of the members of a creditors' committee in this proceeding
owned stock of the debtor either directly or indirectly.
The Commission joined the trustees in opposition to the recognition of this
committee because of the conflict of interests involved in the dual
status of committee members. This committee also was disqualified.
ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD TO ALLOWANCES

Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem
of determining the allowance of compensation to be paid out of the
debtor's estate to the various parties for services rendered and ex.. 24th Annual Report or the SecurIties and Exchange Commission,

penses incurred in the proceeding. The Commission, which under
section 242 of the Bankruptcy Act may not receive any allowance
from the estate for the services it renders, has sought to assist the
courts in protecting debtors' estates from excessive charges and at the
same time equitably allocating compensation on the basis of a claimant's contribution to the administration of an estate and the formulation of a plan.
In the Third Avenue Transit Corporation case the District Court
granted fees and expenses totaling $2,068,505. The Commission had
recommended awarding fees and expenses of $1,818,476, and upon appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, that Court set
the amount at $1,849,005.18 In so doing, the Court listed the factors
which bear on the granting of allowances in reorganization cases:
(a) economy of administration, (b) the burden the estate can safely
bear, (c) value of the services, (d) duplication of service by counsel
representing the same interests, and (e) the reasonableness and fairness of the compensation to each applicant. It noted that the recommendations of the Commission "are entitled to great weight."
The District Court had found that an oral agreement between an
attorney and a firm to share equally in the compensation they received
:from the reorganization contemplated as well as an equal division of
work. The Court of Appeals upheld in principle the award by the
district judge of separate compensation to each. The Court of Appeals also upheld the Commission's contention that section 249 of the
Bankruptcy Act prevented the awarding of a fee where the fee applicant had pledged securities of the debtor after assuming to act in a
representative or fiduciary capacity in a reorganization and the securities were subsequently sold.
In this case, further, the wife of an attorney in the reorganization
had sold securities of the debtor. The District Court found that the
wife's decision to sell was based on the advice of her investment
broker and not on any inside information possessed by the husband
and held that section 249 did not bar a fee to the attorney although
he had knowledge of the sale of the securities by his wife. The Commission took the position that a fee should be denied the attorney since
he had knowledge of his wife's transaction and derived an indirect
benefit from it. The Court of Appeals sustained the Commissions
position and held that the facts warranted
the statutory
disqualification. IS
In the Stardust, Inc. case," the court confirmed a plan of reorganization which provided for a sale to reorganized Stardust, Inc. of a
group of five hotel units, in various stages of completion, for $1,500,000

cash and a $2,800,000note secured by a deed of trust on the properties.
Subsequently it appeared that the costs for completion had been underestimated and, as a result, the reorganized Stardust was unable to
meet the first payment on the note. A petition for modification was
approved by the court under section 222 of chapter X.
Applications for fees and expenses in connection with the modification of the plan aggregated $58,460. The Commission took the
position that the creditors, preferred stockholders, and the trustee and
his counsel were primarily interested in preserving the terms previously determined and fixed under the plan, and that the modifications, as amended, were essentially a compromise and reflected, in
greater or lesser degree, the efforts of all participants.
Under a commitment pursuant to order of the Court, the proponent of the modification, who was in control of the reorganized debtor, was obligated to
pay the fees and expenses in connection with the modification. The
Commission urged that nevertheless chapter X standards should be
followed, in accordance with the provisions in section 221(4) which
make "all payments ... promised by the debtor or by a corporation ... acquiring property under the plan or by any other person"
subject to the governing standards of chapter X. The Commission
recommended fees totalling $2'3,860, and the judge awarded the applicants $29,881P
In the Adolf Gobel, Inc. case," applications were filed for fees in
the aggregate amount of $374,370. The Commission submitted its
recommendations aggregating $170,000 and the court awarded
$1'1'8,000. The Commission recommended denial of compensation to
the debtor's attorneys who also acted as attorneys for the principal
stockholder and plan proponent, and to an attorney for an individual
creditor whose claim was the subject of litigation, asserting that
the activities of these attorneys were principally for the benefit
of their clients and only collaterally of benefit to creditors generally,
and therefore each should look to his client for his compensation.
The court denied these requests for allowances.
ADVISORY REPORTS ON PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

During the fiscal year, the Commission issued two advisory reports
and one supplemental advisory report. Such reports represent the
principal means by which the Commission records its views publicly.
Generally speaking, an advisory report is prepared only in a case involving a substantial public investor interest and in which significant
problems exist. On occasion, because of the exigencies of time or for
other reasons, no written report is filed but instead Commission

counsel makes a detailed oral presentation of the Commission's views
and the reasons therefor.
Usually advisory reports are prepared at the close of the hearings
after the completed record contains sufficient material upon which to
formulate an opinion as to a plan's fairness and feasibility. However,
in the reorganization proceeding involving Alaska Telephone Oorporation/a the judge requested the Commission to prepare written comments on three proposed plans of reorganization and to submit them to
the court prior to hearings on the plans. In his decision, the judge
followed rather closely the lines of analysis and comments in the
memorandum submitted to the Court by the Commission.
In proceedings in Nevada for reorganization of the San Souci resort hotel 24 the Commission advised the court on four plans of
reorganization. Only two plans were considered worthy of consideration and the Judge requested that additional views be presented
orally by Commission counsel on these plans. The trustee's plan
contemplated an arrangement providing an extension of maturities on the senior debt, and conversion of junior debt to stock. The
second plan also contemplated amortization of the existing debt, but
on different terms.
A feasible plan under chapter X requires a debt structure reasonably geared to prospective earnings. The Commission felt that the
plans were not feasible on an earnings valuation, and that under the
proposed plans the debtor would be insolvent or on the brink of insolvency at the very beginning of its new life. However, the court
approved the trustee's plan and submitted it to the creditors for
acceptance.
On February 25, 1959, the Commission filed objections to a plan
of reorganization proposed in the Selected Investments Oorporation
and Selected Investments Trust Fund case." Under the plan, the
debtor would have transferred some $10 million of assets to a new
corporation which would engage in the general loan and finance business. Creditors of the debtor were to receive $5 million of preferred
stock of the new corporation and $5 million in cash which was to be
borrowed by the new corporation. Additional capital was to be provided to the new corporation through the private sale of $500,000of
common stock. The Commission pointed out, among other things,
that creditors would only be entitled to elect a minority of the board
of directors for their $5 million investment, whereas purchasers of the
$500,000 of new common stock would elect a majority of the board.
The Commission also questioned the feasibility of the plan. The plan
was approved by the court and accepted by the requisite majority of

creditors but it was not confirmed by the court due to the filing of a
new plan of reorganization.
On April 23, 1959, the Commission filed an advisory report on the
second plan of reorganization. The new plan proposed that the reorganized debtor issue to the certificate holders $11 million in 20-year
debentures and 16,500,000shares of common stock, $1 par value per
share, out of a total of 18,150,000shares to be authorized. The remainder of the 1,650,000shares was reserved for options to proposed
management.
The stock options contemplated by the plan provided that the stock
would be available to certain specified persons at $1 per share for
5 years. The plan also provided that there would be a restrictive
stock option to employees at the same price as the options to proposed
management.
The Commission stated that the amended plan was not fair in a
number of respects, particularly in that it would permit creditors desiring to withdraw and receive cash to receive the same amount as
those who stayed in and took securities. The Commission also expressed doubts as to the propriety of including stock options in a
plan of reorganization and urged that they be eliminated completely
or substantially modified.
In a supplemental report following amendments to meet the Commission's recommendations, the Commission concluded that the
amended plan was fair and equitable and feasible. This plan was
approved by the court, accepted by the requisite majority of creditors,
and confirmed by the court. The plan is in the process of being
consummated.
In the Inland Ga8 Corporation case 26 a petition was filed by three
debenture holders of Kentucky Fuel Gas Corporation for the alteration and modification of the plan of reorganization confirmed by the
court on April 28, 1958, and affirmed on appeal, 260 F. 2d 510 (C.A.
6), oert. den. April 27, 1959. The modification was based upon a proposed underwriting whereby the estate would receive cash in an
amount greater than the valuation of the enterprise upon which the
plan was based. The Commission submitted a memorandum. stating
that the court had jurisdiction to consider proposed alterations and
modifications and that the alterations and modifications proposed in
the petition appeared to have sufficient merit on their face to warrant
a hearing upon due notice to security holders.
The District Court denied the petition and on appeal by the creditors, which the Commission supported, the Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit granted a stay of the order of consummation of the
plan."

The Hudson & Manhattan Railroad Company owns and operates
office buildings in New York City and an interurban rapid transit
electric railway between New York City and points in New Jersey.
In the reorganization proceeding of this company," the trustee filed
with the court an amended plan designed to permit only the senior
bondholders to share in the value of the mortgaged assets, but
recognizing the claims of junior bondholders against certain assets
allegedly not subject to the mortgage liens (free assets). It also
provided for a contingent interest for junior bondholders in the proceeds of the sale of the railroad, if such a sale realized more than was
required to meet the claims of the senior bondholders. Under the
plan, the debtor would continue only as a real estate company, and a
new company would be organized as a subsidiary of the real estate.
The real estate company would issue to the senior creditors $10,038,100 principal amount of 20-year 6 percent first mortgage bonds
and 590,476 shares of a new class A common stock, which would constitute 91 percent of the common stock equity. The junior creditors
would receive 58,849 shares of a new class B common stock, which
would represent the remaining 9 percent of the equity. The class B
stock was intended to recognize the interest of junior bondholders in
the free assets of the debtor and generally to provide for their right
to receive the remaining proceeds of any sale of the railroad company
property after satisfaction of the claims of senior bondholders. No
participation was provided for the present preferred and common
stock since the debtor was insolvent. The new class A and B stocks
would be alike except in respect of the election of directors and adjustments in relative participation of proceeds of the sale of the railroad properties in excess of $17million.
The Commission's advisory report found the amended plan fair
and equitable and feasible except in one minor respect. The amended
plan proposed that the initial boards of directors of the real estate
company and the railroad company would be appointed by the court
after consideration of nominations by the bondholders or their representatives, but the court was not required to accept any of the nominees. Representatives of senior bondholders proposed that the initial
boards of directors be designated by the court from among nominees
of bondholders, with the seven class A directors of the real estate
company and the five class A directors of the railroad company to be
chosen from among nominees of senior bondholders, and the two class
B directors of each of the reorganized companies to be chosen from
among nominees by junior bondholders. The Commission believed
that this proposal was appropriate and the court agreed and incorporated the proposal into the plan.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Frank Fehr Brewing Company," a relatively small, long-established brewery in Louisville, Ky., filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter X on August 16, 1957, following several
years of losses. Its preferred stock was widely held by public
investors.
A plan of reorganization was filed on December 26, 1958, based on
an offer by a group of local business men to supply a substantial
amount of cash for all the common stock of a reorganized company.
Creditors were to be paid in cash and 5-year mortgage bonds and the
rights of the preferred stockholders altered. The old common stock
was excluded. The Commission initially opposed the plan, primarily
on the ground that the preferred stockholders were not being fairly
treated. The Commission counsel participated in a series of negotiations culminating in amendments satisfactory to a preferred stockholders committee and upon Commission recommendation the court
confirmed the amended plan.
The president of the debtor, who was also the majority common
stockholder, appealed from the order of confirmation.
The trustee
moved to dismiss the appeal on the grounds, among others, that the
appellant had failed to object formally to the order of confirmation
and had failed to appeal from the order of approval.
The appellant
had participated actively in the proceedings and had made his opposition to the plan known at several stages, but had remained mute at
the hearing on confirmation. The appellant's counsel had withdrawn
prior to that hearing.
The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied the motion to
dismiss on May 26, 1959, saying-"The
preliminary approval of the
plan by the court is but one step in a continuous process leading to
confirmation." It held that appellant's statements at the prior approval hearing "adequately presented to the district judge, and presents to this court also, applicant's contentions and objections to the
plan." This decision was in accordance with the position taken by
the Commission on this issue in its brief.
Thereafter, on the merits, the Court of Appeals affirmed on June
16, 1959,80the order of confirmation, and the plan is now being
consummated.
The Commission had advocated affirmance of the order in its brief,
with ?ne reservation, The trustee, apparently by inadvertance, had
supplied the preferred stockholders group, which was then soliciting
rejection of the plan,
with an old stockholders list , and had subse.
quently made available a current list to a group soliciting acceptances.
It was contended that enough acceptances had been received to make
the discrepancy between the two lists immaterial and the objecting

preferred group later withdrew its opposition to the plan as the result
of further amendments.
The Commission considered that these circumstances would require
reversal of the order of confirmation, on the ground that the plan had
not been properly accepted, in the absence of a showing that the error
was not prejudicial. The Court of Appeals concluded "Although
that might be the proper remedy under some circumstances, we do
not think the particular circumstances of this case warrant taking
that procedure." It stressed the fact that the old list was delivered
in good faith and clearly dated, that no request was made for a later
list and there was no indication that it would have not been supplied
if requested, and that the parties directly involved had withdrawn
their objections and were not supporting the plan. The Court said:
"Under the circumstances, we find no such unfairness which would
cause us to invalidate the entire vote of the preferred stockholders
at the request of one who appeals as a common stockholder only ... "
In the Magnolia Park case 31 the Court approved a plan of reorganization which included a provision for the trustee to enter into an agreement with outsiders to operate the track. Sportservice Corporation,
which held a concession agreement with Magnolia and was a creditor
and stockholder, had objected to the plan unless it could continue as
operator of the concession. As a result of Sportservice's vote against
the plan, there was not the requisite majority voting acceptance of the
plan. Sportservice by the actions and statements of its representatives appeared to be primarily interested in upsetting the plan because
it was not given the concession, and Commission counsel urged that
the vote of Sportservice had not been in good faith and should be
disregarded pursuant to section 203 of chapter X. All other creditors
voted in favor of the plan. The vote of Sportservice was disqualified
by the Court. Sportservice has filed notices of appeal," and applied
to the Court of Appeals for a stay. An agreement was reached
whereby the motion for stay was withdrawn. Subsequently, a compromise was effected with the aid of Commission counsel and the plan
was confirmed after the close of the fiscal year .

PART VIII
ADMINISTRATION OF TIlE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939
Bonds, notes, debentures, and similar securities publicly offered for
sale, except as specifically exempted by the Trust Indenture Act of
1939,must be issued under an indenture which meets the requirements
of the act and has been duly qualified with the Commission. Indentures to be qualified are required to include specified provisions
which provide means by which the rights of holders of securities
issued under such indentures may be protected and enforced. These
provisions relate to designated standards of eligibility and qualification of the corporate trustee to provide reasonable financial responsibility and to minimize conflicting interests. The act imposes on the
trustee, after default, the duty to use the same degree of care and
skill "in the exercise of the rights and powers invested in it by the
indenture" as a prudent man would use in the conduct of his own
affairs. Exculpatory provisions formerly used to eliminate all
liability of the indenture trustee are outlawed.
The provisions of the Trust Indenture Act are closely integrated
with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant
to the Securities Act of securities to be issued under a trust indenture
subject to the Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective
unless the indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter act, and
necessary information as to the trustee and the indenture must be
contained in the registration statement. In the case of securities issued
in exchange for other securities of the same issuer and secunities issued
under a plan approved by a court or other proper authority which,
although exempted from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, are not exempted from the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act, the obligor must file an application for the qualification of
the indenture, including a statement of the required information
concerning the eligibility and qualification of the trustee.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF

1940
Companies engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, holding and trading in securities are subject to registration and
regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This act,
among other things, prohibits such companies from changing the
nature of their business or their investment policies without the approval of their stockholders, requires disclosure of the finances and
investment policies of these companies, regulates the means of custody
of the companies' assets, requires management contracts to be submitted to security holders for their approval, prohibits underwriters,
investment bankers and brokers from constituting more than a minority of the directors of such companies, and prohibits transactions between such companies and their officers, directors and affiliates except
with the approval of the Commission. The act also regulates the
issuance of senior securities and requires face-amount certificate companies to maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity payments upon
their certificates.
Investment companies which offer securities to the public must file
appropriate registration statements under the Securities Act. Registered investment companies must also file periodic reports and are
subject to the Commission's proxy and insider trading rules. Both
the Division of Corporation Finance and the Division of Corporate
Regulation assist the Commission in the administration of this statute,
the former being concerned with the disclosure provisions and the
latter with the regulatory provisions.
COMPANmS REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT

During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1959, 70 new companies

PROGRAM

FOR INSPECTION

159

ANNUAL REPORT
OF INVESTMENT

COMPANIES

The Commission, as indicated in its 23d and 24th Annual Reports,
has initiated a program for the periodic inspection of investment
companies pursuant to the statutory authority under section 31
of the Investment Company Act. Up to the fiscal year 1958, 16 companies had been inspected. Fourteen companies were inspected in
fiscal 1959, the third year of the inspection program. These inspections were undertaken by staff teams usually consisting of one attorney or analyst from the Division of Corporate Regulation and one
securities investigator from the appropriate field office in order to
combine the specialized training and knowledge of the staff concerning the regulatory requirements of the Investment Company Act with
the field experience and investigative expertness of field office
personnel.
Inspections made in the past 3 years indicated, in some instances,
noncompliance with regulatory provisions of the Investment Company Act. For example: (1) improper selling practices by salesmen
who promoted the sale of mutual fund shares just prior to dividend
payment dates without explaining that the amount of dividend to be
paid was included in the purchase price of the shares on which a salesload was paid and that receipt of the dividend would represent a
return of capital on which the shareholder would be liable for income
taxes; (2) deviations from fundamental policy without approval of
stockholders; (3) improper composition of boards of directors because of the affiliation of directors; (4) acquisition of securities during an underwriting where an affiliated relationship existed between
underwriter and company; (5) sale of securities to a company by an
affiliated person acting as a principal; (6) failure to file appropriate
fidelity bond; (7) noncompliance with the requirements for the custody of the portfolio securities of a company under section 17 of the
act; and (8) failure to obtain approval of stockholders or the Board
of Directors for an investment advisory contract,
In addition to noncompliance with various regulations and standards required under the act, there were instances where books and
records of the companies were inadequate or lacking. For example:
(1) failure to record the date and time of requests for redemption,
thus making it impossible to determine whether the investors received
their correct net asset value; (2) failure to maintain purchase and
sales journals; failure to maintain ledger accounts for broker-dealers
used by the company for its portfolio security transactions; and (3)
failure to keep proper vouchers for out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, the staff noted instances where the custodian did not adhere to
the terms of the custodianship agreement, or the Commission's regulations on the safekeeping of portfolio securities of the company.
In some instances, there was a considerable delay in the transmission

160

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

to the investment companies of funds received by dealers selling mutual fund shares.
In cases where deficiencies are noted, unless other action is indicated,
they are brought to the attention of the investment companies involved so that corrective steps may be taken. The Commission's
experience to date shows that this aspect of the inspection program
will prove to be particularly helpful to the newly organized or the
smaller investment company, and of benefit to the investing public.
STUDY OF SIZE OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES

On behalf of the Commission, the Securities Research Unit of the
Wharton School of Finance and Commerce of the University of
Pennsylvania is now conducting a fact-finding survey in connection
with a study of the problems created by the growth in size of investment companies (see 24th Annual Report, p. 148). This inquiry,
made pursuant to the direction contained in section 14(b) of the
Investment Company Act, is being conducted, at present, through
the use of a questionnaire directed to the various investment companies. The questionnaire was prepared by the staff of the Wharton
School after discussion with the Commission and representatives of
the investment company industry and was distributed by the Commission early this year. Shortly before the close of the past fiscal
year the Wharton School submitted to the Commission a progress
report on its size and study activities.
The report indicates that substantial data in reply to the early
phases of the questionnaire have been obtained and are being processed. In the initial stage of the work, detailed processing is being
concentrated on the replies of open-end companies. A preliminary
report on certain phases of the size study is planned early in the next
fiscal year. It is anticipated that later other preliminary reports
covering other aspects of the study will be available.
When it receives the full report :from the Wharton School on the
size study survey, it is expected that the Commission will be in a position to determine whether the increased size of investment companies has created any problems which require specific remedial
]f>gis]ativerecommendations by the Commission to the Congress.
CURRENT INFORMATION

The Commission's rules promulgated under the act require that
the basic information contained in notifications of registration and
in registration statements of investment companies be kept up-todate,
. .through periodic and other reports except in cases of certain
inactive unit trusts and face-amount companies. The following
current reports and documents were filed during the 1958 fiscal year:

The foregoing statistics do not reflect the numerous filings of
revised. prospectuses by open-end mutual funds making a continuous
offering of their securities. These prospectuses, which must be
checked for compliance with the act, are required to show material
changes which have occurred in the operations of the companies
since the effective date of the prospectuses on file. In this respect
the registration of the securities of such companies is essentially
different from the registration of the usual corporate securities.
In addition to these recurring activities, the Commission in the
past year has performed other duties in connection with the Small
Business Investment Act of 1958. Pursuant to an arrangement with
the Small Business Administration, the staff of the Commission
examines a copy of each Proposal to Operate as a small business
investment company, filed on SBA Form 414, to determine the status
of the Proposed Operator under the Investment Company Act and
the other statutes administered by this Commission. Both the Proposed Operator and the SBA are notified as to the staff's conclusion
in each case.
APPUCATIONS

AND PROCEEDINGS

The Investment Company Act prohibits certain types of transactions, in the absence of an exemptive order by the Commission issued
upon a determination that specified statutory standards have been
met. For this reason one of the principal activities of the Commission in its regulation of investment companies is the processing of
applications for such exemptive orders. Under section 6(c) the
Commission, by rules and regulations, upon its own motion or by
order upon application, may exempt any person, security or transaction from any provision of the act if and to the extent that such
exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly
intended by the policy and provisions of the act. Other sections,
such as 6(d), 9(b), 10(f), H(a), 17(b), and 23(c), contain specific
provisions and standards pursuant to which the Commission may
grant exemptions from particular sections of the act or may approve
certain types of transactions. Also, under certain provisions of
sections B, 3, and 8 the Commission may determine the status of
persons and companies under the act.
There were 145 applications under various sections of the Investment Company Act pending before the Commission during the fiscal
year 1959. The various sections of the act with which these applica-

of the act.

Although, as a rule, the applications for exemptions under the
act are processed without holding formal hearings, there are occasions when the applicant will request a hearing, or the Commission feels that the relief sought is such that a hearing should be
held.
Two hearings resulted from applications pursuant to section 17(b)
of the act, requesting exemptions from the statutory prohibition
against dealings between investment companies and their affiliates or
between persons controlled by an investment company. In Atlas
(lorporation, the applicant, a closed-end investment company, requested an exemption for certain transactions incident to a merger of
five companies engaged in uranium mining.' Four of the five companies involved are affiliates of, and presumed to be controlled by,
the investment company under the act. Consequently, they are prohibited by section 17(a) from dealing with each other in connection
with the merger in the absence of an exemptive order. The Commission before granting an exemptive order in such a case must determine
whether the terms of the proposed transactions, including the considerations to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do
not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. In
addition, it must decide whether the proposed transactions are consistent with the policies of the investment company, Atlas Corporation, as recited in its registration statement and reports filed pursuant

to the act, and are consistent with the general purposes of the act.
Hearings were held and the Commission is considering the record to
determine whether there has been compliance with the above-listed
statutory requirements.
Another hearing, involving an application under section 17 (b), in
which the Commission determined that the terms of a merger of an
investment company with its affiliate were in compliance with the
statutory standards was held in New York Dock Oompany.2 In that
case New York Dock Company, a closed-end investment company, requested the order in connection with its merger into its affiliate, Dunhill International, Inc. After considering the record the Commission
granted the exemption. Another hearing held pursuant to an application filed during the past fiscal year involved Dunhill International,
the surviving corporation of the above merger. After acquiring New
York Dock Company's securities portfolio as a result of the merger,
the surviving company conceded that it came within the statutory
definition of an investment company in that it owned investment securities valued at more than 40 percent of its total assets. However, it
filed an application pursuant to section 3 (b) (2) of the act for an
order declaring it to be primarily engaged in a business other than
that of an investment company. A public hearing was held, but before its completion, Dunhill International registered under the act
and withdrew the application it had filed under section 3(b) (2).s
Another hearing resulted from an application by Investors Diversified Services, Inc. and others for an order of exemption permitting
sale of their shares on the basis of a reduced sales load to certain associations for the account of the individual members of the associations.'
A decision is pending.
Other hearings held during the year which resulted from applications filed in prior years included cases involving National Department Stores Corporation and Civil and Military Investors Mutual
Fund, Inc. In National Department Stores Corporation 5 the hearings were concluded and the Commission handed down its findings
and opinion during the past year. The company, which previously
had engaged directly and through wholly-owned subsidiaries in the
retail department store business, had disposed of most of such interests and invested the proceeds so that directly and through a controlled subsidiary it engaged primarily in the mining and oil business.
The Commission held that the company was primarily engaged directly or through a controlled company in business other than that of
an investment company .

In Oivil and Military Investors Mutual Fund, Inc.6 a hearing was

above name was deceptive and misleading in violation of section 35 (d)
of the act. Exceptions have been field to the decision of the hearing
examiner and it is expected that the case will be argued before the
Commission some time next year.
In The Great American Life Underwriters, Ino., where the applicant is seeking an order pursuant to section 6 (c) or in the alternative
an order under sections 8 (f) and 6 (c) s, the hearing examiner filed his
recommendations shortly before the end of the last fiscal year. Exceptions have been filed to the recommended decision and the matter
was pending before the Commission at the end of the fiscal year.
UTIGATION UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT
Variable Annuities

In S.E.O. v. Variable Annuity Life Insurance Oompany of America, et al., 359 U.S. 65 (1959), the Supreme Court reversed the Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia which had upheld the district
court's dismissal of the Commission's complaint charging violation
of the registration provisions of the Investment Company Act and
the Securities Act of 1933. The district court had held that the
McCarran-Ferguson Act placed exclusive regulatory jurisdiction
Over the defendant's sale of variable annuity contracts in the insurance authorities of the State and the District of Columbia," The
Court of Appeals had affirmed the district court's decision on the
ground that the variable annuity contracts sold by the defendants are
exempt from registration by section 3 (a) (8) of the Securities Act,
which excludes the ordinary annuity contracts issued by insurance
companies. In addition, the Court of Appeals had held that defendants were insurance companies within the provision of section
3(c) (3) of the Investment Company Act. The Supreme Court held
that the defendants were not issuing contracts of insurance within
the exemption provisions of the Securities Act, Investment Company
Act and the McCarran-Ferguson Act. In so holding the court concluded that insurance involved some investment risk-taking on the
part of the insurer and noted the absence here of such an assumption
by the companies, since in these contracts they guarantee essentially
only an interest in a portfolio of common stock which interest "may
be a lot, a little or nothing" depending on the investment results of
the company. In a concurring opinion, Justice Brennan added that

he considered the contracts as containing elements of both insurance
and investment contracts and since they raise regulatory problems of
the sort contemplated by the Congress when it passed the Securities
Act and the Investment Company Act, he concluded that Congress
did not intend to exclude these contracts by reason of the insurance
exemption. Four dissenting judges viewed the contracts as a bona
fide experiment in the insurance field, and even though this particular
development has securities aspects, felt that regulation should be left
to the states as contemplated by the exemptions in the federal
legislation.
The effect of the Supreme Court decision is to make the defendants
subject to registration as investment companies under the Investment
Company Act. Prior to the close of the fiscal year extensive staff
conferences were held with these entirely new kinds of investment
companies to consider proposals for changing their methods of operation so as to bring them into compliance with the underlying purposes and provisions of the Investment Company Act. Administrative proceedings were instituted after the close of the year, and
are pending, in connection with applications of these companies to
exempt them from literal compliance with certain provisions of the
act.
Other Litigation

During the year, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company filed
a notification of registration under the Investment Company Act, and
thereby became a registered company under the terms of the act.
Previously the Commission had filed suit to enjoin the company from
engaging in any securities transactions until it had registered."
Prior to 1953 the company either directly or through subsidiaries,
was engaged in intercoastal shipping operations. Thereafter the
company sold its vessels, suspended its intercoastal shipping services,
closed its branch offices,and cancelled its intercoast tariffs on file with
the Interstate Commerce Commission. It engaged in no shipping
whatever in 1957 or 1958. In the years prior, it had incurred operating deficits from shipping, while its principal income was obtained
from dividends and interest on its investments. As of December 31,
1957, the company and its two wholly-owned subsidiaries had consolidated assets of about $30 million, of which 95 percent was in cash
and securities, the rest in office and other equipment.
The object of the Commission having been achieved, a stipulation
was entered into, discontinuing the action.
In S.E.O. v. McPhail (S.D.N.Y.) the Commission brought suit
under section 36 of the Investment Company Act against the directors
and officers of the McPhail Candy Corporation, a registered invest10 8.E.O.

ment company." The Commission's complaint, which sought to enjoin
the defendants from serving as directors or officers of the corporation, as well as an accounting and the appointment of a receiver,
charged Russell McPhail, the president and controlling stockholder
of the corporation with the fradulent diversion, waste and misuse
of corporate assets, and charged the other defendants with failure
to discharge their obligations to enforce the corporation's rights
against McPhail. The complaint also stated that the corporation had
been an investment company since 1953 but had failed to register
under the act until 1957in violation of section 7.
In October 1957, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint
on the ground that the acts complained of by the Commission had
occurred prior to registration, but the motion was denied. Thereafter
the defendants offered to settle the Commission's action on the basis
of (1) the entry of a consent decree enjoining the defendants from
acting as officers or directors of any investment company; (2) the
payment by McPhail to the Corporation of $325,000; (3) the extension
by McPhail of an offer to purchase publicly held common shares of
the corporation at their net asset value, and publicly held preferred
shares of the corporation at their redemption price, including all unpaid dividends. The settlement was accepted by the Commission and
approved by the Court subject to the acceptance of the purchase offer
by a sufficient number of stockholders to cause the corporation to fall
outside the scope of the Investment Oompany Act 12 and the compromise of a stockholder's suit now pending in the Delaware Chancery
Court.

PART X
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF

1940
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires persons engaging for
compensation in the business of advising others concerning securities
to register as investment advisers. The registration requirements,
however, do not apply in certain limited situations. For example,
an investment adviser is not required to register when he furnishes
investment advice only to persons who are residents of the state in
which he maintains his principal place of business and he does not
provide advice or analysis concerning securities listed on a national
securities exchange or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on
such an exchange. The act also provides an exemption for any investment adviser whose only clients are investment companies and insurance companies. An investment adviser who in the last 12 months
had fewer than 15 clients and does not hold himself out generally
to the public as an investment adviser, is likewise exempt from
registration.
It is unlawful for registered investment advisers to engage in practices which constitute fraud or deceit upon clients or prospective
clients. Registered investment advisers violating any of the various
provisions of the act are subject to appropriate administrative, civil
or criminal remedies. Investment advisers who also effect transactions as brokers or dealers, are required to disclose any interest they
may have in transactions effected for clients, if acting as an investment
adviser in regard to such transaction. In addition, the act prohibits
a registered investment adviser from entering into an agreement
with his clients, under which his compensation is based on a share of
capital gains or appreciation, and also prevents him from assigning
an investment advisory contract without the consent of the client involved. Likewise, a registered investment adviser partnership which
changes its membership must notify clients of such an occurrence.
The Investment Advisers Act does not empower the Commission to
inspect the books and records of an investment adviser. Nor, under
the act, may the Commission deny or revoke the registration of an
investment adviser unless: (1) he has been enjoined by a court of
competent jurisdiction from activities in connection with his conduct
as an investment adviser or from action involving securities or certain
167

168

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

other activities; (2) he has been convicted in the past ten years of a
crime involving securities, the securities business or certain related
activities; or (3) has falsified his application for registration.
During the past fiscal year, the number of registered investment
advisers increased substantially, reaching a total of 1,671, an increase
of 7 percent over the previous year. The following table contains
statistics concerning registration of investment advisers and applications for such registration during the fiscal year:

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS

Security Forecaster Co., Inc.-Registrant,
publisher of a weekly
investment letter known as Financial Forecaster, devoted an entire
issue of the latter to an article on Anacon Lead Mines, Ltd. (Anacon).
This article recommended the purchase of Anacon stock in extravagant and enthusiastic terms, stating that for several weeks registrant
had been conducting an extensive research program on Anacon which
showed beyond a shadow of a doubt that, among other things, Anacon
was the "sleeper" of the year among Canadian mining stocks. It also
projected a potential recovery of gold in Anacon properties of some
$50 million or more, stated that Anacon had paid more than a million
dollars in dividends, and that Anacon's investments had a value of
more than $16 million as of December 31, 1957. The report failed to
disclose that Anacon had no proven gold deposits on these properties,
that no dividends had been paid since 1952, and also failed to disclose
that in contrast with the reported $16 million estimated value of
Anacon Investments in shares of a mining corporation, the same shares
had a value as indicated by a then existing market price of only
$2,212,000. Registrant was also found to have willfully filed an application for registration incorrectly listing an individual as a
director.
In an action brought by the Commission, a permanent injunction
was issued by the United. States District Court for the Southern
District of New York against registrant and Melvin A. Johnson, its

TWENTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

169

president, director and sole stockholder. 1 The decree barred them
from using false and misleading statements concerning the potential
recovery from Anacon's investments, profits realized in stock of other
companies managed by the president of Anacon, profits that could
be realized from investing in Anacon, and the present financial condition of Anacon and its history of dividend payments. Registrant
consented to entry of the decree without admitting any of the allegations of violations contained in the complaint.
In the revocation proceeding, which followed the injunction, registrant urged that Jolmson was the subject of a continuing investigation and had properly, and on advice of counsel, refrained from
testifying in the revocation proceeding in order to avoid the possibility of waiver of his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. Accordingly, it was contended registrant was deprived of
the testimony of the person most qualified to present registrant's
defense. The Commission rejected this argument, holding that registrant was given due notice of the hearing on the charges against
it and at that hearing registrant had participated with counsel.

OF THE COMMISSION

COURT PROCEEDINGS
Civil Proceedings

At the beginning of the fiscal year 1959 there were pending in the
courts 54: injunctive and related enforcement proceedings instituted
by the Commission to prevent fraudulent and other illegal practices in
the sale or purchase of securities. During the year 60 additional
proceedings were instituted and 58 cases were disposed of, leaving
56 such proceedings pending at the end of the year. In addition the
Commission participated in a number of corporate reorganization
cases under chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, in 7 proceedings in
United States District Courts under section 11 (e) of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act and in 18 miscellaneous actions. The Commission also participated in 59 civil appeals in the United States
Courts of Appeals. Of these, 20 came before the courts on petition
for review of an administrative order, 17 arose out of corporate reorganizations in which the Commission had taken an active part, 17
were appeals in actions brought by or against the Commission, 1 was
an appeal from an order entered pursuant to section 11(e) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act, and 4 were appeals in cases
in which the Commission appeared as amicus curiae. The Commission also participated in 4 appeals or petitions for certiorari before
the United States Supreme Court resulting from these or similar
actions.
Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared before
a Federal or State court, either as a party or as amicus curiae, during
the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the year, are
contained in the appendix tables.
Certain significant aspects of the Commission's litigation during
the year are discussed in the sections of this report relating to the
statutes under which the litigation arose.
Criminal Proceedings

The statutes administered by the Commission provide for the transmission of evidence of violations to the Attorney General, who may
institute criminal proceedings.
The regional offices of the Commission prepare detailed reports in cases where the facts appear to warrant criminal prosecution.
After careful review by the General
Counsel's Office, these reports are considered by the Commission, and
171

172

SECURITms

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

if it believes criminal prosecution is appropriate they are forwarded
to the Attorney General. Commission employees familiar with the
case often assist the United States attorneys in the presentation to the
grand jury, the conduct of the trial, and the preparation of briefs on
appeal. The Commission also submits parole reports prepared by its
investigators relating to convicted offenders.
During the past fiscal year, 45 new cases were referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution. This represents the highest
number of criminal referrals in the past 17 years and the 5th highest
in the Commission's history. Also during the fiscal year 27 indictments were returned against 111 defendants, the highest number since
fiscal year 1943,and there were 24 convictions in 13 cases. There were
six appeals in criminal cases during the fiscal year. In three instances
the appeals were dismissed. The conviction was affirmed in the only
appeal decided on the merits. The remaining two cases were still
pending at the close of the period. Two criminal contempt proceedings were instituted during 1959, which were still pending at the end
of the year.'
From 1934 to June 30, 1959, 2,487 defendants have been indicted in
the United States District Courts in 602 cases developed by the Commission and 1,319 convictions obtained in 555 cases. Thus, over the
past 25 years, convictions have been obtained and upheld in over 85
percent of the cases completed,"
As in past years, the criminal cases developed and prosecuted during the year covered a wide variety of fraudulent practices. They included frauds in the sale of securities of established as well as new
businesses, frauds on the part of securities broker-dealers and their
representatives, frauds in the sale of securities relating to oil and gas
promotions and mining ventures, and fraudulent securities promotions of alleged inventions. In addition, defendants in a number of
cases also were charged with violating the registration provisions
of the Securities Act. The filing of a false registration statement
under the Securities Act and the failure to file reports required under
the Securities Exchange Act also were charged in certain of the cases.
The "Ponzi" technique whereby promoters pay back to investors out of
the investors' own funds monies which are falsely represented to be
profits or interest on their investments was a part of the fraud alleged
in a number of the cases in which convictions were obtained during
the year.
In U.S. v. Selected Investment Oorporation et oi.; (W.D. Okla.),
after 3 weeks of trial, Hugh A. Carroll was convicted and sentenced to

a term of 7 years 8 on all counts of a 31-count indictment which
charged violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act
of 1933, violations of the Mail Fraud Statute and conspiracy to violate both statutes. Three other defendants received sentences ranging from a suspended sentence with 5 years probation to 5 years
imprisonment;'
The two corporate defendants were each fined $1,500
and one defendant was acquitted. The indictment alleged that the
defendants employed a scheme to defraud in connection with the sale
of certificate bonds of Selected Investments Trust Fund by means of
false and misleading representations and by concealment of material
facts. It was charged that the defendants paid dividends out of
capital while representing to investors and prospective investors that
such dividends were paid from profits earned by the trust fund created
and managed by defendant Selected Investments Corporation; that
false financial statements of the trust fund were distributed to investors; that the defendants illegally converted to their own use properties of the trust fund; that the defendants falsely represented that
there were adequate safeguards to protect investors from loss and
that their funds were invested in sound income producing securities,"
Convictions also were obtained after trial against two defendants
in V.S. v. Monarch Radio and Television Oorporation et al. (S.D.
N. Y.) . Prior to trial one defendant pleaded guilty. Two defendants
were acquitted and the case dismissed as to the four remaining defendants. This indictment charged the defendants with making various misrepresentations in the sale of Monarch stock and with issuing
false financial statements and paying dividends out of stock sale proceeds while representing that such dividends came from company
earnings when the company had no earnings.
A sentence of 18 months imprisonment was imposed upon Roy W.
Adams (N.D. Texas) following his conviction of charges arising out
of the fraudulent sale of stock of Central Finance Service, Inc. A
codefendant, Council Mayo Forsyth, had previously been sentenced to
2 years imprisonment for the fraudulent sale of the same stock. The
indictment charged that the defendants falsely represented to investors that the Central stock being offered was unissued stock and that
the money received from the sale of such stock would be used by
Central in its business operations; that Central was realizing substantial profits from its business operations and would pay substantial
dividends and that investors would receive a return of all money
invested in Central stock upon request.
The promotion of alleged inventions resulted in convictions in Ii.S,

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

(S.D. Calif.). After 6 weeks of trial in the Vandersee case defendants Vandersee and the Vandersee Corporation were found guilty on
11 counts of a 15-count indictment charging fraud in the offer and
sale of common stock of the Vandersee Corporation The indictment
alleged that as part of a scheme and artifice to defraud purchasers the
defendants falsely represented, among other things, that the Vandersee Corporation had contracts with General Motors, General Electric,
Ford Motor Company and other large corporations; that the corporation was producing equipment used in the manufacture and production
of atomic energy, radio tubes, aircraft engines, printed circuits, and
other electrical equipment; that the corporation had an order for
$1 million from Bell Telephone and General Electric; and that the
corporation had obtained title to two patents issued to Arnold E.
Vandersee. The indictment also charged that the defendants failed
to advise the public investors that some of the shares being offered by
Vandersee were his personally owned shares, or the personally owned
shares of other defendants. Vandersee was sentenced to a total term
of 8 years and fined $5,000. The defendant corporation was fined
$5,500. Two remaining defendants were found not guilty.
In the Bell case defendant was found guilty on three counts charging violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act, and
two counts charging violations of the registration requirements of
that act in connection with the sale of stock of Nu-Form Batteries,
Inc. A sentence of 5 years probation was imposed upon Bell who
was also ordered to make restitution. The indictment charged that
Bell falsely represented that funds invested in Nu-Form Batteries
stock would be used to acquire additional production facilities when,
in fact, the defendant intended to and did appropriate such funds to
his own use and benefit; that Bell had invented the Nu-Form Battery;
that the battery would soon be distributed nationwide; that an affiliate of Nu-Form Batteries was equipped to assemble 2,000 batteries
per day; and that Nu-Form stock would be listed on a national
securities exchange. The indictment further charged that defendant
failed to disclose that earlier attempts to manufacture and market
the Nu-Form Batteries on a commercial basis had been unsuccessful
and that earlier experience had indicated that the company could not
generate sufficient revenue to cover operating expenses.
In U.S. v. Albert Hefferan (W.D. Mich.) the defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 3 years following his plea of guilty to
various counts of an indictment charging violations of the antifraud
provisions of the Securities Act in connection with the sale of promissory notes purportedly secured by shares of stock. The indictment
alleged that as part of a scheme and artifice to defraud, the defendant
placed a series of newspaper advertisements soliciting investors to
advance him sums of money. It was represented in these advertise-

TWENTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

175

ments that the defendant would furnish collateral variously described
as "listed, highgrade securities" and "grade A negotiable listed securities," having values substantially in excess of the amounts of the
investments solicited. The indictment charged that the defendant
did not intend to and did not pledge genuine securities as collateral
for his promissory notes issued to investors, but delivered to them
forged certificates which he falsely represented to be genuine. In
addition, the indictment alleged that Hefferan falsely represented to
investors that investments in his notes collateralized by purported
shares of stock would be absolutely safe and involve no risk of loss;
and that he had ample income from his business and investments to
pay the monthly instalments of principal and interest provided in his
notes.
In U.S. v. PUIUlH. Oollilns (S.D. Ill.) the defendant, who was the
representative of a broker-dealer, pleaded guilty to ten counts of a
twenty count indictment charging him with violations of the Securities Act and the Mail Fraud Statute.
Collins' sentence was suspended
and he was placed on probation for 3 years.
Hugh O. Van Valkenburgh (D. Neb.) entered a plea of nolo contendere to four counts of an indictment charging fraud in the sale of
securities of Instant Beverages, Inc. The defendant was fined $11,500
and placed on probation for 3 years. The other defendant, Abraham
Schapiro, had previously pleaded guilty to eight counts of the indictment and had been placed on probation for 30 months and fined $2,000.
The indictment charged that the defendants employed a scheme to
defraud purchasers of the securities of Instant Beverages, Inc. by
misrepresenting that the proceeds from the sale of defendants' shares
of stock would be used by Instant Beverage, Inc. to begin production,
whereas the defendants converted the proceeds to their own use j and
that formulae held by the company for an effervescent soft drink
were perfected and that Instant Beverage, Inc. would soon cause to
be produced a stable product in marketable quantities, whereas the
defendants knew that the formulae and processes were incomplete and
not perfected and that a stable product could not be produced therefrom. In addition, it was charged that the defendants sold stock to
the public at $5 a share for which they had paid 1 cent per share,
without disclosing to the investors the original cost of the shares.
In U.S. v. Harold W. Danser
et al (D. Mass.) the defendants
are charged with violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act in the sale of the common stock and warrants of Ultrasonic
Corporation, and with conspiracy to file false registration statements
under the Securities Act pursuant to which the stock offering was
made and to defraud the United States by impeding and obstructing

r-;

176

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the Commission in its protection of public investors. The indictment
charges, among other things, that the defendants, in the offer and
sale of the Ultrasonic securities used .financial statements, included
in the prospectuses furnished to investors, which represented that the
Ultrasonic Corporation was operating at a profit and had substantial
assets, when in fact the corporation had suffered substantial losses and
the assets were substantially less than the amount stated.
In U.S. v, Charles M. Berman, et al. (S.D.N.Y.) numerous defendants were indicted for violations and conspiracy to violate the Securities Act. The indictment charges the defendants with employing
a scheme to defraud investors in the offer and sale of shares of John
Inglis, Ltd. and other securities. The indictment alleges that as a
part of this scheme defendants caused Cornelis de Vroedt, Inc. to
obtain a broker-dealer registration with the Commission and arranged
to supply securities to be sold through Cornelis de Vroedt, Inc. According to the indictment, defendants caused Cornelis de Vroedt, Inc.
to contract to sell, as commission agent for certain foreign trusts,
large quantities of the John Inglis, Ltd. shares and defendants inserted advertisements in financial journals, newspapers and periodicals, purchased mailing lists and distributed literature to the said
mailing list to condition the public for the extensive telephone sales
campaign that followed.
It is further charged that the defendants, in effecting the sale of
the Inglis shares, falsely represented to investors that the defendant
Cornelis de Vroedt, Inc. was a long established securities firm; that
the purchasers could place their trust and confidence in the firm;
that the firm maintained an independent research department which
issued impartial advice to its customers; that the firm was advising
the purchasers to invest and reinvest in the Inglis shares as a result
of an impartial analysis of that security by its research department,
which analysis was based upon facts and information not generally
available to the public at large; that the firm, the officers thereof and
the salesmen had purchased large quantities of Inglis shares for their
own accounts; that the firm was offering and selling Inglis shares to
a special group of customers at bargain prices with no commission
charge to said customers in order to add such customers to its existing
regular clientele; that the purchasers would suffer no loss and were
assured of immediate large specified profits because of imminently
impending designated mergers, increased earnings, declarations of
dividends and new listings on registered securities exchanges; and
that in order to participate in these guaranteed profits, it was necessary for the customers to make immediate purchase of the Inglis
shares since they were "blue chips" in short supply and soon would be
unavailable at the then existing low prices.

TWENTY-FIFl'H

ANNUAL REPORT

177

The indictment charges further that the defendants would send
confirmations to persons who had not ordered securities and thereafter threaten to make trouble for them with the Securities and Exchange Commission if they did not buy the securities, and that the
defendants destroyed or falsified records of the company for the
purpose of impeding, impairing and obstructing the investigative
functions of the Commission.
The indictment in V.S. v. Alexander L. Guterma, et al (S.D.N.Y.)
charged violations of, and conspiracy to violate, the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The indictment
charges that Guterma, Robert J. Eveleigh, and Comficor, Inc., unlawfully failed to file with the New York Stock Exchange and the Commission a statement indicating beneficial ownership and the changes
in such ownership in the common stock of F. L. Jacobs Co. at the
close of specified calendar months. The indictment further charges
that Guterma and Eveleigh delayed and obstructed the filing of the
annual report of F. L. Jacobs Co. for the fiscal year ended July 31,
1958, and that Guterma and Eveleigh, who were officers, directors
and owners of securities of F. L. Jacobs Co., unlawfully delayed and
obstructed the making and filing of monthly reports of F. L. Jacobs
Co. which would have disclosed the disposition by F. L. Jacobs Co.
of a significant amount of assets otherwise than in the ordinary course
of business.
Indictments in two cases charge fraud in connection with the transaction of business as a broker-dealer. Bryan H. Kyger was charged
in an indictment returned in the Southern District of Texas with
violations of the Securities Exchange Act, as well as the Securities
Act and the Mail Fraud Statute. According to the indictment,
Kyger solicited customers to purchase securities from his firm upon
the representation that the firm was financially able to execute such
orders and to deliver securities and money due customers when he did
not intend to and did not execute such orders or deliver to customers
the securities ordered by them, The indictment also charges that
Kyger appropriated to his own use and benefit the monies received
by him from his customers in payment of securities purchased by
them, and that he sold securities belonging to his customers without
their knowledge and similarly misappropriated the proceeds.
In an indictment returned in V.S. v, Robert Bernard Sills et al
(S.D.Fla.), the defendants were charged with similar violations. The
indictment in this case charges, among other things, that the defendants, operating through Sills and Company, a registered brokerdealer of which Sills was president and controlling stockholder and
for which defendant Green was sales manager and a salesman of securities, employed a scheme and artifice to defraud by soliciting and

178

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

inducing customers to purchase from and sell to Sills and Company
certain securities, and that, instead of effecting such transactions, the
defendants converted to their own use and benefit the funds received
from customers in payment for such securities and the securities obtained from customers for the purpose of such sales. It is further alledged in the indictment that the defendants concealed from their
customers that the firm was insolvent and that the defendants made
and caused to be made false statements in a financial report filed with
the Commission.
Indictments were returned in a number of cases involving alleged
fraudulent promotions regarding securities of insurance companies.
An indictment was returned in the District of Nebraska charging
Oharles F. Newell and others with violations of the antifraud and
registration provisions of the Securities Act in connection with the
sale of stock of Unity Insurance Company. The defendants are
charged with investing funds derived from the sale of Unity Insurance Company stock in business ventures unrelated to the organization of an insurance company. According to the indictment, in the
course of the sales of these securities the defendants falsely represented, among other things, that the purchaser of the stock could
have his money back at any time; that the money raised from the sale
of the stock would be placed in escrow until the insurance business
license or franchise was issued by the State of Nebraska; that the
stock was going to rise in price; that the company had the money to
qualify and get its insurance license; that the company was doing so
well that they would refund the money of the purchaser at any time
with 5 percent interest; that the company was allowed by state law
to spend only 24 cents per share for expenses; and that certain persons
had made substantial investments in the Unity Insurance Company.
In addition, the indictment charged that the defendants concealed
that the principal organizers, officers and directors of the company
did not invest any money in the company, and that the stock purchased by investors was stock optioned to an officer or director, and
that the greater portion of the purchase price would be retained by
the officeror director making the sale.
In Ii.S, v. James Lamar McMichael (D. Ala.}, the indictment
charges the defendant with violations of the antifraud provisions of
the Securities Act, the Mail Fraud Statute and the Fraud by Wire
Statute. McMichael, who had been a fugitive, was apprehended in
January 1959 in Miami, Fla. The charges as laid in the indictment
arose, in part, out of the sale of preorganization subscriptions and
certificates for stock of United Security, Inc., a corporation proposed
to be organized under the laws of South Carolina, which was promoted by McMichael for the purpose of acquiring a number of financially unstable insurance companies and consolidating them into one

TWENTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

179

company; also, in part, out of personal transactions of McMichael
with individual investors involving securities in their portfolios. It
is alleged in the indictment that the defendant engaged in a scheme
to sell preorganization subscriptions and certificates for both the
original stock of United Security, Inc., and personally owned stock
of the defendant to be issued after the corporation would be formed,
by falsely representing to investors, among other things, that money
paid for such securities would be deposited in escrow with The
South Carolina National Bank at Greenville, S.C., and that if the
corporation did not obtain a charter before a specified date, the
funds of the investors would be returned to them. The indictment
further alleges that the defendant falsely represented to investors
that if they would turn over to him certain stocks of established
corporations which they owned, he would be able to sell them at
advantageous prices, and that he would accept one-half of the profits
as his commission. It is also alleged that he purchased securities
from investors and gave them worthless checks in payment therefor.
Violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and
of the Mail Fraud Statute also are charged in the indictment in V.S.
v, William Isaac Lowry, et al. (D. Ariz.), This indictment charges
the defendants with a scheme and artifice to defraud policyholders
and stockholders of American Buyers Insurance Company, the beneficiaries of a certain trust of which the defendants were the trustees,
and the stockholders of The American Buyers Insurance Company
(a separate corporation).
According to the indictment, the scheme
to defraud was devised by the defendants for the purpose of obtaining control and ownership of the property, assets and insurance business of a group of insurance companies of which defendants were
the principal officers and directors, and for the enrichment of defendants at the expense of investors and policyholders. As part of the
scheme defendants induced those persons to invest funds in the insurance companies and to forego rights to which they were entitled as
policyholders and stockholders. Further, it is alleged the defendants diverted insurance business from companies in which such persons were policyholders or stockholders to companies wholly or
substantially owned by the defendants.
An indictment charging violations and a conspiracy to violate the
registration provisions of the Securities Act was returned against
Philip H. Meade and others (S.D. Ind.) in connection with the sale
of the stock of Farm and Home Agency. According to the indictment, the defendants sold the stock to non-residents of the State of
Indiana, which destroyed their claim to an intrastate exemption, and
conspired to conceal the true identities of the purchasers of such
securities and to create the appearance of sales to Indiana residents
by the use of dummies and nominees.
529523--59-15

180

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

An indictment was returned in the District of North Dakota
charging Samuel Parker Pandolfo and others with violations of the
antifraud and registration provisions of the Securities Act, violations of the Securities Exchange Act and violations of the Mail
Fraud Statute in connection with the operation of a securities brokerdealer business. The indictment charges, among other things, that
the defendant Samuel Parker Pandolfo acquired for himself and his
close associates large quantities of securities of Great Northern Investment Company, Inc., and thereafter caused to be formed Universal Securities, Inc., to engage generally in the business of a brokerdealer, and particularly to make, maintain and support a market for
the Class "A" stock of Great Northern Investment Company, Inc.
The indictment also charges that the defendants engaged in a scheme
to sell securities through Universal Securities, Inc. by falsely representing to the investors that the prices at which the securities were
sold were prices determined by an actual bona fide demand for such
securities; that a further rise in the prices of the securities could be
expected in the near future because of a rapid rise in the intrinsic
value of the shares; and that a rise in the market prices of the securities sold was sure to occur. In addition, the indictment charges that
the defendants falsely represented that the Great Northern stock
would double in value within a specified period; that investors could
resell the securities any time at the price at which they paid for
them; and that the price at which such securities were sold was the
market price thereof, when in fact said market price was an artificial
market price maintained by the defendants, which fact was not
disclosed.
Abraham Rosen and another defendant were indicted in the District
of Massachusetts on charges of violation of the antifraud provisions
of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act and the Fraud
by Wire Statute. The indictment charges that the defendants solicited funds and securities from customers with the representation that
the defendants would invest the funds and the proceeds from the
securities for the benefit of the customers, when in truth and in fact,
as the defendants well knew, they did not intend to, and did not, invest
the moneys as represented, but appropriated the funds to their own
use and benefit.
An indictment was returned in the Northern District of Tennessee
charging Robert Lee Proffer and others with violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Mail Fraud Statute.
The indictment charges, among other things, that the defendants induced investors to purchase shares of Old Line Legal Reserve Trust
(later the Teachers-Professional Investment Company) by falsely
representing to investors that the books of the corporation would be
audited by a certified public accountant and that financial statements

TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT

181

would be furnished to stockholders at least once each fiscal year; that
as of a specified date the corporation had an earned surplus of
$13,278.30; that moneys received from the sale of corporation stock
would be used primarily to finance and refinance loans on automobiles
for the school teachers of Texas; and that in the event investors who
purchased stock on the instalment plan failed to complete their purchase contracts, such investors would receive shares of stock of the
corporation to the extent of the amount paid in. The indictment also
alleges that as a further part of the scheme to induce school teachers
to purchase stock of the corporation the defendants caused printed
prospectuses to be distributed to school teachers, and that such prospectuses contained names and photographs of well-known educators
throughout the State of Texas and representations that some of these
individuals were directors of the corporation and that others were
"Regional Directors of Areas."
In the Eastern District of New York an indictment was returned
charging William Spiller and others with violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Mail Fraud Statute in the sale
of the 7 percent cumulative preferred stock of Budget Funding Corporation. The indictment charges that in the offer and sale of those
securities the defendants falsely represented that the moneys invested
would be used to place second mortgages on residential properties for
home improvements on such properties and to place chattel mortgages
on chattels owned by established businesses, that a dividend would be
declared on the common stock of Budget Funding Corporation, that
the common stock was in short supply and would soon be traded on
the open market, and that the preferred shares would be called back
at a higher price than the purchasers paid for them. In fact, the
indictment charges, the defendant concealed from purchasers of the
securities that the money received was being directed to the use of the
defendant Spiller and corporations controlled by him.
As in the past, cases involving alleged fraudulent oil and gas promotions and mining ventures were numerous. In U.S. v, Dudley
Pritchett South (D.N.J.) an indictment was returned charging violations and conspiracy to violate the registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act in connection with the sale of the common
stock of Texas-Western Oil Company, Inc. The indictment charges
that in the sale of that stock the defendants misrepresented that
Texas-Western had acquired oil producing properties in Kansas and
Oklahoma and had a working interest in other specified oil properties,
that Texas- Western had a partnership interest in leases located in
Nevada and in a 10,000-acre block in Wyoming, that Texas-Western
owned a 55 percent interest in a mercury and antimony mine located
in Mexico and was building an ultrasonic ore reduction mill on the
site of that mine, that the company had an income from its oil produc-

182

AND EXCHANGE COMM:ISSION

ing properties in Kansas and Oklahoma, that dividends would be paid
on the Company's stock, that the value of the stock would increase
sharply in a short period of time and that the stock would be registered and listed on the New York and American stock exchanges.
In U.S. v, Thomas E. Robertson, et al (S.D.N.Y.) the indictment alleges that the defendants, in violation of the antifraud provisions of
the Securities Act, employed a device, scheme and artifice to defraud
investors in the sale of the common stock of American-Canadian
Oil
and Drilling Corporation; that Thomas E. Robertson, Inc., in exchange for certain oil and gas leases, acquired 500,000 shares of common stock of American-Canadian which it sold to the investing public
at various prices without a registration statement being in effect with
respect to said shares, and without disclosing that the shares being
sold were shares already issued to Thomas E. Robertson, Inc., and that
the proceeds from the sales would inure to the use and benefit of
Thomas E. Robertson, Inc., and Thomas E. Robertson; and that the
defendants made false and fraudulent representations concerning
the payment of dividends, the value of the stock, approval by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, listing of the stock on a national
securities exchange, the value of the properties and their cost of
acquisition.
Numerous other misrepresentations and omissions also
were charged.
Violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act as
well as the Mail Fraud Statute are charged in the pending indictment
in U.S. v. Texas-Adams Oil Oompany (S.D.N.Y.) which also involved an oil promotion venture.
Alleged fraudulent promotions involving mining ventures led to
indictments in U.S. v. Olement G. Oafarelli, et al, (D. Utah) ; U.S. v,
Silas M. Newton et al, (D. Colo.) ; U.S. v. Arthur L. Damon, et al
(S.D. CaL); and U.S. v. William J. Oonrad (N.D. Ohio). In the
Oafarelli case the indictment charges fraudulent sales of the common
stock of Comstock Uranium Tungsten Co., Inc. According to the
indictment, a Regulation A notification and offering circular covering
the proposed public offering of 440,000 shares of common stock of
Comstock were filed with the Commission, and defendants, instead of
proceeding with the Regulation A offering, sold personally owned
stock to the public using as an inducement false representations to
the effect that the stock would appreciate in market value when it was
offered for "public sale" and that the persons approached were being
given a special prepublic offering price not afforded to the general
public. Other false representations also are charged.
In the Newton case a superseding indictment was returned which
charges, among other things, that the defendants devised a scheme
to defraud investors by means of misleading and false statements and

TWENTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

183

pretenses, which induced them to purchase participation certificates
in trusts known as the Yellow Cat Royalty Trust and the Tennessee
Queen Royalty Trust, and in fractional undivided interests in mining
claims held by the Tennessee Queen Mining Company. The indictment also charges that in connection with the sale of these securities
the defendants falsely represented that the properties were of great
value; that the company was shipping ore, and the investors were absolutely assured of royalty returns on their investments; that the operators and their associates were highly experienced mining operators;
that the operators agreed that they would repurchase or refund the
purchase price to some of the purchasers upon demand; and that the
investment to be made by the prospective purchasers was safeguarded
because of bank trusteeship.
In the Damon case the indictment charges that the defendant made
fraudulent representations to investors concerning the financial status
of Nev-Tah Oil and Mining Company, the potential oil reserves of
mining properties owned or leased by the mining company, and the
company's earnings and ability to pay dividends. The indictment
further charges that Damon acquired control of the company and
caused the market price of its stock on the Salt Lake Stock Exchange
to rise above 45 cents per share through -the use of flamboyant and
misleading reports, letters and oral statements; that he caused the
company to issue stock into a series of escrows for release at prices
ranging from 9 cents to 45 cents per share, and that he offered and
sold escrowed stock at prices in excess of the escrow prices and at
artificial exchange prices.
In the Oonrad case, the defendant was apprehended after the close
of the fiscal year, and pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him
with the fraudulent sale of unregistered common stock of Condonna
Uranium Mines Limited. In connection with the sale of that stock,
according to the indictment, the defendant falsely represented to investors that Kennecott Copper Company would pay more than $10
million for the uranium mining properties owned by Condonna; that
the profit to the investors would be more than $8,000 for each $100
invested; that a deal to sell the uranium mining properties to Standard Ore and Alloys Corporation was "signed, sealed and delivered"
and the profit to the investors would be $60 for each $1 invested; that
that Brush Beryllium Company would advance $500,000 to develop
some beryllium mining claims allegedly owned by Condonna Uranium
Mines Limited and would buy all the beryllium ore produced at $600
a ton.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the conviction
of Helen A. Davenport for conspiracy arising out of a securities fraud
involving Edgar Robert Errion and Mount Hood Hardboard and

184

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Plywood Cooperative," The scheme to defraud the investing public
included the sale of $1,000 memberships in Mount Hood. Appellant
Davenport participated in the fraudulent scheme by allowing her
name to be used as a cloak of respectability and her corporation as a
conduit by which to siphon off the proceeds from the sale of the
memberships. The Court of Appeals rejected appellant's attack on
the indictment and held that it sufficiently charged her with a crime.
In addition, the Court reviewed the evidence and found it sufficient
to sustain the verdict of guilty.
In Tellier v. U.S. and Walters v, U.8. the Supreme Court of the
United States denied petitioners' writs of certiorari. Tellier had been
sentenced to 4% years imprisonment for his activities in running a
boiler-room. Walters had received an 1S-month sentence in connection with insurance company promotions. Both these cases are discussed in the 23d and 24th Annual Reports.
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST PERSONS PRACIlClNG BEFORE
THE COMMISSION

Private proceedings were instituted pursuant to rule II (e) of the
Commission's rules of practice to determine whether James T.
DeWitt should be temporarily or permanently denied the privilege of
practicing as an attorney before the Commission. DeWitt was retained by Cushman Foods Co., Inc. to represent it in connection with
a proposed public offering under Regulation A under the Securities
Act of 1933. He was given authority by his client to execute all
papers necessary to qualify such offering under Regulation A for the
purpose of obtaining an exemption from registration with respect to
the proposed offering. Included in the notification were financial
statements which, together with subsequent amendments thereto, were
prepared and filed by DeWitt. These financial statements were false,
and DeWitt knew that they were false when he filed them. In addition, he advised Cushman to sell the shares covered by the notification, although the time at which such sales would commence under
the regulation had not arrived, and pursuant to that advice Cushman
sold over 4,000 shares. DeWitt requested of Cushman moneys which
he represented were to be distributed among employees of the Commission. Pursuant to this request he received $100, which he thereafter represented to Cushman he had "passed along" to such employees, whereas in fact, no moneys, gifts or inducements of any kind were
given to any Commission personnel. At the private hearing there was
entered of record DeWitt's "consent to order of disqualification", and
thereafter the Commission issued its opinion 7 in which it found that
• Four other convicted defendants did not appeal. Errfon on his plea of guilty received
sentences totaling 12 years. See the 23d and 24th .Annnal Reports for discussions of
this case.

DeWitt had filed false financial statements, which he knew to be false,
that he obtained moneys from his client under the false pretense that
he proposed to use that money to exert an illegal influence on the
Commission staff, and that in so doing he had engaged in unethical
and improper conduct. It ordered that DeWitt be permanently denied
the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission.
Proceedings under rule II(e) with respect to Bollt and Shapiro,
accountants, are discussed below at p. 197 in connection with the activities of the Commission in the field of accounting.
COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

Each of the acts administered by the Commission specifically authorizes investigations to determine whether violations of law have
occurred. In most instances, the investigations conducted by the
Commission are private and nonpublic. However, the Commission
may, in its discretion, order a public investigation.
It is the policy of the Commission to conduct its investigations
privately for a number of reasons. Such a policy is necessary for
effective law enforcement and in the interest of fairness to persons
against whom unfounded or unconfirmed charges may be presented.
Effective enforcement requires that investigations be private in order
that suspected violators may not be warned and thereby frustrate the
investigation. This policy is similar to that of most law enforcement agencies. The Commission investigates many situations where
no violation is ultimately found to exist. To conduct such investigations publicly would ordinarily result in hardship or embarrassment
to many innocent persons and might affect the market for the securities in question, resulting in injury to public investors with no countervailing public benefit. Moreover, members of the public would
have a tendency to be reluctant to furnish information concerning violations if they thought their personal affairs would be publicized. Private investigations protect both those who furnish information and
subjects of investigation against whom the evidence fails to warrant
action. Accordingly, the Commission does not generally divulge the
results of any investigation until they are made a matter of public
record through proceedings before the Commission or in the courts.
The nine regional offices of the Commission, with the assistance of
their branch offices,are chiefly responsible for the conduct of investigations. In addition, the special investigations unit of the Division
of Trading and Exchanges of the Commission's home officeconducts
investigations dealing with matters of particular interest or urgency
either independently or assisting the regional offices. Because of
"boiler-room" operations in the New York area, much of the work
of the special investigations unit is devoted to that area. The Divi-

186

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

sion of Trading and Exchanges exercises general supervision over
and coordination of the investigative activities of the regional offices.
It examines and analyzes periodically the results of investigations
and recommends appropriate action to the Commission, giving serious
consideration to the recommendations of the regional offices in each
instance.
There are several sources of information which eventually lead to
investigations. A primary source of information comes from complaints of members of the public concerning the activities of persons
involved in the offer and sale of securities. The Division of Trading
and Exchanges and the regional officesof the Commission give careful attention to this information and if it appears that violations of
the federal securities laws may have occurred, an investigation is
commenced. H the complaint is received by the Division of Trading
and Exchanges, the information contained in the complaint is forwarded to the appropriate regional office for such investigative activity as may be deemed advisable. Other sources of information
which are of great help to the Commission in carrying out its enforcement responsibilities are national securities exchanges, brokerage
companies, state and Canadian securities authorities, Better Business
Bureaus and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
Many times information from these sources is helpful, for it comes
from persons who are often familiar with the operation of the federal
securities laws and are interested in seeing full protection of these
laws afforded to the investing public.
H, after careful consideration of information received from these
and other sources, it appears that violations may have occurred, a
preliminary investigation may be made. Many times this investigation discloses a violation due to a misunderstanding or ignorance of
the law. In these cases, where no harm to the public has occurred,
it is the policy of the Commission to inform the offender of the violation and to make sure that necessary steps are taken for future compliance. Should the offender fail to conform with the requirements
of the law, then the Commission takes appropriate action.
When the preliminary investigation indicates a serious violation,
or appears to require more extensive investigation, including examination of books and records or interviews with more than a few persons, a case is docketed and a full investigation is made. At times it
is necessary for the Commission to issue a formal order of investigation which appoints members of the staff as officersto issue subpoenas
and take testimony under oath. As is often the case, this step is taken
when the principals and others involved in the investigation are uncooperative, and it is necessary to use the subpoena power in order
to determine the exact nature of the activities involved. During the

TWENTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL

187

REPORT

past year, 94 formal orders were issued in connection with the investigations handled through the Division of Trading and Exchanges,
an increase of nearly 25 percent over the previous year.
In addition investigations are initiated and conducted by the staff
of the Division of Corporation where necessary to assist in ascertaining facts with respect to disclosures required to be made or omissions
of material information in connection with its examination of registration statements filed under the Securities Act and preliminary
proxy soliciting material and reports required to be filed under the
Securities Exchange Act. Where necessary, such investigations are
conducted with the assistance of the staff of other divisions and
regional offices.
Upon completion and review of an investigation by the regional
office concerned and the Division of Trading and Exchanges, or the
Division of Corporation Finance, the Commission takes under consideration the recommendations of its staff concerning the investigation. The Commission, where action is necessary, has the choice
of several avenues. When required in the public interest, the Commission may refer the case, including evidence and exhibits, to the
Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. Should this occur,
members of the staff familiar with the case assist the Department
of Justice and the United States Attorney handling the case in
presenting it to the grand jury. When an indictment is returned,
members of the staff aid in the trial of the case.
The Commission may, when appropriate, authorize institution of
civil proceedings for injunctive relief. In such event, the complaint
is filed in the appropriate United States District Court and the case
presented by a member of the Commission's staff. The Commission
may also institute administrative proceedings when the investigation
indicates that a registration statement or report filed with it is false
or misleading or omits required information or that a broker-dealer
or investment adviser registered with the Commission is violating
the federal securities laws.
The following table reflects in summarized form the investigative
activities of the Commission during fiscal 1959.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS WITH

RESPECI' TO CANADIAN

SECURITIES

Enforcement problems relative to the unlawful offer and sale of
securities by Canadian issuers and broker-dealers continue to be serious. In such enforcement activities the Commission is severely
handicapped in that ordinarily both the violator and essential evidence
are in Canada, where persons, books and records are beyond our
investigative and subpoena powers. It is therefore difficult, and in
most instances, impossible to obtain admissible evidence with respect
to such violations. Even when evidence is obtainable, sanctions, such
as civil or criminal prosecution or administrative proceedings, cannot
be utilized unless personal jurisdiction over defendants can be secured.
Despite these difficulties, the Commission, acting within its jurisdictional limitations, has made aggressive efforts to deal with the
situation. Hundreds of investigations have been made, injunctions
have been secured whenever jurisdiction over violators could be obtained, and a substantial number of criminal indictments have been
entered. However, in a test case under the Supplementary Extradition Convention consummated in July 1952, the details of which
were furnished in our 22d Annual Report, the Canadian courts denied
extradition of a person who engaged in the fraudulent sale of securities by mail and telephone to United States residents. Through
appropriate diplomatic channels negotiations are still continuing in
an effort to correct this situation. In the meantime the Commission
is almost wholly dependent upon voluntary cooperation of the Canadian provincial enforcement authorities.
Canada does not have federal securities legislation nor a federal
regulatory body. Such matters are regulated on a provincial basis
somewhat similar to the blue sky laws administered by State commissions. In general excellent cooperation has been obtained during
the fiscal year from the provinces in the enforcement work of the
Commission.
One of the most encouraging developments in this area has been
the outstanding cooperation afforded by the Saskatchewan Securities
Commission. On May 1, 1959, this Commission concluded an arrangement with the Saskatchewan Securities Commission under which the
latter will require broker-dealers in that Province to refrain from distributing issues of securities into the United States unless the brokerdealer is registered in compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and the security is registered in compliance with the Securities
Act of 1933. This is the only such arrangement which the Commission
has with any province in Canada and reflects the desire of the
Saskatchewan Securities Commission that only legitimate issues be
distributed from that Province into the United States.

TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT

189

During the past fiscal year the Commission has brought 10 civil
actions and instituted three criminal actions in which the illegal sale
of Canadian securities in the United States was involved. Details
concerning these actions: S.E.O. v, Ralph L. Loomis and F. Payson
Tood, SE.O. v. Oanadian Javelin Limited et al, U.8. v. Robert M.
Sherwood, S.E.O. v. Scott Taylor and 00., Ino., S.E.O. v. Sidney B.
Josephson et al, S.E.O. v. A. G. Bellin Securities Oorp, et al, S.E.O.
v. Albert and Oompany, Inc. et al, S.E.O. v.I. B. Morton and Oompany, Inc. et al, S.E.O. v. Gotham Securities Oorp, et al, S.E.O. v.
Philip Newman Associates et al, U.S. v, Oharles M. Berman et al,
S.E.O. v. Lincoln Securities Oorp. et al, and U.S. v. William J. Oonrad
are described above in the section on Litigation under the Securities
Act of 1933 and the section on Criminal Proceedings.
To cope further with the Canadian problem the Commission continues to maintain its Canadian Restricted List, which is a list of
Canadian issuers whose securities the Commission has reason to believe currently are being, or recently have been, distributed in the
United States in violation of the registration requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933. The list and supplements thereto are issued
to and published by the press, copies are mailed to all registered
broker-dealers and are available to the public. They serve as a warning to the public and alert broker-dealers to the fact that transactions
in the securities named therein may be unlawful. As a practical
matter most United States broker-dealers refuse to execute transactions in such securities. During the fiscal year 1959, 27 supplements
(compared to 14 in fiscal year 1958) were issued in which 85 names
(compared to 50 names in fiscal year 1958) were added to the list.
On May 20, 1959, the list was revised and consolidated, resulting in
the deletion of 29 issuers concerning whose securities the Commission had no evidence of a public offering or sale in the United States
during the past 3 years. In many instances the companies were
no longer in existence due to mergers, charter surrenders, etc. The
number of names on the list as of June 30, 1959, was 210.

1959, follows:

OF SECURITIES VIOLATIONS

A Section of Securities Violations is maintained by the Commission
as a part of its enforcement program to provide a further means of
detecting and preventing fraud in securities transactions. The Section maintains files providing a clearing house for other enforcement
agencies of information concerning persons who have been charged
with violations of various Federal and State securities statutes. Considerable information is also available concerning violators resident in
the provinces of Canada. The specialized information in these files is
kept current through the cooperation of the United States Post Office

192

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, parole and probation officials, State securities authorities, Federal and State prosecuting attorneys, police officers, better business bureaus, chambers of
commerce and other agencies. At the end of the fiscal year these records contained information concerning 69,013 persons against whom
Federal or State action had been taken in connection with securities
violations. In keeping these records current, there were added during the fiscal year items of information concerning 9,576 persons, including 3,450 persons not previously identified in these records.
The Section issues and distributes quarterly a Securities Violations
Bulletin containing information received during the period concerning violators and showing new charges and developments in pending
cases. The bulletin includes a "Wanted" section listing the names
and references to bulletins containing descriptive information of
persons wanted on securities violations charges. The bulletin is distributed to cooperating law enforcement and other agencies in the
United States and Canada.
Extensive use is made of the information available in these records
by regulatory and law enforcing officials. Numerous requests are
received each year for special reports on individuals in addition to
the information supplied by regular distribution of the quarterly
bulletin. All available information is supplied in response to inquiries from law enforcement agencies. During the fiscal year the
Commission received 3,730 "securities violations" letters or reports
and dispatched 944 communications to cooperating agencies.
APPLICATIONS FOR NON-DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN INFORMATION

The Commission is authorized under the various acts administered
by it to grant requests for nondisclosure of certain types of information which would otherwise be disclosed to the public in applications,
reports or other documents filed pursuant to these statutes. Thus,
under paragraph (30) of schedule A of the Securities Act of 1933, disclosure of any portion of a material contract is not required if the
Commission determines that such disclosure would impair the value
of the contract and is not necessary for the protection of the investors.
Under section 24(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trade
secrets or processes need not be disclosed in any material filed with
the Commission, and under section 24(b) of that act written objection
to public disclosure of information contained in any such material
may be made to the Commission which is then authorized to make
public disclosure of such information only if in its judgment such
disclosure is in the public interest. Similar provisions are contained
in section 22 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and
in section 45 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. These statutory provisions have been implemented by rules specifying the pro-

cedure to be followed by persons who apply to the Commission for a
determination that public disclosure is not necessary in a particular

case.

ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

Successive reports of the Commission have called attention to the
fact that the detailed provisions of the several acts administered by
the Commission recognize the importance of dependable informative
financial statements which disclose the financial status and earnings
history of a corporation or other commercial entity. These statements,
whether filed in compliance with the statutes administered by the Commission or included in other material available to stockholders or prospective investors, are indispensable to investors as a basis for
investment decisions.
The Congress recognized the importance of these statements and
that they lend themselves readily to misleading inferences or even
deception, whether or not intended. It accordingly dealt extensively
in the several statutes administered by the Commission with financial
statement presentation and the disclosure requirements necessary to
set forth fairly the financial condition of the company. Thus, for
example, the Securities Act requires the inclusion in the prospectus
of balance sheets and profit and loss statements "in such form as the
Commission shall prescribe" s and authorizes the Commission to prescribe the "items or details to be shown in the balance sheet and earnings statement, and the methods to be followed in the preparation of
accounts * * *." 9 Similar authority is contained in the Securities
Exchange Act,IO and more comprehensive power is embodied in the
Investment Company Act 11 and the Holding Company Act.12

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The Securities Act provides that the financial statements required
to be made available to the public through filing with the Commission
shall be certified by "an independent public or certified accountant." 13
The other three statutes permit the Commission to require that such
statements be accompanied by a certificate of an independent public
accountant," and the Commission's rules require, with minor exceptions, that they be so certified. The value of certification by qualified
accountants has been conceded for many years, but the requirement
as to independence, long recognized and adhered to by some individual
accountants, was for the first time authoritatively and explicitly introduced into law in 1933. Out of this initial provision in the Securities Act and the rules promulgated by the Commission," and the action
taken by the Commission in certain cases," have grown concepts of
accountant-client relationships that have strengthened the protection
given to investors.
As shown above, the statutes administered by the Commission give
it broad rule-making power with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements. Pursuant to authority contained in
the statutes the Commission has prescribed uniform systems of accounts for companies subject to the Holding Company Act; 17 has
adopted rules under the Securities Exchange Act governing accounting and auditing of securities brokers and dealers; 18 and has promulgated rules contained in a single, comprehensive regulation, identified
as Regulation S-X,I9 which govern the form and content of financial
statements filed in compliance with the several acts. This regulation
is implemented by the Commission's Accounting Series Releases, of
which 82 have so far been issued. These releases were inaugurated
in 1937, and were designed as a program for making public, from time
to time, opinions on accounting principles for the purpose of contributing to the development of uniform standards and practice in
major accounting questions. The rules and regulations thus established, except for the uniform systems of accounts, prescribe accounting to be followed only in certain basic respects. In the large area
not covered by such rules, the Commission's principal reliance for the
protection of investors is on the determination and application of
accounting principles and auditing standards which are recognized
as sound and which have attained general acceptance.

Since changes and new developments in financial and economic conditions affect the operations and financial status of the several thousand commercial and industrial companies required to file statements
with the Commission, accounting and auditing procedures cannot
remain static and continue to serve well a dynamic economy. It is
necessary for the Commission to be informed of the changes and new
developments in these fields and to make certain that the effects thereof are properly reported to investors. The Commission's accounting
staff, therefore, engages in studies of the changes and new developments for the purpose of establishing and maintaining appropriate
accounting and auditing policies, procedures and practices for the
protection of investors. The primary responsibility for this program
rests with the Chief Accountant of the Commission who has general
supervision with respect to accounting and auditing policies and their
application.
Progress in these activities requires constant contact and cooperation between the staff and accountants both individually and
through such representative groups as, among others, the American
Accounting Association, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, the American Petroleum Institute, the Controllers Institute of America, the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, the National Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies, as well as other government agencies. Recognizing the importance of cooperation in the formulation of accounting principles
and practices, adequate disclosure and auditing procedures which will
best serve the interests of investors, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Controllers Institute of America, and
the National Federation of Financial Analysts Societies regularly
appoint committees which maintain liaison with the Commission's
staff.
The many daily decisions of the Commission require the almost
constant attention of some of the chief accountant's staff. These include questions raised by each of the operating divisions of the Commission, the regional offices and the Commission. This day-to-day
activity of the Commission and the need to keep abreast of current
accounting problems cause the chief accountant's staff to spend much
time in the examination and re-examination of sound and generally
accepted accounting and auditing principles and practices. From
time to time members of this staff are called upon to assist in field investigations, to participate in hearings and to review opinions, insofar
as they pertain to accounting matters.
Prefiling and other conferences, in person or by telephone, with
officials of corporations, practicing accountants and others, occupy a
considerable amount of the available time of the staff. This procedure, which has proven to be one of the most important functions

COMMISSION

of the Officeof the Chief Accountant, and of the Chief Accountant of
the Division of Corporation Finance and his staff, saves registrants
and their representatives both time and expense.
Many specific accounting and auditing problems arise as a result
of the examination of financial statements required to be filed with the
Commission. Where examination reveals that the rules and regulations of the Commission have not been complied with or that applicable generally accepted accounting principles have not been adhered
to, the examining division usually notifies the registrant by an informal letter of comment. These letters of comment and the correspondence or conferences that follow continue to be a most
convenient and satisfactory method of effecting corrections and improvements in financial statements, both to registrants and to the
Commission's staff. Where particularly difficult or novel questions
arise which cannot be settled by the accounting staff of the divisions
and by the Chief Accountant, they are referred to the Commission for
consideration and decision. By these administrative procedures the
Commission deals with many accounting questions.
Inquiries in ever-increasing volume as to the propriety of particular
accounting practices come from accountants and from companies not
presently subject to any of the acts administered by the Commission
who wish to have the benefit of the Commission's views and thus
utilize and apply the Commission's experience to the facts of their own
case. Teachers of accounting and their students also use the public
files and confer with the staff in the study of accounting problems.
Shortly before the opening of the year under report the Commission amended rule 2-01 of regulation S-X relating to the independence of accountants certifying financial statements filed with the
Commission for the purpose of giving formal recognition to administrative practices which have been in the process of development for
some time. The revision makes no material change in the policy
set forth in prior decisions of the Commission and in published
opinions of the Chief Accountant.
In the revision of this rule the Commission has recognized the impact of mergers and the growth of corporations through widespread
affiliations, The emphasis in the rule has been changed to make it
clear that where relationships described in the rule exist the Commission will find that an accountant is in fact not independent with
respect to the company involved, but in those instances where lack of
independence is not established the Commission will make no finding
with respect to the accountant's independence.
A few months after the revision of rule 2-01 of regulation S-X
mentioned above, the Commission announced the publication of an
additional release in its Accounting Series dealing with independence

TWENTY-FIFTH

of accountants," In connection with the revision of rule 2-01 practicing accountants had indicated that an interpretative release similar
to Accounting Series Release No. 47 would be a helpful guide to the
profession. TIns new release, which summarizes previously unpublished rulings on independence in the Commission's experience under
rule 2-01 since the publication of Accounting Series Release No. 47
on January 25, 1944, together with prior releases and Commission decisions reflects the development of policy regarding the practice of
accountants before the Commission over a period of some 25 years.
In Accounting Series Release No. 47 it was stated that it was not
feasible to present adequately in summarized form the circumstances
existing in particular cases in which it was determined not to question
an accountant's independence. The growth of the accounting profession since 1944 and the number of inquiries received from public
accountants unfamiliar with the rules suggested the need for publication of rulings in this category. In view of this development it was
determined to review the administrative rulings in this area and to
state briefly in the new release the relationships which existed in
select cases where an accountant was not denied the right to certify
the financial statements because under the circumstances it was concluded that the independence of the accountant was not prejudiced.
During the fiscal year the Commission issued its Findings, Opinion
and Order in a proceeding instituted under rule II (e) of its rules of
practice against Bollt and Shapiro, Theodore Bollt and Bernard L.
Shapiro." The Commission found that the respondents had failed
to comply with rules and regulations of the Commission and with
generally accepted accounting standards, and had engaged in improper and unethical professional conduct. Specifically, the Commission found that where a partner of an accountant certifying the
financial statement in a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 is the principal officer and controlling stockholder of
the registrant, the certifying accountant is not independent with respect to the registrant.
The Commission concluded that where the
partner in the firm of certified public accountants who was the principal officer and controlling stockholder of the company which filed a
registration statement with the Commission caused the other partner
to certify registrant's financial statements as an independent public
accountant knowing that the certifying partner was not qualified to
furnish an independent certification and sought to conceal the partnership relationship, the privilege of practicing before the Commission should be denied to the firm and the partner controlling the
registrant until they obtain the prior approval of the Commission to
practice before it in the future. The Commission further concluded

that the privilege of practicing before the Commission of the certifying accountant should be suspended for 30 days.
During the year the conflicting views of public utilities, public
accountants, and regulatory agencies with respect to accounting for
deferred taxes reached a stage requiring formal public review by the
Commission. The matter arose because the effect of section 161 (liberalized depreciation) and section 168 (accelerated amortization) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1954 is to permit the tax-free recovery from
operations of capital invested in a plant at a faster rate than would
be possible by depreciation methods previously permitted for income
tax purposes 22 and because there is a lack of uniformity in the related accounting regulations issued by the several state utility commissions. A tax deferral is recorded when liberalized and accelerated
methods of depreciation and amortization are adopted for tax purposes and straight line methods are followed on the books. Most
public utility companies have classified the resulting accumulated
balance sheet credits to reserves or deferred credits or other nonequity
accounts. Others have classified the accumulated amounts as a
part of restricted earned surplus in the equity capital section of the
balance sheets, while a few others, although identifying them as
restricted earned surplus, have not included them in the equity section of the balance sheet. Still other utility companies have not employed deferred tax accounting but have followed what has been called
the "flow-through" method and have shown in the income statement
normal depreciation charges and the actual current income tax provision without provision for future income taxes.
In September 1958 a public utility subsidiary of a registered holding company filed with the Commission a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and a declaration under the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 with respect to the proposed
issue and sale of first mortgage bonds at competitive bidding. In the
financial statements submitted by the registrant company, which are
also subject to the accounting jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission," the balance sheet carried the accumulated credits arising
from the use of deferred tax accounting in respect of both liberalized
depreciation and accelerated amortization as restricted earned surplus
and stated them as a part of the equity capital of the company. The
Commission's staff questioned the classification in light of Order No.
.. That this wall the intent of these sections of the Code is disclosed by the Report ot the
House Committee on Ways and Means and Report ot the Senate Committee on Finance.
See H. Rep. No. 1337 (S3d Cong., 2d Sess.), p, 24, and Sen. Rep. No. 1622 (S3d Cong .•
2d Sess.), p. 26.
.. Federal Power Commission Orders No. 203 and No. 204 do not make mandatory the
use of deferred tall: accounting for financial accounting purposes by those companies which
elect to deduct lIberal1zed depreciation or accelerated amortization in their income tax
returns.
Rather they provide that where the company /Iou employ deferred tax accountIng, the balance sheet credit shall be classlfled in a new account (Account No. 266) entitled
"Accumulated Deferred Taxes 011 Income."

204 of the Federal Power Commission. It should be noted that an
order of a state regulatory commission to which this company is
subject as to a minor portion of its utility operations authorized a
restricted earned surplus classification. The state commission having
jurisdiction over the company's major distributing facilities had recently issued an order directing the company to transfer the accumulated credits from restricted earned surplus to a reserve account. The
company initiated an appeal from this order.23a
Rule 28 promulgated by this Commission under the 1935 Act prohibits a registered holding company or a subsidiary thereof from
distributing to its security holders, or publishing, financial statements
which are inconsistent with the book accounts of such company or
with financial statements filed by it with the Commission. One of the
considerations raised by the staff of the Commission in the above
described case was whether the applicability of Order No. 204 of the
Federal Power Commission to the registrant rendered the publishing
of any financial statements inconsistent therewith violative of the
provisions of rule 28.
In view of the controversial nature of the subject matter and its
importance to many registrants, the Commission permitted the registration statement to become effective and the securities to be sold on
the basis of full disclosure in footnotes to the financial statements of
the different positions taken by the several regulatory agencies concerned with this company's affairs.
As a result of this case, the substantial amounts involved in the
industry;" and in consideration of differences of opinion as to the
proper interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 44 (Revised),25 the Commission issued on December 30, 1958, a "Notice
of Intention to Announce Interpretation of Administrative Policy.?"
The notice proposed that any financial statement which designates as
earned surplus or its equivalent or includes as a part of equity capital
(even though accompanied by words of limitation such as "restricted"
or "appropriated")
the accumulated credit arising from deferred tax
accounting in respect of liberalized depreciation or accelerated amortization would be presumed by the Commission "to be misleading or
23a Later, on September 8, 1959, the State commission issued a supplemental order amending its earlier order to permit each utility subject to its jurisdiction to elect to follow
either the reserve or the restricted retained income treatment for accumulated deferred
taxes .
.. Federal Power Commission statistics indicate that as of Dec. 31, 1957, the aggregate
amount of accumulated balance sheet credits attributable to both liberalized depreciation
and accelerated amortization in respect of electric utility companies and natural gas
and pipe line companies is $792,755,000 .
.. The import of this bulletin, issued in July 1958 by the Committee on Accounting
Procedure of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, has since been clarified by a statement of that Committee that: "A provision in recognition of the deferral of
Income taxes, being required for the proper determination of net income, should not at
the same time result in a credit to earned surplus or to any other account included In the
stockholder's equity section of the balance sheet" .

Many comments were received in response to the Commission's invitation for views and comments. These views have been analyzed
and summarized. Public hearings on the proposed policy statement
were held before the full Commission on April 8 and 10, 1959, and
the Commission has the matter under advisement.
INTERNATIONAL
BANK. FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
AND INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT
BANK

Section 15 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, as amended,
exempts from registration under both the Securities Act of 1933 and
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 securities issued or guaranteed
as to both principal and interest by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
The bank is required to file with
the Commission such annual and other reports with respect to such
securities as the Commission shall determine to be appropriate in
view of the special character of the bank and its operations and necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors. The
Commission has, pursuant to the above authority, adopted rules requiring the bank to file quarterly reports and also to file copies of
each annual report of the bank to its board of governors.
The bank
if:'also required to file reports with the Commission in advance of any
distribution in the United States of its primary obligations.
The
Commission, acting in consultation with the National Advisory Council on International Monetary 'and Financial Problems, is authorized
to suspend the exemption at any time as to any or 'all securities issued
or guaranteed by the bank during the period of such suspension.
By virtue of Public Law 86-147, approved August 7, 1959, which
authorizes United States participation in the new Inter-American
Development Bank, a similar exemption has been provided for certain securities which may be issued by the new bank. The Commission is considering appropriate rules and regulations with respect
to the new bank of the character presently in effect with respect to
the International Bank.
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development sold
in the United States during the fiscal year only one issue of its
primary obligations, in the amount of $100 million, of which
$4,300,000 was for delayed delivery. At the end of the fiscal year
the total funded debt of the bank was approximately the equivalent
of $1.9 billion, of which $1.6 billion was payable in United States
dollars. At the same time the subscribed capital stock of the Bank
aggregated $9.6 billion of which $7.6 billion constituted the uncalled
portion of the subscriptions.

Bank lending during the 12 months ended on June 30, 1959, continued at the high level reached in the previous fiscal year aggregating
the equivalent of approximately $703 million. As indicated in the
bank's 14th Annual Report, because of the implications of the new
level of bank lending in recent years, the governor of the bank for the
United States proposed during the fiscal year consideration of an increase in the capital of the bank. This resulted in a proposal by the
executive directors of the bank that member countries should be invited
to double their capital subscriptions.
The executive directors also
agreed to recommend additional increases over and above the general
100 percent increase in the subscription of 17 member countries. It
was proposed that the authorized capital of the bank be increased from
$10 billion to $21 billion. The proposal envisaged that the entire
amount of the additional general subscription would be left subject to
call and that the board of governors of the bank should decide that
calls would only be made if required by the bank to meet its obligations on borrowings or guarantees.
These proposals were adopted and, at the end of the fiscal year, legislation necessary to carry the increased subscriptions into effect was
being enacted in many member countries. As of September 10, 1959,
the proposal to increase the capital of the bank became effective when
34 countries had increased the subscribed capital by $7,664.7 million.
At that date total subscribed capital was $17,221.2 million.
OPINIONS OF THE COMMISSION

Opinions are issued by the Commission in contested and other cases
arising under the statutes administered by it and under the Commission's rules of practice, where the nature of the matter to be decided,
whether substantive or procedural, is of sufficient importance to warrant a formal expression of views. These opinions include detailed
findings of fact and conclusions of law based on evidentiary records
taken before a hearing examiner who serves independently of the
operating divisions, or, in an occasional case, before a single Commissioner or the entire Commission. In some cases, formal hearings are
waived by the parties and the findings and conclusions are based on
stipulated facts or admissions.
The Commission is assisted in the preparation of findings and
opinions by its Office of Opinion Writing, a staff office completely
independent of the operating divisions of the Commission and directly
responsible to the Commission itself. The independence of the staff
members of this office reflects the principle, embodied in the Administrative Procedure Act, of a separation between staff members performing investigatory or prosecutory functions and those performing
quasi-judicial functions.
In some cases, with the consent of all parties,

202

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the interested operating division participates in the drafting of
opinions.
Opinions are publicly released and distributed to representatives of
the press and to persons on the Commission's mailing list. In addition, the opinions are printed and published by the Government
Printing Office in bound volumes entitled "Securities and Exchange
Commission Decisions and Reports."
During the fiscal year 1959, the Commission issued 143 opinions
and other rulings of an adjudicatory nature.
STATISTICS

AND SPECIAL STUDIES

At its inception the Commission organized a large Research Division
to assist in the drafting of rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. The
division was staffed with a large number of experts from various
phases of the securities business, economists, and statisticians. Many
of the Commission's policies and rules, as well as further securities
legislation, were based on special studies prepared by the research
staff. By 1940 most of the initial research work required by the Commission for the formulation of rules and regulations had been completed, and the Research Division was dissolved and certain of its
activities and general statistical work was transferred to the Division
of Trading and Exchanges.
While subsequent research and statistical work was of a more routine
nature and was chiefly carried out for internal purposes, the Commission began to provide more information of a broader economic
character as related to the capital markets. During this period the
Commission began publication of its series on individuals' saving,
corporate liquid position, plant and equipment expenditures and
quarterly financial report for manufacturing corporations. Several
of these series are joint undertakings with other Government agencies.
As public interest grew in the various data prepared and collected by
the SEC, more of the statistical material was released and the publication of a monthly statistical bulletin was begun.
In recent years, the statistical activities have been co-ordinated
with the overall Government statistical program under the direction
of the Bureau of the Budget. As the need arises, new surveys are
made. One of the most significant in the last few years is the Commission's survey of corporate pension funds. All of the series published by the Commission are studied continuously in order to expand
and improve them in answer to demands of Government agencies,
business and the general public.
The regular statistical series which are prepared include data on
securities effectively registered under the Securities Act of 1933, offerings of securities by all corporations in the United States (including

TWENTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

203

issues not registered with the Commission, such as privately placed
issues and railroad securities), retirements of corporate securities, net
change in corporate securities outstanding, stock prices and trading.
In addition, the research and statistical activity carried out under
the direction of the Bureau of the Budget includes individuals' saving in the United States, income flow and investments of private pension funds of United States corporations, current liquid position
of United States corporations, sources and uses of corporate funds,
anticipated expenditures for plant and equipment by United States
businesses, and a quarterly financial report for all United States
manufacturing concerns.
The statistical series described below are published in the Commission's statistical bulletin and in addition, except for data on registered issues, current figures and analyses of the data are published
in quarterly press releases. The Commission's stock price index is
released weekly, together with the data on round-lot and odd-lot
trading on the two New York stock exchanges.
Issues Registered Under the Securities Act of 1933

Monthly and quarterly statistics are compiled on the number and
volume of registered securities, classified by industry of issuer, type
of security, and use of proceeds. A summary covering the entire
25-year period of the Commission's history appears on page 215, appendix table 1.
New Securities Offerings

This is a monthly and quarterly series covering all new corporate
and noncorporate issues offered for cash sale in the United States.
The series includes not only issues publicly offered but also issues
privately placed, as well as other issues exempt from registration
under the Securities Act such as intrastate offerings and railroad
securities. The offerings series includes only securities actually offered
for cash sale, and only issues offered for account of issuers. Annual
statistics on new offerings beginning with 1934 as well as monthly
figures from January 1958 through June 1959, are given in appendix
tables 3, 4 and 5.
Estimates of the net cash flow through securities transactions are
prepared quarterly and are derived by deducting from the amount
of estimated gross proceeds received by corporations through the
sale of securities the amount of estimated gross payments by corporations to investors for securities retired. Data on gross issues, retirements and net change in securities outstanding are presented for all
corporations and for the principal industry groups.
Stock Market Data

Statistics are regularly compiled on the market value and volume
of sales on registered and exempted securities exchanges, round-lot

204

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

stock transactions of the New York exchanges for accounts of members and nonmembers, odd-lot stock transactions on the New York
exchanges, special offerings and secondary distributions. Indexes of
stock market prices are compiled, based upon the weekly closing market prices of 265 common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The indexes are composed of 7 major industry groups, 29
subordinated groups, and a composite group.
Individuals'

Saving

The Commission compiles quarterly estimates of the volume and
composition of individuals' saving in the United States. The series
represent net increases in individuals' financial assets less net increases
in debt. The study shows the aggregate amount of saving and the
form in which the saving occurred, such as investment in securities,
expansion of bank deposits, increase in insurance and pension reserves, etc. A reconciliation of the Commission's estimates with the
personal saving estimates of the Department of Commerce, derived
in connection with its national income series, is published annually by
the Commerce Department as well as in the Securities and Exchange
Commission Statistical Bulletin.
Corporate Pension Funds

An annual survey is made of pension plans of all United States
corporations where funds are administered by corporations themselves, or through trustees. The survey shows the flow of money into
these funds, the types of assets in which the funds are invested and
the principal items of income and expenditures.
Financial Position of Corporations

The series on working capital position of all United States corporations, excluding banks, insurance companies and savings and loan
associations, shows the principal components of current assets and
liabilities, and also contains an abbreviated analysis of the sources
and uses of corporate funds.
The Commission, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission,
compiles a quarterly financial report of all United States manufacturing concerns. This report gives complete balance sheet data and an
abbreviated income account, data being classified by industry and
size of company.
Plant and Equipment Expenditures

The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce, conducts quarterly and annual surveys of actual and anticipated plant
and equipment expenditures of all United States business, exclusive
of agriculture. Shortly after the close of each quarter, data are released on actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated
expenditures for the next two quarters. In addition, a survey is made

TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT

205

at the beginning of each year of the plans for business expansion
during that year.
PUBUC DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

Public disclosure and dissemination of information with respect to
securities offered for public sale and those traded on exchanges is
essential if public investors generally are to benefit by the disclosure
requirements of the Federal securities laws and if an evaluation of the
worth of securities is to be made by a broad segment of the investing
public. This is accomplished in part by distribution of the prospectus
of offering circular on new offerings, and by filing of annual and
other periodic reports with exchanges and the Commission by listed
companies. Much data filed with the Commission obtains widespread
currency through published securities manuals, investment advisory
services, statistical services and otherwise.
To facilitate public dissemination of the financial and other proposals filed with and actions taken by the Commission, a daily News
Digest is issued which contains a resume of these findings and actions.
This digest is distributed initially to the press, and is distributed on
a semiweekly basis to a mailing list comprising nearly 7,000 names.
The daily digest, for example, contained a summary of the pertinent
facts with respect to the proposals for public offering of securities
contained in the 1,226 registration statements filed during the past
fiscal year. During the year, also, the daily digests contained an informative discussion of each of the 888 orders, decisions and rules
issued by the Commission. Much of the information is published in
the daily newspapers and in financial and other periodicals. Other
releases of an informational nature issued by the Commission include
its various Statistical Series releases and announcements of actions,
civil and criminal, which arise out of the enforcement of the laws.
Members of the Commission and its staff also deliver addresses from
time to time before professional and other.groups, and participate in
radio or television discussions, to explain the nature and scope of the
Commission's functions and activities.
Information

Available for Public Inspection

During every fiscal year thousands of requests for information are
received by mail and through telephone calls and personal visits.
Most of these requests are answered by employees in the Commission's
public reference rooms in Washington, Chicago, and New York City.
The files of the Commission provide information of interest to a
large cross section of the public. Numerous people visit the public
reference rooms seeking information on which to base decisions to
buy or sell securities; they are furnished the files which contain
financial and other information about the issuers of the securities.
Many other visitors consult Commission records. They may be repre-

206

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

sentatives of legal and accounting firms, corporations and labor
unions; they are interested largely in gathering information to be used
as specimens, as precedent material, or for other specialized purposes.
The inquiries received through the mails and over the telephone
follow the same pattern.
Copies of any public information filed with the Commission may be
examined at the principal office in Washington, D.C. Such information includes registration statements, applications and declarations filed under the various statutes administered by the Commission,
together with the records of agency action. In Washington, as in
the regional offices, space considerations have necessitated the transfer
of some of this material to warehouse-type space in nearby federal
records centers. Files from these centers are usually available within
24 hours.
The New York Regional Office has copies of recent filings made by
companies having securities listed on exchanges other than the New
York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange, and copies
of current filings of many companies which have effective registration
statements under the Securities Act of 1933. The Chicago Regional
Office has copies of recent reports of companies which have securities
listed on the New York and American stock exchanges. Reports of
listed companies on the New York, American and Midwest stock exchanges may be seen at the exchange offices.
All regional offices have copies of prospectuses used in recent public
offerings of securities registered under the Securities Act, of active
broker-dealer and investment adviser registration applications originating in their respective regions and of regulation A letters of notification filed intheir respective regions.
The public reference room in Washington had 4,800 visitors during
the fiscal year. Requests were filled for an additional 30,513 persons
who were sent 630,869 copies of Commission publications.
During
the fiscal year 128,149 photocopy pages were sold pursuant to 2,021
orders. Additional thousands of persons made use of the facilities
provided by the N ew York and Chicago public reference rooms.

Personnel Program

In fiscal 1959, the Commission continued to emphasize the recruiting of outstanding college and law school students with the specialized
academic training required for the Commission's fields of work. By
maintaining close contact with placement offices of various colleges
and universities, and through on-campus interviews, the Commission

TWENTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

211

placed a substantial number of applicants of college caliber for its
starting professional level positions.
In January 1959, the Commission adopted four Merit Promotion
Plans covering the following groups of employees:
1. Professional and technical employees in the Headquarters Office.
2. Secretarial, wage board and clerical employees in the- Headquarters Office.
3. Professional and technical employees in the regional offices.
4. Clerical employees in the regional offices.
The purpose of these plans is to apply the Commission's promotion
policy systematically and otherwise to comply with Civil Service
Commission requirements in that area. Members of the staff were
consulted and afforded opportunity for review and comment prior to
formal adoption. In April 1959, representatives of the Civil Service
Commission inspected the Commission's operation under the plans and
found them to be effective and in compliance with its Governmentwide Merit Promotion Program.
As required by the Government Employees Training Act of 1958,
a review was made of the Commission's overall training needs and
plans were formulated to meet these needs. On a cooperative basis
with other regulatory agencies, arrangements were made for a supervisory training course for middle and top management officials. In
addition, the Commission's Division of Corporation Finance and New
York Regional Office continued to conduct training sessions for their
professional staffs.
Under its Incentive Awards Plan the Commission recognized the
long service of its career employees by presenting 10- and 20-year
service pins and certificates for service with the Commission to a total
of 90 employees. In addition, cash awards totaling $6,325 and certificates of merit were presented to 55 employees.
The outstanding achievements of members of the Commission's
staff continued to receive public recognition in the form of awards
made by other organizations. In February 1959 Thomas G. Meeker,
General Counsel of the Commission, received an Arthur S. Flemming
Award of the Junior Chamber of Commerce of Washington, D.C., as
1 of the 10 outstanding young men in the Federal service. In March
1959, the National Civil Service League awarded certificates of merit
to 5 Commission employees-William Green, Atlanta Regional Administrator; Vito Natrella, Chief Economist, Division of Trading
and Exchanges; J. Arnold Pines, Chief Financial Analyst, Division
of Corporate Regulation; Harry Pollack, Director of Personnel; and
Byron D. Woodside, Director, Division of Corporation Finance. In
April 1959, a Rockefeller Public Service Award, 1 of 11 such awards
made throughout the Federal service, was granted to Harry Heller,

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Assistant Director, Division of Corporation Finance. In May 1959,
an attorney in the Chicago Regional Office, Sidney Sosin, was awarded
It Certificate and Citation of Merit by the 'William A. Jump Memorial
Foundation.
The Commission is justifiably proud of these distinctions earned by members of its staff whose loyal and efficient service
has made such a significant contribution to accomplishing the statutory objectives for which the Commission was established.
