ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS RULINGS
Release No. 4109/August 31, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17383

In the Matter of
DYNAMIC VENTURES CORP.

ORDER POSTPONING
HEARING AND SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On August 12, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondent has securities registered with the Commission and is delinquent in its
periodic filings. A hearing is currently scheduled for September 12, 2016.
On August 30, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service asserting
that Respondent was served with the OIP by mail, in accordance with 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.141(a)(2)(ii), on August 15, 2016. However, the “87776 E Shea Blvd” address referenced
in the declaration differs from the “8776 E Shea Blvd” address shown on Respondent’s most
recent filing with the Commission. As such, the declaration does not establish service under 17
C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii).
I therefore ORDER the Division to file an updated declaration of service by September 9,
2016. I FURTHER ORDER that the September 12, 2016, hearing is POSTPONED, and that a
telephonic prehearing conference shall be held on October 31, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern, if the
proceeding has not been resolved by then.
