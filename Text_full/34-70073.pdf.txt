Broker-Dealer Reports
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), is amending certain broker-dealer annual reporting,
audit, and notification requirements. The amendments include a requirement that broker-dealer
audits be conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (“PCAOB”) in light of explicit oversight authority provided to the PCAOB by the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) to oversee these
audits. The amendments further require a broker-dealer that clears transactions or carries
customer accounts to agree to allow representatives of the Commission or the broker-dealer’s
designated examining authority (“DEA”) to review the documentation associated with certain
reports of the broker-dealer’s independent public accountant and to allow the accountant to
discuss the findings relating to the reports of the accountant with those representatives when
requested in connection with a regulatory examination of the broker-dealer. Finally, the
amendments require a broker-dealer to file a new form with its DEA that elicits information
about the broker-dealer’s practices with respect to the custody of securities and funds of
customers and non-customers.

DATES: This rule is effective June 1, 2014, except the amendment to § 240.17a-5(e)(5), which
is effective October 21, 2013 and the amendments to § 240.17a-5(a) and (d)(6) and § 249.639,
which are effective December 31, 2013.

BACKGROUND
A.

Overview

In 2009, the Commission began reviewing rules regarding the safekeeping of investor
assets in connection with several cases the Commission brought alleging fraudulent conduct by
investment advisers and broker-dealers, including, among other things, misappropriation or other
misuse of customer securities and funds. 1 As part of the rule review effort, the Commission
amended Rule 206(4)-2 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Rule 206(4)-2”), which

1

See, e.g., SEC v. Bernard L. Madoff, et al., Litigation Release No. 20889 (Feb. 9, 2009); SEC v. Stanford
International Bank, et al., Litigation Release No. 20901 (Feb. 17, 2009); SEC v. Donald Anthony Walker
Young, et al., Litigation Release No. 21006 (Apr. 20, 2009); SEC v. Isaac I. Ovid, et al., Litigation Release
No. 20998 (Apr. 14, 2009); SEC v. The Nutmeg Group, LLC, et al., Litigation Release No. 20972 (Mar.
25, 2009); SEC v. WG Trading Investors, L.P., et al., Litigation Release No. 20912 (Feb. 25, 2009).

governs the custody of client securities and funds by investment advisers. 2 When adopting this
amendment, the Commission stated that it represented “a first step in the effort to enhance
custody protections, with consideration of additional enhancements of the rules governing
custody of customer assets by broker-dealers to follow.” 3
In June 2011, the Commission proposed rule amendments and a new form designed,
among other things, to provide additional safeguards with respect to broker-dealer custody of
customer securities and funds. 4 The proposed amendments would have amended certain annual
reporting, audit, and notification requirements for broker-dealers. 5 The proposed amendments
also would have required a broker-dealer that clears transactions or carries customer accounts
(each, a “clearing broker-dealer”) to agree to allow representatives of the Commission or the
broker-dealer’s DEA to review the documentation associated with certain reports of the brokerdealer’s independent public accountant and to allow the accountant to discuss with
representatives of the Commission or DEA the accountant’s findings associated with those
reports when requested in connection with an examination of the broker-dealer. 6 Further, the
proposed amendments would have required a broker-dealer to file with its DEA on a quarterly
basis a new form – Form Custody – that would have elicited information as to whether, and if so
how, a broker-dealer maintains custody of securities and funds of customers and others. 7 The
Commission also proposed requiring that a broker-dealer file its annual reports with the
2

(“Advisers Act”) Release No. 2968 (Dec. 30, 2009), 75 FR 1456 (Jan. 11, 2010). See also 17 CFR

The proposed amendments were designed to enhance the ability of the Commission to
oversee broker-dealer custody practices and, among other things, to: (1) increase the focus of
broker-dealers that maintain custody of customer funds and securities (“carrying broker-dealers”)
and their independent public accountants on compliance, and internal control over compliance,
with certain financial and custodial requirements; (2) strengthen and clarify broker-dealer audit
and reporting requirements in order to facilitate consistent compliance with these requirements;
(3) facilitate the ability of the PCAOB to implement the explicit oversight authority over brokerdealer audits provided to the PCAOB by the Dodd-Frank Act; 9 (4) ensure that SIPC receives the
necessary information to assess whether the liquidation fund it maintains is appropriately sized to
the risks of a large broker-dealer failure; (5) enable Commission and DEA examiners to conduct
risk-based examinations of carrying and clearing broker-dealers by assisting the examiners in
selecting areas of focus for their examinations; and (6) provide the Commission and the DEAs
with a comprehensive overview of a broker-dealer’s custody practices. 10
The Commission received 27 comment letters on the proposal. 11 The Commission has
considered the comments and, as discussed in detail below, is adopting the amendments and the
8

Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, H.R. 4173 (July 21, 2010).

10

The proposed amendments also were designed to avoid duplicative requirements for broker-dealers that are
dually-registered as investment advisers in view of the internal control report requirement that was added
by the amendment to Rule 206(4)-2. See discussion below in section VII.A. of this release identifying
further motivations for the amendments.

new form with modifications, in part in response to comments received. A number of
commenters stated that the Commission should coordinate with the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (“CFTC”) to account for broker-dealers that also are registered as futures
commission merchants (“FCMs”) in order to align the broker-dealer reporting and audit
requirements with FCM reporting and audit requirements. 12 The Commission staff is in
discussions with the CFTC staff concerning ways to align the reporting and audit requirements
for dually-registered broker-dealer/FCMs with the goal of coordinating these requirements,
including the requirements that the Commission is adopting today.

(“Account Statement Rules”) 16 (collectively for the purposes of this release, “the financial
responsibility rules”) are central to today’s amendments to the broker-dealer reporting, audit, and
notification requirements. In light of the significance of the financial responsibility rules to
today’s amendments, the following section briefly summarizes the requirements of each rule in
order to provide a foundation for the later discussion of the amendments.
1.

The Broker-Dealer Net Capital Rule

Rule 15c3-1 requires broker-dealers to maintain a minimum level of net capital
(consisting of highly liquid assets) at all times. 17 In computing net capital, a broker-dealer must,
among other things, calculate net worth in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) and then make certain adjustments to net worth, such as deducting illiquid
assets and taking other capital charges and adding qualifying subordinated loans. 18 The amount
remaining after these deductions is defined as “tentative net capital.” 19 The final step in
computing net capital is to deduct certain percentages (“haircuts”) from the market value of the
broker-dealer’s proprietary positions to account for the market risk inherent in the positions 20
and to create a buffer of liquidity to protect against other risks associated with the brokerdealer’s business. 21 The broker-dealer must cease conducting a securities business if the amount
16

See, e.g., Rule 9.12 of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (“CBOE”); NASD Rule 2340 of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”).

17

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1. The rule requires that a broker-dealer perform two calculations: (1) a computation
of the minimum amount of net capital the broker-dealer must maintain; and (2) a computation of the
amount of net capital the broker-dealer is maintaining. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a) and (c)(2). The
computation of net capital is based on the definition of the term “net capital” in paragraph (c)(2) of Rule
15c3-1. Id. Generally, a broker-dealer’s minimum net capital requirement is the greater of a fixed-dollar
amount specified in the rule and an amount determined by applying one of two financial ratios. See 17
CFR 240.15c3-1(a).

18

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(i)–(xiii).

19

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(15).

20

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi).

21

See, e.g., Uniform Net Capital Rule, Exchange Act Release No. 13635 (June 16, 1977), 42 FR 31778 (June
23, 1977).

of net capital maintained by the firm falls below the minimum required amount. 22
2.

The Broker-Dealer Customer Protection Rule

Rule 15c3-3 imposes two key requirements on a carrying broker-dealer: first, the brokerdealer must maintain physical possession or control over customers’ fully paid and excess
margin securities; 23 and second, the firm must maintain a reserve of funds or qualified
securities 24 in an account at one or more banks that is at least equal in value to the amount of net
funds owed to customers. 25 These requirements are designed to protect customers by requiring
broker-dealers to segregate customers’ securities and funds from the broker-dealer’s proprietary
business activities. If the broker-dealer fails financially, customers’ securities and funds should
be readily available to be returned to customers. In addition, if the failed broker-dealer is
liquidated in a proceeding under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (“SIPA”), as
amended, the customers’ securities and funds should be isolated and readily identifiable as
“customer property” and, consequently, available to be distributed to customers ahead of other

22

See 15 U.S.C. 78o(c)(3)(A).

23

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(d). Control means the broker-dealer must hold these securities free of lien in one
of several locations specified in the rule (e.g., at a bank or clearing agency). See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(c).
The broker-dealer must make a daily determination from its books and records (as of the preceding day) of
the quantity of fully paid and excess margin securities not in its possession or control. See 17 CFR
240.15c3-3(d). If the amount in the broker-dealer’s possession or control is less than the amount indicated
as being held for customers on the broker-dealer’s books and records, the broker-dealer generally must
initiate steps to retrieve customer securities from non-control locations or otherwise obtain possession of
them or place them in control locations. Id. The terms fully paid securities, margin securities, and excess
margin securities are defined in Rule 15c3-3. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5),
respectively.

24

The term qualified security is defined in Rule 15c3-3 to mean a security issued by the U.S. or a security in
respect of which the principal and interest are guaranteed by the U.S. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(6).

25

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(e). The amount of the net funds owed to customers (“customer reserve
requirement”) is computed by adding customer credit items (e.g., cash in securities accounts) and
subtracting from that amount customer debit items (e.g., margin loans) pursuant to a formula in Exhibit A
to Rule 15c3-3. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3a. Carrying broker-dealers are required to compute the customer
reserve requirement on a weekly basis, except where customer credit balances do not exceed $1 million (in
which case the computation can be performed monthly, although the broker-dealer must maintain 105% of
the required deposit amount and may not exceed a specified aggregate indebtedness limit). See 17 CFR
240.15c3-3(e)(3).

creditors. 26
Provisions of Rule 15c3-3 exempt a broker-dealer from the requirements of Rule 15c3-3
under certain circumstances. 27 Generally, a broker-dealer is exempt from Rule 15c3-3 if it does
not hold customer securities or funds, or, if it does receive customer securities or funds, it
promptly delivers the securities or promptly transmits the funds to appropriate persons. 28
3.

The Broker-Dealer Quarterly Securities Count Rule

Rule 17a-13 generally requires a broker-dealer that maintains custody of securities
(proprietary, customer, or both), on a quarterly basis, to physically examine and count the
securities it holds, account for the securities that are subject to its control or direction but are not
in its physical possession (e.g., securities held at a control location), verify the locations of
securities under certain circumstances, and compare the results of the count and verification with
its records. 29 In accordance with a schedule, the broker-dealer must take an operational capital
charge under Rule 15c3-1 for short securities differences (which include securities positions
reflected on the broker-dealer’s securities record that are not susceptible to either count or
confirmation) that are unresolved after discovery. 30 The differences also must be recorded in the
broker-dealer’s books and records. 31
4.

The Broker-Dealer Account Statement Rules

The Account Statement Rules of DEAs require member broker-dealers to send, at least
once every calendar quarter, a statement of account containing a description of any securities

positions, money balances, or account activity to each customer whose account had a security
position, money balance, or account activity during the period since the last such statement was
sent to the customer. 32 The Account Statement Rules provide a key safeguard for customers by
requiring that they receive information concerning securities positions and other assets held in
their accounts on a regular basis, which they can use to identify discrepancies and monitor the
performance of their accounts.
II.

FINAL AMENDMENTS TO BROKER-DEALER REPORTING, AUDIT,
NOTIFICATION, AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS
A.

Overview of New Requirements

The Commission is adopting amendments to the reporting, audit, and notification
requirements in Rule 17a-5, and additional amendments to other provisions of the rule, including
technical changes. The Commission also is adopting amendments to the notification
requirements in Rule 17a-11, and certain other technical amendments to that rule.
Under the amendments to the reporting and audit requirements, broker-dealers must,
among other things, file with the Commission annual reports consisting of a financial report and
either a compliance report or an exemption report that are prepared by the broker-dealer, as well
as certain reports that are prepared by an independent public accountant covering the financial
report and the compliance report or the exemption report. 33 The filing of a compliance or
exemption report and the related report of the independent public accountant are new
requirements. The financial report must contain the same types of financial statements that were
required to be filed under Rule 17a-5 prior to these amendments (a statement of financial
condition, a statement of income, a statement of cash flows, and certain other financial

32

See, e.g., CBOE Rule 9.12; NASD Rule 2340.

33

See paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5.

12

statements). 34 In addition, the financial report must contain, as applicable, the supporting
schedules that were required to be filed under Rule 17a-5 prior to these amendments (a
computation of net capital under Rule 15c3-1, a computation of the reserve requirements under
Rule 15c3-3, and information relating to the possession or control requirements under Rule 15c33). 35
A broker-dealer that did not claim that it was exempt from Rule 15c3-3 throughout the
most recent fiscal year must file the compliance report, and a broker-dealer that did claim it was
exempt from Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year (generally, a “non-carrying
broker-dealer”) must file the exemption report. 36 Broker-dealers must make certain statements
and provide certain information relating to the financial responsibility rules in these reports. 37
In addition to preparing and filing the financial report and the compliance report or
exemption report, a broker-dealer must engage a PCAOB-registered independent public
accountant to prepare a report based on an examination of the broker-dealer’s financial report in
accordance with PCAOB standards. 38 A carrying broker-dealer also must engage the PCAOBregistered independent public accountant to prepare a report based on an examination of certain
statements in the broker-dealer’s compliance report. 39 A non-carrying broker-dealer must
engage the PCAOB-registered independent public accountant to prepare a report based on a

review of certain statements in the broker-dealer’s exemption report. 40 In each case, the
examination or review must be conducted in accordance with PCAOB standards. The brokerdealer must file these reports with the Commission along with the financial report and the
compliance report or exemption report prepared by the broker-dealer. 41
The annual reports also must be filed with SIPC if the broker-dealer is a member of
SIPC. 42 In addition, broker-dealers must generally file with SIPC a supplemental report on the
status of the membership of the broker-dealer in SIPC. 43 The supplemental report must include a
report of the independent public accountant that covers the SIPC annual general assessment
reconciliation or exclusion from membership forms based on certain procedures specified in the
rule. In the future, SIPC may determine the format of this report by rule, subject to Commission
approval. 44
Finally, the PCAOB-registered independent public accountant must immediately notify
the broker-dealer if the accountant determines during the course of preparing the accountant’s
reports that the broker-dealer is not in compliance with the financial responsibility rules or if the
accountant determines that any material weakness exists in the broker-dealer’s internal control
over compliance with the financial responsibility rules. 45 The broker-dealer, in turn, must file a
notification with the Commission and its DEA under Rule 15c3-1, Rule 15c3-3, or Rule 17a-11
40

See paragraphs (f)(1) and (g)(2)(ii) of Rule 17a-5.

accountant are discussed below in more detail in section II.D.3. of this release.

Id. Currently, Rule 17a-5 prescribes the format of the report. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5.

45

See paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5. As discussed below, material weakness is defined for purposes of the
compliance report and, therefore, the notification of a material weakness only can occur in the context of
the audit of a broker-dealer that files a compliance report.

14

if the independent public accountant’s notice concerns an instance of non-compliance that would
trigger notification under those rules. 46 Under the amendments to Rule 17a-11, a broker-dealer
also must file a notification with the Commission and its DEA if the broker-dealer discovers or is
notified by the independent public accountant of the existence of any material weakness (as
defined in the amendments) in the broker-dealer’s internal control over compliance with the
financial responsibility rules. 47
Each of these amendments is discussed in more detail in the following sections of this
release.
B.

Annual Reports to Be Filed – Paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5

Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5 generally required a brokerdealer to annually file the financial statements and supporting schedules discussed below in
section II.B.2. of this release and a report prepared by the broker-dealer’s independent public
accountant covering the financial statements and supporting schedules. 48 The Commission
proposed amendments that would, among other things, restructure paragraph (d) and – as part of
the proposed revisions to the attestation engagement provisions – add the requirement that a
broker-dealer file either a compliance report or an exemption report, as applicable, and a report
prepared by the broker-dealer’s independent public accountant based on an examination of the
compliance report or a review of the exemption report. 49 As discussed in sections II.B.1.

46

Id. Notifications under Rule 17a-11 also must be filed with the CFTC if the broker-dealer is registered as a
FCM with the CFTC. See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(g).

47

See paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11. These notification provisions are discussed below in more detail in
section II.F. of this release.

48

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(1)(i). Certain types of broker-dealers were exempt from the requirement to file
the reports or to file reports that had been audited by an independent public accountant. See 17 CFR
240.17a-5(d)(1)(ii)–(iii).

49

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37575–37581.

15

through II.B.6. of this release, the Commission is adopting the proposed amendments to
paragraph (d) with modifications. 50
1.

Requirement to File Reports – Paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 17a-5
i.

Proposed Amendments

The Commission proposed to amend paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 17a-5 51 to require that a
broker-dealer file a financial report containing financial statements and supporting schedules and
either a compliance report or an exemption report, as applicable. 52 The proposal provided that a
broker-dealer must file a compliance report “unless the [broker-dealer] is exempt from the
provisions of [Rule 15c3-3]” in which case the broker-dealer would be required to file an
exemption report. 53 The proposed amendments also would have required a broker-dealer
generally to file reports prepared by an independent public accountant covering the financial
report and compliance report or exemption report, as applicable, unless the broker-dealer was
exempt from the requirement to file the reports or from the requirement to engage an
independent public accountant with respect to the reports. 54 To accommodate these changes, the
Commission also proposed to reorganize the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 17a-5, and to

50

Before today’s amendments, paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5 was titled “Annual filing of audited financial
statements.” In the proposing release, the Commission proposed to change the title to “Annual reports” to
reflect that, under the proposed amendments to paragraph (d), broker-dealers would be required to prepare
and file two reports with the Commission – a financial report and a compliance report or an exemption
report. See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37575. The Commission received no comments on this
proposal and is adopting the new title as proposed. See paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5. In addition, the
Commission is making a technical amendment to paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5 to replace the term “fiscal or
calendar year” with the term “fiscal year.” The Commission is adopting this technical amendment because
the term “fiscal year” includes instances in which December 31st, i.e., the calendar year end, is the brokerdealer’s fiscal year end.

make other technical amendments. 55
The proposed amendments with respect to the compliance report and exemption report
set forth different requirements for carrying broker-dealers as compared with broker-dealers that
do not hold customer securities and funds. 56 In order to provide clarity with respect to this
distinction, the proposed amendments referenced Rule 15c3-3, which applies to carrying brokerdealers and contains provisions under which a broker-dealer is exempt from the requirements in
the rule. The goal was to establish a clear way of determining whether a broker-dealer would
need to file a compliance report or an exemption report. However, not all broker-dealers that are
subject to Rule 15c3-3 regularly hold customer securities or funds. This prompted the
Commission to inquire in the proposing release as to whether there are broker-dealers that would
not qualify to file the proposed exemption report because they are not exempt from Rule 15c3-3,
but that should be allowed to file a more limited report than the proposed compliance report
based on the limited scope of their business. 57
ii.

Comments Received

The Commission received several comments on its proposed amendments to paragraph
(d)(1) of Rule 17a-5. 58 Some commenters asked whether the provision that would require the
broker-dealer to file an exemption report instead of a compliance report related to a period end
date or to a period of time. 59 Further, as discussed in more detail in sections II.B.4. and II.D.3.
of this release, commenters raised questions and concerns about how instances of exceptions to

meeting the exemption provisions of paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 would be treated under the
proposed reporting requirements. 60 One commenter also stated that “limited purpose” carrying
broker-dealers should not be required to file a compliance report, and broker-dealers with certain
business model characteristics should not be required to file the compliance report. 61 Similarly,
another commenter stated that broker-dealers engaging exclusively in proprietary trading or
investment banking may not technically be exempt from Rule 15c3-3 but nonetheless should not
have to file the compliance report as they do not have “customers.” 62 Finally, one commenter
stated that the Commission should clarify who must sign the compliance reports and exemption
reports and the liability that attaches in the event of a misstatement or omission in the reports. 63
iii.

The Final Rule

After considering these comments, the Commission is adopting the proposed
amendments with certain modifications. 64 Under the final rule, all broker-dealers generally must

60

See CAI Letter; SIFMA Letter.

61

See CAI Letter; CAI II Letter.

62

See McGladrey Letter.

63

See CAI Letter.

64

See paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 17a-5. Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of Rule 17a-5 (now re-designated as paragraph
(d)(1)(iv)) contains an exemption from filing an annual report if the broker-dealer is a member of a national
securities exchange and has transacted business in securities solely with or for other members of a national
securities exchange, and has not carried any margin account, credit balance or security for any person who
is defined as a “customer” in paragraph (c)(4) of Rule 17a-5. See paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of Rule 17a-5. The
Commission also proposed to move the exemptions from having to file financial statements under
paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5 from paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(1)(iii) of Rule 17a-5 to paragraphs (d)(1)(iii)
and (d)(1)(iv), respectively. The Commission received no comments on these amendments and is adopting
them as proposed. See paragraphs (d)(1)(iii) and (d)(1)(iv) of Rule 17a-5. For clarity, the amendments to
paragraph (d)(1)(i) of Rule 17a-5 include a reference to the exemptions from the requirement for a brokerdealer to file the annual reports so that the paragraph now states “[e]xcept as provided in paragraphs
(d)(1)(iii) and (d)(1)(iv) of this section, every broker or dealer registered under section 15 of the Act must
file annually . . . .” See paragraph (d)(1)(i) of Rule 17a-5. As proposed, the final rule provided that the
reports must be filed annually “on a calendar or fiscal year basis.” The final rule deletes the phrase “on a
calendar or fiscal year basis” as the rule provides elsewhere that the annual reports must be filed on a fiscal
year basis. Id. In addition, the Commission proposed to move the requirement that reports under
paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5 be as of the same fixed or determinable date each year, unless a change is
approved in writing by the broker-dealer’s DEA, from paragraph (d)(1)(i) of Rule 17a-5 to paragraph
(d)(1)(ii). The Commission received no comments on this proposed amendment and is adopting it
substantially as proposed. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of Rule 17a-5. The final rule also includes a technical

18

prepare and file a financial report and either the compliance report or the exemption report. 65 A
broker-dealer that did not claim an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 at any time during the most
recent fiscal year or claimed an exemption for only part of the fiscal year must prepare and file
the compliance report. 66 A broker-dealer must prepare and file the exemption report if the firm
did claim that it was exempt from Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year. 67 Brokerdealers also must file reports prepared by a PCAOB-registered independent public accountant
covering the financial report and the compliance report or exemption report, as applicable. 68
The final rule is modified from the proposal in three key ways. First, the final rule
provides that the broker-dealer must file the exemption report if it did “claim that it was exempt”
from Rule 15c3-3 69 throughout the most recent fiscal year. 70 This modification from the

modification from the proposal to require that the reports required to be filed under paragraph (d) must be
as of the same “fiscal year end each year,” rather than as of the same “fixed or determinable date each
year.” See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of Rule 17a-5. This change, by having the rule refer to the broker-dealer’s
“fiscal year,” eliminates outdated language and conforms the language in paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5 to
language in paragraph (n) of Rule 17a-5. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(n). The final rule also adds a clarifying
cross-reference to the provision in Rule 17a-5 pursuant to which a broker-dealer requests a change of its
fiscal year end. See paragraph (d)(1)(i) of Rule 17a-5. Furthermore, the final rule requires that a copy of
the written approval by the broker-dealer’s DEA of a change in the broker-dealer’s fiscal year be sent to the
Commission’s principal office in Washington, DC, in addition to the regional office of the Commission for
the region in which the broker-dealer has its principal place of business. Id. This change is consistent with
paragraph (n) of Rule 17a-5, which requires that when a broker-dealer changes its fiscal year, it must file a
notice with the Commission’s principal office in Washington, DC as well as the regional office of the
Commission for the region in which the broker-dealer has its principal place of business. See 17 CFR
240.17a-5(n).
65

See paragraph (d)(1)(i) of Rule 17a-5. The financial report, compliance report, and exemption report are

release.

69

See paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B)(2) of Rule 17a-5. A broker-dealer claiming an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 is
required to indicate the basis for the exemption on the periodic reports it files with securities regulators.
See, e.g., Item 24 of Part IIa of the Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Report. See 17
CFR 249.617.

19

proposal – which provided that a broker-dealer “shall” file the exemption report if the brokerdealer “is exempt from the provisions of [Rule 15c3-3]” – is designed to provide greater clarity
as to whether a broker-dealer must file the exemption report (as opposed to the compliance
report), particularly when the broker-dealer had exceptions to meeting the exemption provisions
in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 during the fiscal year. 71 Specifically, if the broker-dealer
claimed an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 in its Financial and Operational Combined Uniform
Single Reports (“FOCUS Reports”) throughout the fiscal year, 72 it must file the exemption report
even it had exceptions to the exemption provisions. 73 Consequently, the applicability of the
exemption report under the final rule is based on an objective and easily ascertainable factor:
whether the broker-dealer claimed an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent
fiscal year. 74
As noted above, several commenters argued that broker-dealers that engage in limited
custodial activities and, therefore, are not exempt from Rule 15c3-3, should not be required to
file a compliance report. 75 Specifically, one of these commenters suggested that a “new”
category of “limited purpose” broker-dealer with certain business model characteristics should
be addressed in the rule and that this “new” category of broker-dealer should not be required to

70

As discussed below in more detail in section II.B.4. of this release, the provisions of paragraph (k) of Rule
15c3-3 prescribe “exemptions” from the requirements of Rule 15c3-3. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(k)(1),
(k)(2)(i), (k)(2)(ii), and (k)(3).

71

See CAI Letter; SIFMA Letter.

72

The FOCUS Reports are: Form X-17A-5 Schedule I; Form X-17A-5 Part II; Form X-17A-5 Part IIa; Form
X-17A-5 Part IIb; and Form X-17A-5 Part III.

73

As discussed in detail below in section II.B.4. of this release, a broker-dealer that has exceptions to meeting
the exemption provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 must identify them in the exemption report.

74

See discussion in section II.B.4. of this release. There may be circumstances in which a broker-dealer has
not held customer securities or funds during the fiscal year, but does not fit into one of the exemptive
provisions listed under Item 24 of Part IIa. Even though there is not a box to check on the FOCUS Report,
these broker-dealers should file an exemption report and related accountant’s report.

75

See, e.g., CAI Letter; CAI II Letter; McGladrey Letter.

20

file the compliance report. 76 The Commission has considered these comments but has
determined not to provide for a broader exception from the requirement to file a compliance
report for broker-dealers with limited custodial activities. The objectives of the compliance
report and related examination of the compliance report are intended, among other things, to
“increase the focus of independent public accountants on the custody practices of broker-dealers”
and to “help identify broker-dealers that have weak controls for safeguarding investor assets.” 77
Therefore, broker-dealers that hold customer assets – even if their custodial activities are limited
– generally should be subject to the requirement to file the compliance report and related
accountant’s report. 78
The level of effort required by carrying broker-dealers to prepare a compliance report
will depend on the nature and extent of their activities. For example, the controls of a carrying
broker-dealer that engages in limited custodial activities could be less complex than the controls
of a carrying broker-dealer that engages in more extensive custodial activities. 79 Therefore, this
requirement is intended to be scalable so that a carrying broker-dealer with limited custodial
activities generally should have to expend less effort to support its statements in the compliance
report, particularly with respect to the statements relating to Rules 15c3-3 and 17a-13.

76

See CAI II Letter.

77

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37599.

78

Broker-dealers with extremely limited custodial activities (e.g., holding customer checks made out to a
third party for limited periods of time) could seek exemptive relief under section 36 of the Exchange Act
(15 U.S.C. 77mm) from the requirement to file the compliance report and report of the independent public
accountant covering the compliance report.

79

As discussed below in section II.D. of this release, the PCAOB has proposed attestation standards for an
independent public accountant’s examination of the compliance report and the review of the exemption
report. The proposed examination standard provides procedural requirements for independent public
accountants that are “designed to be scalable based on the broker’s or dealer’s size and complexity.” See
Proposed Standards for Attestation Engagements Related to Broker and Dealer Compliance or Exemption
Reports Required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Related Amendments to PCAOB
Standards, PCAOB Release No. 2011-004, PCAOB Rulemaking Docket Matter No. 035 (July 12, 2011) at
8 (“PCAOB Proposing Release”).

21

The second key modification is that the final rule provides that the requirement to file the
exemption report applies if the broker-dealer did claim that it was exempt from Rule 15c3-3
“throughout the most recent fiscal year.” 80 Thus, a broker-dealer that did not claim an
exemption from Rule 15c3-3 at any time during the most recent fiscal year or claimed an
exemption for only part of the fiscal year must file the compliance report. 81
The third key modification is that the final rule specifies the individual who must execute
the compliance reports and exemption reports. 82 As noted above, one commenter stated that the
Commission should make clear who should sign the compliance reports and exemption reports
and what liability attaches in the event of a misstatement or omission. 83 The commenter
suggested a reasonableness standard, and stated that the Commission should make clear that the
reports do not create a new private right of action. 84 In response to this comment, the final rule
provides that the compliance report and the exemption report must be executed by the person
who makes the oath or affirmation under paragraph (e)(2) of Rule 17a-5. 85 As discussed below
in more detail in section II.C.2. of this release, paragraph (e)(2) of Rule 17a-5 requires an oath or
affirmation to be attached to the financial report and provides that the oath or affirmation must be

There will be cases where a broker-dealer changes its business model to convert from a carrying brokerdealer to a non-carrying broker-dealer during the fiscal year. In this case, the broker-dealer could seek
exemptive relief under section 36 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78mm) from the requirement to file the
compliance report and to instead file the exemption report. In analyzing such a request, the period of time
the broker-dealer operated as a carrying broker-dealer would be a relevant consideration.

The Financial Report – Paragraph (d)(2) of Rule 17a-5

Before today’s amendments, paragraph (d)(2) of Rule 17a-5 required that the annual
audited report of a broker-dealer contain certain financial statements in a format consistent with
Form X-17A-5 Part II or Form X-17A-5 Part IIa, as applicable, including a statement of financial
condition, an income statement, a statement of cash flows, a statement of changes in owners’
equity, and a statement of changes in liabilities subordinated to claims of general creditors. 87
Paragraph (d)(3) of Rule 17a-5 required that the annual audited report contain supporting
schedules, including a computation of net capital under Rule 15c3-1, a computation for
determining reserve requirements under Rule 15c3-3, and information relating to the possession
and control requirements of Rule 15c3-3. 88 Paragraph (d)(4) of Rule 17a-5 required a
reconciliation between the net capital and reserve computations in the audited report and those in
the most recent Form X-17A-5 Part II or Form X-17A-5 Part IIa, if there were material
differences between the annual audited report and the form. 89
The Commission proposed combining the provisions in paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(4)
of Rule 17a-5 in revised paragraph (d)(2) without substantive modification to those provisions. 90
86

See paragraph (e)(2) of Rule 17a-5.

87

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(2). As noted above, Form X-17A-5 Part II and Form X-17A-5 Part IIa are
among the FOCUS Reports that broker-dealers complete and file with the Commission or their DEA on a
periodic basis. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(a) and 17 CFR 249.617. These two forms require broker-dealers to
file monthly or quarterly financial information with the Commission or their DEA, including information
about the broker-dealer’s: (1) assets and liabilities; ownership equity; net capital computation under Rule
15c3-1; minimum net capital requirement under Rule 15c3-1; income (loss); computation of the customer
reserve requirement under Rule 15c3-3 in the case of Form X-17A-5 Part II; the possession and control
requirements under Rule 15c3-3 in the case of Form X-17A-5 Part II; and changes in ownership equity.

In addition, the Commission proposed that revised paragraph (d)(2) be titled “Financial report”
to reflect that the information required in this report would be financial in nature and to
differentiate it from the proposed compliance reports and exemption reports. The Commission
did not receive comments concerning the amendments to paragraph (d)(2) of Rule 17a-5 and is
adopting them substantially as proposed. 91

The Compliance Report – Paragraph (d)(3) of Rule 17a-5
i.

The Proposed Amendments

As proposed, the requirements for the contents of the compliance report were prescribed
in paragraph (d)(3) of Rule 17a-5. 92 Under the proposal, a carrying broker-dealer would need to
include in the compliance report a specific statement, certain assertions, and descriptions. 93 The
independent public accountant would examine the assertions in the compliance report in
preparing the report of the accountant. 94
Specifically, as proposed, the carrying broker-dealer would be required to include in the
compliance report a statement as to whether the firm has established and maintained a system of
internal control to provide the broker-dealer with reasonable assurance that any instances of
material non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules will be prevented or detected on a

91

See paragraph (d)(2) of Rule 17a-5. The Commission has made plain English changes to the language of
the paragraph (e.g., replacing the term “shall” with “must”). The Commission also, consistent with current
practice, has clarified that the financial statements must be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to
distinguish from other accounting frameworks. See paragraph (d)(2) of Rule 17a-5. In addition, the
Commission has replaced the words “notes to the consolidated statement of financial condition” with
“notes to the financial statements.” This change in terminology is designed to conform the language in
Rule 17a-5 to current accounting practice. Under GAAP, notes to a complete set of financial statements
must cover all the financial statements, and not just one of the statements, such as the consolidated
statement of financial condition.

timely basis. 95 In addition, the compliance report would need to include the following three
assertions: (1) whether the broker-dealer was in compliance in all material respects with the
financial responsibility rules as of its fiscal year end; (2) whether the information used to assert
compliance with the financial responsibility rules was derived from the books and records of the
broker-dealer; and (3) whether internal control over compliance with the financial responsibility
rules was effective during the most recent fiscal year such that there were no instances of
material weakness. 96 Finally, the carrying broker-dealer would need to include in the
compliance report a description of each identified instance of material non-compliance and each
identified material weakness in internal control over compliance with the financial responsibility
rules. 97 The independent public accountant would examine the assertions in preparing the report
of the accountant. 98 The independent public accountant would not examine the statement
regarding the establishment of the system of internal control.
Under the proposal, the broker-dealer would not be able to assert compliance with the
financial responsibility rules as of its most recent fiscal year end if it identified one or more
instances of material non-compliance. 99 Similarly, the broker-dealer would not be able to assert
that its internal control over compliance with the financial responsibility rules during the fiscal
year was effective if one or more material weaknesses existed with respect to internal control
over compliance. 100

An instance of material non-compliance was proposed to be defined as a failure by the
broker-dealer to comply with any of the requirements of the financial responsibility rules in all
material respects. 101 When determining whether an instance of non-compliance is material, the
Commission stated that the broker-dealer should consider all relevant factors including but not
limited to: (1) the nature of the compliance requirements, which may or may not be quantifiable
in monetary terms; (2) the nature and frequency of non-compliance identified; and (3) qualitative
considerations. 102 The Commission also stated that some deficiencies would necessarily be
instances of material non-compliance, including failing to maintain the required minimum
amount of net capital under Rule 15c3-1 or failing to maintain the minimum deposit requirement
in a special reserve bank account for the exclusive benefit of customers under Rule 15c3-3. 103
The term material weakness was proposed to be defined as a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with the financial responsibility rules, such
that there is a reasonable possibility that material non-compliance with the financial
responsibility rules will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 104 The proposed
definition of material weakness was modeled on the definition of material weakness in a
Commission rule – Rule 1-02(a)(4) of Regulation S-X 105 – and in auditing literature governing
financial reporting. 106 In the proposing release, the Commission stated that a deficiency in
internal control over compliance would exist when the design or operation of a control does not
allow the broker-dealer, in the normal course of performing its assigned functions, to prevent or

Commission also stated that, for purposes of the proposed definition of the term material
weakness, there is a reasonable possibility of an event occurring if it is probable or reasonably
possible. 108 The Commission further stated that an event is probable if the future event or events
are likely to occur and that an event is reasonably possible if the chance of the future event or
events occurring is more than remote, but less than likely. 109
ii.

Comments Received

The Commission received a number of comments on the proposed compliance report.
Generally, the comments focused on the intended scope of the compliance report and the
assertions to be included. Specifically, many commenters raised concerns about what would
constitute “material non-compliance.” 110 Several of these commenters urged the Commission to
provide guidance with additional specific examples or quantitative and qualitative factors to be
considered when determining whether non-compliance was material. 111 One commenter
proposed alternate definitions for material non-compliance and material weakness and provided

examples of non-compliance that should not be regarded as material. 112
Commenters also addressed the time period covered by the assertion relating to
effectiveness of internal control. In particular, some commenters stated that the proposed
assertion that internal control was effective should be as of a point in time, as opposed to “during
the fiscal year.” 113 One commenter stated that broker-dealers that must file the internal control
report required under Rule 206(4)-2 should be able to elect to make the assertion pertain to the
entire fiscal year in order to satisfy reporting requirements under the IA Custody Rule. 114 Others
stated that broker-dealers should have the opportunity to remediate any material weaknesses in
internal control that were identified during the period and, if corrective action was taken, not be
required to include them in the compliance report. 115
Regarding the proposed assertion that the broker-dealer was in compliance with the
financial responsibility rules, one commenter stated that broker-dealers may need to interpret
certain requirements and in other cases broker-dealers may be relying on informal interpretations
obtained through dialogue with the Commission or its DEA. 116 This commenter recommended
that in those circumstances the Commission require broker-dealers to formally document such
interpretations and obtain evidence of agreements reached with the Commission or the DEA.
Some commenters stated that the Commission should provide additional guidance about
the control objectives that would need to be met to achieve effective internal control over

See E&Y Letter. This commenter also stated that a point-in-time assessment would be consistent with the
requirement for issuers subject to internal control reporting under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Further, for carrying broker-dealers that are not subject to Rule 206(4)-2, this commenter stated that the
incremental benefits of having the assertion pertain to the entire year rather than the year end assessment
does not justify the cost. Id.

to clarify the interaction between material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting
and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance with the financial responsibility
rules. 118

One commenter stated that the compliance report was over-inclusive and burdensome,

and suggested that the final rule focus instead on “issues most vital to the financial condition of
the broker-dealer and its compliance and internal control over compliance.” 119
Some commenters had questions and comments about the proposed assertion that
information used to assert compliance with the financial responsibility rules was derived from
the books and records of the broker-dealer. Three commenters asked whether “books and
records” means records maintained under Rule 17a-3. 120
iii.

The Final Rule

The Commission is adopting the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-5 requiring a
carrying broker-dealer to prepare and file a compliance report, with modifications, some of
which are in response to comments. 121 Generally, as adopted, the broker-dealer’s compliance
report will include five specific statements, and two descriptions, if applicable.
Specifically, paragraph (d)(3) of Rule 17a-5 requires that the compliance report contain
statements as to whether: (1) the broker-dealer has established and maintained Internal Control
Over Compliance (which, as discussed below, is a defined term in the final rule); (2) the Internal
Control Over Compliance of the broker-dealer was effective during the most recent fiscal year;
(3) the Internal Control Over Compliance of the broker-dealer was effective as of the end of the

most recent fiscal year; (4) the broker-dealer was in compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph
(e) of Rule 15c3-3 as of the end of the most recent fiscal year; and (5) the information the
broker-dealer used to state whether it was in compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of
Rule 15c3-3 was derived from the books and records of the broker-dealer. Further, if applicable,
the compliance report must contain a description of: (1) each identified material weakness in the
Internal Control Over Compliance during the most recent fiscal year, including those that were
identified as of the end of the fiscal year; and (2) any instance of non-compliance with Rule
15c3-1 or paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 as of the end of the most recent fiscal year.
The final rule does not use the term assertion – the assertions contained in the proposal
are now referred to as statements. 122 The consistent use of the term statements is designed to
simplify the structure of the rule rather than to substantively change the nature of the matters
stated in the compliance report or which of the statements are to be examined by the independent
public accountant.
In the final rule, the first statement in the compliance report is whether the broker-dealer
has established and maintained Internal Control Over Compliance. 123 The rule defines Internal
Control Over Compliance to mean internal controls that have the objective of providing the
broker-dealer with reasonable assurance that non-compliance with the financial responsibility
rules will be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 124 In order to clarify the application of the
rule, the proposal has been modified so that part of the statement contained in the proposed
compliance report, as to the broker-dealer’s system of internal control, has been incorporated in

the definition of Internal Control Over Compliance in the final rule. 125 Under the final rule, a
broker-dealer cannot state that it has established and maintained Internal Control Over
Compliance if the internal controls do not provide the broker-dealer with reasonable assurance
that non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules will be prevented or detected on a
timely basis.
The final rule also provides that a broker-dealer is not permitted to conclude that its
Internal Control Over Compliance was effective if there were one or more material weaknesses
in its Internal Control Over Compliance. 126 A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in the broker-dealer’s Internal Control Over Compliance such that
there is a reasonable possibility127 that non-compliance with Rule 15c3-1 or paragraph (e) of
Rule 15c3-3 will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, or that non-compliance to a
material extent with Rule 15c3-3, except for paragraph (e), Rule 17a-13 or any Account
Statement Rule will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 128 A deficiency in Internal
Control Over Compliance exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow the
management or employees of the broker-dealer to prevent or detect on a timely basis non-

are one or more material weaknesses in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.”).

127

As noted above, the Commission has stated in other contexts that there is a reasonable possibility of an
event occurring if it is “probable” or “reasonably possible.” See Amendments to Rules Regarding
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, 72 FR 35310. See also 17 CFR
240.12b-2; 17 CFR 210.1-02. Commission guidance provides that an event is “probable” if the future
event or events are likely to occur, and that an event is “reasonably possible” if the chance of the future
event or events occurring is more than remote, but less than likely. See Commission Guidance Regarding
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 72 FR at 35332 n.47 and corresponding text.

registrant’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.”).

31

compliance with the financial responsibility rules in the normal course of performing their
assigned functions.
The final amendments reflect several other key changes from the proposal. For example,
one commenter stated that the compliance report was overinclusive and burdensome, and
therefore suggested that the final rule focus on “issues most vital to the financial condition of the
broker-dealer and its compliance and internal control over compliance.” 129 The final rule
requires a statement as to whether the broker-dealer was in compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and
paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 as of the end of the most recent fiscal year and, if applicable, a
description of any instances of non-compliance with these rules as of the fiscal year end. This is
a modification from the proposed assertion that the broker-dealer is in compliance with the
financial responsibility rules in all material respects and proposed description of any material
non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules. Thus, the final rule reflects two changes
from the proposal: (1) elimination of the concepts of “material non-compliance” and
“compliance in all material respects” for the purposes of reporting in the compliance report; and
(2) a narrowing of these statements and requirements from compliance with all of the financial
responsibility rules to compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3. In this
way, the final rule more narrowly focuses on the core requirements of the financial responsibility
rules, as suggested by the commenter.
The “material non-compliance” and “compliance in all material respects” concepts were
designed to limit the types of instances of non-compliance that would prevent a carrying brokerdealer from stating that it was in compliance with the financial responsibility rules. In order to
retain a limiting principle, the final rule focuses on provisions that trigger notification

129

See CAI Letter.

32

requirements when they are not complied with, namely, Rule 15c3-1 and the customer reserve
requirement in paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3. 130 Any instance of non-compliance with these
requirements as of the fiscal year end must be addressed in the compliance report. As stated in
the proposing release, failing to maintain the required minimum amount of net capital under Rule
15c3-1 or failing to maintain the minimum deposit requirement in a special reserve bank account
under paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 would have been instances of material non-compliance under
the proposed rule. 131 Accordingly, under the proposal, a broker-dealer would have been required
to describe all instances of non-compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3.
Under the proposal, a broker-dealer also would have been required to describe instances of
material non-compliance with Rule 17a-13 and the Account Statement Rules. The final rule is
narrower in that a broker-dealer is only required to describe instances of non-compliance with
Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3.
Consistent with these changes, the final rule requires a statement as to whether the
carrying broker-dealer has established and maintained Internal Control Over Compliance, which
is defined as internal controls that have the objective of providing the broker-dealer with
reasonable assurance that non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules will be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. 132 The definition of Internal Control Over Compliance
modifies the proposed statement that the carrying broker-dealer has established and maintained a
system of internal control to provide the firm with reasonable assurance that any instances of

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(6)(iv)(B), (a)(6)(v), (a)(7)(ii), (a)(7)(iii), (c)(2)(x)(B)(1), (c)(2)(x)(F)(3)
(notification requirements with respect to Rule 15c3-1); 17 CFR 240.17a-11(b)-(c) (notification
requirements with respect to Rule 15c3-1); 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(i) (notification requirement in the event of
a failure to make a required deposit to the reserve account).

accountant is not required to examine this statement. See paragraph (g)(2)(i) of Rule 17a-5.

33

material non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules will be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. 133 Thus, the definition eliminates the concept of material non-compliance.
Similarly, the proposed assertion as to whether the information used to assert compliance with
the financial responsibility rules was derived from the books and records of the carrying brokerdealer has been modified to a statement as to whether the information used to state whether the
carrying broker-dealer was in compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3
was derived from the broker-dealer’s books and records. 134
The definition of material weakness similarly has been modified from the proposal.
Under the final rule, a material weakness would include deficiencies in internal control relating
to “non-compliance” with Rule 15c3-1 or paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3, and “non-compliance to
a material extent” with Rule 15c3-3, except for paragraph (e), Rule 17a-13, and the Account
Statement Rules. 135 This modification of the definition of material weakness is based on the
practical difficulties in creating a system of control that will eliminate a reasonable possibility of
the occurrence of any instances of non-compliance with certain requirements of the financial
responsibility rules. For example, the inadvertent failure to send one account statement out of
thousands of such statements would not constitute non-compliance to a material extent with the
Account Statement Rules though it would be an instance of non-compliance.
Further, and consistent with current auditing standards, the definition of “deficiency in
internal control” in the final rule has been modified to include the phrase “the management or
employees of the broker or dealer” in place of the phrase “the broker or dealer.” 136

34

The final rule – substantially as proposed – requires the carrying broker-dealer to state
whether its Internal Control Over Compliance was effective during the most recent fiscal year. 137
Some commenters suggested that a broker-dealer that has remediated a material weakness be
permitted to provide an assertion about whether a material weakness still exists at the end of the
year, instead of having to state whether internal control was effective during the most recent
fiscal year. 138 In light of the importance of a broker-dealer being in continual compliance with
the financial responsibility rules, the Commission believes it is appropriate for the brokerdealer’s statement to address effectiveness of its Internal Control Over Compliance throughout
the fiscal year. Consequently, the final rule requires the statement to cover the entire fiscal year
as opposed to the date that is the end of the fiscal year as suggested by commenters.
However, in response to comments suggesting that the broker-dealer be permitted to
report the remediation or whether a material weakness still exists at the end of the year, 139 the
final rule also requires the carrying broker-dealer to state whether its Internal Control Over
Compliance was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year. 140 Thus, if there was a
material weakness in the Internal Control Over Compliance of the broker-dealer during the year
that has been addressed such that the broker-dealer no longer considers there to be a material
weakness at fiscal year end, the compliance report would reflect both the identification of the
material weakness and that its Internal Control Over Compliance was effective as of the end of

management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or
detect misstatements on a timely basis.”).

the most recent fiscal year, thereby indicating that the material weakness had been addressed as
of the fiscal year end.
Consistent with these changes, the final rule provides that the carrying broker-dealer
cannot conclude that its Internal Control Over Compliance was effective during the most recent
fiscal year if there were one or more material weaknesses in Internal Control Over Compliance
of the broker-dealer during the fiscal year. 141 The final rule adds a similar provision relating to
the effectiveness of a broker-dealer’s Internal Control Over Compliance at the end of the most
recent fiscal year 142 to respond to comments 143 and to align with the additional statement
discussed above as to whether the broker-dealer’s Internal Control Over Compliance was
effective as of the end of the fiscal year. 144
The final rule also retains the proposed requirement that the carrying broker-dealer
provide a description of each identified material weakness in the broker-dealer’s Internal Control
Over Compliance, but, in conformity with other modifications to the proposal, the final rule
requires that the material weaknesses include those identified during the most recent fiscal year
as well as those that were identified as of the end of the fiscal year. 145 This change should not
add a significant burden because broker-dealers should know whether any material weaknesses
identified before year end have been remediated.
As noted above, one commenter recommended that the Commission require broker-

dealers to document oral guidance obtained through dialogue with Commission or DEA staff. 146
While such a requirement was not proposed and is not being adopted in the final rule, it may be
appropriate and prudent for a broker-dealer to maintain documentation in its books and records
of the matters discussed with the Commission or DEA staff, the broker-dealer’s own views and
conclusion on those matters, and any guidance received by the broker-dealer.
Also as noted above, two commenters asked the Commission to provide additional
guidance about the control objectives that should be met to achieve effective internal control
over compliance with the financial responsibility rules. 147 As stated in the proposing release, the
control objectives identified in the Commission’s guidance on Rule 206(4)-2 are more general
than the specific operational requirements in the financial responsibility rules. 148 In particular,
broker-dealers are subject to operational requirements with respect to handling and accounting
for customer assets. 149 Given the specificity of the financial responsibility rules, the
Commission does not believe that additional guidance about the control objectives is necessary.
As noted above, several commenters sought assurances that the independent public
accountant’s examination of the compliance report would not cover the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. 150 The final rule does not require that the broker-dealer include
a statement regarding the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, nor does it
require that the independent public accountant attest to the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. The requirement in the final rule is for the broker-dealer to state whether its
Internal Control Over Compliance was effective during the most recent fiscal year and at the end

of the fiscal year and for the accountant to express an opinion based on an examination of those
statements.
A broker-dealer’s Internal Control Over Compliance is intended to focus, for example, on
a broker-dealer’s oversight of custody arrangements and protection of customer assets. In
contrast, internal control over financial reporting is focused on the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. As stated in the
proposing release, the Commission did not propose that effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting be included as one of the assertions made by the broker-dealer in the compliance
report. The Commission intends that the compliance report should focus on oversight of net capital,
custody arrangements, and protection of customer assets, and therefore, should be focused on
compliance with the financial responsibility rules.

Further, the examination of the compliance report would pertain solely to certain
statements in the compliance report and not to the broker-dealer’s process for arriving at the
statements. The report of the independent public accountant, based on the examination of the
compliance report, requires the accountant to perform its own independent examination of the
related internal controls. Consequently, it is not necessary for the independent public accountant
to provide an opinion with regard to the process that the broker-dealer used to arrive at its
conclusions.
As noted above, commenters sought clarification of the meaning of “books and records”
as used in the compliance report statement. The reference in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A)(5) of Rule
17a-5 to books and records refers to the books and records a broker-dealer is required to make
and maintain under Commission rules (e.g., Rule 17a-3 and Rule 17a-4). 151

The Exemption Report – Paragraph (d)(4) of Rule 17a-5
i.

Proposed Amendments

The Commission proposed that the exemption report must contain an assertion by the
broker-dealer that it is exempt from Rule 15c3-3 because it meets conditions set forth in
paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 and “should identify the specific conditions.” 152 As discussed
below in section II.D.3. of this release, under the proposal, the independent public accountant, as
part of the engagement, would have been required to prepare a report based on a review of the
exemption report in accordance with PCAOB standards. 153
ii.

Comments Received

The Commission received several comments regarding the exemption report. 154 Some
commenters stated that the Commission should clarify whether the assertion would cover the
entire fiscal year or be as of a fixed date. 155 One commenter stated that the assertion should be
as of a fixed date. 156 With respect to the independent public accountant’s review of the
exemption report, one commenter provided the example of a bank or clerical error that results in
a broker-dealer that operates under an exemption to Rule 15c3-3 finding itself in possession of
customer assets overnight once during the fiscal year. 157 This commenter stated that such a
situation should not “warrant the ‘material modification’ of a broker-dealer’s Exemption

Report.” 158 Similarly, another commenter noted that “to consider a single instance of a brokerdealer failing to promptly forward a customer’s securities as an instance that would necessitate a
material modification creates an unworkable standard.” 159
One commenter stated that the exemption report relates only to Rule 15c3-3 and asked
how the Commission intended to assess, for a firm that claims an exemption from Rule 15c3-3,
compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and the adequacy of the firm’s internal control over compliance
with that rule. 160 Another commenter asked whether the exemption report should be replaced
with a box to check on the FOCUS Report, as the amount of paperwork involved for small firms
“seems rather excessive.” 161
iii.

The Final Rule

The Commission is adopting, with modifications discussed below, the requirements
regarding the exemption report. 162 The modifications are designed to address commenters’
concerns that the proposed exemption report assertion would create an unworkable standard
given the possibility that a broker-dealer might have instances of exceptions to meeting the
exemption provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 and that the proposed requirements with
respect to the exemption report did not explicitly provide how exceptions should be treated.
In response to these concerns, the final rule provides that exemption reports must contain the
following statements made to the best knowledge and belief of the broker-dealer: (1) a statement
that identifies the provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 under which the broker-dealer
claimed an exemption from Rule 15c3-3; (2) a statement the broker-dealer met the identified

exemption provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year
without exception or that it met the identified exemption provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule
15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year except as described in the exemption report; and
(3) if applicable, a statement that identifies each exception during the most recent fiscal year in
meeting the identified provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 and that briefly describes the
nature of each exception and the approximate date(s) on which the exception existed. 163
In response to comments seeking clarity as to whether the assertion in the exemption
report should cover a fixed date or the fiscal year, 164 the final rule explicitly provides that the
statement and certain information in the exemption report must cover the most recent fiscal
year. 165 This corresponds to the provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of Rule 17a-5 governing
when a broker-dealer must file the exemption report instead of the compliance report. In
particular, a broker-dealer that claimed an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most
recent fiscal year must file the exemption report. 166
In addition, as proposed, the exemption report was required to contain an assertion that
the broker-dealer “is exempt from the provisions” of Rule 15c3-3 “because it meets conditions
set forth in” paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 and “should identify the specific conditions.” 167 Thus,
the exemption report would have required the broker-dealer to state definitively that “it is
exempt” from Rule 15c3-3 because it “meets the conditions set forth in” in paragraph (k). 168 As
noted above, commenters raised questions and concerns about how certain exceptions would be

handled under the proposed exemption report requirements. The final rule addresses these
comments in a number of ways.
First, it provides that the statements in the exemption report must be made to the “best
knowledge and belief of the broker or dealer.” 169 This modification is designed to address
situations where the broker-dealer is unaware of an instance or instances in which it had an
exception to meeting the exemption provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 during the most
recent fiscal year. As discussed below, the broker-dealer must state in the report that it met the
exemption provisions throughout the year without exceptions or with exceptions that must be
identified. 170
Second, the final rule provides that the broker-dealer first must identify in the exemption
report the “provisions” in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 under which it “claimed” an exemption
from Rule 15c3-3. 171 As discussed above in section II.B.1. of this release, the final rule has been
modified to provide that a broker-dealer must file the exemption report if it did “claim that it was
exempt” from Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year. 172 This change is designed to
remove any ambiguity as to when a broker-dealer must file the exemption report as opposed to
169

See paragraph (d)(4) of Rule 17a-5.

170

As discussed above in section II.B.3. of this release, a carrying broker-dealer must state in the compliance
report whether it was in compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 as of the end of the
most recent fiscal year. See paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A)(4) of Rule 17a-5. In response to comments and in light
of the nature of the statements required in the exemption report, the Commission added the best knowledge
and belief standard to the exemption report requirement.

171

See paragraph (d)(4)(i) of Rule 17a-5. As proposed, paragraph (d)(4) of Rule 17a-5 provided that the
exemption report “shall contain a statement by the broker or dealer that it is exempt from the provisions of
[Rule 15c3-3] because it meets the conditions set forth in [paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3] and should
identify the specific conditions.” See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR 37604 (emphasis added). The
Commission intended that the broker-dealer be required to identify the provisions of paragraph (k) of Rule
15c3-3 under which the broker-dealer was claiming the exemption. To make clear that this requirement
and the other requirements of the exemption report are mandatory, the final rule uses the word “must” in
relation to each element of the exemption report. See paragraph (d)(4) of Rule 17a-5.

172

See paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B)(2) of Rule 17a-5. A broker-dealer claiming an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 is
required to indicate the basis for the exemption on the periodic reports it files with securities regulators.
See, e.g., Item 24 of Part IIa of the FOCUS Reports. See 17 CFR 249.617.

42

the compliance report, particularly in situations where the broker-dealer had exceptions to
meeting the exemption provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3. Consistent with this change,
the final rule requires the broker-dealer to identify in the exemption report the provisions in
paragraph (k) under which it “claimed the exemption.” 173
Further, as proposed, the broker-dealer would have been required to identify the
exemption “conditions” in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3. 174 The use of the word “provisions” in
the final rule is designed to eliminate a potential ambiguity as to whether the exemption
provisions in paragraphs (k)(2) and (3) of Rule 15c3-3 applied to the exemption report. In
particular, paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 prescribes “exemptions” from the requirements of Rule
15c3-3. 175 Paragraph (k)(1) provides that the requirements of Rule 15c3-3 do not apply to a
broker-dealer that meets all of the “conditions” set forth in the paragraph. 176 Paragraph (k)(2)
identifies two sets of conditions (without using the word “conditions”) either of which exempts a
broker-dealer from the requirements of Rule 15c3-3. 177 Paragraph (k)(3) provides that the
Commission may exempt a broker-dealer from the provisions of Rule 15c3-3, either
unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, if the Commission finds that the brokerdealer has established safeguards for the protection of funds and securities of customers
comparable with those provided for by Rule 15c3-3 and that it is not necessary in the public
interest or for the protection of investors to subject the particular broker-dealer to the provisions

173

See paragraph (d)(4)(i) of Rule 17a-5.

174

See paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of Rule 17a-5. The proposed rule provided that the broker-dealer must assert that
it is exempt from the provisions of Rule 15c3-3 because it meets “conditions” set forth in paragraph (k) and
should identify the specific “conditions.” See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37580–37581.

43

of Rule 15c3-3. 178 The Commission intended that a broker-dealer file an exemption report if it is
exempt from Rule 15c3-3 under the provisions in either paragraph (k)(1), (k)(2)(i), (k)(2)(ii), or
(k)(3) of Rule 15c3-3. To make this clear, the final rule refers to the “provisions” of paragraph
(k) of Rule 15c3-3. 179 Consequently, a broker-dealer filing the exemption report must identify
the provisions in paragraph (k) that it relied on to claim an exemption from Rule 15c3-3. 180
The third modification designed to address commenters’ questions and concerns about
how to handle exceptions to meeting the exemption provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3
relates to the proposed assertion that the broker-dealer “is exempt from the provisions” of Rule
15c3-3 “because it meets conditions set forth in” paragraph (k). The final rule provides that the
exemption report must contain a statement that the broker-dealer met the identified exemption
provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year without
exception or that it met the identified exemption provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3
throughout the most recent fiscal year except as described in the exemption report. 181 This
modification from requiring the broker-dealer to state an absolute (i.e., that it is exempt from
Rule 15c3-3) allows the broker-dealer to account for instances in which it had exceptions to
meeting the exemption provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 directly in the exemption
178

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(k)(3).

179

This modification is consistent with Item 24 of Part IIa of the FOCUS Report, which is titled
“EXEMPTIVE PROVISION UNDER RULE 15c3-3” and requires a broker-dealer that claims to be
exempt from the requirements of Rule 15c3-3 to identify the provision in Rule 15c3-3 – paragraph (k)(1),
paragraph (k)(2)(i), paragraph (k)(2)(ii), or paragraph (k)(3) – under which it is claiming to be exempt. See
17 CFR 249.617.

180

This change also is intended to make clear that the broker-dealer can identify the provisions of paragraph
(k) of Rule 15c3-3 that the broker-dealer is relying on to claim the exemption by simply identifying in the
exemption report the subparagraph in paragraph (k) (i.e., (k)(1), (k)(2)(i), (k)(2)(ii), or (k)(3)) that contains
the particular conditions the broker-dealer is relying on to claim the exemption rather than repeating the
conditions themselves in the exemption report. For example, it would be sufficient for a broker-dealer
relying on the exemption provisions in paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of Rule 15c3-3 to identify the provisions in the
exemption report under which in claimed an exemption by referring to “paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of Rule 15c33” or “17 CFR 240.15c3-3(k)(2)(ii).”

181

See paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of Rule 17a-5.

report (rather than having to file the compliance report). Specifically, if to the broker-dealer’s
best knowledge and belief, it had no exceptions during the most recent fiscal year to the
identified exemption provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3, it must state in the exemption
report that it met the identified exemption provisions in paragraph (k) without exception.
Alternatively, a broker-dealer that had exceptions must state that it met the identified exemption
provisions except as described in the exemption report.
If the broker-dealer states that it had exceptions (e.g., exceptions identified during the
year, such as through routine monitoring of its compliance processes as part of the execution of
its internal controls, internal or external audits, or regulatory examinations), the final rule
requires the firm to identify, to its best knowledge and belief, each exception and briefly describe
the nature of the exception and the approximate date(s) on which the exception existed. 182 The
Commission expects that non-carrying broker-dealers generally track exceptions as part of
monitoring compliance with the exemption provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3. 183
Further, a non-carrying broker-dealer’s adherence to the exemption provisions in paragraph (k)
of Rule 15c3-3 generally is a focus of Commission examiners when they conduct financial
responsibility examinations on this class of firm. For example, examiners will review whether a
non-carrying broker-dealer promptly forwards checks in accordance with provisions in paragraph
(k) of Rule 15c3-3. The Commission also notes that the 2011 AICPA Broker Dealer Audit
Guide states: “In auditing the financial statements of a broker-dealer claiming exemption from
SEC Rule 15c3-3, the auditor should determine whether and to what extent the broker-dealer
complied with the specific exemption during the audit period as well as the quality of the broker182

See paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of Rule 15c3-3.

See, e.g., Net Capital Rule, Exchange Act Release No. 31511 (Nov. 24, 1992), 57 FR 56973 (Dec. 2,

do not receive customer securities or checks made payable to themselves).

45

dealer’s controls and procedures to ensure ongoing compliance.” 184 In addition, under the
PCAOB’s proposed standards, the independent public accountant should inquire of individuals at
the broker-dealer who have relevant knowledge of controls relevant to the broker-dealer’s
compliance with the exemption provisions and who are responsible for monitoring compliance
with the exemption provisions whether they are aware of any deficiencies in controls over
compliance or instances of non-compliance with the exemption conditions. 185 Moreover, in the
independent public accountant’s report, “[i]f the broker’s or dealer’s statement is not fairly
stated, in all material respects, because of an instance or certain instances of non-compliance
with the exemption conditions, the auditor must modify the review report to describe those
instances of non-compliance and state that the broker or dealer is not in compliance with the
specified exemption conditions.” 186
Under the final rule, a non-carrying broker-dealer must identify in the exemption report
and describe each exception during the most recent fiscal year in meeting the identified
exemption provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3. The description must include the
approximate date(s) on which the exception existed. Without such reporting, the Commission
and the broker-dealer’s DEA would have no information to assess the nature, extent, and
significance of the exceptions.
As noted above, one commenter asked whether the exemption report should be replaced
with a box to check on the FOCUS Report, as the amount of paperwork involved for small firms
“seems rather excessive.” 187 The Commission does not believe this is an appropriate alternative.

46

First, as indicated above, a broker-dealer claiming an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 already is
required to indicate the basis for the exemption on its FOCUS Report. 188 Second, the exemption
report requires the broker-dealer to make certain statements that the independent public
accountant must review. Thus, the exemption report will provide a standardized statement
across all broker-dealers claiming an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 for the independent public
accountant to review. Third, the exemption report will provide the Commission and the brokerdealer’s DEA with more information than currently is reported by non-carrying broker-dealers in
the FOCUS Report. Specifically, it requires the broker-dealer to, among other things, state either
that it met the identified exemption provisions in paragraph (k) throughout the most recent fiscal
year without exception or that it met the identified exemption provisions throughout the most
recent fiscal year except as described in the report. This will provide the Commission and the
broker-dealer’s DEA with information as to whether a broker-dealer is meeting the exemption
provisions of paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 (not simply that the broker-dealer is claiming the
exemption as is reported in the FOCUS Report). Fourth, requiring that the exemption report be
filed with the Commission should increase broker-dealers’ focus on the statements being made,
facilitating consistent compliance with the exemption provisions in Rule 15c3-3, and therefore,
providing better protection of customer assets. Fifth, the requirement to prepare and file the
exemption report should not result in excessive paperwork, as stated by one commenter. 189
As noted above, one commenter pointed out that the exemption report relates solely to
Rule 15c3-3 and asked how the adequacy of a non-carrying broker-dealer’s internal controls over

compliance with Rule 15c3-1 would be assessed. 190 Under the final amendments, a brokerdealer’s financial report will continue to include a supporting schedule containing a net capital
computation under Rule 15c3-1, which will be covered by the independent public accountant’s
examination of the financial report. Moreover, the PCAOB has proposed standards for auditing
supplemental information accompanying audited financial statements. 191
5.

Time for Filing Annual Reports – Paragraph (d)(5) of Rule 17a-5

Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (d)(5) of Rule 17a-5 required that the annual
audit report be filed not more than 60 days after the date of the financial statements. 192 The
Commission proposed amending paragraph (d)(5) to replace the term annual audit report with
annual reports. 193 This change was designed to reflect the fact that, under the proposal, brokerdealers must file a financial report, a compliance report or exemption report, and reports
prepared by an independent public accountant covering these reports. While the Commission did
not receive comments on this proposed change, one commenter stated that the existing
requirement in Rule 17a-5 that the annual audit report be filed 60 days after the date of the
financial statements should be lengthened to 90 days. 194 In support of this recommendation, the
commenter cited CFTC Rule 1.10, which allows an FCM up to 90 days to file annual audit

190

See McGladery Letter. The material inadequacy report – which applied to carrying and non-carrying
broker-dealers – covered Rule 15c3-1. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(g).

reports. 195
The Commission is adopting, with modifications, the proposed amendment to paragraph
(d)(5) of Rule 17a-5. 196 The modifications add the term “calendar” to make explicit that the time
for filing the annual reports is 60 calendar days after the fiscal year end (as opposed to business
days). The modifications replace the words “date of the financial statements” with the words
“end of the fiscal year of the broker or dealer” to provide consistency in the language of Rule
17a-5. 197 The final rule does not change the time limit for filing the annual reports to 90 days
after the end of the fiscal year. The 60-day time frame is a long standing requirement and it
provides the Commission and other regulators with relatively current information to, among
other things, monitor the financial condition of broker-dealers. Further, broker-dealers may seek
an extension of time to file the annual reports from their DEAs. 198

Filing of Annual Reports with SIPC – Paragraph (d)(6) of Rule 17a-5

Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (d)(6) of Rule 17a-5 provided that the “annual
audit report” must be filed at the regional office of the Commission for the region in which the
broker-dealer has its principal place of business, the Commission’s principal office in
Washington, DC, and the principal office of the DEA of the broker-dealer. 199 Copies were
required to be provided to all self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”) of which the broker-dealer
is a member.

195

See 17 CFR 1.10(b)(ii). Rule 1.10 also provides that if the FCM is registered with the Commission as a
broker-dealer, the FCM must file the report not later than the time permitted for filing an annual audit
report under Rule 17a-5.

i.

The Proposed Amendments

The Commission proposed two amendments to this provision. First, the Commission
proposed that an SRO that is not a broker-dealer’s DEA could by rule waive the requirement that
broker-dealers file annual reports with it because many SROs do not believe that it is necessary
to receive copies of broker-dealer annual reports if they are not the broker-dealer’s DEA. 200 The
Commission received no comments on this proposal and is adopting it as proposed. 201
Second, the Commission proposed amending this provision to require a broker-dealer to
file its annual reports with SIPC. 202 SIPC, a nonprofit, nongovernmental membership
corporation established by SIPA, is responsible for providing financial protection to customers of
failed broker-dealers. SIPA also provided for the establishment of a fund (“SIPC Fund”) to pay
for SIPC’s operations and activities. SIPC uses the fund to make advances to satisfy customer
claims for securities and cash that cannot be readily returned to the customer. SIPA limits the
amount of the advance to $500,000 per customer, of which $250,000 can be used to satisfy the
cash portion of a customer’s claim. The SIPC Fund also covers the administrative expenses of
liquidation proceedings for failed broker-dealers when the general estate of the failed firm is
insufficient; these include costs incurred by a trustee, trustee’s counsel, and other advisors. SIPC
finances the SIPC Fund through annual assessments, set by SIPC, on all member firms, plus
interest generated from its permitted investments. Generally, all broker-dealers registered with
the Commission under section 15(b) of the Exchange Act 203 are required to be members of

SIPC. 204 Before today’s amendments, broker-dealers were required to file only limited
information with SIPC. Specifically: (1) information elicited on Form SIPC-6, the “General
Assessment Payment Form;” (2) information elicited on Form SIPC-7, the “Annual General
Assessment Reconciliation;” and (3) for periods in which the SIPC assessment is not a minimum
assessment, a comparison by the independent public accountant of the amounts reflected in the
annual report the broker-dealer filed with the Commission with amounts reported on Form SIPC7.
The Commission explained in the proposing release that the proposed requirement for
broker-dealers to file their annual reports with SIPC could allow SIPC to better monitor industry
trends and enhance its knowledge of particular firms. 205 The Commission also explained that the
requirement that broker-dealers file copies of their annual reports with SIPC was designed to
address cases where the SIPC Fund has been used to pay the administrative expenses of the
liquidation of a failed broker-dealer and SIPC sought to recover the money advanced when the
estate had insufficient assets. 206 In some of these cases, SIPC has sought to recover money
damages from the broker-dealer’s auditing firm based on an alleged failure to comply with
auditing standards. At least one court, however, has held under New York law that SIPC could
not maintain such a claim because it was not a recipient of the annual audit filing and could not
have relied on it. 207

204

See 15 U.S.C. 78ccc(a)(2). However, broker-dealers engaged exclusively in the distribution of mutual fund
shares, the sale of variable annuities, the insurance business, the furnishing of investment advice to
investment companies or insurance company separate accounts, or whose principal business is conducted
outside the U.S. are not required to be members of SIPC. See 15 U.S.C. 78ccc(a)(2)(A)(i)–(iii).

Comments Received

The Commission received seven comments on the proposal that broker-dealers be
required to file their annual reports with SIPC. 208 Six commenters generally opposed the
requirement. 209 One commenter indicated that it is appropriate for broker-dealers to file their
annual reports with SIPC if SIPC uses the reports to reconcile the annual reports with the Form
SIPC-7 or otherwise places reliance on them. 210 Three of the commenters stated that the
Commission failed to adequately articulate the policy considerations driving the proposed
change and also failed to discuss the possible costs of increased litigation risk to accountants. 211
Some of the commenters argued that this change would contradict limitations on SIPC’s
authority to bring claims against accountants under SIPA and the securities laws imposed by the
U.S. Supreme Court. 212
After the proposal, a task force established by SIPC to undertake a comprehensive review
of SIPA and SIPC’s operations and policies and to propose reforms to modernize SIPA and SIPC
recommended to the SIPC Board that SIPC members be required to file audit reports with SIPC
concurrently with their filing with the SEC, a position consistent with the proposal. In a report
presented to the SIPC Board of Directors in February 2012, 213 the task force stated that including
SIPC as a designated recipient of the audit report “would further the goal of investor protection

by providing another layer of review of the report by an organization directly affected by its
contents.” 214 In addition, the task force stated that “including SIPC as a recipient would help to
address the persistent concern that any signs of ‘financial weakness, as by non-compliance with
net capital requirements or otherwise, [be] watched very carefully and followed up’ in order to
augment the financial responsibility requirements SIPA was intended to enhance, and to provide
greater investor protection.” 215
iii.

The Final Rule

The Commission is adopting the amendment requiring broker-dealers to file their annual
reports with SIPC substantially as proposed. 216 SIPC plays an important role in the securities
markets and the SIPC Fund can help reduce losses to investors from the failure of their brokerdealer. SIPC has a legitimate interest in receiving the annual reports of its broker-dealer
members to assist it with its maintenance of the SIPC Fund and to monitor trends in the brokerdealer industry. SIPC presently obtains revenue information from broker-dealers, through Form
SIPC-7, to determine how best to structure broker-dealer assessments to maintain the SIPC Fund
at an appropriate level. However, the information collected in the form is limited and may not
assist SIPC in assessing whether the SIPC Fund is appropriately sized to the risks of a large
broker-dealer failure. The annual audited reports contain much more detailed information about
the assets, liabilities, income, net capital, and Rule 15c3-3 customer reserve requirements of
broker-dealers, and also include, for carrying broker-dealers, a compliance report containing

Id. (quoting the SEC, Study of Unsafe and Unsound Practices of Broker-Dealers, H.R. Doc. No. 92-231, at
152 (1971)).

216

See paragraph (d)(6) of Rule 17a-5. The Commission clarified that the broker-dealer must file the annual
reports with SIPC only “if the broker or dealer is a member of SIPC.” The Commission believes that SIPC
has an interest in receiving annual reports only from broker-dealers that are SIPC members, because only
these broker-dealers may pose a risk to the SIPC Fund.

53

information about the broker-dealer’s compliance with, and controls over compliance with, the
broker-dealer financial responsibility rules. The annual reports also generally include the
independent public accountant’s reports covering the financial report and compliance report or
exemption report, as applicable, prepared by the broker-dealer. This information will assist SIPC
in monitoring the financial strength of broker-dealers and, therefore, in assessing the adequacy of
the SIPC Fund. 217
In addition, by receiving the annual reports, SIPC may be able to overcome a legal hurdle
to pursuing claims against a broker-dealer’s accountant where the accountant’s failure to adhere
to professional standards in auditing a broker-dealer caused a loss to the SIPC Fund. Although
this amendment is intended to remove one potential legal hurdle to SIPC actions against
accountants, the other elements of any relevant cause of action would be unaffected. The
Commission does not intend by this amendment to take a position on the circumstances under
which SIPC may have a viable cause of action against an independent public accountant. 218
Several commenters stated that the Commission did not address the potential costs and
benefits of requiring broker-dealers to file copies of their annual reports with SIPC, including

217

See McGladrey Letter.

218

Several commenters argue that requiring the annual report to be filed with SIPC would contradict
limitations the Supreme Court has imposed on SIPC’s authority to bring claims against accountants. The
decisions cited by these commenters, however, do not speak to the precise issue the amended rule is
intended, among other things, to address – the New York Court of Appeals’ decision held that SIPC could
not state a cause of action for either fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation against an auditing firm
because it was not a recipient of the annual audit report. See SIPC v. BDO Seidman, LLP, 746 N.E.2d
1042 (N.Y. 2001); aff’d, 245 F.3d 174 (2d Cir. 2001). Rather, in Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection
Corporation, the Supreme Court found that the statutory provision relied on by SIPC, 15 U.S.C. 78eee(d),
did not, either alone or with the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, confer standing. 503
U.S. 258, 275 (1992). And, in Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, the Supreme Court determined that
customers of securities brokerage firms do not have an implied cause of action for damages under section
17(a) of the Exchange Act against accountants who audit the financial reports filed by such firms; thus,
SIPC could not assert this implied cause of action on behalf of these customers. 442 U.S. 560, 567 (1979).
As already noted, the Commission does not intend by this amendment to take a position on the
circumstances under which SIPC may have a viable cause of action against an independent public
accountant.

54

potential accounting litigation costs. 219 As discussed below in section VII. of this release, the
Commission recognizes that there may be increased litigation costs (or reserves for potential
litigation costs) as a result of the amendment and that to the extent that there are such costs, some
of them may be passed on to broker-dealers in the form of increased audit fees. But, while this
amendment may facilitate the ability of SIPC to bring actions against accountants for malpractice
or material misrepresentation under state law by removing one potential legal hurdle to such
actions, it will not necessarily result in a significant increase in such actions. Generally, SIPC
initiates a small number of proceedings each year, and most of these proceedings have not
involved a claim against a broker-dealer’s accountant. Specifically, SIPC was established in
1971. In the period from 1971-2011, SIPC initiated 324 proceedings under SIPA to liquidate a
failed broker-dealer. 220 This results in an average of approximately 8 SIPA proceedings per
year, though 109 of the 324 proceedings were initiated in the period from 1971-1974, which was
the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis of 1968-1970. 221 According to SIPC staff, SIPC
has brought 9 lawsuits against accountants since 1971, which is one lawsuit for every 36 SIPA
proceedings. 222 Accordingly, the likelihood of a lawsuit against an accountant is small and the
Commission anticipates that the overall costs related to litigation as a result of the filing
requirement should not be significant. The Commission believes that any such costs are justified

The Nature and Form of the Annual Reports
1.

Exemptions from Audit Requirement – Paragraph (e)(1) of Rule
17a-5

Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (e)(1)(i) of Rule 17a-5 provided, among other
things, that the audit of the broker-dealer’s financial statements needed to be performed by an
accountant that is independent as defined in paragraph (f) of Rule 17a-5. 223 Paragraph (e)(1)(i)
also contained provisions under which certain broker-dealers were not required to engage an
accountant to audit their financial statements. 224
The Commission proposed amending paragraph (e)(1)(i) of Rule 17a-5 to remove the
words “An audit shall be conducted by a public accountant who shall be in fact independent as
defined in paragraph (f)(3) of this section herein, and he shall give an opinion covering the
statements filed pursuant to paragraph (d).” This amendment would consolidate the
requirements with respect to the qualifications of the accountant in paragraph (f) of Rule 17a-5,
and paragraph (e)(1)(i) of Rule 17a-5 would address only exemptions from the requirement to
engage an independent public accountant to audit the annual reports prepared by the brokerdealer. 225 The Commission received no comments on this proposal, and is adopting it with
modifications. 226 The modifications: (1) modernize certain terms in the rule in a manner
consistent with the Commission’s “plain English” initiative; and (2) cite to the reports required

to reports required under “Rule 17a-5(d).” 227
2.

Affirmation – Paragraph (e)(2) of Rule 17a-5

Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (e)(2) of Rule 17a-5 provided that an oath or
affirmation must be attached to the annual audit report that, to the best knowledge and belief of
the person making the oath or affirmation, the financial statements and schedules are true and
correct and, among other things, that the oath or affirmation must be made by the proprietor if a
sole proprietorship, by a general partner, if a partnership, or by a duly authorized officer, if a
corporation. 228 The Commission proposed amending the first sentence of paragraph (e)(2) of
Rule 17a-5 by adding the word “financial” before the word “report.” 229 The Commission is
adopting this amendment as proposed.
One commenter stated that currently paragraph (e)(2) of Rule 17a-5 does not
specifically cover limited liability companies, and its reference to partnerships assumes that a
general partner is a natural person. 230 The commenter argued that it should be updated to
conform to generally accepted business laws.

227

Id. Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of Rule 17a-5 provided that “[a] broker or dealer who
files a report which is not covered by an accountant’s opinion shall include in the oath or affirmation
required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section a statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon as a basis
for exemption from the requirement that financial statements and schedules filed pursuant to paragraph (d)
of this section be covered by the opinion of an accountant.” See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(e)(1)(ii). The
Commission did not propose amendments to this subparagraph. However, to be consistent with today’s
amendments, the Commission is making technical amendments to paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of Rule 17a-5 so that
it now provides that “[a] broker or dealer that files annual reports under paragraph (d) of this section that
are not covered by reports prepared by an independent public accountant must include in the oath or
affirmation required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section a statement of the facts and circumstances relied
upon as a basis for exemption from the requirement that the annual reports filed under paragraph (d) of this
section be covered by reports prepared by an independent public accountant.” See paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of
Rule 17a-5.

See IMS Letter.

57

In response to this comment, the Commission is adopting amendments to paragraph
(e)(2) of Rule 17a-5 that modify the proposed amendments. 231 In particular, the Commission is
adding that if the broker-dealer is a limited liability company or limited liability partnership, the
oath or affirmation must be made by the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, manager,
managing member, or any of those members vested with management authority for the limited
liability company or limited liability partnership. 232
3.

Confidentiality of Annual Reports – Paragraph (e)(3) of Rule 17a-5

Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (e)(3) of Rule 17a-5 provided that the financial
statements filed under paragraph (d) are public, except that if the Statement of Financial
Condition is bound separately from the balance of the annual audited financial statements filed
under paragraph (d)(1), the balance of the annual audited financial statements will be deemed
confidential. 233 As noted in the proposing release, the wording of this provision has led to
confusion. 234 In particular, Commission staff has received inquiries on how broker-dealers can
indicate that they are requesting confidential treatment for the portion of the financial statements
intended to be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law and, on occasion, financial
statements broker-dealers intended to be confidential are inadvertently made public. 235 This
could happen, for example, if a broker-dealer fails to bind the balance sheet separately from the
other portion of the financial statements when it files the financial statements with the

These reports may be accessed via the Search for Company Filings link under Filings & Forms on the
Commission’s home page.

58

Commission.236
Consequently, the Commission proposed amending paragraph (e)(3) of Rule 17a-5 to
provide that the annual reports filed pursuant to paragraph (d) are public, except that if the
Statement of Financial Condition is bound separately from the annual report filed pursuant to
“paragraph (d)(2) of Rule 17a-5,” and each page of the balance of the annual report is stamped
“confidential,” the balance of the annual report shall be deemed confidential. 237 The proposed
rule text inadvertently referenced only the financial report. It was intended that the financial
report, compliance report, exemption report, and related accountant reports would be treated the
same under paragraph (e)(3) of Rule 17a-5. Consequently, the Commission is modifying the
proposed amendment. Specifically, paragraph (e)(3) of Rule 17a-5, as adopted, provides that if
the Statement of Financial Condition is bound separately from the balance of the “annual reports
filed under paragraph (d) of this section,” and each page of the balance of the annual reports is
stamped “confidential,” then the balance of the annual reports will be deemed confidential to the
extent permitted by law. 238 Consequently, if the compliance reports and exemption reports and
the related reports of the independent public accountant are submitted in accordance with the
procedures specified in paragraph (e)(3) of Rule 17a-5, these reports will be deemed confidential
to the extent permitted by law. 239

236

The Commission staff has previously posted guidance on the Commission website on how to request
confidential treatment for the financial statements other than the statement of financial condition. See
http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/bdnotices.htm.

See 5 U.S.C. 552 et seq. (Freedom of Information Act – “FOIA”). FOIA provides at least two potentially
pertinent exemptions under which the Commission has authority to withhold certain information. FOIA
Exemption 4 provides an exemption for “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained
from a person and privileged or confidential.” 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). FOIA Exemption 8 provides an
exemption for matters that are “contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports
prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of
financial institutions.” 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8). However, as discussed below, under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of

59

Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (e)(3) of Rule 17a-5 also provided that the
broker-dealer’s reports, including the confidential portions, will be available, for example, for
official use by any official or employee of the U.S. and an official or employee of any national
securities exchange and registered national securities association of which the broker-dealer is a
member and “by any other person to whom the Commission authorizes disclosure of such
information as being in the public interest.” 240 The Commission proposed amending this list of
permitted recipients to include the PCAOB. 241 The Commission did not receive comments on
this proposal and is adopting it essentially as proposed with a minor wording edit for clarity. 242

Supplemental Report on SIPC Membership – Paragraph (e)(4) of
Rule 17a-5

As discussed above in section II.B.6. of this release, SIPC maintains the SIPC Fund to be
used in liquidations of broker-dealers under SIPA. The SIPC Fund is established and maintained
through assessments on broker-dealers that are required to be members of SIPC. 243 In order to
assist in the collection of assessments from member broker-dealers, SIPC has promulgated two
forms that broker-dealers must file with SIPC, as applicable: Form SIPC-3 and Form SIPC-7.
Form SIPC-3 is required when a broker-dealer is claiming an exemption from SIPC membership
(i.e., when the broker-dealer does not have to pay an assessment). In this case, the broker-dealer
Rule 17a-5, if there are material weaknesses, the accountant’s report on the compliance report must be
made available for customers’ inspection and, consequently, it would not be deemed confidential. In
addition, paragraph (c)(2)(i) of Rule 17a-5 (which is not being amended today) requires a broker-dealer to
furnish to its customers annually a balance sheet with appropriate notes prepared in accordance with GAAP
and which must be audited if the broker-dealer is required to file audited financial statements with the
Commission. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(c)(2)(i).

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37592–37593.

243

Broker-dealers engaged exclusively in the distribution of mutual fund shares, the sale of variable annuities,
the insurance business, the furnishing of investment advice to investment companies or insurance company
separate accounts, or whose principal business is conducted outside the U.S. are not required to be
members of SIPC. See 15 U.S.C. 78ccc(a)(2)(A)(i)–(iii).

60

must file Form SIPC-3 each year certifying that the broker-dealer remained qualified for the
exemption during the prior year. Form SIPC-7 elicits information from a broker-dealer that is a
SIPC member about the broker-dealer’s sources of revenue attributable to its securities business.
Every broker-dealer that is a member of SIPC must file this form annually.
Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (e)(4) of Rule 17a-5 provided that a brokerdealer must file with its annual report a supplemental report on the status of the membership of
the broker-dealer in SIPC, which was required to be “covered by an opinion of the independent
public accountant” if the annual report of the broker-dealer was required to be audited. 244
Among other things, the supplemental report needed to cover the SIPC annual general
assessment reconciliation or exclusion from membership forms (i.e., Form SIPC-7 or Form
SIPC-3). 245 Paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of Rule 17a-5 used the terms “review” and “opinion” in
describing the accountant’s report that must cover the supplement report. 246 In addition, it
required that the review by the accountant include certain minimum procedures. 247
Under this provision, the supplemental report did not need to be filed if the SIPC Fund
assessments were the minimum assessment provided for under SIPA. 248 Between 1996 and
2009, the annual assessment for SIPC members remained at the $150 minimum assessment level
provided for under SIPA. 249 In 2009, SIPC raised the assessment above the minimum, which
triggered the requirement in paragraph (e)(4) of Rule 17a–5 to file a supplemental report with the

61

Commission, the broker-dealer’s DEA, and SIPC. 250
The Commission stated in the proposing release that, because Forms SIPC-3 and SIPC-7
are used solely by SIPC for purposes of levying its assessments, the supplemental report required
pursuant to paragraph (e)(4) of Rule 17a-5 relating to these forms would be more appropriately
filed exclusively with SIPC and that SIPC (rather than the Commission) should prescribe by rule
the form of the supplemental report. 251 The Commission stated that it would continue to have a
role in establishing the requirements for a supplemental report because the Commission must
approve SIPC rules. 252
For these reasons, the Commission proposed to amend paragraph (e)(4) of Rule 17a-5 to
require that broker-dealers file with SIPC a report on the SIPC annual general assessment
reconciliation or exclusion from membership forms that contains such information and is in such
format as determined by SIPC by rule and approved by the Commission. 253 However, because
there would be an interim period before a rule determined by SIPC became effective, the
Commission proposed amendments to paragraph (e)(4) under which broker-dealers would
continue to file a supplemental report with the Commission, the broker-dealer’s DEA, and SIPC
until SIPC adopts a rule pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(i) of Rule 17a-5 and the rule is approved by
the Commission.254 Consequently, a broker-dealer would be required to file the SIPC
supplemental reports with SIPC using the existing formats for the reports until the earlier of the
Commission approving a rule adopted by SIPC or two years. If after two years, a rule

promulgated by SIPC has not been approved by the Commission, broker-dealers would no longer
be required to file these reports.
Further, to facilitate this change, the Commission proposed to update the rule text to
conform it to existing professional standards and industry practices. 255 Specifically, the
Commission proposed amending paragraph (e)(4) of Rule 17a-5 to eliminate the ambiguity that
stems from the differing auditing terms used in that rule by removing all references to “review”
and “opinion.” 256 In their place, the Commission proposed that the supplemental report include
an independent public accountant’s report based on the performance of the procedures listed in
paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of Rule 17a-5, which the Commission did not propose to change. 257
The Commission received two comments relating to the proposed amendments to
paragraph (e)(4) of Rule 17a-5, both of which supported the proposed change. 258 One
commenter indicated that the proposed amendment would decrease the burden on broker-dealers
associated with filing the supplemental report with the Commission and the broker-dealer’s

D.

Engagement of the Accountant

As part of today’s amendments to the broker-dealer annual reporting requirements in
Rule 17a-5, the Commission is amending certain requirements relating to a broker-dealer’s
engagement of an independent public accountant. Specifically, the Commission is requiring that
a broker-dealer engage an independent public accountant to prepare reports based on an
examination of the broker-dealer’s financial report and either an examination of certain
statements in the broker-dealer’s compliance report or a review of certain statements in the
broker-dealer’s exemption report. The examinations and reviews must be made in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB, consistent with the explicit authority granted to the PCAOB
by the Dodd-Frank Act to establish (subject to Commission approval) auditing and attestation
standards with respect to broker-dealer audits. 264 Among other things, the amendments replace
provisions that required the filing of a “material inadequacy” report and are intended to update
terminology in the rule to make the rule’s requirements clear and to provide for a more consistent
approach to engaging broker-dealer independent public accountants.
This section addresses statutory requirements for broker-dealer annual reports and the

the Commission is available at http://www.sec.gov/foia/howfo2.htm#privacy.

See, e.g., Exchange Act section 24, 15 U.S.C. 78x (governing the public availability of information
obtained by the Commission) and 5 U.S.C. 552 et seq. (Freedom of Information Act – “FOIA”). FOIA
provides at least two pertinent exemptions under which the Commission has authority to withhold certain
information. FOIA Exemption 4 provides an exemption for “trade secrets and commercial or financial
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.” 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). FOIA Exemption
8 provides an exemption for matters that are “contained in or related to examination, operating, or
condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or
supervision of financial institutions.” 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8).

requirements in Rule 17a-5 prior to today’s amendments, summarizes the Commission’s
proposed amendments and comments received, and discusses the final rule amendments.
1.

Statutory Requirements and Commission Authority

Section 17(e)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act requires a broker-dealer to file annually with the
Commission a “certified” balance sheet and income statement as well as “such other financial
statements (which shall, as the Commission specifies, be certified) and information concerning
its financial condition as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in
the public interest or for the protection of investors.” 265 Section 17(e)(2) of the Exchange Act
provides the Commission with authority, by rule, to prescribe the form and content of the
financial statements and the accounting principles and standards used in their preparation as it
deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. 266 In
addition, section 17(a) of the Exchange Act more generally requires registered broker-dealers to
make and disseminate such reports as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors. 267 The Commission adopted
Rule 17a-5, in part, under these provisions. 268
Prior to the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), 269
section 17(e)(1)(A) required that the annual financial statements a broker-dealer must file with
the Commission be certified by “an independent public accountant.” The Sarbanes-Oxley Act

established the PCAOB 270 and amended section 17(e)(1)(A) by replacing the words “certified by
an independent public accountant” with the words “certified by a registered public accounting
firm.” 271 Title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act prescribed specific PCAOB registration, standardssetting, inspection, investigation, disciplinary, foreign application, oversight, and funding
programs in connection with audits of issuers. 272 However, as originally enacted, the SarbanesOxley Act did not expressly prescribe similar programs in connection with audits of brokerdealers that are not issuers.
The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, amended the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to provide
the PCAOB with explicit authority to, among other things, establish (subject to Commission
approval) auditing and related attestation, quality control, ethics, and independence standards for
registered public accounting firms with respect to their preparation of audit reports to be included
in broker-dealer filings with the Commission, and the authority to conduct and require an
inspection program of registered public accounting firms that audit broker-dealers. 273 The DoddFrank Act addressed inspection authority by adding section 104(a)(2)(A) to the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, which provides that the PCAOB “may, by rule, conduct and require a program of
inspection…of registered public accounting firms that provide one or more audit reports for a
broker or dealer” and that the PCAOB, in establishing a program for inspection, “may allow for

271

See Pub. L. No. 107-204 § 205(c)(2). The term Registered Public Accounting Firm is defined in section
2(a)(12) as “a public accounting firm registered with the [PCAOB] in accordance with this Act.” See Pub.
L. No. 107-204 § 2(a)(12).

272

Section 2(a)(7) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act defines the term issuer as “an issuer as defined in section 3 of
the [Exchange Act], the securities of which are registered under section 12 of [the Exchange Act], or that
files or has filed a registration statement that has not yet become effective under the Securities Act of
1933…, and that it has not withdrawn” (U.S.C. citations omitted). See Pub. L. No. 107-204 § 2(a)(7).

273

differentiation among classes of brokers or dealers, as appropriate.” 274
The Dodd-Frank Act also added section 104(a)(2)(D) to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which
provides that a public accounting firm is not required to register with the PCAOB if the public
accounting firm is exempt from an inspection program established by the PCAOB. 275 The
Dodd-Frank Act made a conforming amendment to section 17(e)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act to
replace the words “certified by a registered public accounting firm” with the words “certified by
an independent public accounting firm, or by a registered public accounting firm if the firm is
required to be registered under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.” 276
Before today’s amendments, paragraph (g)(1) of Rule 17a-5 required that audits of
broker-dealer reports filed with the Commission under Rule 17a-5 be made in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards (“GAAS”), which are established by the Auditing
Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”). In light
of the authority granted to the PCAOB by the Dodd-Frank Act to establish standards governing
audit reports to be included in broker-dealer filings with the Commission, the Commission issued
transitional interpretive guidance to clarify that references in Commission rules, staff guidance,
and in the federal securities laws to GAAS or to specific standards under GAAS, as they relate to
non-issuer brokers or dealers, should continue to be understood to mean auditing standards
generally accepted in the U.S., in addition to any applicable rules of the Commission. 277 The

See Pub. L. No. 111-203 § 982(e)(2). As discussed below, today’s amendments to the qualifications of the
independent public accountant provisions require, consistent with amended section 17(e)(1)(A), that the
accountant be qualified, independent, and registered with the PCAOB “if required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002.” See paragraph (f)(1) of Rule 17a-5.

guidance also stated that the Commission intended to revisit the interpretation in connection with
a rulemaking project to update the audit and related attestation requirements under the federal
securities laws for broker-dealers. 278 As discussed below, the Commission is now adopting
amendments to Rule 17a-5 to require that audits and attestations of broker-dealer reports filed
under Rule 17a-5 be made in accordance with standards of the PCAOB – the rule as amended
does not contain references to GAAS.
Since the Commission proposed these amendments, the PCAOB has taken a number of
actions to implement the explicit authority over broker-dealer audits provided to it by the
Dodd-Frank Act. For example, on August 18, 2011, the Commission approved two PCAOB rule
changes: a temporary PCAOB rule that established an interim program of inspection of audits of
broker-dealers, 279 and a PCAOB rule change providing that funds to cover the PCAOB’s annual
budget be allocated among issuers, brokers, and dealers. 280 In addition, as discussed below,
subsequent to the Commission’s proposal to amend Rule 17a-5, the PCAOB proposed attestation
standards to establish requirements for examining broker-dealer compliance reports and
reviewing broker-dealer exemption reports “to align its attestation standards more closely with
the auditor’s responsibilities under [the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-5].” 281 The PCAOB
concurrently proposed an auditing standard for supplemental information accompanying audited

apply to supporting schedules broker-dealers must file under Rule 17a-5, including schedules
regarding the computation of net capital and the customer reserve requirement and information
related to the broker-dealer’s possession or control of customer assets. 283 The PCAOB also
proposed amendments “to tailor certain of its rules to the audits and [independent public
accountants] of broker-dealers.” 284
2.

Engagement of Accountant Requirements Prior to Today’s
Amendments

Rule 17a-5 requires that a broker-dealer prepare and file certain financial statements and
supporting schedules in addition to the balance sheet and income statement required under
section 17(e)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act. 285 Before today’s amendments, the financial
statements and supporting schedules were generally required to be audited in accordance with
GAAS by an independent public accountant registered with the PCAOB. 286
In addition to filing a report of the independent public accountant covering the financial
statements and supporting schedules, paragraph (j) of Rule 17a-5 required the broker-dealer to
file with the annual audit a supplemental report prepared by the accountant (“material
inadequacy report”) that either: (1) indicated that the accountant did not find any material

285

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d).

286

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(g). An engagement to perform an audit (or examination) of financial statements is
designed to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. See, e.g., PCAOB Interim Auditing Standard, AU Section 110 at ¶ .02. The term audit is
defined in section 110(1) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, to mean “an
examination of the financial statements, reports, documents, procedures, controls, or notices of an issuer,
broker, or dealer by an independent public accountant in accordance with the rules of the [PCAOB] or the
Commission, for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the financial statements or providing an audit
report.”

69

inadequacies; or (2) described any material inadequacies in internal control the accountant found
during the course of the audit of the financial statements and supporting schedules and any
corrective action taken or proposed by the broker-dealer. 287
For purposes of preparing the material inadequacy report, paragraph (g)(1) of Rule 17a-5
required that the audit include a “review” of the broker-dealer’s accounting system, internal
accounting control, and procedures for safeguarding securities. 288 Further, the accountant was
required to review the practices and procedures of the broker-dealer in: (1) making the periodic
computations of aggregate indebtedness and net capital under paragraph (a)(11) of Exchange Act
Rule 17a-3 and the reserve required by paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3; 289 (2) making the quarterly
securities examinations, counts, verifications, and comparisons and the recordation of differences
required by Rule 17a-13; 290 (3) complying with the requirement for prompt payment for
securities under Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

287

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(j). Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (g)(3) of Rule 17a-5 describes a
material inadequacy in a broker-dealer’s accounting system, internal accounting controls, procedures for
safeguarding securities, and practices and procedures to include any condition which has contributed
substantially to or, if appropriate corrective action is not taken, could reasonably be expected to: (1) inhibit
a broker-dealer from promptly completing securities transactions or promptly discharging its
responsibilities to customers, other broker-dealers or creditors; (2) result in material financial loss; (3)
result in material misstatements of the broker-dealer’s financial statements; or (4) result in violations of the
Commission’s recordkeeping or financial responsibility rules to an extent that could reasonably be expected
to result in the conditions described in (1) through (3) above. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(g)(3). In addition to
the material inadequacy report, a broker-dealer was required to file during certain periods a supplemental
report covered by an opinion of the independent public accountant on the status of the broker-dealer’s
membership in SIPC. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(e)(4). The Commission is amending this requirement as
discussed above in section II.C.4. of this release. Further, a broker-dealer that computes net capital under
the alternative model-based standard in Appendix E to Rule 15c3-1 (17 CFR 240.15c3-1e) is required to
file a supplemental report of an independent public accountant indicating the results of the accountant’s
review of the internal risk management control system established and documented by the broker-dealer in
accordance with Rule 15c3-4 (17 CFR 240.15c3-4). See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(k). The Commission is not
amending this requirement today.

(“Regulation T”); 291 and (4) obtaining and maintaining physical possession or control of all fully
paid and excess margin securities of customers as required by Rule 15c3-3. 292 The scope of the
independent public accountant’s procedures was required to be sufficient to provide “reasonable
assurance” that any material inadequacies existing at the date of the examination in the brokerdealer’s accounting system, internal accounting control, and procedures for safeguarding
securities as well as in the practices and procedures described in items (1) through (4) above
would be disclosed. 293
The AICPA Broker-Dealer Audit Guide provided that the material inadequacy report
should address what the independent public accountant concluded in its “study” of the adequacy
of the broker-dealer’s practices and procedures in complying with the financial responsibility
rules in relation to the definition of material inadequacy as stated in paragraph (g)(3) of Rule
17a-5. 294 The issuance of a study is relatively unique to broker-dealer audits, however, and
while auditing standards at one time referred to the performance of a study, current auditing
standards no longer contain such references.

294

The material inadequacy report is addressed in the AICPA’s Audit & Accounting Guide: Brokers and
Dealers in Securities (Sept. 1, 2011 ed.) (“AICPA Broker-Dealer Audit Guide”), which provides that the
report should: (1) address what auditors concluded in their study of the adequacy of the broker-dealer’s
practices and procedures in complying with the Commission’s financial responsibility rules in relation to
the definition of a material inadequacy in Rule 17a-5; and (2) disclose material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting (including procedures for safeguarding securities) that are revealed through
auditing procedures designed and conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the financial
statements. See AICPA Broker-Dealer Audit Guide at ¶ 3.77. The AICPA Broker-Dealer Audit Guide
further provides that if conditions believed to be material weaknesses are found to exist or have existed
during the year, the report should disclose the nature of the weaknesses and the corrective action taken or
proposed to be taken by the broker-dealer. See AICPA Broker-Dealer Audit Guide at ¶ 3.80. The AICPA
Broker-Dealer Audit Guide also provides sample reports “on internal control required by SEC Rule 17a5(g)(1).” See AICPA Broker-Dealer Audit Guide apps. C, D, and F.

forth in paragraphs (g) and (i) of Rule 17a-5. Paragraph (g)(2) of Rule 17a-5 provided that, if the
broker-dealer was exempt from Rule 15c3-3, the independent public accountant must ascertain
that the conditions of the exemption were being complied with as of the examination date and
that no facts came to the independent public accountant’s attention to indicate that the exemption
had not been complied with during the period since the last examination. 295
Paragraph (i) of Rule 17a-5, before today’s amendments, was titled, “Accountant’s
reports – general provisions.” 296 Paragraph (i)(1) of Rule 17a-5 provided that the accountant’s
report must be dated, signed manually, indicate the city and state where issued, and identify the
financial statements and schedules covered by the report. 297 Paragraph (i)(2) of Rule 17a-5
provided that the accountant’s report must state whether the audit was made in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards; state whether the accountant reviewed the procedures
followed for safeguarding securities; and designate any auditing procedures deemed necessary
by the accountant under the circumstances of the particular case which have been omitted, and
the reason for their omission. 298 Further, the rule provided that “[n]othing in this section shall be
construed to imply authority for the omission of any procedure which independent accountants
would ordinarily employ in the course of an audit made for the purpose of expressing the
opinions required under [Rule 17a-5].” 299
Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (i)(3) of Rule 17a-5 provided that the
accountant’s report must state clearly the opinion of the accountant: (i) with respect to the
financial statements and schedules covered by the report and the accounting principles and

any changes in such principles that have a material effect on the financial statements. 300
Paragraph (i)(4) provided that any matters to which the accountant took exception must be
clearly identified, the exception specifically and clearly stated, and, to the extent practicable, the
effect of each such exception on the related financial statements given. 301 Paragraph (i)(5) of
Rule 17a-5 provided that the terms audit (or examination), accountant’s report, and certified have
the meanings given in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210.1-02). 302

Amended Engagement of Accountant Requirements
i.

Proposed Amendments

The Commission proposed to substantially amend paragraph (g) and remove paragraph
(j) of Rule 17a-5, in part, to update the engagement of the accountant requirements to address
outdated or inconsistent terminology in the rule. 303 The proposed amendments to paragraph (g)
and removal of paragraph (j) of Rule 17a-5 would have eliminated the requirement for the
accountant to prepare and the broker-dealer to file a material inadequacy report. 304 In its place,
the independent public accountant would have been required to prepare, and the broker-dealer
would have been required to file, in addition to a report covering the financial report, a report
covering either the broker-dealer’s compliance report or exemption report, as applicable. 305
Specifically, the Commission proposed to amend paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-5 to be titled

“Engagement of independent public accountant” and to require a broker-dealer required to file
annual reports under paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5 to engage an independent public accountant,
unless the broker-dealer is subject to the exclusions in paragraphs (d)(1) and (e)(1)(i) of Rule
17a-5. The independent public accountant, as part of the engagement, would have been required
to undertake to: (1) prepare a report based on an examination of the broker-dealer’s financial
report in accordance with standards of the PCAOB; and (2) prepare a report based on an
“examination” of the assertions of the broker-dealer in the compliance report in accordance with
standards of the PCAOB 306 or to prepare a report based on a “review” of the broker-dealer’s
exemption report in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. 307 This provision would have
retained the requirement that the financial statements and supporting schedules be audited by the
independent public accountant, so that the accountant would have continued to be required to
obtain “reasonable assurance” about whether they were free of material misstatement, but would
have changed the audit standards from GAAS to standards of the PCAOB. 308

306

An attest engagement designed to provide a high level of assurance is referred to as an “examination.” See,
e.g., PCAOB Interim Attestation Standard, AT Section 101 at ¶ .54. For this type of engagement, the
accountant’s conclusion will be expressed in the form of an opinion. For example, the accountant’s
conclusion based on an examination of an assertion could state that in the accountant’s opinion, [the
assertion] is fairly stated in all material respects. See, e.g., PCAOB Interim Attestation Standard, AT
Section 101 at ¶ .84. The proposed rule provided that the examination and related report would apply to the
broker-dealer’s “assertions” in the compliance report (and therefore would not apply to other items in the
proposed compliance report; namely, a statement as to whether the broker-dealer has established a system
of internal control and a description of instances of material non-compliance, and material weaknesses over
compliance with, the financial responsibility rules).

307

An attest engagement designed to provide a moderate level of assurance is referred to as a “review.” See,
e.g., PCAOB Interim Attestation Standard, AT Section 101 at ¶¶ .55, .89. For this type of engagement, the
accountant’s conclusion will be expressed, not in the form of an opinion, but in the form of “negative
assurance.” See, e.g., PCAOB Interim Attestation Standard, AT Section 101 at ¶ .68. For example, the
accountant’s conclusion based on a review of an assertion could state that no information came to the
accountant’s attention that indicates that the assertion is not fairly stated in all material respects. See, e.g.,
PCAOB Interim Attestation Standard, AT Section 101 at ¶ .88.

308

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37606. As stated above, an engagement to perform an audit of
financial statements is designed to provide “reasonable assurance” about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. See, e.g., PCAOB Interim Attestation Standard, AT Section 101 at ¶ .54.

74

The Commission proposed making conforming amendments to paragraph (i) of Rule 17a5, substituting the words “examinations” and “reviews” for the word “audits,” substituting the
words “standards of the PCAOB” for “generally accepted auditing standards,” substituting
“annual reports” for “financial statements,” and changing the title to “Reports prepared by the
independent public accountant.” The Commission also proposed deleting paragraph (i)(5) of
Rule 17a-5, which provided that the terms “audit,” “examination,” “accountant’s report,” and
“certified” have the meanings given in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X. As proposed, paragraph
(i)(1) of Rule 17a-5 would have provided that the independent public accountant’s reports must:
be dated; be signed manually; indicate the city and state where issued; and identify without
detailed enumeration the items covered by the reports. Paragraph (i)(2) of Rule 17a-5 would
have provided that the accountant’s report must state whether the examination or review was
made in accordance with standards of the PCAOB and must designate any examination, and, if
applicable, review procedures deemed necessary by the independent public accountant under the
circumstances of the particular case that have been omitted, and the reason for their omission.
Further, the rule would have provided that “[n]othing in this section shall be construed to imply
authority for the omission of any procedure that independent public accountants would ordinarily
employ in the course of an examination or review made for the purpose of expressing the
opinions or statement required under [Rule 17a-5].” Paragraph (i)(3) of Rule 17a-5 would have
provided that the independent public accountant’s reports must state clearly the opinion of the
independent public accountant: (i) with respect to the financial report and the accounting
principles and practices reflected therein and the compliance report; and (ii) with respect to the
financial report, as to the consistency of the application of the accounting principles, or as to any
changes in such principles that have a material effect on the financial statements. Paragraph

75

(i)(4) of Rule 17a-5 would have provided that any matters to which the independent public
accountant takes exception must be clearly identified, the exception thereto specifically and
clearly stated, and, to the extent practicable, the effect of each such exception on any related
items contained in the annual reports.
As stated above, after the Commission proposed the amendments to Rule 17a-5, the
PCAOB issued proposed standards that “would establish requirements for examining the
assertions in a broker’s or dealer’s compliance report and reviewing a broker’s or dealer’s
assertion in the exemption report.” 309 The PCAOB stated that the proposed standards were
“tailored to the requirements” in Rule 17a-5 as proposed to be amended by the Commission. 310
ii.

Comments

The Commission received several comments regarding the proposed revisions to the
independent accountant engagement requirements in Rule 17a-5. 311 One commenter stated that
GAAS should be used for audits of non-carrying broker-dealers; or, in the alternative, that the
Commission should delay the effective date for the requirement that the audit be conducted in
accordance with PCAOB standards for smaller broker-dealers until one year after the approval of
the amendments. 312 A second commenter stated that PCAOB standards should apply only for
broker-dealers “permanently subject to PCAOB inspection” and that the Commission should not
require that audits of broker-dealers be performed in accordance with PCAOB standards for nonissuer broker-dealers until the PCAOB determines which non-issuer broker-dealers will be

subject to its permanent inspection program. 313
One commenter noted that the proposing release states that broker-dealers will be
required to file a report by the accountant that “addresses” the assertions in the compliance
report, 314 and stated that the Commission should provide more guidance on what an accountant
must address, as “nowhere in the Release or in the proposed rules is there guidance as to what
‘addresses’ means or entails.” 315 This commenter further stated that the Commission
“presumably” will rely on PCAOB rules, and suggested that final rules regarding the
accountant’s obligations with respect to its examination of the compliance report should be
deferred until after a comment period of at least 60 days after the PCAOB rules are finalized or
the Commission amends its proposal to include specifics as to what “address” means and what
type of review is required by the accountant. 316 The commenter also stated that the requirement
should not be effective unless the AICPA Broker-Dealer Audit Guide is revised and updated. 317
One commenter asked what was expected of the auditor with respect to the books and records
assertion and stated that a separate opinion on this assertion may entail more detailed procedures
as to the source of the information. 318
Another commenter stated that a review engagement should not be employed for the
exemption report because inquiry and observation would not provide sufficient evidence
regarding a broker-dealer’s assertion that it is exempt from the requirements of Rule 15c3-3 and
stated that, under the PCAOB’s interim attestation standards, an auditor should not accept an

engagement to perform a “review” level of service related to an entity’s compliance with
specified requirements or an assertion with regard to that compliance. 319 As an alternative, this
commenter suggested an “agreed-upon procedures” approach addressing the results of
procedures specified by the Commission or the performance of an examination engagement if
suitable criteria were developed. 320 Another commenter stated that the benefit of receiving an
audit report covering the exemption report would not justify the cost. 321 Similarly, a commenter
stated that the exemption report should be replaced with a box to check on the FOCUS Report as
the auditor attestation provided no added benefit. 322
Several commenters urged the Commission to clarify the interaction between material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and material weaknesses in internal
control over compliance with the financial responsibility rules. 323 One commenter stated that
due to the reliance placed on the financial books and records to calculate net capital, it will not
be feasible to attest to the effectiveness of internal control over the financial responsibility rules
without also attesting to internal control over financial reporting. 324 The commenter stated that,
accordingly, it is necessary to include internal control over financial reporting within the scope
of the rule. The commenter stated its understanding that accountants expect to include internal
control over financial reporting in their attestation scope over the financial responsibility rules,
and that the process will include documenting all existing processes and engaging internal audit
to validate the effectiveness of the procedures implemented through procedural walkthroughs

and control testing to validate management’s assertions. 325 This commenter also stated its belief
that independent public accountants will need “to include an attestation of the additional in scope
processes within the scope of their audit work in order to comply with PCAOB requirements.” 326
As noted above in section II.B.4.ii. of this release, with respect to the independent public
accountant’s review of the exemption reports, one commenter stated that, for example, a bank or
clerical error that results in a broker-dealer that operates under an exemption to Rule 15c3-3
finding itself in possession of customer assets overnight once during the fiscal year should not
“warrant the ‘material modification’ of a broker-dealer’s Exemption Report.” 327 Another
commenter noted that “to consider a single instance of a broker-dealer failing to promptly
forward a customer’s securities as an instance that would necessitate a material modification
creates an unworkable standard.” 328
iii.

The Final Rule

The Commission is adopting amendments to the engagement of the accountant
requirements in Rule 17a-5 substantially as proposed, except for revisions, as discussed in detail
below, to clarify the rule’s requirements and to make technical changes. Paragraph (g) of Rule
17a-5 as adopted provides that the independent public accountant engaged by the broker-dealer
to provide reports on the financial report and either the compliance report or exemption report
must, as part of the engagement undertake to: (1) prepare a report based on an examination of the
broker-dealer’s financial report in accordance with standards of the PCAOB; and (2) prepare a
report based on an examination of certain enumerated statements of the broker-dealer in the

325

79

compliance report 329 in accordance with standards of the PCAOB or prepare a report based on a
review of the statements in the broker-dealer’s exemption report in accordance with standards of
the PCAOB. Additionally, as proposed, the amendments delete paragraph (j) of Rule 17a-5,
which, as explained above, required that the broker-dealer file with the annual audit report a
material inadequacy report, as well as provisions in paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-5 requiring that
the audit be conducted in accordance with GAAS and addressing the accountant’s review for
material inadequacies.
Various commenters suggested that GAAS instead of PCAOB standards should apply for
engagements of accountants with respect to certain broker-dealer reports, such as reports of noncarrying broker-dealers. 330 The Commission believes that requiring GAAS for audits of brokerdealers that are exempt from Rule 15c3-3 would not be consistent with the provisions of the
Dodd-Frank Act that provide the PCAOB with explicit authority to establish standards with
regard to audits of broker-dealer reports filed with the Commission. 331 These provisions enable
the PCAOB to exercise its standard-setting authority over audits of broker-dealers registered
with the Commission. The change from GAAS to PCAOB auditing standards will facilitate the
Commission’s regulatory oversight authority because the Commission has direct oversight
authority over the PCAOB, including the ability to approve or disapprove the PCAOB’s rules
329

As discussed above in section II.B.3. of this release, the final rule does not use the term assertion – the
assertions contained in the proposal are now referred to as statements. These changes are not intended to
be substantive. Paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-5 specifies that the accountant prepare a report based on an
examination of certain statements enumerated in the rule. Similar to the proposal, the statements subject to
the examination do not include a statement as to whether the broker-dealer has established a system of
internal control or a description of instances of non-compliance with certain financial responsibility rules.

See Pub. L. No. 111-203 § 982. For example, section 982(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 110 to
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which contains definitions of terms such as audit, audit report, and professional
standards. These definitions apply to audits, audit reports, and professional standards with respect to audits
of broker-dealers as well as audits of issuers. In addition, section 982(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended
section 101 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to substitute the words “issuers, brokers, and dealers” for the word
“issuers.”

and standards. The Commission also has greater confidence in the quality of audits conducted
by an independent public accountant registered with, and subject to regular inspection by, the
PCAOB. 332 Further, as the PCAOB develops and implements an inspection program of brokerdealer audits as contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act, that program will include inspection of,
among other things, “registered public accounting firms’ current compliance with laws, rules,
and standards in performing audits of brokers and dealers.” 333 The requirement that all
broker-dealer independent public accountants comply with the standards established by the
PCAOB should facilitate the development and implementation of its permanent inspection
program, as contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act.
As noted above, the PCAOB has proposed an auditing standard for supplemental
information accompanying audited financial statements, including the supporting schedules
broker-dealers must file as part of the financial report. 334 The PCAOB stated that a primary
factor that led it to reexamine its requirements regarding supplemental information was the
Commission’s proposal to amend the reporting requirements of Rule 17a-5. 335 In addition, as
noted above, the PCAOB has proposed specific attestation standards for examining compliance
reports and reviewing exemption reports. The PCAOB’s proposing release noted that the
proposed standards “are tailored to the requirements in SEC Proposed Rule 17a-5.” 336 The
proposed standards, if adopted, would establish a single and broker-dealer-specific approach to
examining compliance reports and reviewing exemption reports. This should provide greater

clarity as to procedures an independent public accountant should use in examining a compliance
report and reviewing an exemption report.
With respect to comments suggesting that PCAOB standards should apply only to
auditors of broker-dealers “permanently subject to PCAOB inspection,” 337 the PCAOB has not
exempted the audits by independent public accountants of any class of broker-dealer from the
PCAOB’s permanent inspection program. 338 In fact, the PCAOB has established an interim
inspection program for all broker-dealer audits by independent public accountants that will
“allow the Board to begin inspections of relevant audits and auditors and provide a source of
information to help guide decisions about the scope and elements of a permanent program.” 339
The PCAOB stated that it did not intend “to postpone all use of its new inspection authority until
after those judgments were made.” 340
At this time, there is no reason to expect that any type of broker-dealer audit will be
exempt from the PCAOB’s permanent inspection program, and any PCAOB determination to
exempt broker-dealer audits from the PCAOB’s permanent inspection program must be
approved by the Commission. Therefore, notwithstanding any such exemption, paragraph (g) of
Rule 17a-5 is amended to require that broker-dealer independent public accountants prepare
reports covering the financial report and compliance report or exemption report in accordance
with standards of the PCAOB.
On August 20, 2012, the PCAOB published its first report on the progress of the interim

inspection program. 341 The report contains observations from inspections of portions of 23
broker-dealer audits conducted by ten independent public accounting firms that were all
conducted in accordance with GAAS. 342 The inspections did not exclude any broker-dealer
audits from being eligible for selection. 343 PCAOB staff identified deficiencies in all of the
audits inspected. 344 For example, as to all of the 14 audits of broker-dealers that claimed an
exemption from Rule 15c3-3, the staff stated that the accountant “did not perform sufficient
procedures to ascertain that the broker or dealer complied with the conditions of the
exemption,” 345 and in 21 of the 23 audits, that the accountant “failed to perform sufficient audit
procedures to obtain reasonable assurance that any material inadequacies found to exist since the
date of the last examination…would have been disclosed in the accountant’s supplemental
report.” 346 The deficiencies noted in the PCAOB’s report on the progress of the interim
inspection program provide further support for the amendments that the Commission is adopting
today to establish the foundation for the PCAOB’s development of standards that are tailored to
Rule 17a-5, and to strengthen and facilitate consistent compliance with broker-dealer audit and
reporting requirements.
Several commenters suggested that the Commission delay the applicability of these
requirements because, among other things, PCAOB standards regarding broker-dealer audits,
including standards that apply to compliance reports and exemption reports, will not be final

when these rule amendments are adopted. 347 In response, as discussed below in section V. of
this release, the Commission is delaying the effective dates of most of the rule amendments. In
accordance with the effective dates, broker-dealers must file compliance reports or exemption
reports, as applicable, and broker-dealers must file reports of independent public accountants
covering compliance reports or exemption reports in accordance with Rule 17a-5 as amended,
for fiscal years ending on or after June 1, 2014. In the interim, broker-dealers must continue to
file material inadequacy reports in accordance with the provisions of Rule 17a-5 as they existed
before today’s amendments. Broker-dealer independent public accountants must prepare reports
based on an examination of broker-dealer financial reports in accordance with PCAOB standards
for fiscal years ending on or after June 1, 2014. In the interim, audits of broker-dealer financial
statements filed with the Commission under Rule 17a-5 should continue to be understood to
mean auditing standards generally accepted in the U.S., plus any applicable rules of the
Commission.348 The June 1, 2014 effective date should provide sufficient time for the PCAOB
to finalize, subject to Commission approval, the standards for broker-dealer audits and for
broker-dealers and their independent public accountants to prepare to comply with the new
requirements and standards.
As noted above, one commenter stated the Commission should provide more guidance on
what an independent public accountant must address, and that the requirement for PCAOB
standards should not be effective unless the AICPA Broker-Dealer Audit Guide is revised and
updated. 349 Another commenter sought clarification on what was expected of the auditor with

respect to the books and records assertion. 350 In response to these comments, the Commission
notes that the PCAOB’s proposed standards with respect to the examination of the compliance
report by the independent public accountant address, among other things: (1) the objective of the
examination; (2) the relationship between the examination engagement and the audit of the
financial report; (3) considerations for broker-dealers with multiple divisions or branches; (4)
identifying risks of material non-compliance; (5) testing controls over compliance; (6)
performing compliance tests; (7) testing information used to assert compliance; (8) evaluating
the results of the examination procedures; (9) subsequent events; (10) obtaining a representation
letter; (11) communication requirements; (12) reporting on the examination engagement; (13) the
examination report date; and (14) examination report modifications. 351 The PCAOB’s proposed
standards with respect to the review of the exemption report by the independent public
accountant address, among other things: (1) the objective of the review; (2) the relationship
between the review engagement and the audit of the financial report; (3) the review procedures;
(4) evaluating the results of the examination procedures; (5) obtaining a representation letter; (6)
communication requirements; (7) reporting on the review engagement; (8) the review report
date; and (9) review report modifications. 352 The Commission expects that the final standards of
the PCAOB, which are subject to Commission approval, will provide sufficient guidance to
independent public accountants performing examinations of compliance reports and reviews of
exemption reports.
In response to the comment that the requirements with respect to the compliance reports
and exemption reports should not be effective unless the AICPA Broker-Dealer Audit Guide is

revised and updated, as stated above, once adopted, only the standards of the PCAOB apply to
broker-dealer annual reports. The PCAOB has proposed standards with respect to the
examination of the compliance report and the review of the exemption report and it is expected
that final standards will be in place before the audit requirements with respect to the compliance
report and the exemption report are effective. Consequently, there is no need to wait for the
AICPA Broker-Dealer Audit Guide to be updated.
As noted above, several commenters requested clarity about the interaction between
material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and material weaknesses in
internal control over compliance with the financial responsibility rules. 353 Additionally, one
commenter stated that due to the reliance placed on the financial books and records of the
broker-dealer, it will not be feasible for the independent public accountant to attest to the
effectiveness of internal control over the financial responsibility rules without also attesting to
internal control over financial reporting. 354 As discussed above in section II.B.3.iii. of this
release, although a broker-dealer is required to state in the compliance report that the information
it used to state whether it was in compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3
was derived from its books and records, the final rule does not require that the broker-dealer
include a statement regarding the effectiveness of its internal control over the accuracy of its
books and records, nor does it require that the independent public accountant attest to the
effectiveness of internal control over the accuracy of the broker-dealer’s books and records.
Additionally, under the final rule, the independent public accountant is not required to opine on
the effectiveness of the broker-dealer’s internal control over financial reporting. However, the
independent public accountant’s existing obligation to gain an understanding and perform

86

appropriate procedures relative to the broker-dealer’s internal control over financial reporting, as
a necessary part of the independent public accountant’s financial report audit, remains
unchanged. 355 Further, as discussed above in section II.B.3.iii. of this release, the examination of
the compliance report would pertain solely to certain statements in the compliance report and not
to the broker-dealer’s process for arriving at the statements. The report of the independent public
accountant, based on the examination of the compliance report, requires the accountant to
perform its own independent examination of the related controls and procedures. Consequently,
it is not necessary for the independent public accountant to provide an opinion with regard to the
process that the broker-dealer used to arrive at its conclusions.
As noted above, one commenter stated that a review engagement should not be employed
for the exemption report, because an accountant’s inquiry and observation would not provide
sufficient evidence regarding a broker-dealer’s assertion that it is exempt from Rule 15c3-3, and
under the PCAOB’s attestation standards, an auditor should not accept an engagement to perform
a “review” engagement related to an entity’s compliance with specified requirements. 356 As an
alternative, this commenter suggested an “agreed-upon procedures” approach or an examination
engagement. 357
The PCAOB’s attestation standards currently provide that an accountant should not
accept an engagement to perform a review of an entity’s compliance with specified requirements
or about the effectiveness of an entity’s internal control over compliance, and that an agreed
upon procedures engagement be considered as an alternative. 358 Irrespective of the PCAOB’s

current standards, Rule 17a-5, as amended, provides that the broker-dealer engage an
independent public accountant to perform a review of the exemption report. Moreover, in July
2011, as part of its proposed standards for attestation engagements related to broker-dealer
compliance reports or exemption reports, the PCAOB proposed replacing the provision cited by
the commenter with the following: “When a practitioner is engaged to perform a review
engagement on assertions made by a broker or dealer in an exemption report that is prepared
pursuant to SEC Proposed Rule 17a-5, the practitioner must conduct the review engagement
pursuant to Proposed Attestation Standard, Review Engagements Regarding Exemption Reports
of Brokers and Dealers.” 359 In addition, as discussed above, the PCAOB has proposed specific
standards for an accountant to perform a review of the exemption report. 360 The PCAOB’s final
standards, which must be approved by the Commission, are intended by the PCAOB to clarify
the procedures an independent public accountant will need to perform in a review of an
exemption report. 361
In response to the comment that a review engagement should not be employed for the
exemption report because inquiry and observation would not provide sufficient evidence, 362 the
independent public accountant would be able to obtain the moderate level of assurance
contemplated by the required review through a combination of procedures that the accountant
would perform in connection with the financial audit currently required under Rule 17a-5 and
certain inquiries and other procedures specifically targeting the exemption report. Also, the

359

See PCAOB Proposing Release app. 3 at A3–4. The PCAOB’s attestation standards currently provide that
an accountant should not accept an engagement to perform a review of an entity’s compliance with
specified requirements or about the effectiveness of an entity’s internal control over compliance or an
assertion regarding those items. See PCAOB Interim Attestation Standard, AT Section 601 at ¶ 7.

88

PCAOB’s proposal includes specific requirements for a review engagement regarding exemption
reports of brokers and dealers. In addition to inquiry and observation, the PCAOB’s proposal
states that “in performing the review engagement, the auditor should…[e]valuate whether the
evidence obtained and the results of the procedures performed in the audit of the financial
statements and supplemental information corroborate or contradict the broker’s or dealer’s
assertion regarding compliance with the exemption conditions.” 363 Additionally, the auditor
should “[p]erform other procedures as necessary in the circumstances to obtain moderate
assurance.” 364 The PCAOB’s final standards will provide clarity on the procedures to be
performed by the independent public accountant to obtain a moderate level of assurance to form
a conclusion with respect to the review of the exemption report. 365
The commenter’s suggestion to use an “agreed-upon procedures” engagement for the
exemption report was considered. The final rule, however, requires a review engagement as
proposed. Under an “agreed-upon procedures” engagement, the independent public accountant
is engaged by a client to issue a report of findings based on specific procedures performed on
subject matter that the specified parties believe are appropriate. 366 Additionally, in an “agreedupon procedures” engagement, the independent public accountant does not perform an
examination or a review, and does not provide an opinion or negative assurance. Thus, no
conclusion would be rendered as to the broker-dealer’s statement that it met certain exemption
provisions in Rule 15c3-3.

In addition to the commenter advocating an “agreed-upon procedures” standard, 367 a
second commenter stated that the cost “would not justify the need” for an audit report covering
the exemption report 368 and a third commenter stated that the exemption report should be
replaced with a box to check on the FOCUS Report as the auditor attestation provided no added
benefit. 369 In response to all these comments, the Commission notes that previously Rule 17a-5
required that if a broker-dealer is exempt from Rule 15c3-3, the independent public accountant is
required to ascertain whether the conditions of the exemption were being complied with and that
no facts came to the accountant’s attention to indicate that the exemption had not been complied
with. 370 Consequently, the rule previously required the independent public accountant to reach a
conclusion with respect to a broker-dealer’s claimed exemption from Rule 15c3-3. The
Commission believes that the rule should continue to require a conclusion from the independent
public accountant on the broker-dealer’s claimed exemption from Rule 15c3-3 because of the
importance of safeguarding customer securities and cash. Consequently, the Commission does
not believe that it would be appropriate to use a lower standard (i.e., the agreed-upon procedures
standard) or to have no requirement for the independent public accountant to perform any work
with respect to the exemption report. Moreover, because the independent public accountant was
previously required to render a conclusion with respect to the broker-dealer’s claimed exemption
from Rule 15c3-3, the exemption report review should not result in significant incremental cost
over the existing requirement.
As noted above, two commenters raised concerns that minor exceptions to meeting the

exemption provisions of paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 could result in the independent public
accountant becoming aware of material modifications that should be made to the statement in the
exemption report. 371 Under PCAOB standards for attestation engagements, the independent
public accountant’s review report on a statement in an exemption report would be required to
include a statement about whether the accountant is aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the statement in the exemption report in order for it to be fairly stated in all
material respects. 372 As discussed above in section II.B.4.iii. of this release, the exemption
report requirements have been modified from the proposal so that a broker-dealer must either
state that it met the identified exemption provisions in paragraph (k) throughout the most recent
fiscal year without exception or that it met the identified exemption provisions throughout the
most recent fiscal year except as described in the report. Consequently, a broker-dealer that had
exceptions will state that fact in the exemption report and describe the exceptions. Under
PCAOB standards, if the statement is fairly stated in all material respects, including descriptions
of any exceptions, the broker-dealer’s independent public accountant would not need to state that
the accountant is aware of any material modifications that should be made to the statement. 373
The Commission did not receive comments regarding the proposed amendments to
paragraph (i) of Rule 17a-5. However, the final rule has been revised from the proposal for

372

See PCAOB Interim Attestation Standard, AT Section 101 at ¶ .90. See also PCAOB Proposing Release
app. 2 at ¶ 11 (“The auditor should evaluate the identified instances of non-compliance with the exemption

broker’s or dealer’s assertion not to be fairly stated, in all material respects. If the broker’s or dealer’s
assertion is not fairly stated, in all material respects, the auditor should: (a) modify the review report … and
(b) evaluate the effect of the matter on the audit of the financial statements and supplemental
information.”).

373

See PCAOB Interim Attestation Standard, AT Section 101 at ¶ .67 (stating that in expressing its

reasonable person would be influenced by the omission or misstatement.”).

clarity and consistency with the other amendments to Rule 17a-5. The title of the rule has been
modified from the proposal to add a citation for clarity. As adopted, the title is, “Reports of the
independent public accountant required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of [Rule 17a-5].” As
adopted, paragraph (i)(1) of Rule 17a-5 provides, as proposed, that the independent public
accountant’s reports must: be dated; be signed manually; indicate the city and state where issued;
and identify without detailed enumeration the items covered by the reports.
Paragraph (i)(2) of Rule 17a-5, as adopted, is also consistent with the proposal except that
the word “Identify” is substituted for the word “Designate” for clarity and the phrase “opinions
or conclusions” is substituted for the phrase “opinions or statement” because as explained above,
consistent with auditing standards, a review engagement will not result in an opinion, but in the
accountant’s conclusion in the form of “negative assurance” – for example, a conclusion that no
information came to the accountant’s attention that indicates that a statement is not fairly stated
in all material respects. 374 The rule therefore provides that the independent public accountant’s
reports must: (i) state whether the examinations or review, as applicable, were made in
accordance with standards of the PCAOB; (ii) identify any examination and, if applicable,
review procedures deemed necessary by the independent public accountant under the
circumstances of the particular case that have been omitted and the reason for their omission.
The rule also provides that: “[n]othing in this section may be construed to imply authority for the
omission of any procedure that independent public accountants would ordinarily employ in the
course of an examination or review made for the purpose of expressing the opinions or
conclusions required under [Rule 17a-5].”

Paragraph (i)(3) of Rule 17a-5, as adopted, is re-organized for clarity. Specific reference
has been added to those statements in the compliance report that the accountant must examine,
consistent with other amendments to Rule 17a-5 (e.g., the amendments to paragraph (g)(2)(i) of
Rule 17a-5 regarding the engagement of the accountant to prepare a report based on the
examination of specified statements in the compliance report). In addition, a subparagraph is
added to include a reference to the exemption report. 375 The rule provides that the independent
public accountant’s reports must state clearly: (i) the opinion of the independent public
accountant with respect to the financial report required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of Rule 17a5 and the accounting principles and practices reflected in that report; (ii) the opinion of the
independent public accountant with respect to the financial report required under paragraph
(d)(1)(i)(A) of Rule 17a-5, as to the consistency of the application of the accounting principles,
or as to any changes in those principles, that have a material effect on the financial statements;
and (iii) either (A) the opinion of the independent public accountant with respect to the
statements required under paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A)(2), (3), (4), and (5) of Rule 17a-5 in the
compliance report required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B)(1) of Rule 17a-5, or (B) the conclusion
of the independent public accountant with respect to the statements required under paragraphs
(d)(4)(i), (ii), and (iii) of Rule 17a-5. The specific references to the compliance report and
exemption report in paragraph (i)(3) are intended to provide a complete description of what must
be contained in the report of the independent public accountant under current attestation
standards, which require a conclusion in the case of an examination to be expressed in the form

375

As proposed, paragraph (i)(3) did not contain a reference to the exemption report. See Broker-Dealer
Reports,76 FR at 37607. The final rule makes clear that the auditor’s conclusion must be included in the
independent public accountant’s report covering the exemption report.

93

of an opinion and a conclusion in the case of a review that is not expressed in the form of an
opinion, but in the form of “negative assurance.” 376
Paragraph (i)(4) of Rule 17a-5 has been modified from the proposal to add a reference to
paragraph (d) to make it more clear that the annual reports referenced in the paragraph are the
financial report, compliance report, and exemption report prescribed in paragraph (d). In
addition – in the interest of using “plain English” in the Commission’s rules – the word “must”
has been substituted for the word “shall” and the word “thereto” has been eliminated. The rule
as adopted therefore provides that “[a]ny matters to which the independent public accountant
takes exception must be clearly identified, the exceptions must be specifically and clearly stated,
and, to the extent practicable, the effect of each such exception on any related items contained in
the annual reports required under paragraph (d) of [Rule 17a-5] must be given.”

PCAOB Registration of Independent Public Accountant – Paragraph (f)(1)
of Rule 17a-5

Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (f)(1) of Rule 17a-5 was titled “Qualification of
accountants” and provided that: “The Commission will not recognize any person as a certified
public accountant who is not duly registered and in good standing as such under the laws of his
place of residence or principal office.” 377 Paragraph (f)(3) of Rule 17a-5 provided that the
accountant “shall be independent in accordance with the provisions of § 210.2-01 (b) and (c) of

376

As noted above, the accountant’s conclusion in an examination engagement will be expressed in the form
of an opinion. For example, the accountant’s conclusion based on an examination of an assertion could
state that in the accountant’s opinion, the assertion is fairly stated in all material respects. See, e.g.,
PCAOB Interim Attestation Standard, AT Section 101 at ¶ .84. The accountant’s conclusion in a review
engagement will be expressed, not in the form of an opinion, but in the form of “negative assurance.” See,
e.g., PCAOB Interim Attestation Standard, AT Section 101 at ¶ .68. For example, the accountant’s
conclusion based on a review of an assertion could state that no information came to the accountant’s
attention that indicates that the assertion is not fairly stated in all material respects. See, e.g., PCAOB
Interim Attestation Standard, AT Section 101 at ¶ .88.

this chapter” and, paragraph (e)(1)(i) of Rule 17a-5 provided that the accountant “shall be in fact
independent as defined in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.” 378
As discussed above, section 17(e)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act, requires registered broker-dealers to annually file financial statements with the
Commission certified by “an independent public accounting firm, or by a registered public
accounting firm if the firm is required to be registered under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.”
Accordingly, the Commission proposed amending paragraph (f)(1) to provide that: “The
independent public accountant must be qualified and independent in accordance with § 210.2-01
of this chapter and, in addition, the independent public accountant must be registered with the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board if required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002.” 379 The Commission further proposed deleting the accountant independence language in
paragraph (e)(1)(i) of Rule 17a-5. 380 In addition, the Commission proposed deleting paragraph
(f)(3) and re-designating paragraph (f)(4) as paragraph (f)(3). 381 These proposed amendments to
paragraph (f) of Rule 17a-5 would consolidate the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1)(i), (f)(1), and
(f)(3) of Rule 17a-5 into paragraph (f)(1) and make Rule 17a-5 consistent with other
Commission requirements governing the qualifications of accountants. The Commission
received no comments on these proposals and is adopting them substantially as proposed. 382
Although the underlying independence requirements have not changed, broker-dealers
and their independent public accountants are reminded that they must comply with the

independence requirements of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X. 383 As a result of the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002, Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X was strengthened, including increased
restrictions on the provision of certain non-audit services to an audit client. 384
Under the Commission’s rules, an accountant will not be recognized as independent with
respect to an audit client if the accountant is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all
relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that the accountant is not, capable of exercising
objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the accountant’s engagement.
In determining whether an accountant is independent, the Commission will consider all relevant
circumstances, including all relationships between the accountant and the audit client, and not
just those relating to reports filed with the Commission. 385 The standard is predicated largely on
whether a relationship or the provision of a service: (1) creates a mutual or conflicting interest
between the accountant and the audit client; (2) places the accountant in the position of auditing
his or her own work; (3) results in the accountant acting as management or an employee of the
audit client; or (4) places the accountant in a position of being an advocate for the audit client. 386
Further, Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X sets forth a non-exclusive specification of
circumstances that are inconsistent with the general standard. For example, the accountant is
prohibited from providing the following non-audit services, among others, to an audit client: 387
•

Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial
statements of the audit client;

With respect to bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or
financial statements of the audit client, Rule 2-01(c)(4)(i) of Regulation S-X specifies that these
services include: (1) maintaining or preparing the audit client's accounting records; (2) preparing
financial statements that are filed with the Commission or the information that forms the basis of
financial statements filed with the Commission; or (3) preparing or originating source data
underlying the audit client's financial statements. 388
Not all of the independence requirements in Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X that are
applicable to audits of issuers are applicable to engagements under Rule 17a-5. Specifically,
auditors of broker-dealers are not subject to the partner rotation requirements or the
compensation requirements of the Commission’s independence rules because the statute
mandating those requirements is limited to issuers. 389 Additionally, auditors of broker-dealers
are not subject to the audit committee pre-approval requirements 390 or the cooling-off period
requirements for employment 391 because those requirements only reference issuers.
F.

Notification of Non-Compliance or Material Weakness

As discussed in detail below, the Commission is amending the notification provisions in
Rule 17a-5 and amending Rule 17a-11 to align that rule with the amendments to Rule 17a-5.
Under Rule 17a-11, a broker-dealer must provide notice to the Commission and its DEA in

certain circumstances. 392 For example, paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17a-11 requires a broker-dealer
to give notice if its net capital declines below the minimum amount required under Rule 15c31. 393 Rule 15c3-1 and Rule 15c3-3 also require broker-dealers to provide notification in certain
circumstances. 394 For example, paragraph (i) of Rule 15c3-3 requires a carrying broker-dealer to
immediately notify the Commission and its DEA if it fails to make a deposit into its customer
reserve account as required by paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3. 395
1.

New Notification Requirements – Paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5

Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (h)(2) of Rule 17a-5 provided that if, during the
course of the audit or interim work, the independent public accountant determined that any
“material inadequacies” existed, then the independent public accountant was required to inform
the chief financial officer (“CFO”) of the broker-dealer, who, in turn, was required to give notice
to the Commission and the broker-dealer’s DEA within 24 hours in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 17a-11. 396 The rule also provided that the broker-dealer must furnish the
independent public accountant with the notice, and if the independent public accountant failed to
receive the notice within the 24 hour period, or if the accountant disagreed with any statements
contained in the notice, the independent public accountant was required to inform the
Commission and the DEA within the next 24 hours. 397 In that event, the independent public
accountant was required to describe any material inadequacies found to exist or, if the broker or

i.

The Proposed Amendments

The proposed amendments to Rule 17a-5 would have replaced references to material
inadequacies, including the material inadequacy report, with a requirement applicable to carrying
broker-dealers to identify an instance of “material non-compliance” with the financial
responsibility rules and any material weakness in internal control over compliance with the
financial responsibility rules in the compliance report and the requirement to engage an
independent public accountant to examine the compliance report. 399 Consistent with those
proposed changes, the Commission proposed amending the notification provisions of paragraph
(h)(2) of Rule 17a-5 to replace the term “material inadequacy” with the term “material noncompliance,” which would result in a requirement to notify the Commission upon the discovery
by the accountant during the course of preparing a report based on an examination of the
compliance report of an instance of material non-compliance as that term was proposed to be
defined under the amendments. 400
The Commission also proposed amending provisions regarding the notification
process. 401 Under the proposal, the accountant would have been required to notify the
Commission and the broker-dealer’s DEA directly. 402 In the proposing release, the Commission
stated that it preliminarily believed these changes would provide more effective and timely
notice of broker-dealer compliance deficiencies and enable the Commission to react more

quickly to protect customers and others adversely affected by those deficiencies. 403 The
amendments also would have been consistent with the notification requirement in Rule 206(4)-2
that is triggered in the context of a “surprise” examination of an investment adviser. 404
ii.

Comments Received

The Commission received numerous comments in response to this proposal. 405 Most of
these commenters objected to the proposed notification process. 406 Among the reasons given
were that it would be inappropriate to require the accountant to notify the Commission and the
DEA directly, because, among other things, the broker-dealer is principally responsible for
compliance with the securities laws, including timely notification; 407 that PCAOB standards
provide that “the practitioner should not take on the role of the responsible party;” 408 and that
PCAOB attestation standards (which were referenced in the proposing release) clearly provide
that management is responsible for the subject matter to which it is asserting, and not the
accountant. 409 In addition, one commenter stated that alignment of notification procedures (that
is, to require the accountant to notify the Commission directly) between Rule 17a-5 and Rule
206(4)-2 is not necessary, given the other auditing and reporting responsibilities in place or
proposed. 410 In addition to suggestions that the notification process that existed prior to today’s

Id.

404

Id. Rule 206(4)-2 provides, in pertinent part, that upon finding any “material discrepancies” during the
“surprise” examination of an investment adviser to verify client funds and securities, the independent
public accountant must notify the Commission within one business day. 17 CFR 275.206(4)-2(a)(4)(ii).

simultaneous notice by the accountant to the Commission and to the firm’s management. 412
In addition, one commenter asked whether the notification provisions apply to a review
of the exemption report. 413 Another commenter stated that a report of non-compliance also will
trigger a Rule 17a-11 notice, which would be duplicative and create confusion. 414
iii.

The Final Rule

In part in response to comments received, and to achieve consistency with other revisions
to the proposed rule amendments described above, the notification provisions in the final rule
have been modified from the proposed amendments. 415 First, the Commission is persuaded by
comments received that the primary obligation to notify the Commission should remain with the
broker-dealer. 416 Therefore, the notification process in place before today’s amendments
generally has been retained.

411

See, e.g., ABA Letter; E&Y Letter; McGladrey Letter.

See Van Kampen/Invesco Letter.

413

See KPMG Letter.

See ABA Letter.

415

See paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5.

416

As the proposal noted, the proposed amendment to require the independent public accountant to notify the
Commission directly of material non-compliance would have been consistent with the surprise examination
notification requirement in Rule 206(4)-2 under the Advisers Act. A surprise examination of an investment
adviser by an independent public accountant generally verifies that client funds and securities of which the
investment adviser has custody are held by a qualified custodian, such as a bank or broker-dealer. The
accountant’s surprise examination report opines on the adviser’s compliance with the custody rule
requirement that client funds and securities are maintained by a qualified custodian and also opines on the
adviser’s compliance with certain recordkeeping obligations between surprise examinations. The
difference in nature and scope of custodial and other activities between broker-dealers and advisers results
in significantly broader examination requirements for broker-dealers. Broker-dealers are required to
undergo an annual examination by an independent public accountant of their financial statements and
certain supporting schedules: a computation of net capital under Rule 15c3-1, a computation for
determining reserve requirements under Rule 15c3-3, and information relating to the possession and control
requirements of Rule 15c3-3. Moreover, under today’s amendments, the independent public accountant
must examine the compliance report of broker-dealers that maintain custody of customer funds or
securities. The differences in the overall nature of an examination also supports continuing to maintain
today’s model under which a broker-dealer has the primary notification obligation (e.g., unlike in the case
of a surprise examination of an investment adviser, a broker-dealer would already be making its own

101

Second, the final rule amendments require that, if the independent public accountant
determines that the broker-dealer “is not in compliance with” any of the financial responsibility
rules during the course of preparing the accountant’s reports, the independent public accountant
must immediately notify the broker-dealer’s CFO of the nature of the non-compliance. 417 As
proposed, the independent public accountant would have been required to provide notification if
the accountant determined that any “material non-compliance” existed. As discussed above in
section II.D.3. of this release, the final rule does not include a definition of the term material
non-compliance, as in the proposal. Thus, the independent public accountant will be required to
provide notification to the broker-dealer of all instances of non-compliance with the financial
responsibility rules as opposed to the proposal, which required the independent public accountant
to report to the Commission and the DEA only instances of material non-compliance. While this
may increase the number of times the independent public accountant must provide notification of

assessment and preparing its own report in the case of a compliance report examination). Further, the
Dodd-Frank Act provided the PCAOB with explicit authority to, among other things, establish (subject to
Commission approval) auditing and related attestation, quality control, ethics, and independence standards
for registered public accounting firms with respect to their preparation of audit reports to be included in
broker-dealer filings with the Commission, and the authority to conduct and require an inspection program
of registered public accounting firms that audit broker-dealers. The PCAOB oversight of broker-dealer
examinations provides additional regulatory oversight with respect to the examination of the broker-dealer
further supporting the retention of the primary obligation with the broker-dealer to provide notice to the
Commission and the broker-dealer’s DEA.
417

Id. Under the current provisions of paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5 (which are being amended), the
independent public accountant “shall call it to the attention” of the CFO of the broker-dealer any material
inadequacies. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(h)(2). In the final rule, the independent public accountant is required
to “immediately notify” the CFO of the “nature” of any non-compliance with the financial responsibility
rules or material weakness. This change from the current notification requirement is designed to make the
rule more clear as “shall call it to the attention” does not specify when the notification must be given.
Further, as proposed, the independent public accountant would have been required to provide the
Commission with notice of any material non-compliance within one business day of determining that the
material non-compliance exists. See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37606. Under the final rule, the
independent public accountant provides notice to the broker-dealer’s CFO of any non-compliance with the
financial responsibility rules or material weakness and the CFO, in turn, is required to provide the
Commission and other securities regulators with notice if the non-compliance requires notice under Rule
15c3-1, Rule 15c3-3, or Rule 17a-11 or in the case of a material weakness. Consequently, because there is
an intermediate step before the Commission receives notice, it is important that the independent public
accountant notify the CFO immediately so that the Commission and other securities regulators receive
timely notice.

102

non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules, the independent public accountant will
not have to analyze whether an instance of non-compliance is “material non-compliance” under
the proposed definition.
If the independent public accountant provides notice to the broker-dealer of an instance
of non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules, the broker-dealer must provide notice
to the Commission and its DEA in accordance with the notification provisions of Rule 15c3-1,
Rule 15c3-3, or Rule 17a-11, but only if the notice provided by the independent public
accountant concerns an instance of non-compliance that requires the broker-dealer to provide
notification under those rules. The proposal would have required the accountant to notify the
Commission “upon determining that any material non-compliance exists.” 418 Rule 15c3-1, Rule
15c3-3, and Rule 17a-11 specify instances of non-compliance that require notification by the
broker-dealer, and paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5, as amended, refers to the notification provisions
in those rules.
The broker-dealer must provide a copy of the notification to the accountant within one
business day and, if the accountant does not receive the notice or the accountant does not agree
with any statements in the notice, the accountant must provide a report to the Commission and
the broker-dealer’s DEA within one business day. 419 The report from the accountant must, if the
broker-dealer failed to file a notification, describe any instances of non-compliance that required
the broker-dealer to provide a notification. 420 If the broker-dealer filed a notification but the
independent public accountant does not agree with the statements in the notice, the report from
the accountant must detail the aspects of the notification of the broker-dealer with which the
418

See paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5.

420

Id.

103

accountant does not agree. 421 This notification process is generally the same as that in place
before today’s amendments.
While the final rule incorporates the existing notification process, the Commission wants
to emphasize the importance of broker-dealers providing notification to the Commission and
other securities regulators of non-compliance with Rule 15c3-1 as required by Rule 17a-11 and
non-compliance with paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 as required by paragraph (i) of Rule 15c33. 422 Consequently, the Commission is adding a note to paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5 calling the
attention of the broker-dealer and independent public accountant to these notification
requirements. 423 Further, an important element of this process is the back-up provided by the
independent public accountant in terms of the obligation under the rule to provide the
Commission and DEA with notification of the instance of non-compliance if the accountant does
not receive a copy of the broker-dealer’s notification or the accountant does not agree with the
statements in the notification. Therefore, of necessity, the independent public accountant would
have to have measures in place to determine whether, and if so when, the accountant received a
copy of the notification required to be provided by the broker-dealer to the Commission or the

421

Id.

422

Paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17a-11 provides, among other things, that every broker-dealer whose net capital
declines below the minimum amount required pursuant to Rule 15c3-1 shall give notice of such deficiency
that same day in accordance with paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-11 and that the notice shall specify the brokerdealer's net capital requirement and its current amount of net capital. See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(b)(1).
Paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-11 provides, among other things, that the notice shall be given or transmitted to
the principal office of the Commission in Washington, D.C., the regional office of the Commission for the
region in which the broker-dealer has its principal place of business, the DEA of which such broker-dealer
is a member, and the CFTC if the broker-dealer is registered as a futures commission merchant with such
Commission, and that the notice shall be given or transmitted by telegraphic notice or facsimile
transmission. See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(g). Paragraph (i) of Rule 15c3-3 provides that if a broker-dealer
shall fail to make a reserve bank account or special account deposit, as required by Rule 15c3-3, the brokerdealer shall by telegram immediately notify the Commission and the regulatory authority for the brokerdealer, which examines such broker-dealer as to financial responsibility and shall promptly thereafter
confirm such notification in writing. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(i). The Commission staff is considering
ways to modernize the process by which broker-dealers file these and other notices with the Commission.

423

See note to paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5, as adopted.

broker-dealer’s DEA. An independent public accountant could decide not to rely solely on the
receipt of a copy of the notice from the broker dealer and take other steps to check whether the
broker-dealer provided notice to the Commission and the DEA, such as obtaining a copy of a
facsimile transmission from the broker-dealer to the Commission and DEA.
Third, the proposal has been modified to add that, if the accountant determines in
connection with the audit of a carrying broker-dealer’s annual reports that any material weakness
(as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of Rule 17a-5) exists, the independent public accountant must
immediately notify the broker-dealer’s CFO of the nature of the material weakness. 424 As
discussed above, before today’s amendments, paragraph (h)(2) of Rule 17a-5 required the
accountant to notify the broker-dealer’s CFO if the accountant determined that any “material
inadequacies” existed. However, as explained above in section II.B.3. of this release, the final
rules do not contain the concept of material inadequacy. Also, as the term material weakness is
defined with respect to the compliance report, this notification requirement only applies to
carrying broker-dealers, whereas the requirement to provide notification of a material inadequacy
applied to carrying and non-carrying broker-dealers.
As discussed in more detail below in section II.F.2. of this release, the Commission is
amending Rule 17a-11 to provide that a broker-dealer must provide notification to the
Commission and its DEA if the broker-dealer discovers, or is notified by its independent public
accountant, of the existence of a material weakness. 425 Paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5, as stated
above, requires that the independent public accountant notify the broker-dealer if the accountant
determines that a material weakness exists. 426 The rule also requires the broker-dealer to provide

of Rule 17a-11 within 24 hours and transmit a report within 48 hours of the notice stating what
the broker-dealer has done or is doing to correct the situation. 427 Paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5
requires the broker-dealer to provide the accountant with a copy of the notice it sends to the
Commission within one business day and, if the accountant does not receive the notice or the
accountant does not agree with the statements in the notice, the accountant must provide a report
to the Commission and the broker-dealer’s DEA within one business day. 428 The report from the
accountant must, if the broker-dealer failed to file a notification, describe any material
weakness. 429 If the broker-dealer filed a notification and the accountant does not agree with the
statements in the notification, the report from the accountant must detail the aspects of the
notification of the broker-dealer with which the accountant does not agree. 430 Again, this
notification process is generally the same as the one in place before today’s amendments. 431 In
response to the comment that the rule should require simultaneous notice by the accountant to
the Commission and to the firm’s management, the notification procedures adopted today require
that the accountant notify management of the broker-dealer and also ensure that the Commission
receives timely notice.
As stated above, one commenter asked whether the notification provisions apply to a

One change from the current rule (which is being amended) is to provide that required actions be completed
within “one business day” as opposed to within a “24 hour period.” This change is designed to account for

review of an exemption report. 432 The notification provisions in paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5
with respect to non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules apply regardless of
whether the independent public accountant is engaged to prepare a report based on examination
of a broker-dealer’s compliance report or a review of a broker-dealer’s exemption report. 433 An
independent public accountant may determine that a broker-dealer is not in compliance with a
requirement in the financial responsibility rules (e.g., not in compliance with Rule 15c3-1)
during the course of an audit engagement of a non-carrying broker-dealer that files an exemption
report either as part of the examination of the broker-dealer’s financial statements or the review
of certain statements the broker-dealer’s exemption report. In this case, the independent public
accountant would need to immediately notify the CFO of the broker-dealer of the nature of the
non-compliance. The notification provisions with respect to an instance of material weakness
only apply to broker-dealers that file a compliance report because material weakness is defined
for purposes of the compliance report.
The rule as amended does not require the accountant to notify the Commission directly
when the accountant determines that a non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules
exists, which eliminates the concern of a commenter that a report of non-compliance by the
accountant, as proposed, would also trigger a Rule 17a-11 notice, which would be duplicative
and create confusion. 434 As adopted, the responsibility to provide notification rests with the
broker-dealer in the first instance.

Conforming and Technical Amendments to Rule 17a-11

Before today’s amendments, paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11 provided that whenever a
broker-dealer discovered, or was notified by an independent public accountant, pursuant to
paragraph (h)(2) of Rule 17a-5 or paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-12 of the existence of any
material inadequacy as defined in paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-5 or paragraph (e)(2) of Rule 17a12, the broker-dealer was required to give notice to the Commission within 24 hours of the
discovery or notification and transmit a report to the Commission within 48 hours of the notice
stating what the broker-dealer has done or was doing to correct the situation. 435 The
Commission proposed amending paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11 to delete the references to Rule
17a-5 and to correct the references to Rule 17a-12. 436
One commenter stated that the current notification process under paragraph (h)(2) of Rule
17a-5 and paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11 satisfies the objective of notifying the Commission in a
timely manner and that the commenter was concerned that the proposal could undermine the
effectiveness of the notification process in part because it would require notice to the
Commission only when the accountant determines that there is a deficiency, and not when it is
independently discovered by the broker-dealer. 437
The Commission agrees with the commenter that notification should be provided to the
Commission when a deficiency in internal control is discovered by the broker-dealer, in addition

435

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(e).

436

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37579. Rule 17a-12 contains reporting requirements for over-thecounter (“OTC”) derivatives dealers. See 17 CFR 240.17a-12. The rule is similar to Rule 17a-5. Compare
17 CFR 240.17a-12, with 17 CFR 240.17a-5. For example, paragraph (h)(2) of Rule 17a-12 describes
material inadequacies and paragraph (i)(2) of Rule 17a-12 provides that if the accountant determines that
any material inadequacy exists, the accountant must call it to the attention of the CFO of the OTC
derivatives dealer, who must inform the Commission. See 17 CFR 240.17a-12(h)(2) and (i). The
Commission did not propose amending Rule 17a-12. Consequently, Rule 17a-12 retains the concept of
material inadequacy.

108

to when it is notified by its accountant of the existence of any material weakness. Therefore, the
final rule retains references to Rule 17a-5 in paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11. The Commission is
conforming paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11 to today’s amendments to Rule 17a-5 to substitute the
term material weakness as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of Rule 17a-5 for the term material
inadequacy with respect to Rule 17a-5 and to replace the reference to paragraph (h)(2) of Rule
17a-5 with a reference to paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5. Specifically, the final rule provides that
whenever a broker-dealer discovers, or is notified by its accountant under paragraph (h) of Rule
17a-5 of the existence of any material weakness, the broker-dealer must: (1) give notice of the
material weakness within 24 hours of the discovery or notification; and (2) transmit a report
within 48 hours of the notice stating what the broker or dealer has done or is doing to correct the
situation. 438 The rule retains a reference to material inadequacy as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of
Rule 17a-12, but the amendments correct citations to that rule.
G.

Other Amendments to Rule 17a-5
1.

Information Provided to Customers – Paragraph (c) of Rule 17a-5
i.

Background

Paragraph (c) of Rule 17a-5 generally requires a broker-dealer that carries customer
accounts to send its balance sheet with appropriate notes and certain other financial information
to each of its customers twice a year. 439 The Commission did not propose to amend this
requirement. Accordingly, a broker-dealer that carries customer accounts must continue to send
its customers: (1) an audited balance sheet with footnotes, including a footnote specifying the
amount of the broker-dealer’s net capital and required net capital, under paragraph (c)(2) of Rule

438

See paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11. As stated above, this provision only applies to broker-dealers that file
compliance reports, as the tern material weakness is defined with respect to the compliance report.

439

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(c).

109

17a-5; 440 and (2) an unaudited balance sheet dated six months after the date of the audited
balance sheet with footnotes, including a footnote regarding the amount of the broker-dealer’s
net capital and required net capital, under paragraph (c)(3) of Rule 17a-5. 441 The information
required by paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of Rule 17a-5 must either be mailed to customers, or, if
the broker-dealer meets certain conditions under paragraph (c)(5) of Rule 17a-5, the brokerdealer can semi-annually send its customers summary information regarding its net capital, as
long as it also provides customers with a toll-free number to call for a free copy of its balance
sheet with appropriate notes, makes its balance sheet with appropriate notes available to
customers on its website, and meets other specified requirements. 442
ii.

Availability of Independent Public Accountant’s Comments on
Material Inadequacies – Paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 17a-5

Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of Rule 17a-5 provided that if, in
conjunction with a broker-dealer’s most recent audit report, the broker-dealer’s independent
public accountant commented on any material inadequacies in the broker-dealer’s internal
controls, its accounting system, or certain of its practices and procedures 443 under paragraphs (g)
and (h) of Rule 17a-5, and paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11, the broker-dealer’s audited statements
sent to customers were required to include a statement that a copy of the auditor’s comments
were available for inspection at the Commission’s principal office in Washington, DC, and the
regional office of the Commission in which the broker-dealer had its principal place of

business. 444
As discussed above in sections II.D.3. and II.F. of this release, the Commission proposed
deleting references to, and the definition of, the term material inadequacy in Rule 17a-5, and
proposed amending paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5 to require a broker-dealer’s independent public
accountant to notify the Commission and the broker-dealer’s DEA if the accountant determined
that any material non-compliance existed at the broker-dealer during the course of preparing its
reports. 445 Consequently, the Commission proposed replacing paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of Rule 17a5, which contained the term material inadequacies, with a requirement that, if a broker-dealer’s
accountant provided notice to the Commission of an instance of material non-compliance, the
financial information sent to customers under paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 17a-5 must include a
statement that a copy of the accountant’s notice was available for customers’ inspection at the
principal office of the Commission in Washington, DC. 446 Under this proposal, notices to the
Commission regarding an accountant’s determination that one or more instances of material noncompliance existed at a broker-dealer would be publicly available.
Three commenters responded to the proposed amendments to paragraph (c)(2) of Rule
17a-5. 447 These commenters each stated that the Commission should accord confidential
treatment to accountants’ notices to the Commission regarding determinations of material noncompliance. 448 One commenter stated that due to the technical nature of the financial
responsibility rules, there was a risk that notices of material non-compliance could be

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(c)(2)(iii).

445

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37579.

446

This proposal would have been codified in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of Rule 17a-5 as a result of paragraph
(c)(2)(iii) being removed and paragraph (c)(2)(iv) being redesignated as paragraph (c)(iii). See BrokerDealer Reports, 76 FR at 37603.

447

111

misinterpreted by the media and others. 449
The Commission is revising its proposal to amend paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 17a-5 to be
consistent with the new notification provisions in paragraph (h) described above relating to the
identification by a broker-dealer’s accountant of a material weakness rather than an instance of
material non-compliance. 450 Specifically, if, in connection with the most recent annual reports,
the report of the independent public accountant covering the broker-dealer’s compliance report
identifies a material weakness, the broker-dealer must include a statement that one or more
material weaknesses have been identified and that a copy of the report of the independent public
accountant is currently available for the customer’s inspection at the principal office of the
Commission in Washington, DC, and the regional office of the Commission for the region in
which the broker-dealer has its principal place of business. 451
In response to commenters’ concerns about making the report of material noncompliance available to the public, the report that now will be made publicly available is a report
that identifies the existence of a material weakness – not a report of material non-compliance. In
addition, making the report of the independent public accountant covering the compliance report
publicly available if it identifies the existence of a material weakness is consistent with the
previous treatment of a report of a material inadequacy. Providing customers notice of an
accountant’s finding that goes directly to the financial and operational condition of their brokerdealer and making the report containing the finding publicly available will make available to
customers information that facilitates their ability to make more informed decisions in selecting
broker-dealers through which they prefer to conduct business. For these reasons, the final rule
449

See ABA Letter.

450

See paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of Rule 17a-5.

451

Id.

112

does not accord confidential treatment to a report of an independent public accountant covering
the compliance report if it identifies a material weakness as some commenters suggested should
be the case with respect to the proposed – but not adopted – report of material non-compliance.
Consequently, an independent public accountant’s report covering the compliance report will be
made available for the customer’s inspection at the principal office of the Commission in
Washington, DC, and the regional office of the Commission for the region in which the brokerdealer has its principal place of business if the report identifies the existence of a material
weakness. 452
iii.

Exemption from Mailing Financial Information to Customers
– Paragraph (c)(5) of Rule 17a-5

Before today’s amendments, paragraph (c)(5) of Rule 17a-5 provided a conditional
exemption from the requirement that a broker-dealer send paper copies of financial information
to customers if the broker-dealer mailed to customers a financial disclosure statement with
summary information and an Internet link to its balance sheet and other information on the
broker-dealer’s website. 453 One of the conditions of the exemption, contained in paragraph
(c)(5)(vi) of Rule 17a-5, was that the broker-dealer was not required by paragraph (e) of Rule
17a-11 to give notice of a material inadequacy during the prior year. The Commission proposed
revising the condition in paragraph (c)(5)(vi) of Rule 17a-5 to provide that the broker-dealer’s
financial statements must receive an unqualified opinion from the independent public accountant
and neither the broker-dealer, under proposed paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5, nor the independent

452

Paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of Rule 17a-5, as adopted, includes both the principal office of the
Commission in Washington, DC and the regional office of the Commission for the region in which a
broker-dealer has its principal place of business as locations where the accountant’s reports are available.
Including the applicable regional office of the Commission as a location where these notices are available
will make them more accessible to customers and is consistent with the previous treatment of material
inadequacy reports.

public accountant, under proposed paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-5, identified a material weakness or
an instance of material non-compliance. 454
The Commission received several comments on the proposal. 455 One commenter stated
that broker-dealers should be able to deliver the financial information available to customers via
its website regardless of whether an instance of material non-compliance or material weakness
was identified. 456 Another commenter stated that the rule should not require a 100% rate of
compliance with the financial responsibility rules to qualify for the exemption. 457 A third
commenter stated that the proposed amendment should be eliminated, or replaced with the
requirement that broker-dealers include a notice of the material weakness or non-compliance on
customer account statements for a year following its identification. 458
In response to comments received, the Commission has decided not to adopt the proposed
condition in paragraph (c)(5)(vi) of Rule 17a-5 for qualifying for the conditional exemption.
Requiring paper delivery of financial information to customers when a broker-dealer’s financial
statements do not receive an unqualified opinion from its independent public accountant, or
when the broker-dealer fails to comply with certain regulatory requirements, will not necessarily
result in a more effective means of communication to customers and runs counter to the
dominant trend toward electronic communications between financial entities and their customers.

account statements monthly instead of quarterly, broker-dealers are already potentially facing “extremely
high” costs of sending information to customers. FINRA withdrew its proposals to send customer account
statements monthly instead of quarterly on July 30, 2012. See Proposed Rule Change to Adopt FINRA

Further, as discussed above, if a broker-dealer or its independent public accountant provides
notice to the Commission of a material weakness in the broker-dealer’s Internal Control Over
Compliance, paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of Rule 17a-5 as adopted requires the broker-dealer to include
with the semi-annual financial disclosure statement it sends its customers a statement that the
independent public accountant identified a material weakness and that a copy of the report of the
independent public accountant is available for the customers’ inspection.

Technical Amendments
i.

Deletion of Paragraph (b)(6) of Rule 17a-5

Before today’s amendments, paragraph (b)(6) of Rule 17a-5 provided that “a copy of [a
broker-dealers] annual audit report shall be filed at the regional office of the Commission for the
region in which the broker or dealer has its principal place of business and the principal office of
the designated examining authority for said broker or dealer. Two copies of said report shall be
filed at the Commission’s principal office in Washington, DC. Copies thereof shall be provided
to all self-regulatory organizations of which said broker or dealer is a member.” The
Commission proposed to delete this paragraph because the same provisions are in paragraph
(d)(6) of Rule 17a-5. 459 The Commission received no comments on this proposal and is deleting
paragraph (b)(6) of Rule 17a-5 as proposed.
ii.

Deletion of Provisions Relating to the Year 2000

Before today’s amendments, paragraph (e)(5) of Rule 17a-5 required broker-dealers to
459

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37593. As discussed above in section II.B.6. of this release, the
Commission is amending paragraph (d)(6) of Rule 17a-5 to require that a copy of a broker-dealer’s annual
report must be filed with SIPC. Specifically, the Commission is amending paragraph (d)(6) to provide that
a broker-dealer’s annual reports “must be filed at the regional office of the Commission for the region in
which the broker or dealer has its principal place of business, the Commission’s principal office in
Washington, DC, the principal office of the designated examining authority for the broker or dealer, and
with the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (‘SIPC’) if the broker or dealer is a member of SIPC.
Copies of the reports must be provided to all self-regulatory organizations of which the broker or dealer is a
member, unless the self-regulatory organization by rule waives this requirement.”

115

file Form BD-Y2K. Form BD-Y2K elicited information with respect to a broker-dealer’s
readiness for the year 2000 and any potential problems that could arise with the advent of the
new millennium. 460 Form BD-Y2K was required to be filed in April 1999 and only then. In the
proposing release, the Commission proposed to delete paragraph (e)(5) of Rule 17a-5 in its
entirety because the provisions of that paragraph are now moot. 461 The Commission received no
comments on this proposal and is deleting paragraph (e)(5) of Rule 17a-5 as proposed.
iii.

Deletion of Paragraph (i)(5) of Rule 17a-5

In the proposing release, the Commission proposed to delete paragraph (i)(5) of Rule
17a-5, which, before today’s amendments, provided that “the terms audit (or examination),
accountant’s report, and certified shall have the meanings given in §210.1–02 of this chapter.” 462
The Commission received no comments on this proposal and is deleting paragraph (i)(5) of Rule
17a-5 as proposed.
iv.

Amendments to Paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-5

Before today’s amendments, paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-5 provided that a broker-dealer
that was required to file an annual audit report must file a statement with the Commission and its
DEA that it has designated an independent public accountant responsible for performing the
annual audit of the broker-dealer, which was called “Notice pursuant to Rule 17a-5(f)(2)”. 463
Paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of Rule 17a-5 prescribed the items that were required to be included in the
notice: the name, address, telephone number and registration number of the broker-dealer; the
name, address and telephone number of the accounting firm; and the audit date of the broker460

dealer for the year covered by the agreement. 464
In addition to the proposed amendments discussed below in section III. of this release, the
Commission proposed certain technical amendments to paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-5. 465 First,
the Commission proposed amending the language in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of Rule 17a-5 to
streamline the paragraph and to add a reference to proposed paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of Rule 17a-5,
which would have prescribed the information a broker-dealer would have been required to
include in its notice designating its accountant. In addition, the Commission proposed to amend
paragraph (f)(2)(i) of Rule 17a-5 to require that a broker-dealer include a statement in its notice
as to whether the engagement with its independent public accountant was for a single year or was
of a continuing nature. This statement was previously required by paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of Rule
17a-5, which the Commission proposed to delete as part of its revisions to that paragraph. The
Commission did not receive any comments on these proposed changes and is adopting them as
proposed. The Commission also proposed to retain the annual December 10 filing deadline for
the statements provided pursuant to paragraph (f)(2), but also added the language “(or 30
calendar days after the effective date of its registration as a broker or dealer, if earlier).” The
Commission did not receive any comments on this amendment and is adopting it as proposed. In
addition, the final rule adds a conforming change to the date of the statement designating the
independent public accountant. Under the proposal, the statement must be dated “no later than
December 1.” Under the final rules, the statement must be dated “no later than December 1 (or
20 calendar days after the effective date of its registration as a broker or dealer, if earlier)” to
make the timing consistent with the filing deadlines described above.

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(f)(2)(iii)(A)–(C).

465

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37583–37584, 37605–37606.

117

As discussed in the proposing release, notices pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-5
currently on file with the Commission do not contain the representations that are required by the
amendments to paragraph (f)(2) that the Commission is adopting today. Accordingly, brokerdealers subject to paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-5 (i.e., all broker-dealers that are required to file
audited annual reports) must file a new “statement regarding the independent public accountant
under Rule 17a-5(f)(2).” 466 As specified in the new rule, if the engagement covered by the new
statement is of a continuing nature, no subsequent filing would be required unless and until the
broker-dealer changes its independent public accountant or amends the engagement with the
accountant. 467
v.

Further Technical Amendments

In the proposing release, the Commission proposed additional technical amendments to
Rule 17a-5, including changes that would consistently use the term “independent public
accountant” throughout Rule 17a-5 when referring to a broker-dealer’s accountant, 468 to make
the rule gender neutral, 469 and to replace the term “balance sheet” with the term “Statement of
Financial Condition” in all places where that term appeared in Rule 17a-5. 470 These technical
amendments were designed to modernize the language of Rule 17a-5, and to make the rule easier
to understand. The Commission received no comments on these amendments and is adopting
them as proposed.
The Commission is making further technical amendments that are consistent with the
Commission’s “plain English” initiative and do not substantively affect the requirements of Rule
466

See paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-5.

17a-5. 471 In addition, for clarity and consistency throughout Rule 17a-5, the Commission is
amending Rule 17a-5 to replace the words “date selected for the annual audit of financial
statements” that were previously contained in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (iii) of Rule 17a-5 with
the words “end of the fiscal year of the broker or dealer.” 472 The phrase “date selected for the
annual audit of the financial statements” has the same meaning as the phrase “end of the fiscal
year of the broker or dealer.” As discussed earlier, this change eliminates outdated language and
conforms the text in paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-5 to the text in paragraph (n) of Rule 17a-5. The
Commission is making a technical amendment to paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17a-5. As proposed,
paragraph (a)(3) provided that the reports required under paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-5 were
considered filed when received at the Commission’s principal office and the regional office of
the Commission where the broker-dealer has its principal place of business. However, Form
Custody, which broker-dealers must file under paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17a-5, as amended, must
be filed with the broker-dealer’s DEA and not with the Commission. The Commission is
therefore amending paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17a-5 to clarify that this provision applies to reports
“that must be filed with the Commission.” As a result, the Commission is making technical
amendments to paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iv) of Rule 17a-5 to specify that the FOCUS
Reports required under these provisions must be filed with the Commission.
The Commission also is making technical amendments to paragraph (m)(1) of Rule 17a5, which relates to extensions and exemptions for filing annual reports, and (n)(2) of Rule 17a-5,
which relates to a broker-dealer’s notification requirements when changing its fiscal year, to

471

These amendments replace the term “shall” with “must,” the term “pursuant to” with “under,” the term
“said” with “the” or “that,” the term “such” with “the” or “that,” the term “other than” with “not,” and the
term “therewith” with “with the.”

472

For example, 17 CFR 240.17a-5(a)(5), (d)(3)(i)(B), and (d)(5) each refer to the “end of the fiscal year of
the broker or dealer.”

119

replace the words “annual audit reports” and “audit report,” respectively, with the words “annual
reports.” The Commission also is deleting an unnecessary citation to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of Rule
17a-5 that was previously included in paragraph (n)(2) of Rule 17a-5.

Background

The amendments to Rule 17a-5 that the Commission is adopting today will permit
carrying broker-dealers that either also are registered as investment advisers or maintain client
assets of an affiliated investment adviser and are subject to the internal control report
requirement in Rule 206(4)-2 to satisfy that requirement with a report prepared by the brokerdealer’s independent public accountant based on an examination of certain of the broker-dealer’s
statements in the compliance report.

Rule 206(4)-2 provides that a registered investment adviser is prohibited from
maintaining custody of client funds or securities unless a “qualified custodian” maintains those
funds and securities: (1) in a separate account for each client under that client’s name; or (2) in
accounts that contain only the investment adviser’s clients’ funds and securities, under the
investment adviser’s name as agent or trustee for the clients. 473 Under Rule 206(4)-2, only
banks, certain savings associations, registered broker-dealers, FCMs, and certain foreign
financial institutions may act as qualified custodians. 474
In addition, when an investment adviser or its related person maintains client funds and
securities as qualified custodian in connection with advisory services provided to clients, the
adviser annually must obtain, or receive from its related person, a written internal control report
473

See 17 CFR 275.206(4)-2(a)(1)(i)–(ii).

prepared by an independent public accountant registered with, and subject to regular inspection
by, the PCAOB. 475 This report must be supported by the independent public accountant’s
examination of the qualified custodian’s custody controls. 476
The Commission has issued guidance identifying the control objectives that should be
included in the scope of the internal control examination required under Rule 206(4)-2. 477 The
control objectives for the Rule 206(4)-2 examination are more general than the specific
operational requirements in the financial responsibility rules. 478 This approach allows different
types of qualified custodians (banks, certain savings associations, broker-dealers, FCMs, and
certain foreign financial institutions) to establish controls and procedures that meet the identified
control objectives in a manner that reflects differences in business models, regulatory
requirements, and other factors. 479
475

Id.

476

Rule 206(4)-2 provides that the internal control report must include an opinion of an independent public
accountant as to whether controls have been placed in operation as of a specific date, and are suitably
designed and are operating effectively to meet control objectives relating to custodial services, including
the safeguarding of funds and securities held by either the adviser or its related person on behalf of
advisory clients, during the year. The rule also requires that the accountant “verify that the funds and
securities are reconciled to a custodian other than [the adviser or its] related person.” See 17 CFR
275.206(4)-2.

Broker-Dealers Acting as Qualified Custodians under Rule 206(4)-2

Broker-dealers that also are registered as investment advisers may, acting in their
capacity as broker-dealers, maintain client securities and funds as qualified custodians in
connection with advisory services provided to clients. 480 As a result of being the adviser and
qualified custodian to its clients, under Rule 206(4)-2 these broker-dealers must obtain an
internal control report relating to the custody of those assets from an independent public
accountant that is registered with, and subject to regular inspection by, the PCAOB. In addition,
broker-dealers acting as qualified custodians also may maintain advisory client assets in
connection with advisory services provided by related or affiliated investment advisers. Rule
206(4)-2 requires such a broker-dealer to provide an internal control report to its related
investment adviser. 481

Proposal to Allow Report Based on Examination of Compliance
Report to Satisfy Rule 206(4)-2
i.

The Proposal

Broker-dealers that maintain custody of customer funds and securities are subject to
specific operational requirements in the financial responsibility rules with respect to handling
and accounting for customer assets. 482 The operational requirements of the financial
responsibility rules are consistent with the control objectives outlined in the Commission’s

480

The Commission staff has estimated that approximately 18% of FINRA-registered broker-dealers also are
registered as investment advisers with the Commission or with a state. See Commission staff, Study on
Investment Advisers and Broker-Dealers, as required by Section 913 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Jan. 2011).

481

See 17 CFR 275.206(4)-2(a)(6). Based on data collected from the Investment Adviser Registration
Depository as of August 2012, close to 200 investment advisers reported on Form ADV that client assets
were being held at a qualified custodian that was related to the adviser.

482

While Rule 15c3-1 prescribes broker-dealer net capital requirements, it also contains provisions relating to
custody. For example, a broker-dealer must take net capital charges for short security differences
unresolved after specifically enumerated timeframes. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(v)(A).

guidance on Rule 206(4)-2. 483 As a result of the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-5, the
Commission stated in the proposing release that a broker-dealer subject to an examination by an
independent public accountant of its compliance report that also acts as a qualified custodian for
itself as an investment adviser or for its related investment advisers under Rule 206(4)-2 would
be able to use the independent public accountant’s report resulting from the examination to
satisfy the internal control report requirement under Rule 206(4)-2. 484
ii.

Comments on the Proposal

The Commission received several comments regarding the proposal that the independent
public accountant’s report based on an examination of the compliance report would satisfy the
internal control report under Rule 206(4)-2. One commenter stated that it is “critically
important” that there be a single independent public accountant engagement of the custody
function at both the broker-dealer and investment adviser operations of any dually registered
entity (or of affiliated broker-dealers and investment advisers) and that this engagement use a
single, consistent standard for evaluating custody at both the broker-dealer and investment
adviser operations. 485 Two commenters noted that there are non-carrying broker-dealers that act
as qualified custodians under the Advisers Act and that these broker-dealers would not be subject
to the proposed compliance report requirements and, consequently, would not be able to use the
report of the independent public accountant covering the compliance report to satisfy the internal
control report requirement in Rule 206(4)-2 because the broker-dealers would be filing

exemption reports instead of compliance reports. 486 One commenter characterized this as an area
of redundancy that could be eliminated by allowing an accountant’s review of a non-carrying
broker-dealer’s transmittal procedures to be “recognized by the Investment Adviser regulatory
regime promulgated by the Commission.” 487
In addition, two commenters asked for clarification regarding the interaction of the
proposed compliance report requirements with the requirement in Rule 206(4)-2 that investment
advisers undergo an annual surprise examination by an independent accountant to verify
customer funds and securities held in custody. 488 Specifically, both asked that the Commission
clarify whether the independent public accountant performing the surprise examination would be
able to place reliance on the proposed compliance report and related compliance examination to
determine the nature and extent of the procedures for the surprise examination. 489 One of the
commenters also asked that, if the Commission clarifies that the independent public accountant
performing the surprise examination is expected to rely on the proposed compliance report
requirements, what factors should the independent public accountant consider, given that the
report based on an examination of the compliance report would not be required to be completed
until 60 days after the fiscal year end while the surprise examination may occur at any time. 490

funds and securities of which an investment adviser has custody must be verified by actual examination at
least once during each calendar year by an independent public accountant, pursuant to a written agreement
between the investment adviser and the accountant, at a time that is chosen by the accountant without prior
notice or announcement to the investment adviser and that is irregular from year to year. See 17 CFR

Adoption of Proposal Relating to Rule 206(4)-2

As discussed above, under today’s amendments, a carrying broker-dealer must prepare,
and file with the Commission and its DEA, a compliance report on, among other things, its
Internal Control Over Compliance, and must file with the compliance report a report prepared by
its independent public accountant based on an examination of the compliance report. 491 As a
result of the amendments to Rule 17a-5, the Commission has determined that the independent
public accountant’s report based on an examination of the compliance report will satisfy the
internal control report requirement under Rule 206(4)-2 because the operational requirements of
the financial responsibility rules are consistent with the control objectives outlined in the
Commission’s guidance on Rule 206(4)-2. 492 For example, to be able to include a statement that
the broker-dealer has established and maintained Internal Control Over Compliance (which is
defined as internal controls that have the objective of providing the broker-dealer with
reasonable assurance that non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules will be
prevented or detected on a timely basis), 493 a broker-dealer’s internal control over compliance
with Rule 17a-13 will result in controls over the safeguarding of securities from loss or
misappropriation and the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of the securities reconciliation
process. 494 To make a similar statement with respect to the Account Statement Rules, a broker-

491

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(3) and (g)(2)(i).

492

See Commission Guidance Regarding Independent Public Accountant Engagements Performed Pursuant to
Rule 206(4)-2 Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 75 FR at 1494; Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at
37579–37580. As discussed above in section II.D.3. of this release, the independent public accountant
must examine the compliance report in accordance with attestation standards promulgated by the PCAOB.
Consequently, the PCAOB’s attestation standards are integral to the Commission’s determination that the
independent public accountant’s report based on an examination of the compliance report satisfies the
internal control report requirement under Rule 206(4)-2. The Commission could revisit this determination
if the PCAOB’s attestation standards do not support the determination.

493

See paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A)(1) and (d)(3)(ii) of Rule 17a-5.

494

See 17 CFR 240.17a-13. As discussed above in section II.D.3. of this release, the PCAOB proposed
attestation standards related to the compliance report. The PCAOB’s proposed attestation standards

125

dealer would of necessity have internal controls over compliance with the Account Statement
Rules designed to ensure that customers receive complete, accurate, and timely information
concerning securities positions and other assets held in their accounts. 495 A statement that the
broker-dealer has established and maintained Internal Control Over Compliance would cover
these and other internal controls over compliance with the financial responsibility rules and
would be examined by the independent public accountant during the examination of the
compliance report.
As commenters noted, broker-dealers that are not carrying broker-dealers are not subject
to the compliance report requirements and, therefore, those broker-dealers must comply with the
internal control report requirement in Rule 206(4)-2 if they are subject to that requirement. The
exemption report is not redundant of the internal control report requirement in Rule 206(4)-2
because, among other things, the scope of the required statements included in a broker-dealer’s
exemption report is different than the scope of the internal control report requirement in Rule
206(4)-2. 496
As noted above, commenters also asked whether the accountant would be able to place
reliance on the proposed compliance report and related examination of the compliance report to

include a requirement that the independent public accountant must perform procedures to obtain evidence
about the existence of customer funds or securities held for customers, e.g., confirmation of customer
security positions directly with depositories and clearing organizations. See PCAOB Proposing Release
app. 1, at ¶ 26. This procedure would be consistent with the tests of the qualified custodian’s reconciliation
that the Commission specified in the guidance on Rule 206(4)-2. See Commission Guidance Regarding
Independent Public Accountant Engagements Performed Pursuant to Rule 206(4)-2 Under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, 75 FR 1494.
495

See, e.g., CBOE Rule 9.12; NASD Rule 2340. See also Commission Guidance Regarding Independent
Public Accountant Engagements Performed Pursuant to Rule 206(4)-2 Under the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940, Advisers Act Release No. 2969 (Dec. 30, 2009), 75 FR 1494 (Jan. 11, 2010), which describes as a
control objective for qualified custodians (including broker-dealer qualified custodians) that account
statements reflecting cash and security positions are provided to clients in a complete, accurate and timely
manner.

determine the nature and extent of the procedures for the surprise examination. PCAOB
attestation standards require an independent public accountant “to obtain an understanding of
internal control over compliance sufficient to plan the engagement and to assess control risk for
compliance with specified requirements.” 497 The Commission agrees that the independent public
accountant’s understanding of internal controls related to custody at the broker-dealer acting as a
qualified custodian, as well as other facts and circumstances, may affect the nature and extent of
procedures performed for the annual surprise examination. 498 The Commission has provided
interpretive guidance on the relationship between the annual surprise examination and the
internal control report for engagements performed pursuant to Rule 206(4)-2. 499
III.

ACCESS TO ACCOUNTANT AND AUDIT DOCUMENTATION
The Commission proposed amending paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-5 to require that each

clearing broker-dealer 500 include a representation in its statement regarding its independent
public accountant that the broker-dealer agrees to allow Commission and DEA examination staff
to review the audit documentation associated with its annual audit reports required under Rule
17a-5 and to allow its independent public accountant to discuss findings relating to the audit
reports with Commission and DEA examination staff if requested for the purposes of an

497

See PCAOB Interim Attestation Standard, AT Section 601. AT Section 601 requires an independent public
accountant “to obtain an understanding of internal control over compliance sufficient to plan the
engagement and to assess control risk for compliance with specified requirements. In planning the
examination, such knowledge should be used to identify types of potential non-compliance, to consider
factors that affect the risk of material noncompliance, and to design appropriate tests of compliance.” Id. at

500

For the purpose of this release, a “clearing broker-dealer” is a broker-dealer that clears transactions or
carries customer accounts.

127

examination of the broker-dealer. 501 This proposed requirement was intended to facilitate
examinations of clearing broker-dealers by Commission and DEA examination staff. 502 Access
to information obtained from audit documentation and discussions with a clearing brokerdealer’s independent public accountant would enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of
Commission and DEA examinations by providing examiners with access to additional relevant
information to plan their examinations. 503
The Commission proposed to limit this requirement to clearing broker-dealers, which
generally have more complex business operations than non-carrying firms. 504 Thus, access to
accountants and audit documentation was considered of substantially greater value when
preparing for regulatory examinations of these types of broker-dealers, as compared to firms with
more limited business models.
To facilitate Commission and DEA examination staff access to a clearing broker-dealer’s
independent public accountant and the accountant’s audit documentation, the Commission
proposed amending paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-5 to require that a clearing broker-dealer’s
notice designating its independent public accountant include, among other things,
representations: (1) that the broker-dealer agrees to allow representatives of the Commission or
the broker-dealer’s DEA, if requested for purposes of an examination of the broker-dealer, to
review the documentation associated with the reports of its independent public accountant
prepared pursuant to paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-5; and (2) that the broker-dealer agrees to permit

503

For example, where an independent public accountant has performed extensive testing of a carrying brokerdealer’s custody of funds and securities by confirming holdings at custodians and sub-custodians,
examiners could focus their efforts on other matters that had not been the subject of prior testing and
review.

its independent public accountant to discuss with representatives of the Commission and the
DEA, if requested for the purposes of an examination of the broker-dealer, the findings
associated with the reports of the accountant prepared pursuant to paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-5. 505
Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of Rule 17a-5 provided that a broker-dealer that does not clear
transactions or carry customer accounts would not be required to include these representations in
its notice. 506
Eight commenters addressed the proposed changes to paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-5. 507
Generally, commenters requested that the Commission do one or more of the following: (1)
clarify the type of documentation that the Commission and DEA examiners would seek to
access; 508 (2) grant confidential treatment to documentation obtained by the Commission under
this provision; 509 (3) clarify the process by which Commission and DEA examiners would seek
access to a broker-dealer’s independent public accountant and its audit documentation; 510 and (4)
limit the use of information and documentation obtained from a broker-dealer’s independent
public accountant. 511 In addition, one commenter raised general concerns that providing
Commission and DEA examiners with access to a broker-dealer’s auditor and audit
documentation will discourage communications between broker-dealers and their auditors and
may require auditors to produce documentation protected by attorney-client and/or accountant-

client privilege. 512 Finally, one commenter asserted that it is reasonable for securities regulators
to be able to validate any concerns promptly with a broker-dealer’s accountant. 513
In response to requests for clarity as to the types of audit documentation that Commission
and DEA examiners would seek to access under the proposal, the Commission revised proposed
paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(F) of Rule 17a-5 to clarify that “audit documentation” has the meaning
established by PCAOB standards. 514 This revision, which was specifically suggested by two
commenters, 515 is not intended to alter an independent public accountant’s obligations with
respect to audit documentation; rather, it is intended to clarify the types of audit documentation
that the Commission and DEA examiners may ask to review in connection with a broker-dealer
examination.
In response to questions regarding the process by which Commission and DEA
examiners might seek to access audit documentation, the Commission agrees with a commenter
that suggested that these requests be in writing because that will provide independent public
accountants with a record of requests for information and specify the documentation the
Commission or DEA examination staff would like to access. 516 Therefore, the Commission has

512

See CAI Letter.

513

See CFP Letter.

514

PCAOB Auditing Standard 3 defines “Audit documentation” as the “written record of the basis for the
auditor’s conclusions that provides the support for the auditor’s representations, whether those
representations are contained in the auditor’s report or otherwise. Audit documentation also facilitates the
planning, performance, and supervision of the engagement, and is the basis for the review of the quality of
the work because it provides the reviewer with written documentation of the evidence supporting the
auditor’s significant conclusions. Among other things, audit documentation includes records of the
planning and performance of the work, the procedures performed, evidence obtained, and conclusions
reached by the auditor. Audit documentation also may be referred to as work papers or working papers.”

515

See CAQ Letter; KPMG Letter.

516

See KPMG Letter. See also Deloitte Letter, which suggests that Commission and DEA examiners first
provide notice to the broker-dealer, in writing, of plans to request access to the broker-dealer’s audit
documentation and then make a written request to the accountant. Although, in practice, Commission and
DEA examiners may provide advance or simultaneous notice to a broker-dealer of requests to access audit
documentation from the broker-dealer’s accountant, the Commission is not adopting a requirement that

130

modified the rule from the proposal to provide that a request to a broker-dealer’s independent
public accountant for the accountant to discuss audit findings or for access to audit
documentation be made in writing.
Independent public accountants can seek to protect information obtained by examiners
from being disclosed to Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) requestors by specifically
requesting confidential treatment of audit documentation following the process described in Rule
83 of the Commission’s Rules on Information and Requests. 517 The Commission anticipates that
it will accord confidential treatment to such documents to the extent permitted by law. 518
Two commenters requested that the Commission clarify the intended use of information
and documents obtained from an independent public accountant. 519 One recommended that the
Commission clarify that the information obtained from the independent public accountant not be
used for any purpose other than in connection with a regulatory examination of the brokerdealer. 520 The other suggested that the rule text state that the requests for information should be
solely for the purposes of conducting a regulatory examination of the clearing broker-dealer. 521
The Commission does not believe that it is necessary to modify the proposed rule text in
response to these comments. The Commission stated that it did not propose that examiners
would use the requested information for the purpose of inspecting independent public
examiners so notify broker-dealers of such requests. This additional notification would likely delay an
examiner’s ability to gain access to the broker-dealer’s audit documentation and is not necessary given the
broker-dealer’s prior consent. In addition, a broker-dealer can request that its accountant provide notice
when examiners request audit documentation, and, expects that, in practice, accountants will provide such
notice. See also E&Y Letter.
517

17 CFR 200.83. Generally, persons who submit information to the Commission may request that the
Commission accord confidential treatment to the information for any reason permitted by federal law.

518

The Commission believes that this audit documentation likely would fall under exemptions (b)(8) and/or
(b)(4) of FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 522(b)(8); 5 U.S.C. 522(b)(4).

accountants. 522 As the Commission stated in the proposing release, the purpose of this access
requirement is to enhance and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Commission and DEA
examinations of broker-dealers. 523 The PCAOB is responsible for inspections of independent
public accountants that audit broker-dealers. 524 In response to these comments, the Commission
reiterates its intention, as stated in the proposing release, that any requests for audit
documentation under this provision would be made exclusively in connection with conducting a
regulatory examination of a broker-dealer. 525
One commenter stated that Commission and DEA examiners should be limited to
inspecting audit documentation relating to a broker-dealer in the offices of the broker-dealer’s
independent public accountant and that the broker-dealer should be permitted to be present
during conversations between Commission or DEA staff and the accountant. 526 The
Commission has considered these comments and decided not to modify the proposal in response
to these comments. However, Commission and DEA examiners may exercise discretion in
determining whether to review audit documentation in the offices of the broker-dealer’s
accountant and whether to permit the broker-dealer to be present during conversations with the
accountant. This commenter also requested that the Commission establish a process by which
broker-dealers can object to overly broad or unduly burdensome requests. 527 The rule will not be
modified in response to this comment and the Commission recommends that any concerns
regarding the scope of audit documentation requests be directed to the examiner from whom the

request was received. The examiner will consider the concerns and determine whether and how
to limit the scope of the audit documentation request, if appropriate. The independent public
accountant also can express concerns to senior examination staff if the scope of the audit
documentation request remains a concern after discussions with the examiner.
Another commenter stated that the Commission must be responsible for returning all
audit work papers that it receives for purposes of an examination of the broker-dealer to either
the broker-dealer or its accountant. 528 The purpose of requesting access to audit documentation
is to assist examiners in conducting a regulatory examination of the clearing broker-dealer.
Upon completion of the examination, if the Commission and DEA, and any offices and divisions
thereof, no longer need the audit documentation, the Commission and DEA will, upon the
request of the independent public accountant and in the absence of unusual circumstances, return
audit documentation to the independent public accountant or the broker-dealer within a
reasonable time after the examination is complete.
One commenter stated that, if adopted, this requirement will discourage or “chill”
communications between a broker-dealer and its auditor because “the broker-dealer knows that
regardless of the nature of an auditing issue and how it was discovered . . . it cannot freely seek
advice from, or discuss the issue openly with[] the auditor[] without fear of the auditor
misunderstanding the broker-dealer’s response or simply drawing a conclusion that a brokerdealer’s questions indicate the broker-dealer’s lack of knowledge or admission of an issue.” 529
Presumably, this “chilling effect” would result from a broker-dealer’s desire to avoid the creation
of audit documentation memorializing misunderstandings and miscommunications, which, when
accessed by Commission and DEA examiners, could result in regulatory scrutiny. The
528

See CAI Letter.

529

Id.

133

Commission is not persuaded by this comment; while it is possible for miscommunications to
occur between representatives of a broker-dealer and its auditor, potential misunderstandings or
miscommunications should not limit the ability of the Commission or a DEA to have access to
audit documentation or a broker-dealer’s independent public accountant. Further, to the extent a
misunderstanding or miscommunication between a broker-dealer and its accountant is reflected
in the accountant’s audit documentation relating to the broker-dealer, the broker-dealer could
clarify the nature of the misunderstanding or miscommunication to examiners and explain how it
was rectified if such clarification and rectification is not already described in subsequent audit
documentation.
The same commenter also asserted that the requirement that broker-dealers allow
regulators to access audit documentation may, in effect, require auditors to produce
documentation protected by attorney-client privilege or accountant-client privilege. 530 The rule
language providing Commission and DEA examiners with access to a broker-dealer’s auditor
and audit documentation is not designed to affect the circumstances in which privilege can be
asserted. Any claims of privilege can be addressed on a case-by-case basis by appropriate
Commission and DEA staff as those claims arise.
IV.

FORM CUSTODY
A.

Background

Proposed Form Custody was comprised of nine line items (each, an “Item”) designed to
elicit information about a broker-dealer’s custodial activities. 531 As is discussed below, several
Items on the proposed form contained multiple questions, and some required the completion of

530

531

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37584–37592.

134

charts and the disclosure of custody-related information specific to the broker-dealer completing
the form. 532
The Commission received nine comment letters on proposed Form Custody. 533 While
commenters generally supported the proposed form, the Commission received several comments
on the timing of, exemptions from, and the compliance date for filing the form and whether a
broker-dealer also would be required to file an accountant’s attestation covering the form. 534 In
addition, several commenters suggested that the Commission make certain revisions to the form
and address certain technical interpretative questions. 535 One commenter, who agreed “in
concept” that Form Custody is appropriate for custodial broker-dealers, also stated that the
aggregate cost estimate of the proposed form was “staggering.” 536
The Commission is adopting the requirement that broker-dealers file Form Custody with
their DEAs, subject to modifications that, in part, respond to issues raised by commenters. A
description of the comments on the proposed process for filing Form Custody is set forth below
in section IV.B. of this release, together with a discussion of the final rule amendments that the
Commission is adopting today. A description of the comments on the proposed form is set forth

Filing of Form Custody
1.

Requirement to File Form Custody with FOCUS Reports

Under paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-5, a broker-dealer is required to file periodic FOCUS
Reports with the Commission and the broker-dealer’s DEA. 537 In the proposing release, the
Commission proposed adding paragraph (a)(5) to Rule 17a-5 to require the filing of Form
Custody, which was designed to elicit information concerning whether a broker-dealer
maintained custody of customer and non-customer assets, and, if so, how such assets were
maintained. 538 Under this proposed amendment, a broker-dealer would be required to file Form
Custody with its DEA at the same time it filed its periodic FOCUS Report with its DEA under
paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-5. 539 The DEA, in turn, would be required to maintain the information
obtained through the filing of Form Custody and to transmit such information to the Commission
at such time as it transmits FOCUS Report data to the Commission under paragraph (a)(4) of
Rule 17a-5. 540
A broker-dealer’s FOCUS Report provides the Commission and a broker-dealer’s DEA
with information relating to the broker-dealer’s financial and operational condition but does not

537

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(a); 17 CFR 249.617. FOCUS Reports are one of the primary means of monitoring
the financial and operational condition of broker-dealers and enforcing the broker-dealer financial
responsibility rules. The completed forms also are used to determine which firms are engaged in various
securities-related activities and how economic events and government policies might affect various
segments of the securities industry. The FOCUS Report was designed to eliminate overlapping regulatory
reports required by various SROs and the Commission and to reduce reporting burdens as much as
possible. FOCUS Reports and Form Custody are deemed confidential under paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17a5.

538

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37592. For purposes of Form Custody, the term “customer” means a
person that is a “customer” for purposes of Rule 15c3-3(a), and a “non-customer” means a person other
than a “customer” as that term is defined in Rule 15c3-3(a). See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a); FINRA,

solicit detailed information on how a broker-dealer maintains custody of assets. 541 Proposed
Form Custody was intended to provide additional information about a broker-dealer’s custodial
activities and to make it easier for examiners to identify risks and possible violations of laws and
regulations concerning the broker-dealer’s custody of assets. 542 If, upon reviewing Form
Custody, regulatory authorities were to become aware of inconsistencies or other red flags in
information contained on the form, they could initiate a more focused and detailed analysis of the
broker-dealer’s custodial activities. Such an analysis could, in turn, identify potential abuses
related to customer assets. Moreover, proposed Form Custody was intended to expedite the
examination of a broker-dealer’s custodial activities and reduce examination costs, as examiners
would no longer need to request basic custody-related information already disclosed on the
form. 543
The Commission proposed that a broker-dealer file Form Custody with its DEA within
17 business days after the end of each calendar quarter and within 17 business days after the date
selected for the broker-dealer’s annual report where that date was other than the end of a
calendar quarter. 544 The Commission received one comment regarding proposed paragraph
(a)(5) of Rule 17a-5, which supported the Commission’s proposal as to when a broker-dealer
should be required to file Form Custody. 545
The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17a-5 substantially as proposed.
As to when a broker-dealer must file its Form Custody with its DEA, the Commission is
adopting its proposal that a broker-dealer file Form Custody with its DEA within 17 business

days after the end of each calendar quarter. 546 However, for year end filings of Form Custody by
a broker-dealer that has selected a fiscal year end date that is not the end of a calendar year, the
Commission has modified its proposal to provide that a broker-dealer also must file Form
Custody with its DEA within 17 business days after the end of the broker-dealer’s fiscal year. 547
The Commission did not receive any comments relating to when DEAs are required to
transmit Form Custody information to the Commission and is adopting this requirement as
proposed.
2.

Requests for Exemption from Filing Form Custody

One commenter recommended that the Commission include a provision in Rule 17a-5
that would enable the Commission to exempt broker-dealers from the requirement to file Form
Custody if the Commission determined that receiving the form for a particular firm, or type of
firm, would serve no useful purpose. 548 For example, the commenter stated that no useful
purpose would be served by receiving Form Custody from a firm that has no customer or noncustomer accounts. 549
The Commission intends for all broker-dealers to file Form Custody without exception.
The Commission is concerned about circumstances where broker-dealers falsely represent to
regulators and others that they do not handle funds or securities or issue trade confirmations or
account statements. One of the purposes of Form Custody is to assist Commission and DEA

546

See paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17a-5.

547

Id. Consistent with the proposal, a broker-dealer must file Form Custody with its DEA at the same time
that the broker-dealer files its FOCUS Report with its DEA. However, since the final rule changes the date
for the filing of the year end FOCUS Report to “within 17 business days after the end of the fiscal year
where that date is not the end of a calendar quarter,” the deadline for the year end filing of Form Custody is
correspondingly changed to “within 17 business days after the end of the fiscal year of the broker or dealer
where that date is not the end of a calendar quarter.”

548

examiners in identifying potential misrepresentations relating to broker-dealers’ custody of
assets. Through Form Custody, examiners will be in a position to better understand a brokerdealer’s custody profile and identify custody-related violations and misconduct. For example, if
a broker-dealer represents on Form Custody that it does not issue account statements, but an
examiner receives an account statement issued by the broker-dealer (e.g., in connection with a
customer complaint or in the course of an examination of the broker-dealer), the examiner will
be able to react more quickly to the misrepresentation. Further, the requirements to file the form
will promote greater focus and attention to custody practices by requiring that broker-dealers
make specific representations in this regard.
In addition, although the Commission does not currently contemplate any circumstance in
which it would exempt a broker-dealer from having to file Form Custody, if the Commission
subsequently determines that it is appropriate to exempt a broker-dealer, or type of broker-dealer,
from such requirements, the Commission can act under existing authority. In particular, under
section 36 of the Exchange Act, the Commission, by rule, regulation, or order, may exempt any
person, or any class or classes of persons, from any rule under the Exchange Act to the extent
that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and is consistent with the
protection of investors. 550
Nonetheless, the Commission understands that a number of Items on Form Custody may
not apply to certain types of broker-dealers (e.g., broker-dealers that do not carry customer, noncustomer, or proprietary securities accounts) and has modified the form’s instructions to make
clear that questions on the form that cannot be answered because the broker-dealer does not

550

139

engage in a particular activity do not need to be answered. 551
3.

Attest Engagement Not Required for Form Custody

In response to a question posed by the Commission in the proposing release, one
commenter stated that the Commission should not require a broker-dealer to engage a PCAOBregistered independent public accountant to audit Form Custody. 552 This commenter stated that
an audit of Form Custody is not necessary since the intent of the form is to gather custodyrelated information, which in some cases may not be derived from the broker-dealer’s books and
records. 553 This commenter also does not believe that the benefits of performing an audit of the
information included on Form Custody would outweigh the costs or that an audit is necessary for
the Commission to achieve its principal objective of using the information in the examination of
a broker-dealer’s custody activities. 554
The Commission did not propose to require that a broker-dealer engage an independent
public accountant to review Form Custody, and agrees that such a requirement should not be
imposed. Accordingly, under today’s amendments, broker-dealers are not required to enter into
an attestation engagement with an independent public accountant for purposes of reviewing
Form Custody.

Form Custody

As is discussed above, proposed Form Custody was comprised of nine Items designed to
elicit information about a broker-dealer’s custodial activities. Set forth below is a description of
each of the Items.

1.

Item 1 – Accounts Introduced on a Fully Disclosed Basis

Item 1 consists of two subparts. Item 1.A, as proposed, would have elicited information
concerning whether the broker-dealer introduced customer accounts to another broker-dealer on
a fully disclosed basis by requiring the broker-dealer to check the appropriate “Yes” or “No”
box. 555 Item 1.B of Form Custody would require broker-dealers that check “Yes” on Item 1.A to
identify each broker-dealer to which customer accounts are introduced on a fully disclosed
basis. 556 The Commission did not receive any comments on Item 1.A or 1.B and is adopting this
Item as proposed.
As is discussed in the proposing release, many broker-dealers enter into agreements
(“carrying agreements”) with another broker-dealer in which the two firms allocate certain
responsibilities with respect to the handling of accounts. 557 These carrying agreements are
governed by applicable SRO rules, which require a broker-dealer entering into a carrying
agreement to allocate certain responsibilities associated with introduced accounts. 558
Typically, under a carrying agreement, one broker-dealer (“introducing broker-dealer”)
agrees to act as the customer’s account representative (e.g., by providing the customer with
account opening documents, ascertaining the customer’s investment objectives, and making
investment recommendations). The carrying broker-dealer typically agrees to receive and hold
the customer’s cash and securities, clear transactions, make and retain records relating to the
transactions and the receipt and holding of assets, and extend credit to the customer in
connection with the customer’s securities transactions.
555

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37585. See AICPA Broker-Dealer Audit Guide glossary (defining the
term fully disclosed basis as a “situation in which a nonclearing broker introduces a customer to a clearing
broker and the customer’s name and statement are carried by, and disclosed to, that clearing broker.”).

Id.

558

See, e.g., FINRA Rule 4311.

141

Item 1.A, as adopted, elicits information concerning whether the broker-dealer introduces
customer accounts to another broker-dealer on a fully disclosed basis, rather than asking whether
the broker-dealer is an “introducing broker-dealer.” The Commission is presenting the question
in this manner because some broker-dealers operate as carrying broker-dealers (i.e., they hold
cash and securities) for one group of customers but also introduce the accounts of a second group
of customers on a fully disclosed basis to another broker-dealer. For example, a broker-dealer
may incur the capital expense and cost of acting as a carrying broker-dealer for certain products
(e.g., equities) but not for other products (e.g., options). In this case, the firm operates as a
hybrid introducing/carrying broker-dealer by introducing on a fully disclosed basis to a carrying
broker-dealer those customers that trade securities for which the broker-dealer is not prepared to
provide a full range of services. Broker-dealers also may introduce customer accounts on an
omnibus basis, as is discussed below in section IV.C.2. of this release.
If the broker-dealer answers Item 1.A by checking the “Yes” box, the broker-dealer will
be required under Item 1.B to identify each broker-dealer to which customer accounts are
introduced on a fully disclosed basis. The carrying broker-dealer in such an arrangement
maintains the cash and securities of the introduced customers and is therefore obligated to return
cash and securities to the introduced customers. Commission and DEA examiners could use the
identification information provided by a broker-dealer in response to Item 1.B to confirm the
existence of an introducing/carrying relationship.
2.

Item 2 – Accounts Introduced on an Omnibus Basis

Item 2 of Form Custody consists of two subparts. Item 2.A, as proposed, would have
elicited information concerning whether the broker-dealer introduced customer accounts to
another broker-dealer on an omnibus basis by requiring the broker-dealer to check the

142

appropriate “Yes” or “No” box. 559 Item 2.B, as proposed, would require a broker-dealer that
checks “Yes” in response to Item 2.A to identify each broker-dealer to which customer accounts
are introduced on an omnibus basis. 560 The Commission did not receive any comments on Items
2.A or 2.B and is adopting this Item as proposed.
An omnibus account is an account carried and cleared by another broker-dealer that
contains accounts of undisclosed customers on a commingled basis and that are carried
individually on the books of the broker-dealer introducing the accounts. 561 Disclosure of this
information is important because when a broker-dealer introduces customer accounts to another
broker-dealer on an omnibus basis, the introducing broker-dealer (in addition to the brokerdealer carrying the omnibus account) is considered to be a carrying broker-dealer with respect to
those accounts under the Commission’s broker-dealer financial responsibility rules. 562 Thus, in
these arrangements, the broker-dealer introducing the omnibus account is obligated to return
cash and securities in the account to customers. 563
If the broker-dealer checks the “Yes” box in Item 2.A, it will be required to identify in
Item 2.B each broker-dealer to which accounts are introduced on an omnibus basis. Commission
and DEA examiners could use this information to confirm whether the cash and securities
introduced to the carrying broker-dealer are in fact being held in an omnibus account at the
carrying broker-dealer and that the books and records of the broker-dealer that introduced the
customer accounts to the carrying broker-dealer reflect the correct amounts of customer cash and

Item 3 – Carrying Broker-Dealers

Item 3 of Form Custody, as proposed, would have elicited information concerning how a
carrying broker-dealer held cash and securities. 564 Proposed Item 3 was comprised of five
subparts, as described below. 565 Two commenters specifically addressed this Item, in particular
regarding subparts 3.C., 3.D, and 3.E, which also are discussed below. 566
i.

Items 3.A and 3.B

The first question of Item 3 of proposed Form Custody – Item 3.A – would have elicited
information concerning whether the broker-dealer carried securities accounts for customers by
requiring the broker-dealer to check the appropriate “Yes” or “No” box. 567 The General
Instructions to Form Custody specify that the term “customer” as used in the Form means a
“customer” as defined in Rule 15c3-3.
The next question of Item 3 – Item 3.B – would have elicited information concerning
whether the broker-dealer carried securities accounts for persons that are not “customers” under
the definition in Rule 15c3-3. 568 For example, under Rule 15c3-3, persons that are not
“customers” include an accountholder that is a general partner, director, or principal officer of
the carrying broker-dealer, and accountholders that are themselves broker-dealers. 569 The
Commission did not receive any comments on Item 3.A or 3.B and is adopting these questions as
proposed.

Item 3.C
a.

Background

Item 3.C, as proposed, would have required the broker-dealer to identify in three charts
the types of locations where it held securities and the frequency with which it performed
reconciliations between the information on its stock record and information on the records of
those locations. 570 Each of these charts, which are set forth in Items 3.C.i through 3.C.iii, is
discussed in more detail below.
b.

General Comments to Item 3.C

One commenter suggested that it would be helpful to require the broker-dealer to disclose
the identities of specific entities at which it custodies securities. 571 This commenter stated that
such disclosure would allow regulators to identify potential discrepancies more easily, as well as
changes in custody relationships that may warrant further investigations. 572
The Commission has considered this suggestion and determined that providing the
identities of a broker-dealer’s custodians instead of the types of locations would significantly
increase the burden on broker-dealers in preparing the form, which is intended to be a starting
point for Commission and DEA examiners in assessing a broker-dealer’s compliance with its
custody requirements. Large broker-dealers often maintain custody of customers’ securities in
many locations, which can total in the hundreds, particularly if the broker-dealer carries a large
number of uncertificated investments for customers, such as alternative investments. Requiring
broker-dealers to disclose this level of detail on Form Custody could significantly increase the
costs of preparing the form for a number of broker-dealers. Although the Commission
570

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37586–37587.

571

See CFP Letter.

572

Id.

145

acknowledges that requiring the additional information the commenter suggested would enhance
the ability of regulators to identify discrepancies, the Commission believes that the information
on Form Custody provides sufficient information to allow examiners to determine whether it is
appropriate to seek additional information from a particular broker-dealer. To the extent a
Commission or DEA examiner believes that it is appropriate to obtain this information from a
particular broker-dealer, the examiner could do so in a document request to that firm, a method
that the Commission expects would be less costly than requiring this information from all
broker-dealers on Form Custody. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to require
that broker-dealers identify on the form the specific identities of all of their custodians.
Another commenter to Item 3.C requested that the Commission clarify the distinction
between “locations where the broker-dealer holds securities directly in the name of the brokerdealer” and “locations where the broker-dealer holds securities only through an intermediary.” 573
In making this distinction, the Commission intended to distinguish between locations that are
aware of the identity of the broker-dealer and act directly upon the broker-dealer’s instructions
and locations that are not aware of the identity of the broker-dealer or that will not act on
instructions directly from the broker-dealer. In the latter scenario, the location holding securities
for the broker-dealer would act only on instructions relating to the broker-dealer’s securities
from the broker-dealer’s intermediary. The Commission has modified the instructions to Item
3.C of Form Custody to reflect this clarification.
c.

Item 3.C.i

The first chart in Item 3.C – set forth in Item 3.C.i – identifies the most common
locations where broker-dealers hold securities. Many of the locations identified on the first

573

See SIFMA Letter.

146

chart, and described below, are locations deemed to be satisfactory control locations under
paragraph (c) of Rule 15c3-3. 574 The Commission did not receive any comments on Item 3.C.i
of proposed Form Custody and is adopting it as proposed.
The first location identified in the chart is the broker-dealer’s vault. Broker-dealers
primarily hold securities in fungible bulk at other institutions. In some cases, however, brokerdealers may physically hold securities certificates (e.g., in the case of restricted securities).
The second location identified in the chart is another U.S. registered broker-dealer. For
example, a broker-dealer may hold customers’ foreign securities at another U.S. broker-dealer, or
may hold securities in an omnibus account at another broker-dealer.
The third and fourth locations identified in the chart are the Depository Trust Company
and the Options Clearing Corporation. These are the two most common securities clearing and
depository organizations for equities and options in the U.S. and, consequently, are identified by
name rather than by type of location.
The fifth location identified in the chart is a U.S. bank. Broker-dealers may have
arrangements with U.S. banks to receive and hold securities for the accounts of the brokerdealer’s customers and non-customers, as well as for the broker-dealer’s own account.
Obtaining information about a broker-dealer’s relationships with U.S. banks could enable
examiners to test and confirm the accuracy of the broker-dealer’s representations on Form
Custody (i.e., that a U.S. bank holds securities for the broker-dealer), and, in addition, facilitate
the collection of information regarding the relationship between the broker-dealer and the bank.
For instance, customer fully paid and excess margin securities must be in the possession or
control of the broker-dealer and therefore cannot be pledged as collateral for a loan to the broker-

574

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(c).

147

dealer, among other things, and customer margin securities may not be commingled with
proprietary securities that are pledged as collateral for a bank loan. Form Custody could, for
example, lead examiners to seek account statements and documentation governing the brokerdealer’s relationship with the U.S. bank to ensure customer fully paid and excess margin
securities are not pledged as collateral for a loan to the broker-dealer.
The sixth location identified in the chart is the transfer agent of an open-end investment
management company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (i.e., a mutual
fund). Generally, mutual funds issue securities only in book-entry form. This means that the
ownership of securities is not reflected on a certificate that can be transferred but rather through a
journal entry on the books of the issuer maintained by the issuer’s transfer agent. A brokerdealer that holds mutual funds for customers generally holds them in the broker-dealer’s name on
the books of the mutual fund.
d.

Item 3.C.ii

The second chart in Item 3.C – set forth in Item 3.C.ii – is intended to capture all other
types of U.S. locations where a broker-dealer may hold securities that are not specified in the
chart included in Item 3.C.i. This category would include, for example, securities held in bookentry form by the issuer of the securities or the issuer’s transfer agent. A broker-dealer that holds
securities at such locations must list the types of locations in the spaces provided in the chart and
indicate the frequency with which the broker-dealer performs asset reconciliations with those
locations. The Commission did not receive any comments on Item 3.C.ii of proposed Form
Custody and is adopting it as proposed.

148

e.

Item 3.C.iii

The third chart in Item 3.C – set forth in Item 3.C.iii – pertains to foreign locations where
the broker-dealer maintains securities. Under the proposal, the Commission did not list
categories of foreign locations because terminology used to identify certain locations may differ
by jurisdiction. 575 For example, in some foreign jurisdictions, banks may operate a securities
business, making it difficult to classify whether securities are held at a bank or a broker-dealer.
A broker-dealer that holds securities in a foreign location must list the types of foreign locations
where it maintains securities in the spaces provided in the chart and indicate the frequency with
which reconciliations are performed with the location. The Commission did not receive any
comments on Item 3.C.iii of proposed Form Custody and is adopting it as proposed.
iii.

Items 3.D and 3.E

Items 3.D and 3.E of proposed Form Custody each contained three identical subparts
(discussed in more detail below) designed to elicit information about the types and amounts of
securities and cash the broker-dealer held, whether those securities were recorded on the brokerdealer’s stock record and, if not, why they were not recorded, and where the broker-dealer held
free credit balances. 576 The General Instructions to proposed Form Custody defined “free credit
balances” as liabilities of a broker-dealer to customers or non-customers which are subject to
immediate cash payment to customers or non-customers on demand, whether resulting from
sales of securities, dividends, interest, deposits, or otherwise. 577
The difference between proposed Item 3.D and proposed Item 3.E is that the former

575

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37587.

576

Id. at 37587–37589.

577

This definition is similar to the definition of the term free credit balance in Rule 15c3-3, except that the
definition in the rule is limited to liabilities to customers whereas the definition in the Form contemplates
liabilities to customers and non-customers. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(8).

149

would have elicited information with respect to securities and free credit balances held for the
accounts of customers, whereas the latter would have elicited information with respect to
securities and free credit balances held for the accounts of persons who are not customers. 578
Accordingly, the proposed form asked two sets of identical questions to elicit information about
each category of accountholder – customer and non-customer. 579
a.

Items 3.D.i and 3.E.i

Items 3.D.i and 3.E.i of proposed Form Custody would have elicited information about
the types and dollar amounts of the securities the broker-dealer carried for the accounts of
customers and non-customers, respectively. 580 Specifically, for each Item, the broker-dealer
would have been required to complete information on a chart to the extent applicable. 581 The
proposed charts were comprised of twelve rows, with each row representing a category of
security. These categories included: (1) U.S. Equity Securities; (2) Foreign Equity Securities; (3)
U.S. Listed Options; (4) Foreign Listed Options; (5) Domestic Corporate Debt; (6) Foreign
Corporate Debt; (7) U.S. Public Finance Debt; (8) Foreign Public Finance Debt; (9) U.S.
Government Debt; (10) Foreign Sovereign Debt; (11) U.S. Structured Debt; and (12) Foreign
Structured Debt. A thirteenth row was included in each chart to identify any securities not
specifically listed in the first twelve rows. The types of securities were categorized this way
because the various categories ordinarily are associated with certain types of locations. Thus, as
examiners review the form, they could assess whether the types of securities held by the brokerdealer were maintained at locations generally known to hold such securities. If a broker-dealer’s

completed form indicated that some types of securities were held at a location atypical for such
securities, the examiner could refine the focus of the examination to evaluate whether customer
assets were properly safeguarded. The Commission is adopting these requirements, with
modifications, as discussed below.
One commenter requested that the Commission clarify whether alternative investments,
mutual funds, and exchange traded funds fall within the scope of “Other” securities within the
thirteenth row of Items 3.D.i and 3.E.i. 582 The Commission has considered this comment and
determined that those investments are other types of securities that should be part of Items 3.D.i
and 3.E.i, but that it would be useful to separately identify each of these categories of securities
in Items 3.D.i and 3.E.i, rather than group them together in the “Other” category. By identifying
these types of investments separately on Form Custody, Commission and DEA examiners will
have a better understanding of a broker-dealer’s business activities and a more refined
understanding of the types of securities held by the broker-dealer. This information, in turn,
could facilitate more focused examinations by Commission and DEA examiners. Accordingly,
Items 3.D.i and 3.E.i of Form Custody, as adopted, will contain six additional rows to account
for both domestic and foreign alternative investments (referred to on the form as “private
funds”), mutual funds, and exchange traded funds. The Commission is referring to the term
“private funds” on the form, rather than the term “alternative investments,” for purposes of
clarity; while both terms are often used interchangeably in practice, the term “private fund” is a
regulatory term defined in other contexts of the securities laws (e.g., on Form ADV), whereas the
term “alternative investments” is not. For purposes of Form Custody, the term “private fund” is

company as defined in section 3 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 but for section 3(c)(1)
or 3(c)(7) of that Act. Items 3.D.i and 3.E.i of Form Custody and the related Instructions to
those Items, as adopted, reflect these changes.
The charts in Items 3.D.i and 3.E.i, as proposed, would have each had eight columns.
The first column contained boxes for each category of security specified in the Item (and
identified in the second column), as discussed above. 583 The broker-dealer would have been
required to check the box in each chart for every applicable category of security it holds for the
accounts of customers and non-customers, respectively. The second column would have
identified the category of security. The third through eighth columns represented ranges of
dollar values: (1) up to $50 million; (2) greater than $50 million up to $100 million; (3) greater
than $100 million up to $500 million; (4) greater than $500 million up to $1 billion; (5) greater
than $1 billion up to $5 billion; and (6) greater than $5 billion. In each chart, the broker-dealer
would have been required to check the box in the column reflecting the approximate dollar value
for every category of security that the broker-dealer carried for the accounts of customers and
non-customers, respectively. 584
The Commission proposed identifying dollar ranges for the values of the securities, as
opposed to actual values, to ease compliance burdens. 585 The intent was to elicit information
about the relative dollar value of securities the broker-dealer held for customers and noncustomers in each category of security. Values would be reported as of the date specified in the
broker-dealer’s accompanying quarterly FOCUS Report.

One commenter noted that the charts set forth in Items 3.D.i and 3.E.i of proposed Form
Custody did not include boxes to check to reflect the approximate dollar values for the categories
of securities the broker-dealer carried for the accounts of customers and non-customers. 586 This
commenter requested guidance on whether broker-dealers would be required to populate the
chart with checkmarks or more precise estimates of market value. 587 The Commission intended
to include boxes to check to reflect approximate dollar values in the charts set forth in Items
3.D.i and 3.E.i of proposed Form Custody, and the form, as adopted, includes these boxes.
b.

Items 3.D.ii and 3.E.ii

Items 3.D.ii and 3.E.ii of proposed Form Custody would have elicited information
concerning whether the broker-dealer had recorded all the securities it carried for the accounts of
customers and non-customers, respectively, on its stock record by requiring the broker-dealer to
check the appropriate “Yes” or “No” box. 588 If the broker-dealer checked “No,” it would have
been required to explain in the space provided why it had not recorded such securities on its
stock record and indicate the type of securities and approximate U.S. dollar market value of such
unrecorded securities. 589 The Commission did not receive any comments on Items 3.D.ii and
3.E.ii of proposed Form Custody and is adopting these Items as proposed.
The Commission anticipates that a broker-dealer ordinarily would answer “Yes” in
response to Items 3.D.ii and 3.E.ii because the stock record – which a broker-dealer is required to
create pursuant to Rule 17a-3 590 – is a record of custody of securities. A long position in the
stock record indicates ownership of the security or a right to the possession of the security.

Thus, the “long side” of the stock record indicates the person to whom the broker-dealer owes
the securities. Common examples of “long side” positions are securities received from
customers (e.g., fully paid or excess margin securities), securities owned by the firm (i.e.,
securities held in the broker-dealer’s inventory for its own account), securities borrowed, and
fails-to-deliver (i.e., securities sold to or through another broker-dealer but not delivered).
A short position in the stock record indicates either the location of the securities or the
responsibility of other parties to deliver the securities to the broker-dealer. Every security owned
or held by the broker-dealer must be accounted for by its location. Since securities are fungible,
the short side of the stock record does not in fact designate where particular securities are
located. Rather, it indicates the total amount of securities, on a security-by-security basis, held at
each location, which could include, for example, securities depositories. Common short-side
stock record locations also include banks (e.g., when a broker-dealer pledges securities to a bank
as collateral for a loan), stock loan counterparties (e.g., when a broker-dealer lends securities to
another firm as part of a securities lending transaction), and counterparties failing to deliver
securities to the broker-dealer (e.g., when the broker-dealer has purchased securities that have
not yet been received from the counterparty).
The Commission’s goals in asking this question were twofold. First, the question would
elicit the disclosure of the unusual circumstance in which a broker-dealer carries securities for
the account of a customer or non-customer but does not reflect them on its stock record. 591 The
Commission and other securities regulators could use this information to assess whether the
broker-dealer is properly accounting for securities. Second, this question could prompt a brokerdealer to identify, and self-correct, circumstances in which it did not include securities on its

stock record as required by Rule 17a-3. 592
c.

Items 3.D.iii and 3.E.iii

Items 3.D.iii and 3.E.iii of proposed Form Custody would have elicited information as to
how the broker-dealer treated free credit balances in securities accounts of customers and noncustomers, respectively. 593 The information would have been elicited through a chart the brokerdealer would be required to complete. The chart in Item 3.D.iii of proposed Form Custody had
five rows with each row representing a different process for treating free credit balances. The
chart would have disclosed whether free credit balances were: (1) included in a computation
under Rule 15c3-3(e); (2) held in a bank account under Rule 15c3-3(k)(2)(i); (3) swept to a U.S.
bank; (4) swept to a U.S. money market fund; and/or (5) “other,” with a space to describe such
other treatment. The options were not intended to be mutually exclusive in that a broker-dealer
may treat free credit balances in several different ways (e.g., a broker-dealer may be instructed
by certain customers to sweep their free credit balances to a bank, and by other customers to
sweep their free credit balances to a U.S. money market fund). The Commission did not receive
any comments on Items 3.D.iii and 3.E.iii of proposed Form Custody and is adopting these Items
as proposed.
A broker-dealer will be required to check the box in the first column of the chart for
every process that applies to the broker-dealer’s treatment of free credit balances in customer and
non-customer accounts, respectively. The first process identified on each chart is that the brokerdealer treats customer and non-customer free credit balances in accordance with the customer
reserve computation required under paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3. Paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3
requires a broker-dealer to maintain a special reserve bank account for the exclusive benefit of its
592

Id.

593

Id.

155

customers and maintain deposits in that account (to the extent a deposit is required) in amounts
computed in accordance with Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3. 594 Rule 15c3-3 requires that a brokerdealer comply with these reserve account provisions only with respect to customer-related credit
balances. The Commission has, however, proposed amendments to Rule 15c3-3 that would
require a broker-dealer to maintain a reserve account and perform a reserve computation for noncustomer accountholders that are domestic and foreign broker-dealers. 595
The second process identified on the chart is that the broker-dealer handles free credit
balances by placing funds in a “bank account under Rule 15c3-3(k)(2)(i).” Paragraph (k)(2)(i) of
Rule 15c3-3 prescribes a process by which a broker-dealer can qualify for an exemption from the
requirements of Rule 15c3-3. Specifically, the exemption applies to a broker-dealer that does not
carry margin accounts, promptly transmits all customer funds and delivers all securities received
in connection with its activities, does not otherwise hold funds or securities for, or owe money or
securities to, customers and effectuates all financial transactions between the broker-dealer and
its customers through one or more bank accounts that are each designated as a “Special Account
for the Exclusive Benefit of Customers of (the name of broker or dealer).” 596
The third process identified in the chart – “swept to a U.S. bank” – is included because
some broker-dealers engage in “bank sweep programs.” Rather than hold customer funds in
securities accounts, some broker-dealers require or offer the option to transfer free credit
balances in securities accounts to a specific money market fund or interest bearing bank account

(“Sweep Programs”). The customer earns dividends on the money market fund or interest on the
bank account until such time as the customer chooses to liquidate the position in order to use the
cash, for example, to purchase securities. 597 Customers must make a request to the broker-dealer
for the return of funds swept from their securities accounts to the bank.
The fourth option identified in the chart is that the broker-dealer sweeps free credit
balances into a money market fund as part of a Sweep Program. In most cases when a brokerdealer sweeps free credit balances into a money market fund, the broker-dealer purchases shares
in the money market fund, which are registered in the name of the broker-dealer. The money
market fund understands that these shares are not proprietary positions of the broker-dealer, and
any interest earned on the shares from the money market fund are payable to the customers.
Finally, the fifth option in the chart covers any other process that is not described in the
other options.

Item 4 – Carrying for Other Broker-Dealers

Item 4 of proposed Form Custody would have required a broker-dealer to disclose
whether it acted as a carrying broker-dealer for other broker-dealers. 598 There were two sets of
questions in Item 4 – Item 4.A.i, ii, and iii and Item 4.B.i, ii, and iii. The first set of questions
would have elicited information from a broker-dealer as to whether it carried transactions for
other broker-dealers on a fully disclosed basis. 599 The second set of questions would have
elicited information from a broker-dealer as to whether it carried transactions for other brokerdealers on an omnibus basis. 600 The Commission did not receive any comments to Item 4 of

proposed Form Custody and is adopting this Item as proposed.
Items 4.A.i and 4.B.i require a broker-dealer to indicate by checking the appropriate
“Yes” or “No” box whether it carries customer accounts for another broker-dealer on a fully
disclosed basis and on an omnibus basis, respectively. Items 4.A.ii and 4.B.ii require a brokerdealer, if applicable, to indicate the number of broker-dealers with which it has an arrangement
to carry accounts on a fully disclosed basis and on an omnibus basis, respectively. Items 4.A.iii
and 4.B.iii require a broker-dealer, if applicable, to identify any affiliated broker-dealers that
introduce accounts to the broker-dealer on a fully disclosed basis and on an omnibus basis,
respectively.
As the Commission has noted, related person custody arrangements can present higher
risks to “advisory clients” than maintaining assets with an independent custodian. 601 Consistent
with the definition of the term in other contexts applicable to broker-dealers, including Form
BD, 602 the General Instructions for Form Custody define the term “affiliate” as any person who
directly or indirectly controls the broker-dealer or any person who is directly or indirectly
controlled by or under common control with the broker-dealer. The definition also specifies that
ownership of 25% or more of the common stock of the broker-dealer introducing accounts to the
broker-dealer submitting the Form Custody is deemed prima facie evidence of control; this
provision also is consistent with the definition used in Form BD. 603

601

See Custody of Funds or Securities of Clients by Investment Advisers, 75 FR at 1462.

602

Form BD is the uniform application for broker-dealer registration with the Commission. Form BD states
that a person is presumed to control a company if, among other things, that person has directly or indirectly
the right to vote 25% or more of a class of a voting security or has the power to sell or direct the sale of
25% or more of a class of voting securities, or, in the case of a partnership, the right to receive upon
dissolution, or has contributed, 25% or more of the firm’s capital.

603

This definition of the term affiliate is the same as the definition in Form BD, including the specification
that ownership of 25% or more of the common stock is deemed prima facie evidence of control.

158

Item 4 in Form Custody elicits information about broker-dealers’ custodial
responsibilities with respect to accounts held for the benefit of other broker-dealers, and requires
broker-dealers to identify such broker-dealers that are affiliates of the broker-dealer. 604 The
Commission believes that this information will provide the Commission with an enhanced
understanding of, and useful and readily available information relating to, the scope of brokerdealer introducing/carrying relationships and activities, and the custodial practices of brokerdealers involved in such relationships.
5.

Item 5 – Trade Confirmations

Item 5 of Form Custody, as proposed, would have required broker-dealers to disclose
whether they send transaction confirmations to customers and other accountholders by checking
the appropriate “Yes” or “No” box. 605 Confirmations are important safeguards that enable
customers to monitor transactions that occur in their securities accounts. Timely confirmations
alert customers of unauthorized transactions and provide customers with an opportunity to object
to the transactions. The Commission received one comment on Item 5 of proposed Form
Custody. As discussed below, the Commission is modifying the instructions to Item 5 in
response to this comment and is otherwise adopting Item 5 as proposed.
Exchange Act Rule 10b-10 specifies the information a broker-dealer must disclose to

604

Form Custody does not require a broker-dealer to identify unaffiliated broker-dealers for which it carries
accounts, though, as discussed above, it would need to indicate that it carries accounts for such brokerdealers. The Commission believes that this approach provides the Commission and DEA examiners with
access to useful information involving a broker-dealer’s custody practices while alleviating potential time
and cost burdens associated with completing Form Custody given that some broker-dealers carry accounts
for hundreds of unaffiliated broker-dealers. The Commission notes that information about these brokerdealers would be part of the books and records of the carrying broker-dealer. Therefore, an affirmative
answer to Item 4 could prompt the Commission and DEA examiners to request information about the
identities of the unaffiliated broker-dealers. See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37589 n.143.

605

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37589–37590.

159

customers on a trade confirmation at or before completion of a securities transaction. 606
Generally, Rule 10b-10 requires a confirmation to include, among other things: (1) the date and
time of the transaction and the identity, price, and number of shares or units (or principal
amount) of such security purchased or sold by such customer; (2) the broker-dealer’s capacity
(agent or principal) and its compensation; (3) the source and amount of any third party
remuneration it has received or will receive; and (4) other information, both general (e.g., that
the broker-dealer is not a SIPC member, if such is the case) and transaction-specific (e.g., certain
yield information in most transactions involving debt securities). 607
The information contained on a trade confirmation should reconcile with customer
statements and the broker-dealer’s journal entries. 608 In this regard, there is a link between trade
confirmations sent by a broker-dealer and the broker-dealer’s records pertaining to custody of
customer assets. 609 How a broker-dealer answers Item 5 could assist examiners in focusing their
inspections. For example, if the form indicates that a third party is responsible for sending trade
confirmations, the examiners can confirm with that third party that it is in fact sending
confirmations.

606

17 CFR 240.10b-10.

607

Id.

608

See 17 CFR 240.17a-3(a)(1), which requires the broker-dealer to make “[b]lotters (or other records of
original entry) containing an itemized daily record of all purchases and sales of securities, all receipts and
deliveries of securities (including certificate numbers), all receipts and disbursements of cash and all other
debits and credits. Such records shall show the account for which each such transaction was effected, the
name and amount of securities, the unit and aggregate purchase or sale price (if any), the trade date, and the
name or other designation of the person from whom purchased or received or to whom sold or delivered.”

609

Although broker-dealers may allocate the function of sending confirmations to other broker-dealers or to
service providers, the allocating broker-dealer retains the responsibility for sending confirmations. See
New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change, Exchange Act Release No.
18497 (Feb. 19, 1982), 47 FR 8284 (Feb. 25, 1982) at n.2 (providing “no contractual arrangement for the
allocation of functions between an introducing and carrying organization can operate to relieve either
organization from their respective responsibilities under the federal securities laws and applicable SRO
rules”).

160

With respect to Item 5.A, one commenter requested clarification as to whether a brokerdealer should indicate that it sends trade confirmations directly to customers (by checking “yes”)
where it employs a vendor to do so. 610 The Commission has considered this comment and
determined that a broker-dealer should affirmatively respond to Item 5 of Form Custody, as
adopted, by checking the “yes” box on the form if it employs a vendor to send trade
confirmations to customers on its behalf because, in such an arrangement, the broker-dealer is
ultimately responsible for complying with its trade confirmation obligations, not the vendor. The
Commission has modified the instructions to Item 5 to reflect this clarification.
6.

Item 6 – Account Statements

Item 6 of proposed Form Custody would have required broker-dealers to disclose
whether they send account statements directly to customers and other accountholders by
checking the appropriate “Yes” or “No” box. 611 The Commission received one comment on
Item 6 of proposed Form Custody. 612 As is discussed below, the Commission is modifying the
instructions to Item 6 in response to this comment and is otherwise adopting Item 6 as proposed.
Account statements generally are sent to customers and other accountholders on a
monthly or quarterly basis and typically set forth the assets held in the investor’s securities
account as of a specific date and the transactions that occurred in the account during the relevant
period. SROs impose requirements on broker-dealers with respect to the statements they must
send to their customers. 613 For example, FINRA generally requires any member that conducts a
general securities business and also carries customer accounts or holds customer funds or

161

securities, at least once each calendar quarter, to send an account statement to each customer
whose account had a security position, money balance, or account activity since the last
statement was sent. 614 The account statement must contain a description of any securities
positions, money balances, or account activity in the account. In addition, the account statement
must include a statement that advises the customer to report promptly any inaccuracy or
discrepancy in that person’s account to the brokerage firm. 615 The statement also is required to
advise the customer that any oral communications made to the broker-dealer regarding
inaccuracies or discrepancies should be re-confirmed in writing to further protect the customer's
rights, including rights under SIPA. 616
Like trade confirmations, account statements are important safeguards that allow
investors to monitor transactions that occur in their securities accounts. If the account statements
are sent by a broker-dealer other than the broker-dealer completing Form Custody, this fact will
need to be disclosed on the Form in Item 6.B. Item 6.C asks whether the broker-dealer sends
account statements to anyone other than the beneficial owner of the account. 617 In response to a
request for clarification raised by one commenter to proposed Item 6.C, 618 a broker-dealer also

614

See NASD Rule 2340. NASD Rule 2340 defines a general securities member as any member that conducts
a general securities business and is required to calculate its net capital pursuant to Rule 15c3-1. NASD
Rule 2340(d)(2). Additionally, NASD Rule 2340 defines account activity broadly so that it includes, but is
not limited to, purchases, sales, interest credits or debits, charges or credits, dividend payments, transfer
activity, securities receipts or deliveries and/or journal entries relating to securities or funds in the
possession or control of the member. NASD Rule 2340(d)(1). See also Order Approving Proposed Rule
Change Relating to Rule 2340 Concerning Customer Account Statements, Exchange Act Release No.

relating to Rule 2340 concerning customer account statements).

615

If the customer’s account is serviced by both an introducing broker-dealer and a clearing broker-dealer, the
statement must inform customers that such reports must be made to both firms. See NASD Rule 2340(a).

Generally, the beneficial owner of an account represents the person entitled to the economic benefits of
ownership. With respect to securities, the term beneficial owner is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the

would check “Yes” to Item 6.C if the broker-dealer sends account statements to the beneficial
owner of an account and duplicate account statements to persons other than the beneficial owner
of the account. The Commission has modified the instructions to Item 6 to reflect this
clarification.
The Commission is requiring broker-dealers to answer the questions in Item 6 to enhance
its understanding of a broker-dealer’s relationship with customers, particularly in the context of
the broker-dealer’s custodial responsibilities. Broker-dealers do not currently disclose to the
Commission whether they send account statements directly to customers. Collecting this
information on Form Custody will provide examiners with additional background information
that could be used to refine the focus of their inspections. Further, the Commission anticipates
that examiners would make further inquiries to the extent the Form reveals answers that are
inconsistent with industry practice.
A review of Item 6 also may facilitate an examiner’s preparation for an inspection. For
example, if a broker-dealer indicates on Form Custody that it holds customer accounts and sends
account statements to customers, the examiner could prepare a more targeted document request
to the broker-dealer. In this regard, an examiner could request customer account statements from
the broker-dealer, as well as statements from the custodian(s) of the broker-dealer’s customer
securities and cash. 619 Examiners could then review and reconcile these documents to verify
whether customer securities and cash are held at the custodian(s) identified by the broker-dealer.

619

As is discussed above in section IV.C.3. of this release, the fact that a broker-dealer uses a custodian to
hold customer securities and cash, and the type of custodian, will be disclosed in response to Items 3.C and
3.D of Form Custody.

163

7.

Item 7 – Electronic Access to Account Information

Item 7 of proposed Form Custody would have required broker-dealers to indicate whether
they provided customers and other accountholders with electronic access to information about
the securities and cash positions in their accounts by checking the appropriate “Yes” or “No”
box.620 Electronic access to account information can provide investors with an efficient means
of monitoring transactions that occur in their securities accounts. This inquiry would inform the
Commission as to how readily customers are able to access and review their account
information. The Commission did not receive any comments to Item 7 of proposed Form
Custody and is adopting this Item as proposed.
The Commission believes that electronic access to account information is beneficial to
customers, who can more easily monitor the performance of their accounts and perhaps more
quickly identify any discrepancies or inaccuracies. The Commission is including this Item in
Form Custody because it will help to inform examiners as to how readily customers can access
and review account information.
8.

Item 8 – Broker-Dealers Registered as Investment Advisers

Item 8 of Form Custody, as proposed, would have elicited information, if applicable, as
to whether and how the broker-dealer operated as an investment adviser. 621 Proposed Item 8 was
comprised of three subparts, as described below.
The first question of Item 8 – Item 8.A – would have required the broker-dealer to
indicate whether it was registered as an investment adviser with the Commission under the

164

Advisers Act or with one or more states pursuant to the laws of a state. 622 If the broker-dealer
indicated that it was registered with the Commission under the Advisers Act or pursuant to state
law (or both), then it would have been required to respond to the remaining questions under Item
8. 623
The next question of Item 8 of proposed Form Custody – Item 8.B – would have required
the broker-dealer to disclose the number of its investment adviser clients. 624 This would provide
the Commission with information about the scale of the broker-dealer’s investment adviser
activities.
The third question of Item 8 of proposed Form Custody – Item 8.C – would have required
the broker-dealer to complete a chart, consisting of six columns, in which the broker-dealer
would have provided information about the custodians where the assets of the investment adviser
clients were held. 625 In the first column, the broker-dealer would have been required to disclose
the name of the custodian, and in the second column, the broker-dealer would have been required

625

Id. Under Rule 206(4)-2, it is a “fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act, practice or course of business”
for an investment adviser registered or required to be registered under section 203 of the Advisers Act (15
U.S.C. 80b-3) to have custody of client funds or securities unless, among other things, a qualified custodian
maintains those funds or securities. See 17 CFR 275.206(4)-2(a)(1). A qualified custodian is: (1) a bank as
defined in section 202(a)(2) of the Advisers Act or savings association as defined in section 3(b)(1) of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(b)(1)) that has deposits insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (2 U.S.C. 1811); (2) a broker-dealer
registered under section 15(b)(1) of the Exchange Act holding the client assets in customer accounts; (3) an
FCM registered under section 4f(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 6f(a)), holding the client
assets in customer accounts, but only with respect to clients' funds and security futures, or other securities
incidental to transactions in contracts for the purchase or sale of a commodity for future delivery and
options thereon; and (4) a foreign financial institution that customarily holds financial assets for its
customers, provided that the foreign financial institution keeps the advisory clients' assets in customer
accounts segregated from its proprietary assets. See 17 CFR 275.206(4)-2(d)(6). A qualified custodian
must maintain client funds and securities: (1) in a separate account for each client under that client’s name;
or (2) in accounts that contain only the clients’ funds and securities, under the investment adviser’s name as
agent or trustee for the clients. See 17 CFR 275.206(4)-2(a)(1).

165

to identify the custodian by either SEC file number or CRD number, as applicable. 626
The third and fourth columns of the chart would have elicited information about the
scope of the broker-dealer/investment adviser’s authority over the accounts held at the custodian
by requiring the broker-dealer/investment adviser to check the appropriate “Yes” or “No” box. 627
Specifically, in the third column, the broker-dealer/investment adviser would have been required
to indicate whether it had the authority to effect transactions in the advisory client accounts at the
custodian. In the fourth column, the broker-dealer/investment adviser would have been required
to indicate whether it had the authority to withdraw funds and securities from those accounts.
In the fifth column, the broker-dealer/investment adviser would have been required to
indicate whether the custodian sends account statements directly to the broker-dealer’s
investment adviser clients. 628 The Commission recently adopted amendments to Rule 206(4)-2
to require that investment advisers have a reasonable basis, after due inquiry, for believing that
qualified custodians of advisory client assets send account statements to the investment advisers’
clients. As stated in the release adopting that requirement, the Commission believes that the
direct delivery of account statements by qualified custodians provides greater assurance of the
integrity of account statements received by clients. 629
In the sixth column, the broker-dealer/investment adviser would have been required to
indicate whether investment adviser client assets were recorded on the broker-dealer’s stock
record. 630 If the broker-dealer was acting as custodian for such assets, the Commission

anticipates that those assets would be recorded on the broker-dealer’s stock record. 631
The Commission received one comment in response to Item 8 of Form Custody, as
proposed. 632 This commenter stated that the information sought in Item 8 was largely redundant
with information collected from investment advisers on Form ADV. The Commission is aware
that some overlap exists between the information collected from investment advisers on Form
ADV and the information that would be collected from broker-dealers dually-registered as
investment advisers in Item 8 of proposed Form Custody. However, these two forms also
contain a significant amount of non-overlapping material, reflecting their different purposes and
uses. Form Custody is intended to be a single source of readily-available information to assist
Commission and DEA examiners in preparing for and performing focused custody exams, and it
is particularly important that such information be readily available in the case of duallyregistered firms. Accordingly, the Commission is adopting Item 8 of Form Custody substantially
as proposed. 633
9.

Item 9 – Broker-Dealers Affiliated with Investment Advisers

Item 9 of Form Custody consists of two subparts. Item 9.A, as proposed, would have
elicited information concerning whether the broker-dealer was an affiliate of an investment
adviser. 634 Item 9.B.i, as proposed, would have elicited information from a broker-dealer that

631

If the broker-dealer acts as custodian for an investment adviser client’s securities, and does not record those
securities on its stock record, the broker-dealer would need to explain why those securities were not
recorded on its stock record in response to the question in Item 3.D.ii of Form Custody.

632

See Angel Letter.

633

Column 2 of Item 8.C of Form Custody, as proposed, would have required a broker-dealer/investment
adviser to identify the SEC File No. or CRD No. of each custodian where assets of investment adviser
clients were held. However, not all custodians of investment adviser client assets have an SEC File No. or
CRD No. Accordingly, the instructions applicable to Column 2 of Item 8.C, as adopted, have been
modified to provide that a broker-dealer needs to identify custodians in the column by SEC File No. or
CRD No., “if applicable.” Thus, a broker-dealer can leave Column 2 of Item 8.C blank if assets of its
investment adviser clients are held at a custodian that does not have an SEC File No. or CRD No.

634

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37592.

167

checks “Yes” in response to Item 9.A to identify whether it has custody of client assets of the
adviser, and, if Item 9.B.i is checked “Yes,” to indicate the approximate U.S. dollar market value
of the adviser client assets of which the broker-dealer has custody. 635 The Commission did not
receive any comments to Item 9 of proposed Form Custody and is adopting this Item as
proposed. The additional information obtained from a broker-dealer in response to Item 9 will
provide SEC and DEA examiners with a better understanding of a broker-dealer’s custody
profile and, in particular, custodial relationships with investment adviser affiliates.
For purposes of Item 9, an affiliate is any person who directly or indirectly controls the
broker-dealer or any person who is directly or indirectly controlled by or under common control
with the broker-dealer. Ownership of 25% or more of the common stock of the investment
adviser is deemed prima facie evidence of control. 636
V.

EFFECTIVE DATES
As discussed below, the Commission has established December 31, 2013 as the effective

date for the requirement to file Form Custody and the requirement to file annual reports with
SIPC. The Commission is delaying the effective date for the requirements relating to brokerdealer annual reports to June 1, 2014. These delayed effective dates are intended to provide time
for broker-dealers, broker-dealer independent public accountants, and broker-dealer DEAs to
prepare for the changes that will result from these new requirements. The amendments relating
to broker-dealer annual reports and the other amendments to Rule 17a-5 (including the technical
amendments) affect numerous paragraphs in that rule and two paragraphs in Rule 17a-11. Given
the complexity and practical difficulty of having certain provisions become effective before
others, the amendments to Rule 17a-5 and the amendments to Rule 17a-11 will become effective
635

Id.

636

See supra note 603 and corresponding text which specifies the same ownership percentage on Form BD.

168

on June 1, 2014, regardless of whether they relate to the annual report requirements, except that
there will be different effective dates for the amendments to paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-5 (which
includes the filing requirement for Form Custody), Form Custody, the deletion of paragraph
(e)(5) of Rule 17a-5 (which sets forth the requirement to file Form BD-Y2K), and the
requirement to file annual reports with SIPC. The effective dates for the remaining paragraphs
of Rule 17a-5 and Rule 17a-11 are discussed further below.
A.

Amendments Effective 60 Days After Publication in the Federal Register

Before today’s amendments, paragraph (e)(5) of Rule 17a-5 required a broker-dealer to
file Form BD-Y2K, which elicits information with respect to a broker-dealer’s readiness for the
year 2000 and any potential problems that could arise with the advent of the new millennium.
The Commission is deleting this paragraph from Rule 17a-5 as the requirement is no longer
applicable. The amendment deleting paragraph (e)(5) of Rule 17a-5 will be effective 60 days
after this release is published in the Federal Register.
B.

Amendments Effective on December 31, 2013

The amendments to paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-5 and the rule establishing Form Custody
(17 CFR 249.639) are effective on December 31, 2013. The amendments to paragraph (a)
include the requirement for a broker-dealer to file Form Custody with its DEA. 637 Consequently,
broker-dealers subject to this filing requirement must begin filing Form Custody with their DEAs
17 business days after the calendar quarter or fiscal year, as applicable, ended December 31,
2013.
Two commenters requested that the Commission provide broker-dealers with sufficient
time to develop, test, and implement the systems that they will use to comply with the Form

637

See paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17a-5.

169

Custody filing requirements. 638 The Commission understands that broker-dealers will need to
allocate personnel and systems resources to comply with the Form Custody filing requirements,
particularly for a broker-dealer’s initial filing. DEAs also will need to be prepared to receive the
forms that are filed by broker-dealers. Establishing December 31, 2013 as the effective date of
the Form Custody requirements is designed to accommodate the efforts that need to be
undertaken by both broker-dealers and DEAs in connection with the filing and receipt of Form
Custody.
Additionally, the amendment to paragraph (d)(6) of Rule 17a-5 is effective on December
31, 2013. Broker-dealer annual reports must be filed with SIPC for fiscal years ending on or
after December 31, 2013.
C.

Amendments Effective on June 1, 2014

The amendments to paragraphs (b), (c), (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), (d)(4), (d)(5), (e)(1), (e)(2),
(e)(3), (e)(4), (f), (g), (h), (i), (k), (l), (m) and (n) and the deletion of paragraph (j) of Rule 17a-5
and the amendments to Rule 17a-11 are effective on June 1, 2014. Consequently, all of the
amendments to Rule 17a-5 not discussed above in sections V.A. and V.B. of this release and the
amendments to Rule 17a-11 are effective on that date. This includes the amendments relating to
the annual report requirements, with the exception of the requirement to file annual reports with
SIPC, which is effective on December 31, 2013. In 2014, therefore, the annual report
requirements will apply to all broker-dealers subject to these requirements that have a fiscal year
ending on or after June 1, 2014.
The Commission proposed that the amendments would apply for fiscal years ending on
or after December 15, 2011, with a first-year transition period for carrying broker-dealers

638

See E&Y Letter; SIFMA Letter.

170

required to file compliance reports with fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2011 but
before September 15, 2012. 639 The Commission received 14 comments concerning the
compliance date of the amendments. 640 Most commenters recommended that the Commission
delay the compliance date. One commenter, however, stated that broker-dealers should start
working on compliance immediately. 641 Several stated that the compliance date of the
amendments should be aligned with the effective date of the proposed PCAOB standards for
engagements related to compliance reports and exemption reports. 642 One commenter suggested
that the Commission postpone the assertion requirements until the rule has been in effect for one
year. 643 Another commenter stated that the rules should be effective for fiscal years ending on
or before December 15, 2012 “to allow sufficient time to complete robust documentation and
testing of the processes related to the Financial Responsibility Rules and the Financial
Statements.” 644 Similarly, another commenter stated that the effective date should be deferred to
fiscal years ending on or before December 15, 2012 “to give broker-dealers and their auditors
time to adequately address the final rules,” and that the effective date should be aligned with the
effective date of PCAOB standards. 645 Another commenter stated that the rule amendments
should apply only to annual reports filed on or after December 15, 2012, and that implementation
of the proposal must be postponed until after the PCAOB establishes auditing and attestation
639

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37581. During the transition period, the statement in the compliance
report as to whether internal control was effective would have been a point-in-time statement as of the date
of the report, rather than covering the entire fiscal year.

standards and broker-dealers have had ample time to plan and budget for the new standards. 646
Finally, a commenter stated that broker-dealers should be required to file the first compliance
report or exemption report no earlier than one quarter after the adoption of the final rule
amendments and to report identified instances of material non-compliance or material
weaknesses in annual reports filed no earlier than five quarters after the adoption of the final rule
amendments, with a transition period as proposed of no less than five quarters after the adoption
of the final rule amendments. 647 This commenter also suggested that the Commission require the
filing of the first Form Custody no earlier than three quarters after the effective date of the final
rule. 648
The amendments, among other things, establish important new safeguards with respect
to broker-dealer custody of customer funds and securities. However, the Commission recognizes
that broker-dealers and other affected parties may need additional time to prepare to comply with
the new requirements.
Amendments to provisions regarding broker-dealer annual reports and the engagement of
an independent public accountant in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), (d)(4), (d)(5), (e)(1), (e)(2),
(e)(3), (e)(4), (g), and (i) of Rule 17a-5 and the deletion of paragraph (j) of Rule 17a-5 generally
will apply for broker-dealers with fiscal years ending on or after June 1, 2014. In particular,
broker-dealers must file compliance reports or exemption reports, as applicable, and brokerdealers must file reports of independent public accountants covering compliance reports or
exemption reports in accordance with Rule 17a-5 as amended, for fiscal years ending on or after
June 1, 2014, with no transition period. Similarly, PCAOB standards, rather than GAAS, apply

Id.

172

to examinations of financial reports for fiscal years ending on or after June 1, 2014. For brokerdealers with fiscal years that end before June 1, 2014, applicable reports must be filed in
accordance with the provisions of Rule 17a-5 as they existed before today’s amendments.
Amendments to the customer statement provisions of paragraph (c) of Rule 17a-5 apply
for fiscal years ending on or after June 1, 2014, and in the interim broker-dealers must comply
with those provisions as they existed before today’s amendments.
Paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-5 requires a broker-dealer to file a statement regarding its
independent public accountant on December 10 of each year. As a result of today’s
amendments, all broker-dealers that are required by Rule 17a-5 to engage an independent public
accountant must file a new statement by December 10, 2013 that contains the information and
representations required under paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-5 as amended. For example, after
today’s amendments, the statement must include a representation that the accountant has
undertaken the engagement of the accountant provisions of paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-5 as
amended. The statement also must include, if applicable, representations regarding access to the
broker-dealer’s independent public accountant and the audit documentation of the independent
public accountant.
The amendments to the notification provisions in paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5 and
amendments to Rule 17a-11 are effective on June 1, 2014. In the interim, these provisions as
they existed before today’s amendments continue to apply.
Finally, the amendments to paragraphs (b), (c), (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), (d)(4), (d)(5), (e)(1),
(e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4), (f), (g), (h), (i), (k), (l), (m), and (n) of Rule 17a-5 and the amendments to
Rule 17a-11 not discussed above, including technical amendments, are effective on June 1, 2014.

173

With respect to the annual report requirements, the June 1, 2014 effective date should
provide sufficient time for the PCAOB to finalize, and for the Commission to consider, proposed
standards applicable to broker-dealer examinations and reviews and for broker-dealers and their
accountants to become familiar with, and be prepared to comply with, those standards. The
Commission has chosen a specific effective date, instead of aligning that date with the date of
adoption of the rule amendments or the date that the Commission approves PCAOB standards
applicable to broker-dealer examinations and reviews, as suggested by commenters, to provide
certainty regarding the date by which broker-dealers and their accountants must comply with the
new requirements. Certain commenters referenced AICPA guidance with respect to brokerdealer audits. However, this guidance will no longer be applicable for fiscal years ending on or
after June 1, 2014, when standards of the PCAOB begin to apply.
One commenter suggested that the effective date for non-carrying and smaller brokerdealers to comply with amendments to the annual reporting requirements should be one year
after the adoption of the amendments. 649 The Commission notes that most smaller brokerdealers are non-carrying firms and, therefore, will be required to file the exemption report and a
report of the independent public accountant based on a review of the exemption report. As
discussed in sections VI. and VII. of this release, the hour burdens and costs of the exemption
report requirements will be substantially less than the hour burdens and costs of the compliance
report requirements. Consequently, the Commission does not believe the effective date should
be extended further for smaller broker-dealers.
As stated above, another commenter suggested that the Commission postpone the

649

See Citrin Letter.

174

assertion requirements until the rule has been in effect for one year. 650 The Commission
recognizes that all broker-dealers subject to these requirements and their independent public
accountants will need time to prepare to comply with the requirements. The effective date the
Commission is establishing should provide sufficient time for small or non-carrying firms, as
well as larger carrying firms, to prepare for compliance with the new requirements.
VI.

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
Certain provisions of the final rule amendments contain “collection of information”

requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 651 The
Commission solicited comment on the estimated burden associated with the collection of
information requirements in the proposed amendments. 652 The Commission submitted the
proposed collection of information requirements to the Office of Management and Budget
(“OMB”) for review in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5 CFR 1320.11.
The titles and OMB control numbers for the collections of information are:
(1)

Rule 17a-5, Reports to be made by certain brokers and dealers (OMB Control
Number 3235-0123);

(2)

Rule 17a-11, Notification provisions for brokers and dealers (OMB Control
Number 3235-0085); and

(3)

Form Custody (OMB Control Number 3235-0691).

An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a
collection of information requirement unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

As discussed above, the Commission received 27 comment letters on the proposed rulemaking.
Some of these comments relate directly or indirectly to the PRA. These comments are addressed
below. Finally, some initial burden estimates have been adjusted, as discussed below, to reflect
updated information used to make the estimates.
A.

Summary of the Collection of Information Requirements

As discussed in greater detail above in sections II., III., and IV. of this release, the
Commission is adopting amendments to Rules 17a-5 and 17a-11 and is adopting new Form
Custody for broker-dealers to file with their DEA.
Under the amendments to Rule 17a-5, broker-dealers must, among other things, file with
the Commission annual reports consisting of a financial report and one of two new reports –
either a compliance report or an exemption report that are prepared by the broker-dealer, and
generally must also file reports prepared by an independent public accountant registered with the
PCAOB covering those reports in accordance with PCAOB standards. 653 The financial report
must contain the same types of financial statements that were required to be filed under Rule
17a-5 prior to these amendments (a statement of financial condition, a statement of income, a
statement of cash flows, and certain other financial statements). 654 In addition, the financial
report must contain, as applicable, the supporting schedules that were required to be filed under
Rule 17a-5 prior to these amendments (a computation of net capital under Rule 15c3-1, a
computation of the reserve requirements under Rule 15c3-3, and information relating to the
possession or control requirements under Rule 15c3-3).
A broker-dealer that does not claim an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 through the most
recent fiscal year – generally a carrying broker-dealer – must file the compliance report, and a
653

See discussion above in sections II.B.1., II.B.2., II.B.3., and II.B.4. of this release.

654

See discussion above in section II.B.2. of this release.

176

broker-dealer that claimed an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year
must file the exemption report. In the compliance report and exemption report, a broker-dealer
must make certain statements and provide certain information relating to the financial
responsibility rules.
In addition to preparing and filing the financial report and the compliance report or
exemption report, a broker-dealer must engage a PCAOB-registered independent public
accountant to prepare a report based on an examination of the broker-dealer’s financial report in
accordance with PCAOB standards. 655 A broker-dealer that files a compliance report also must
engage the PCAOB-registered independent public accountant to prepare a report based on an
examination of certain statements in the compliance report. 656 A broker-dealer that files an
exemption report must engage the PCAOB-registered independent public accountant to prepare a
report based on a review of certain statements in the broker-dealer’s exemption report. In each
case, the examination or review must be conducted in accordance with PCAOB standards. A
broker-dealer must file these reports of the independent public accountant with the Commission
along with the financial report and the compliance report or exemption report prepared by the
broker-dealer.
The amendments add a requirement that the annual reports also be filed with SIPC if the
broker-dealer is a member of SIPC. 657 In addition, broker-dealers must generally file with SIPC
a supplemental report on the status of the membership of the broker-dealer in SIPC. 658 The
supplemental report must include a report of the independent public accountant based on certain

655

See discussion above in section II.C.4. of this release.

177

procedures specified in the rule in accordance with PCAOB standards. In the future, SIPC may
determine the format of this report by rule, subject to Commission approval.
Under the amendments, the PCAOB-registered independent public accountant must
immediately notify the broker-dealer if the accountant determines during the course of preparing
the accountant’s reports that the broker-dealer was not in compliance at any time during the
fiscal year with the financial responsibility rules or if the accountant determines that any material
weakness existed in the broker-dealer’s Internal Control Over Compliance during the fiscal
year. 659 The broker-dealer, in turn, must file a notification with the Commission and its DEA
under Rule 15c3-1, Rule 15c3-3, or Rule 17a-11 if the accountant’s notice concerns an instance
of non-compliance that would trigger notification under those rules. Under amendments to Rule
17a-11, a broker-dealer also must file a notification with the Commission and its DEA if the
accountant’s notice concerns (or if the broker-dealer discovers) a material weakness in the
broker-dealer’s Internal Control Over Compliance.
The amendments also require a broker-dealer that clears transactions or carries customer
accounts to agree to allow representatives of the Commission or the broker-dealer’s DEA to
review the documentation associated with the reports of the broker-dealer’s independent public
accountant and to allow the accountant to discuss its findings with the representatives, if
requested in writing for purposes of an examination of the broker-dealer. 660
Finally, the amendments require broker-dealers to file a new Form Custody, which elicits
information concerning the custody practices of the broker-dealer. 661 Form Custody must be
filed with the DEA each quarter. The DEA must transmit the information obtained from Form
659

See discussion above in section II.F. of this release.

660

See discussion above in section III. of this release.

661

See discussion above in section IV. of this release.

178

Custody to the Commission at the same time that it transmits FOCUS Report data to the
Commission under paragraph (a)(4) of Rule 17a-5.
The burdens associated with the collection of information requirements in the
amendments are discussed below.
B.

Use of Information

The proposed amendments relating to the reports to be filed by the broker-dealer are
designed to enhance the ability of the Commission to oversee broker-dealer custody practices
and, among other things, to: (1) increase the focus of carrying broker-dealers and their
independent public accountants on compliance, and internal control over compliance, with the
financial responsibility rules; (2) facilitate the ability of the PCAOB to implement the explicit
oversight authority of broker-dealer audits provided to the PCAOB by the Dodd-Frank Act; and
(3) with respect to broker-dealers that are dually-registered as investment advisers, satisfy the
internal control report requirement that was added by the amendment to Rule 206(4)-2 noted
above with the accountant’s report based on an examination of the compliance report. Securities
regulators will use these reports to monitor the financial condition of broker-dealers. In addition,
the components of the reports that are made public may be used by investors to review the
financial condition of broker-dealers with which they have accounts or obtain other securities
related services. SIPC can use the annual reports to monitor the financial strength of brokerdealers and to assess the adequacy of the SIPC Fund.
The amendment requiring a broker-dealer that clears transactions or carries customer
accounts to allow Commission and DEA examination staff to review the audit documentation
associated with its annual audit reports required under Rule 17a-5 and to allow its independent
public accountant to discuss findings relating to the audit reports with Commission and DEA

179

examination staff is intended to facilitate examinations of clearing broker-dealers by
Commission and DEA examination staff. Commission and DEA examiners will use the
information obtained from audit documentation and discussions with the broker-dealer’s
independent public accountant to plan their examinations.
Finally, Commission and DEA examiners will use Form Custody to understand a brokerdealer’s custody profile and identify custody-related violations and misconduct. For example, if
a broker-dealer represents on Form Custody that it does not issue account statements, but an
examiner discovers that an account statement has been issued by the broker-dealer (e.g., in
connection with a customer complaint or in the course of an examination of the broker-dealer),
the examiner will be able to react more quickly to the misrepresentation. Further, the
requirement to prepare and file the form should motivate broker-dealers to focus more attention
on their custody practices.
C.

Respondents

The Commission estimated in the proposal that there were 5,063 registered brokerdealers that would be affected by the proposed amendments and that, of these, 305 were carrying
broker-dealers, 528 were carrying or clearing broker-dealers, and 4,752 were broker-dealers that
claimed exemptions from Rule 15c3-3. 662 The Commission did not receive comments regarding
these estimates, but the Commission has updated the estimates to reflect more recent
information. 663
As of December 31, 2011, 4,709 broker-dealers filed FOCUS Reports with the
Commission. Of these, 4,417 broker-dealers claimed exemptions from Rule 15c3-3.

662

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37595.

663

The updated estimates are based on FOCUS Report data as of year end 2011. As discussed above, FOCUS
Reports are deemed confidential pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17a-5.

180

Consequently, the Commission estimates that there are approximately 292 carrying brokerdealers (4,709 – 4,417 = 292). Based on FOCUS Report data, the Commission further estimates
that there are approximately 513 carrying or clearing broker-dealers. According to SIPC, as of
March 31, 2012, 217 broker-dealers claimed exemptions from SIPC membership. Therefore, the
Commission estimates that 4,492 (4,709 – 217 = 4,492) broker-dealers are members of SIPC.
D.

Total Initial and Annual Burdens

As discussed in detail below, the Commission estimates that the total PRA burden
resulting from the amendments to Rules 17a-5 and 17a-11 and new Form Custody include an
initial, one-time burden of approximately 13,522 hours 664 and an annual burden of approximately
276,717 hours. 665 There is significant variance between the largest broker-dealers and the
smallest broker-dealers. Consequently, the estimates described below are averages across all
types of broker-dealers expected to be affected by the amendments.
1.

Annual Reports to be Filed
i.

The Financial Report

The Commission’s amendments to Rule 17a-5 retain the current requirement that brokerdealers annually file financial statements and supporting schedules that must be audited by a
PCAOB-registered accountant. As a result, the Commission’s estimate of the hour burden for
broker-dealers to prepare and file the financial report has not changed as a result of the
amendments to Rule 17a-5.

664

As discussed below, the total one-time burden relates to the requirement to draft and file a revised
statement regarding the independent public accountant under Rule 17a-5(f)(2). The Commission estimated
a total one-time burden of 10,214 hours in the proposing release for the statement regarding the
independent public accountant and for SIPC forms. See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37595.

665

As discussed below, the total annual hour burden relates to the compliance report (17,520 hours), the
exemption report (30,919 hours), the filing of annual reports with SIPC (2,246 hours), and Form Custody
(226,032 hours). The Commission estimated a total annual burden of 287,325 hours in the proposing
release. See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 at FR 37595.

181

ii.

The Compliance Report

Under the amendments, a carrying broker-dealer must prepare and file with the
Commission a new compliance report each year. The compliance report must contain statements
as to whether: (1) the broker-dealer has established and maintained Internal Control Over
Compliance; (2) the Internal Control Over Compliance of the broker-dealer was effective during
the most recent fiscal year; (3) the Internal Control Over Compliance of the broker-dealer was
effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year; (4) the broker-dealer was in compliance
with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 as of the end of the most recent fiscal year;
and (5) the information the broker-dealer used to state whether it was in compliance with Rule
15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 was derived from the books and records of the brokerdealer. In addition, if applicable, the compliance report must contain a description of: (1) each
identified material weakness in the broker-dealer’s Internal Control Over Compliance during the
most recent fiscal year, including those that were identified as of the end of the fiscal year; and
(2) any instance of non-compliance with Rule 15c3-1 or paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 as of the
end of the most recent fiscal year.
The Commission estimated that, on average, carrying broker-dealers would spend
approximately 60 hours each year to prepare the compliance report, as proposed. 666
One commenter stated that the proposal did not “address the additional costs broker-dealers
would incur in preparing Compliance Reports.” 667 The commenter, however, did not comment
directly on the estimated hour burden or provide specific examples of costs, in addition to the
hour burdens, that broker-dealers would bear. 668 Another commenter also stated that the
666

668

182

proposed estimate of 60 hours “is not an accurate estimate of the time burden to complete the
Compliance Report” and that the burdens in the proposing release are understated. 669 The
commenter stated that completing the compliance report will require extensive collaboration
between management, internal audit and the independent public accountants resulting in added
hours to perform the validation and evidence gathering of the existing processes necessary to
make the assertions in the proposed compliance report. 670 The commenter, however, did not
provide a different estimate of the number of hours it would take to complete the compliance
report.
In response to these comments, the Commission notes that the final rule modifies the
proposal in ways that may modestly reduce the time burden. For example, the final rule requires
a statement as to whether the broker-dealer was in compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph
(e) of Rule 15c3-3 as of the end of the most recent fiscal year and, if applicable, a description of
any instances of non-compliance with these rules as of the fiscal year end, rather than the
proposed assertion that the broker-dealer is in compliance with the financial responsibility rules
in all material respects and proposed description of any material non-compliance with the
financial responsibility rules. This reflects two changes from the proposal: (1) elimination of the
concepts of “material non-compliance” and “compliance in all material respects” with Rule
15c3-1 and 15c3-3 for the purposes of reporting in the compliance report; and (2) a narrowing of
these statements and description requirements from compliance with all of the financial
responsibility rules to compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3.
As modified, the final rule no longer requires the broker-dealer to evaluate whether an
instance of non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules was material, a component of
669

See Van Kampen/Invesco Letter.

670

Id.

183

the proposal that generated significant comment. In addition, the broker-dealer only needs to
report instances of non-compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3. In this
regard, broker-dealers currently are required to include supporting schedules to their financial
statements containing a computation of net capital and the reserve requirement under paragraph
(e) of Rule 15c3-3. Consequently, the work required under this pre-existing requirement should
provide the broker-dealer with the information it needs to make the statement as to whether it is
in compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 as of the fiscal year end.
Given these modifications, the statements in the compliance report concerning the
broker-dealer’s Internal Control Over Compliance likely will be responsible for the bulk of the
hour burden associated with preparing the compliance report. For example, the broker-dealer
will need to evaluate whether its Internal Control Over Compliance with the financial
responsibility rules was effective during the most recent fiscal year.
The Commission believes that the modifications to the final rule discussed above may
modestly reduce the hour burden of the final rule as compared to the hour burden that would
have resulted from the proposed rule; namely, because a broker-dealer will not need to evaluate
whether instances of non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules are material and will
only need to report instances of non-compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule
15c3-3. In light of the comments suggesting that the proposing release underestimated the
burden, the Commission is not reducing the hour burden estimate for the rule to reflect the
potential reduction in hour burden associated with the requirement. Thus, to the extent the
proposing release underestimated the burden associated with making the statements in the
compliance report about the broker-dealer’s Internal Control Over Compliance, the amount of

184

the burden reduction realized through the modifications discussed above is now attributed to the
burden associated with the statements about Internal Control Over Compliance.
For these reasons, the Commission is retaining the rule’s overall hour burden estimate
without revision. The Commission, however, is updating the number of carrying broker-dealers
to reflect more recently available data from the broker-dealer FOCUS Reports. The Commission
now estimates that there are 292 carrying broker-dealers. Consequently, the Commission
estimates that the total annual reporting burden to prepare and file the compliance report is
approximately 17,520 hours per year for all carrying broker-dealers. 671
iii.

The Exemption Report

Under the amendments, a non-carrying broker-dealer must file the exemption report. 672
In the exemption report, the broker-dealer must provide to its best knowledge and belief: (1) a
statement that identifies the provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 under which the brokerdealer claimed an exemption from Rule 15c3-3; (2) a statement that the broker-dealer met the
identified exemption provisions in paragraph (k) throughout the most recent fiscal year without
exception or that it met the identified exemption provisions in paragraph (k) throughout the most
recent fiscal year except as described in the exemption report; and (3) if applicable, a statement
that identifies each exception during the most recent fiscal year in meeting the identified
provisions in paragraph (k) and that briefly describes the nature of each exception and the
approximate date(s) on which the exception existed.
The Commission estimated that it would take a non-carrying broker-dealer approximately

671

60 hours x 292 carrying broker-dealers = 17,520 hours. See the discussion below regarding the external
costs associated with obtaining the accountant’s report on the compliance report.

672

See discussion above in sections II.B.1. and II.B.4. of this release.

185

five hours to prepare and file the proposed exemption report. 673 The Commission did not receive
any comments on this hour estimate. As discussed above in section II.B.4. of this release, the
Commission is adopting, with modifications, the requirements regarding the exemption report.
These provisions generally clarified the scope and application of the report. However, one
modification provides that if the broker-dealer states that it met the identified exemption
provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year except as
described in the report, the broker-dealer must identify each exception during the most recent
fiscal year in meeting the identified provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 and that briefly
describes the nature of each exception and the approximate date(s) on which the exception
existed. The Commission expects that non-carrying broker-dealers generally track exceptions as
part of monitoring compliance with the exemption provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3.
The requirement to identify and describe exceptions would create an incremental burden over the
rule as proposed. Based on staff experience with the application of Rule 17a-5, the Commission
estimates that the additional work associated with describing exceptions in the exemption report
would take two hours. Therefore, the Commission is revising the hour estimate associated with
the exemption report to seven hours.
The Commission now estimates that there are approximately 4,417 non-carrying brokerdealers that must file exemption reports. Therefore, the Commission estimates that the annual
reporting burden for all non-carrying broker-dealers to prepare and file the exemption report is
approximately 30,919 hours per year. 674

673

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37596.

674

7 hours x 4,417 non-carrying broker-dealers = 30,919 hours. See the discussion below regarding the
external costs associated with obtaining the accountant’s report on the exemption report.

186

iv.

Additional Burden and Cost to File the Annual Reports

The filing requirements for the annual reports are being amended. 675 In particular, Rule
17a-5 previously provided that a broker-dealer must file two copies of its annual reports with the
Commission’s principal office in Washington, DC. The final rule no longer requires that two
copies be filed, so that, in accordance with paragraph (d)(6) of Rule 17a-5, broker-dealers must
file only one copy of the annual reports with the Commission’s principal office. This change
could reduce slightly the hour burden and cost associated with filing the annual reports with the
Commission.676
Amendments to paragraph (d)(6) of Rule 17a-5 require that a broker-dealer also file a
copy of its annual reports with SIPC. The Commission estimated that it would take 30 minutes
to prepare an additional copy of the annual reports and mail it to SIPC as required by the
proposed amendments. 677 The Commission did not receive comments regarding this estimate.
In addition, the clarification to the final rule that only broker-dealers that are members of SIPC
must file a copy of their annual reports with SIPC will not affect the final PRA hour burden
estimate. Therefore, the Commission is retaining this estimate without revision. The
Commission now estimates that 4,492 broker-dealers are members of SIPC. 678 Therefore, the
Commission estimates that the annual industry-wide reporting burden associated with this

675

See discussion above in section II.B.6. of this release.

676

The Commission does not expect the compliance report, exemption report, and related reports of the
independent public accountant to increase the mailing costs of the annual reports because these additional
reports in the aggregate should not significantly increase the size and weight of the package of annual
reports.

677

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37596.

678

As discussed in subsection C. above, according to SIPC, as of March 31, 2012, 217 broker-dealers claimed
exemptions from SIPC membership. The Commission therefore estimates that 4,492 (4,709 – 217 = 4,492)
broker-dealers are members of SIPC.

187

amendment is approximately 2,246 hours per year. 679
There would be postage costs associated with sending a copy of the annual reports to
SIPC that are estimated to be, on average, 680 approximately $12.05 per broker-dealer per year. 681
Thus, the Commission estimates that the total annual postage costs associated with sending a
copy of the annual reports to SIPC would be approximately $54,128 per year for all brokerdealers that are SIPC members. 682
Finally, the Commission notes that paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of Rule 17a-5 of the final rule
was amended to require that a copy of a DEA’s written approval to change a broker-dealer’s
fiscal year end must be sent to the Commission’s principal office in Washington DC, in addition
to the regional office of the Commission for the region in which the broker-dealer has its
principal place of business. Based on the number of copies of approvals received by the
Commission and staff experience in the application of Rule 17a-5, the Commission estimates
that approximately 75 broker-dealers will receive approval each year to change their fiscal year
end. The Commission estimates that it would take 10 minutes to copy and send an additional
copy of the approval to the Commission’s principal office in Washington, DC for a total

679

1/2 hour x 4,492 broker-dealers = 2,246 hours.

680

The number of pages of an annual report, and consequently the associated postage costs, likely will vary
significantly based on the size of the broker-dealer and the types of business in which it engages.

681

Based on Commission staff experience with annual report filings of broker-dealers under Rule 17a-5, the
Commission staff estimates that approximately 50% of broker-dealers file their annual reports using an
overnight mail delivery service. These broker-dealers would consequently incur higher postage costs than
broker-dealers which choose to mail their annual reports using first class mail or delivery methods other
than overnight mail. Therefore, postage costs will vary depending on the size of the annual report and
method of delivery. The Commission estimates that the cost to mail the additional reports would be, on
average, $12.05 per broker-dealer. As of October 2012, the $12.05 rate is an average rate of the cost of an
Express Mail Flat Rate Envelope of $18.95 and a Priority Mail Flat Rate Envelope of $5.15, based on costs
obtained on the website of the U.S. Postal Service at: www.usps.gov. ($18.95 + $5.15) = $24.10/2 =
$12.05.

682

4,492 broker-dealers x $12.05 = $54,128.

188

industry-wide annual hour burden of approximately 12.5 hours, 683 and a total industry-wide cost
of approximately $33.75 per year to mail the approval. 684
v.

Supplemental Report on SIPC Membership

Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (e)(4) of Rule 17a-5 provided that a brokerdealer must file with its annual report a supplemental report on the status of the membership of
the broker-dealer in SIPC, which was required to be “covered by an opinion of the independent
public accountant” if the annual report of the broker-dealer was required to be audited. The
Commission is adopting amendments to paragraph (e)(4) of Rule 17a-5 to provide that brokerdealers must file with SIPC – but no longer with the Commission after an interim period if SIPC
adopts a rule under paragraph (e)(4)(i) that is approved by the Commission – a report of an
independent public accountant designed to help administer the collection of assessments from
broker-dealers for purposes of establishing and maintaining SIPC’s broker-dealer liquidation
fund. 685 The Commission is adopting the proposed amendments to paragraph (e)(4) of Rule 17a5 substantially as proposed. One modification is that, as adopted, the final rule provides that the
accountant must perform the procedures specified in the rule in accordance with PCAOB
standards. SIPC may determine the format of this report by rule, subject to Commission
approval.
Because broker-dealers are currently required to file these reports with both the
Commission and SIPC, the final rule amendment does not result in any change to the
Commission’s current estimate of the hour burden for broker-dealers to comply with this
requirement under the current PRA collection for Rule 17a-5. Although broker-dealers will file
683

(75 approvals x 10 minutes)/60 = 12.5 hours.

684

75 approvals x $0.45 (current price of a letter sent first class) = $33.75.

685

See discussion above in section II.C.4. of this release.

189

the supplemental report on SIPC membership only with SIPC if a SIPC rule change to
implement this amendment is approved by the Commission, as noted in the current PRA
collection, the variation in the size and complexity of broker-dealers subject to Rule 17a-5 makes
it difficult to calculate the burden of the information collection of Rule 17a-5. Therefore, the
Commission will determine whether it is appropriate to revise the PRA estimate for Rule 17a-5
after any SIPC rule filing is approved or after the end of the two-year sunset provision.
In the proposing release the Commission estimated, however, that SIPC would incur a
one-time burden associated with filing a rule change with the Commission to implement this
proposed amendment of approximately 100 hours. 686 The process and requirements for SIPC to
file rule changes with the Commission, however, is set out in SIPA. 687 Any burden on SIPC to
file a rule change with the Commission would be associated with the requirements under SIPA.
Therefore, the Commission is deleting the proposed one-time 100 hours from the final rule
amendments.
vi.

Statement Regarding Independent Public Accountant

The Commission is amending paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-5 to revise the statement
regarding identification of a broker-dealer’s independent public accountant that broker-dealers
must file each year with the Commission and their DEA (except that if the engagement is of a
continuing nature, no further filing is required). 688 The revised statement contains additional
information that includes a representation that the independent public accountant has undertaken
686

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37597.

687

15 U.S.C. 78ccc(e)(2). The statute generally requires that the Board of Directors of SIPC file with the
Commission a copy of any proposed rule change accompanied by a concise general statement of the basis
and purpose of such proposed rule change. In addition, the statute states that “the Commission shall, upon
the filing of any proposed rule change, publish notice thereof, together with the terms of substance of such
proposed rule change or a description of the subjects and issues involved” and that the “Commission shall
give interested persons an opportunity to submit written data, views, and arguments with respect to such
proposed rule change.” 15 U.S.C. 78ccc(e)(2)(A).

688

See discussion above in section III. of this release.

190

to provide a report regarding the broker-dealer’s financial reports and a report regarding the
broker-dealer’s compliance report or exemption report, as applicable. 689 In addition, the
statement provided by a clearing or carrying broker-dealer must include representations
regarding the access to its accountant requirements described above. 690 Therefore, all brokerdealers will generally be required to file a new statement regarding their independent public
accountant. The Commission estimated that the one-time hour burden associated with amending
its existing statement and filing the new statement with the Commission, in order to comply with
the proposed amendments, would be an average of approximately two hours on a one-time basis
for each broker-dealer, as the statement can be continuing in nature. 691
The Commission is revising this estimate for clearing and carrying broker-dealers, as
these broker-dealers will likely need to renegotiate their agreements with their independent
public accountants. The Commission estimates, based on staff experience, that it will take a
carrying or clearing broker-dealer approximately ten hours on a one-time basis to renegotiate its
agreement with its accountant, amend its statement regarding its accountant, and file the new
statement with the Commission. The Commission estimates that the one-time burden for all
carrying or clearing broker-dealers is approximately 5,130 hours 692 and the one-time burden for
all broker-dealers that neither carry customer accounts nor clear transactions is approximately
8,392 hours, 693 for a total industry-wide reporting burden of approximately 13,522 hours on a
one-time basis.

689

See Rule 17a-5(f)(2)(ii). 17 CFR 240.17a-5(f)(2)(ii).

690

See Rule 17a-5(f)(2)(ii)(F) and (G).

691

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37596.

692

10 hours x 513 carrying or clearing broker-dealers = 5,130 hours.

693

2 hours x 4,196 non-carrying and non-clearing broker-dealers = 8,392 hours.

191

Finally, the Commission believes there will be postage costs associated with sending the
amended statement regarding the accountant, which must be sent to the Commission’s principal
office in Washington, DC, the regional office of the Commission for the region in which the
broker-dealer’s principal place of business is located, and to its DEA. The Commission
estimates that each mailing will cost approximately $0.45, for a total cost of approximately
$6,357 for all broker-dealers on a one-time basis. 694
vii.

External Costs of Engagement of Accountant

The amendments to Rule 17a-5 retain the current requirement that broker-dealers
annually file with the Commission a financial report and a report prepared by a PCAOBregistered accountant based on an audit of the financial report. 695 However, the financial report
must be audited in accordance with standards of the PCAOB, instead of in accordance with
GAAS, as previously required. The amendments also require a broker-dealer to file with the
Commission either a compliance report or an exemption report and to obtain an independent
accountant’s report based on an examination or review of those reports, respectively. 696
Broker-dealers incur annual external costs associated with the PRA burden in terms of
hiring outside auditors and accountants to comply with the requirements of Rule 17a-5. Any
external costs of accountants’ reports included in the PRA collection of information for these
final rule amendments are averages across all broker-dealers. The external PRA costs incurred
by a broker-dealer to comply with the final rule amendments will generally depend on its size
and the complexity of its business activities. Because the size and complexity of broker-dealers

694

4,709 broker-dealers x $0.45 cost for first class postage x 3 mailings = $6,357.15.

695

See discussion above in section II.D.3. of this release.

696

Id.

192

varies significantly, the Commission provides estimates of the average external cost per brokerdealer across all broker-dealers. 697
The Commission received various comments regarding the costs of the proposed
requirements and engagement of the accountant provisions. More specifically, the Commission
received comments addressing: (1) the costs of the change from GAAS to PCAOB standards for
the financial report; (2) the costs of the examination of the new compliance report; and (3) the
costs of the review of the new exemption report. The comments received with respect to these
three areas and the Commission’s responses are addressed in detail in each subsection below.
a.

Financial Report (including Change from GAAS to
PCAOB Standards)

Two commenters stated that the Commission did not address the costs associated with the
change from GAAS to PCAOB standards. 698 These costs would affect the external costs of
broker-dealers under the PRA burden to the extent the change in standards caused an increase in
external accounting fees incurred by broker-dealers. One commenter also stated that the
Commission may need to consider the PCAOB’s proposed rules before it can make a reasonable
estimate, and that transition to PCAOB standards may require substantial revisions to audit
programs. 699 Another commenter stated that the economic analysis was “inconclusive” because
the PCAOB has not yet established auditing and attestation standards for broker-dealers. 700 In
response to this comment, the Commission estimates the costs of its rules using the best
information available to it at the time.
697

In the proposing release, these costs were included in the Economic Analysis. The Commission is also
including these costs in the PRA amendments to more accurately reflect external costs incurred by brokerdealers as a result of the PRA hour burdens imposed by the final rule amendments, and in response to
comments.

698

See, e.g., McGladrey Letter; SIFMA Letter.

699

See ABA Letter.

700

See CAI Letter.

193

Based on information currently available, including the proposed PCAOB standards, the
Commission does not expect that the move to PCAOB standards for audits of broker-dealer
financial reports will result in significant one-time implementation costs or recurring annual
costs. The proposed PCAOB standards for audits of financial reports (financial statements and
supporting schedules) generally incorporate concepts and requirements contained within GAAS,
thereby minimizing the potential costs to broker-dealer auditors of this change. As such, the
Commission is not including any additional external PRA costs related to the change from
GAAS to PCAOB auditing standards. 701 However, in response to the comment, the Commission
will examine the effect of any final PCAOB standards on the external costs associated with this
collection of information in subsequent extensions of this collection of information and make
any necessary cost adjustments.
b.

Compliance Report

The Commission estimated that the incremental external cost to a carrying broker-dealer
of obtaining the independent public accountant’s report based on an examination of the proposed
compliance report would be an average incremental cost of approximately $150,000 per carrying
broker-dealer per year. 702 The Commission is including these external costs in this collection of
information.
One commenter stated that the Commission underestimated the cost of examining the
compliance report. 703 This commenter believed that the auditing costs associated with the
compliance examinations were underestimated given that the proposing release contemplated a

701

See section VII. of this release (discussing benefits and costs of changing from GAAS to PCAOB auditing
standards).

702

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37599.

703

See ABA Letter.

194

move from GAAS to PCAOB auditing standards. 704 This commenter stated that the transition
may require substantial revisions to independent public accountant audit programs, including
implementation of new auditing techniques and processes and the associated training programs
and noted that the proposed PCAOB standards were not released until after the publication of the
proposing release. 705 Another commenter stated that completing both the compliance reports
and exemption reports “will require extensive collaboration between management, internal audit,
and the independent public accountants” and that due to the “significant increase in hours,” the
proposed amendments have “the potential to double the total current audit fees and have a
material impact” on firms. 706 These commenters did not quantify their cost estimates in terms of
dollars; nor did they provide data to support their conclusions.
As explained above in section II.D. of this release, before today’s amendments, Rule 17a5 required a broker-dealer to engage an independent public accountant to prepare a material
inadequacy report based on, among other things, a review of the accounting system, internal
accounting control, and procedures for safeguarding securities of the broker-dealer, including
appropriate tests, for the period since the prior examination date. In addition, the accountant was
required to review the practices and procedures followed by the broker-dealer in, among other
things, (1) making periodic computations of net capital and under paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3,
(2) making quarterly securities examinations, counts, verifications, and comparisons under Rule
17a-13, and (3) obtaining and maintaining physical possession or control of all fully paid and
excess margin securities of customers as required by Rule 15c3-3.

704

706

See Van Kampen/Invesco Letter.

195

Consequently, under requirements before today’s amendments relating to a material
inadequacy report that are being replaced by the examination of the compliance report, the
broker-dealer was required to engage the independent public accountant to review the internal
controls, practices, and procedures of the broker-dealer with respect to key elements of the
financial responsibility rules.
For these reasons, the Commission continues to believe that the average incremental cost
of $150,000 per carrying broker-dealer to obtain the accountant’s report covering the compliance
report is reasonable. Moreover, as stated above, the Commission is adopting the proposed
amendments to Rule 17a-5 with respect to the compliance report with modifications. For
example, the final rule requires a statement as to whether the broker-dealer was in compliance
with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 as of the end of the most recent fiscal year
and, if applicable, a description of any instances of non-compliance with these rules as of the
fiscal year end, rather than the proposed assertion that the broker-dealer is in compliance with the
financial responsibility rules in all material respects and the proposed description of any material
non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules. This reflects two changes from the
proposal: (1) elimination of the concepts of “material non-compliance” and “compliance in all
material respects” with Rule 15c3-1 and 15c3-3 for the purposes of reporting in the compliance
report; and (2) a narrowing of these statements and description requirements from compliance
with all of the financial responsibility rules to compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of
Rule 15c3-3.
As modified, the final rule no longer requires the independent public accountant to
evaluate whether an instance of non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules was
material. While there may be an increase in the number of reported instances of non-compliance

196

than under the proposal, the independent public accountant will not be required to determine
whether an instance of non-compliance is material. Consequently, the reporting of instances of
non-compliance (as compared to instances of material non-compliance) is not expected to
increase costs of the engagement of the accountant from those estimated for the proposal and
may decrease costs.
In addition, the final rule has been modified from the proposal so that the independent
public accountant will not be required to examine a broker-dealer statement that encompassed
compliance with all the financial responsibility rules. Instead, the independent public accountant
must examine a statement about compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3.
In this regard, the Commission has not amended the requirement, which existed before today’s
amendments, that the independent public accountant examine the supporting schedules to the
broker-dealer’s financial statements, which contain a computation of net capital under Rule
15c3-1 and the reserve requirement under paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3.
Given these modifications, the statements in the compliance report concerning the
broker-dealer’s Internal Control Over Compliance will likely account for the bulk of the work of
the independent public accountant and, as noted above, before today’s amendments, the
independent public accountant was required to include internal control within the scope of the
audit.
The Commission believes that the modifications to the final rule discussed above should
modestly reduce the external cost of the final rule as compared to the cost that would have
resulted from the proposed rule. Further, elimination of the requirement that the accountant
prepare a material inadequacy report will result in some cost savings. 707 While these

707

The Commission also stated in the proposing release that the Commission estimated that amendments to
the IA Custody Rule would impose external costs of $250,000 per investment adviser, and that the

197

modifications to the final rule may result in reduced costs, the Commission continues to believe
that the average estimated incremental cost of $150,000 per carrying broker-dealer, which may
be at the high end of the range of estimated costs, is reasonable.
For these reasons, the Commission has not changed its average estimate of the
incremental cost of the accountants’ reports covering the compliance report. The Commission
therefore estimates that the average industry-wide annual external reporting incremental cost of
this requirement is approximately $43,800,000 per year ($150,000 x 292 carrying broker-dealers
= $43,800,000).
c.

Exemption Report

The Commission estimated that the external cost to a non-carrying broker-dealer of
obtaining the independent public accountant’s report based on a review of the proposed
exemption report would be an average of approximately $3,000 per non-carrying broker-dealer
per year, for a total estimated annual cost associated with this proposal of $14,256,000. 708 The
Commission did not receive any specific comments regarding this cost estimate.
In the proposing release, the Commission stated its belief that an independent public
accountant’s review of the exemption assertion would add an incremental cost to that incurred as
a result of the annual financial audit. 709 As discussed above, independent public accountants
engaged by broker-dealers were required, before today’s amendments, to “ascertain that the

Commission estimated that the examination of the compliance report would incrementally cost $150,000
because the IA Custody Rule imposed new requirements on investment advisers, and, unlike the final rule
amendments being adopted today, was not based on existing obligations. See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76
FR at 37599. Based on this comparison, the Commission continues to believe that the average estimated
incremental cost of $150,000 per carrying broker-dealer is reasonable and that the changes discussed above
generally should not materially impact the cost estimate as they may, in some cases, result in a modest
reduction in burden.
708

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37599–37600. The Commission estimated that there were 4,752 noncarrying broker-dealers. 4,752 x $3,000 = $14,256,000.

709

conditions of the exemption were being complied with as of the examination date and that no
facts came to [the independent public accountant’s] attention to indicate that the exemption had
not been complied with during the period since [the independent public accountant’s] last
examination.” 710
The Commission continues to believe that $3,000 is a reasonable estimate of the cost of
obtaining the accountant’s report covering the exemption report. The Commission now
estimates that there are approximately 4,417 non-carrying broker-dealers. The Commission
therefore estimates that the total industry-wide external annual reporting cost of this requirement
is approximately $13,251,000 per year (4,417 non-carrying broker-dealers x $3,000 =
$13,251,000).
d.

Access to Accountant and Audit Documentation

The amendments to Rule 17a-5 require that carrying or clearing broker-dealers agree to
allow Commission and DEA staff, if requested in writing for purposes of an examination of the
broker-dealer, to review the work papers of the independent public accountant and to allow the
accountant to discuss its findings with the examiners.
In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that a carrying or clearing brokerdealer’s accountant would charge the broker-dealer for time its personnel spend speaking with
the Commission or the broker-dealer’s DEA and providing them with audit documentation. 711
Thus, the Commission estimated that the additional cost of accountant time associated with this
amendment to all clearing and carrying broker-dealers would be approximately $660,000

710

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(g)(2).

711

In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that a broker-dealer’s accountant would spend
approximately 5 hours per year speaking with Commission or DEA staff and providing them with audit
documentation.

199

annually. 712 As the Commission now estimates that the number of carrying or clearing brokerdealers is 513, the new estimate is approximately $641,250. 713
2.

Conforming and Technical Amendments to Rule 17a-11

The Commission proposed technical amendments to Rule 17a-5 and proposed amending
paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11 to eliminate a reference to Rule 17a-5. 714 The Commission stated
that these changes should not result in an additional hour burden for the Rule 17a-11 collection
of information. As discussed above in section II.F.2. of this release, in response to a comment,
paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11, as adopted, retains a reference to Rule 17a-5. In addition, the
Commission is adopting conforming amendments to substitute the term material weakness as
defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of Rule 17a-5 for the term material inadequacy with respect to
Rule 17a-5. Specifically, the final rule provides that whenever a broker-dealer discovers, or is
notified by its accountant under paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5 of the existence of any material
weakness, the broker-dealer must: (1) give notice of the material weakness within 24 hours of the
discovery or notification; and (2) transmit a report within 48 hours of the notice stating what the
broker-dealer has done or is doing to correct the situation. 715
The Commission does not expect any change in the number of notices filed per year as a
result of the final amendments because the material inadequacy notification requirement is being
replaced by a material weakness notification requirement. Therefore, the final amendments to
Rule 17a-11 should not result in a change in the current PRA burden for Rule 17a-11. However,
the Commission will take into account any changes in the number of notices associated with this
712

In the proposing release, the Commission multiplied 528 clearing and carrying broker-dealers x 5 hours x
$250/hour = $660,000.

713

513 clearing and carrying broker-dealers x $1,250 in increased costs per clearing broker-dealer = $641,250.

714

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37597.

Rule 17a-12.

collection of information in subsequent extensions of this collection of information and make
any necessary adjustments, as appropriate.
3.

Form Custody

As described more fully above, the amendments require that all broker-dealers registered
with the Commission file Form Custody quarterly with their DEA. The Commission estimated
that the hour burden associated with completing and filing proposed Form Custody would be
approximately 12 hours per quarter, or 48 hours per year, on average, for each broker-dealer. 716
In section IV. of this release, in adopting the final amendments to Form Custody, the
Commission received one comment in response to Item 8 of Form Custody, as proposed, noting
that the information sought in Item 8 was largely the same as information collected from
investment advisers on Form ADV. 717 As stated above in section IV. of this release, the
Commission is aware that some overlap exists between the information collected from
investment advisers on Form ADV and the information that would be collected from brokerdealers dually-registered as investment advisers in Item 8 of proposed Form Custody. However,
these two forms also contain a significant amount of non-overlapping material, reflecting their
different purposes and uses. Form Custody is intended to be a single source of readily-available
information to assist Commission and DEA examiners in preparing for and performing focused
custody exams, and it is particularly important that such information be readily available in the
case of dually-registered firms. Consequently, the Commission believes that the PRA burden for
Form Custody is reasonable in light of its intended purpose, as discussed above in section IV. of
this release. Additionally, the commenter did not indicate disagreement with the hour burden

716

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37597.

717

See Angel Letter.

201

estimate as proposed. Therefore, the Commission is retaining the hour burden estimate without
revision.
The Commission now estimates that there are approximately 4,709 broker-dealers that
must file Form Custody. The Commission therefore estimates that the total annual burden
associated with completing and filing Form Custody for all 4,709 broker-dealers is
approximately 226,032 hours per year (4,709 broker-dealer times 4 responses per year times 12
hours = 226,032 hours).
One commenter stated that the estimated costs to the industry of $69,179,670 is
“staggering,” and that such costs would likely indirectly be passed on to customers. 718 The
commenter did not disagree with the PRA estimate in the proposing release; rather, the
commenter focused on size of the total estimated costs. The Commission recognizes that the
requirement to file Form Custody will increase compliance costs for broker-dealers and,
consequently, the PRA estimates reflect these costs. The PRA hour burden estimates (and
associated internal burden costs), however, are averages across all broker-dealers. The costs
incurred by a broker-dealer to comply with the requirement to file Form Custody will depend on
its size and the complexity of its business activities. Because the size and complexity of brokerdealers varies significantly, the Commission provides estimates of the average cost per brokerdealer across all broker-dealers.
For these reasons, the Commission believes the internal costs related to the PRA for this
hour burden are reasonable and, therefore, the Commission is not adjusting the final cost

718

See IMS Letter. The cost of $69,179,670 was reflected in the Economic Analysis in the proposing release.
See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37601. This cost was calculated as an internal cost of the estimated
PRA hours and is the total cost divided among 5,057 firms. Id. at 37601 n.215. This internal cost would
amount to an average of $13,680 per broker-dealer.

202

estimate, except to reflect updated data with respect to the number of broker-dealers and
compensation. 719
E.

Collection of Information Is Mandatory

The collection of information obligations imposed by the rule amendments are mandatory
for broker-dealers that are registered with the Commission.
F.

Confidentiality

The Commission expects to receive confidential information in connection with the
proposed collections of information. Paragraph (e)(3) of Rule 17a-5, as amended, provides that
broker-dealer annual reports filed with the Commission are not confidential, except that if the
Statement of Financial Condition is bound separately from the balance of the annual reports, and
each page of the balance of the annual reports is stamped “confidential,” then the balance of the
annual reports shall be deemed confidential to the extent permitted by law. 720 However, under
paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of Rule 17a-5, if there are material weaknesses, the accountant’s report on
the compliance report must be made available for customers’ inspection and, consequently, it
would not be deemed confidential. In addition, paragraph (c)(2)(i) of Rule 17a-5 requires a
broker-dealer to furnish to its customers annually a balance sheet with appropriate notes prepared
in accordance with GAAP and which must be audited if the broker-dealer is required to file
audited financial statements with the Commission.721 With respect to the other information
collected under the amendments, a broker-dealer can request the confidential treatment of the
information. 722 If such a confidential treatment request is made, the Commission anticipates that

it will keep the information confidential to the extent permitted by law. 723
VII.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
The Commission is sensitive to the costs and benefits of its rules. When engaging in

rulemaking that requires the Commission to consider or determine whether an action is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest, section 3(f) of the Exchange Act requires that the
Commission consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 724 In addition, section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange
Act requires that the Commission consider the effects on competition of any rules the
Commission adopts under the Exchange Act, and prohibits the Commission from adopting any
rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of
the purposes of the Exchange Act. 725
In the proposing release, the Commission solicited comment on the costs and benefits of
the proposed amendments and new form, including whether estimates of the costs and benefits
were accurate and comprehensive. 726 The Commission further encouraged commenters to
provide specific data and analysis in support of their views. 727 The Commission also requested
comment on whether the proposed amendments would place a burden on competition, and promote
efficiency, competition, and capital formation.728
The Commission received 27 comment letters on the proposed amendments. A number

728

Id.

204

of commenters addressed the Commission’s estimates of the cost and benefits of the proposed
amendments. 729 Generally, these commenters stated that the Commission’s cost and benefit
estimates failed to include all of the costs associated with the proposed amendments and that the
costs that the Commission did include in its analysis were underestimated. For example, one
commenter stated that the proposed amendments “place unnecessary regulatory burdens and
costs on industry, in general, and smaller firms, in particular” and that “broker-dealers compete
against investment advisers who are not burdened by the same regulatory requirements,”
including the requirements in the proposed amendments. 730 While commenters stated that the
Commission underestimated costs, they did not provide alternative quantified estimates of the
costs. 731
As discussed throughout this release, in part in response to comments, the Commission
has modified the proposed rules to reduce compliance burdens where consistent with investor
protection. In addition, as discussed below, where commenters identified costs the Commission
did not consider, the Commission has revised its economic analysis of the final rules to take
these costs into account.
In adopting the rule amendments and new form, the Commission has been mindful of the
associated costs and benefits. The costs and benefits that the Commission has considered in
adopting these amendments and new form are discussed below. The discussion focuses on the

729

See ABA Letter; AICPA Letter; Angel Letter; CAI Letter; Citrin Letter; IMS Letter; KPMG Letter;
McGladrey Letter; SIFMA Letter; Van Kampen/Invesco Letter.

730

See IMS Letter.

731

For example, one commenter stated that the Commission’s estimate of the costs of the compliance report
have “the potential to double the total current audit fees and have a material impact” on firms. See Van
Kampen/Invesco Letter. The commenter, however, did not provide a quantified baseline estimate of
current audit fees incurred by broker-dealers with which to compare the Commission’s estimate of the
incremental cost that the compliance report amendments will have on audit fees.

205

Commission’s reasons for adopting these amendments and new form, the affected parties, and
the costs and benefits of the amendments and new form compared to the baseline, described
below, and to alternative courses of action.
Many of the benefits and costs discussed below are difficult to quantify, in particular
when discussing increases in investor confidence and improvements in investor protection. For
example, the extent to which the increased ability of the Commission and DEAs to oversee
compliance with the financial responsibility rules will help limit future violations of the rules is
unknown. Similarly, it is unknown how much increasing the focus of broker-dealers on the
financial responsibility rules will result in enhanced compliance with those rules. Moreover,
limited public data exists to study the costs of broker-dealer audits. Therefore, much of the
discussion is qualitative in nature but, where possible, the Commission attempted to quantify the
costs.
A.

Motivation for the Amendments

The rule amendments and new form being adopted today are designed to provide
additional safeguards with respect to broker-dealer custody of customer securities and funds.
The motivation for these amendments, which are discussed throughout this release, are
summarized below.
First, as mentioned above in section I.A. of this release, over the last several years, the
Commission has brought several cases alleging fraudulent conduct by investment advisers and
broker-dealers, including among other things, alleged misappropriation or other misuse of
customer securities and funds. 732 These cases highlight the need for enhancements to the rules

732

See, e.g., SEC v. Donald Anthony Walker Young, et al., Litigation Release No. 21006 (Apr. 20, 2009);
SEC v. Isaac I. Ovid, et al., Litigation Release No. 20998 (Apr. 14, 2009); SEC v. The Nutmeg Group,
LLC, et al., Litigation Release No. 20972 (Mar. 25, 2009); SEC v. WG Trading Investors, L.P., et al.,
Litigation Release No. 20912 (Feb. 25, 2009); SEC v. Stanford International Bank, et al., Litigation

206

governing broker-dealer custody of customer assets. Such enhancements include both increased
focus on compliance and internal compliance controls by broker-dealers and their auditors, as
well as measures to increase the ability of the Commission and broker-dealer DEAs to oversee
broker-dealer custody practices by requiring broker-dealers to provide more information about
these practices.
Second, as discussed above in section II.D. of this release, certain provisions of Rule 17a5 before today’s amendments were inconsistent with current audit practices, standards, and
terminology, which have evolved since these provisions were adopted. This inconsistency has
resulted in disparate audit practices and inconsistent compliance with the rule. As discussed
above in section II.D.3.iii. of this release, the PCAOB has published a report containing
observations from inspections of portions of 23 broker-dealer audits conducted by ten accounting
firms. 733 According to the report, PCAOB inspections staff identified deficiencies in all of the
audits inspected. 734 The deficiencies noted in the report provide support for the need to
strengthen and clarify broker-dealer audit and reporting requirements in order to facilitate
consistent compliance with these requirements.
Third, as discussed in section II.D. of this release, prior to today’s amendments, Rule
17a-5 required that broker-dealer audits be conducted in accordance with GAAS, which are
established by the Auditing Standards Board of the AICPA. The amendments – by requiring
that the audits be conducted in accordance with PCAOB standards – recognize the PCAOB’s
explicit oversight authority over broker-dealer audits as provided by the Dodd-Frank Act,
Release No. 20901 (Feb. 17, 2009); SEC v. Bernard L. Madoff, et al., Litigation Release No. 20889 (Feb.
9, 2009). The Commission also has brought an enforcement action against an accountant that purported to
audit financial statements and disclosures of one of these broker-dealers. See SEC v. David G. Friehling,
C.P.A., et al., Litigation Release No. 20959 (Mar. 18, 2009).
733

See PCAOB Inspection Report at p. ii.

734

Id.

207

including the authority to establish (subject to Commission approval) and enforce auditing and
related attestation, quality control, ethics, and independence standards. 735 In addition, the
Commission has direct oversight authority over the PCAOB, including the authority to approve
or disapprove the PCAOB’s rules and standards. 736 Consequently, requiring that broker-dealer
audits be conducted in accordance with standards the Commission has approved will better
ensure alignment between broker-dealer audits and the regulatory policy objectives reflected in
the Commission’s financial responsibility rules.
Fourth, as discussed in section II.B.6. of this release, because broker-dealers have not
been required to file with SIPC their annual audited financial statements, SIPC has received
limited information regarding the financial condition of its broker-dealer members. SIPC can
use this information, among other things, to assess whether the SIPC Fund is appropriately sized
to the risks of a large broker-dealer failure. In addition, at least one court, the New York Court
of Appeals, has held that in cases where SIPC is required to fund the liquidation of a brokerdealer, SIPC could not maintain a claim against the auditor of the broker-dealer based on an
alleged failure to comply with auditing standards because SIPC did not receive the audited
financial statements and therefore could not have relied upon them.
Fifth, as discussed in section III. of this release, the audit work performed by independent
public accountants with respect to audits of carrying and clearing broker-dealers can provide
useful information to Commission and DEA examiners in terms of planning the scope and focus

735

See discussion in section II.D.3. of this release.

736

Section 107(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act provides that the Commission “shall have oversight and
enforcement authority over the [PCAOB] as provided by the [Sarbanes-Oxley Act].” Section 107(b) of the
Sarbanes-Oxley act provides that “[n]o rule of the [PCAOB] shall become effective without prior approval
of the Commission” other than certain initial or transitional standards. Section 107(c) of the SarbanesOxley Act provides for Commission review of disciplinary action taken by the PCAOB. Section 107(d) of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act provides that the Commission may censure and impose other sanctions on the
PCAOB in certain circumstances.

208

of the examination of the broker-dealer. Providing Commission and DEA examiners with access
to the independent public accountant that audited the broker-dealer and audit documentation
related to the audit will allow the examiners to gain an understanding of the work the accountant
did in auditing the broker-dealer and any areas of concern highlighted by the auditor. This will
enable the examiners to conduct risk-based examinations of carrying and clearing broker-dealers
and assist the examiners in determining areas of focus for their examinations. Furthermore, the
amendments will make it clear to the independent public accountant that the broker-dealer has
agreed that the accountant can provide this information and, consequently, eliminate uncertainty
as to whether the broker-dealer consents to the disclosure of the information.
Sixth, as discussed in section IV. of this release, because broker-dealers were not required
to provide comprehensive or consolidated information about their custody practices to the
Commission or their DEA, the Commission and the broker-dealer’s DEA had a fragmented and
incomplete picture of whether a broker-dealer maintained custody of customer and non-customer
assets, and if so, how such assets were maintained. This hindered the ability of the Commission
and DEAs to efficiently plan, prioritize, and perform examinations.
B.

Economic Baseline

The regulatory changes adopted today amend requirements that apply to broker-dealers
registered with the Commission and independent public accountants that audit or attest to brokerdealer annual reports. The discussion below includes approximate numbers of broker-dealers
and accountants that would be affected by today’s amendments and a description of the
economic baseline against which the costs and benefits, as well as the impact on efficiency,
competition, and capital formation, of today’s amendments and new form are measured.

209

1.

Broker-Dealers

The broker-dealers registered with the Commission vary significantly in terms of their
size, business activities, and the complexity of their operations. For example, carrying brokerdealers hold customer securities and funds. 737 Clearing broker-dealers clear transactions as
members of security exchanges and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and the
Options Clearing Corporation. 738 Many clearing broker-dealers are carrying broker-dealers, but
some clearing broker-dealers clear only their own transactions and do not hold customer
securities and cash.
As stated in section I.B.1. above, a broker-dealer that claims an exemption from Rule
15c3-3 is generally referred to as “non-carrying broker-dealer.” Non-carrying broker-dealers
include “introducing brokers.” 739 These non-carrying broker-dealers accept customer orders and
introduce their customers to a carrying broker-dealer that will hold the customers’ securities and
cash along with the securities and cash of customers of other introducing broker-dealers and
those of direct customers of the carrying broker-dealer. The carrying broker-dealer generally
receives and executes the orders of the introducing broker-dealer’s customers. 740 Carrying

737

Rule 15c3-1, the Commission’s net capital rule, specifies that a broker-dealer shall be deemed to carry
customer or broker-dealer accounts “if, in connection with its activities as a broker or dealer, it receives
checks, drafts, or other evidences of indebtedness made payable to itself or persons other than the requisite
registered broker or dealer carrying the account of a customer, escrow agent, issuer, underwriter, sponsor,
or other distributor of securities” or “if it does not promptly forward or promptly deliver all of the securities
of customers or of other brokers or dealers received by the firm in connection with its activities as a broker
or dealer.” 17 CFR 240.15c3-11(a)(2)(i). Further, Rule 15c3-3, the Commission’s customer protection
rule governing reserves and custody of securities, defines the term “securities carried for the account of a
customer” to mean “securities received by or on behalf of a broker or dealer for the account of any
customer and securities carried long by a broker or dealer for the account of any customer,” as well as
securities sold to, or bought for, a customer by a broker-dealer. 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(2).

broker-dealers also prepare trade confirmations, settle trades, and organize book entries of the
securities. 741 Introducing broker-dealers also may use carrying broker-dealers to clear the firm’s
proprietary trades and carry the firm’s securities. Another group of non-carrying broker-dealers
effects transactions in securities such as mutual funds on a subscription-way basis, where
customers purchase the securities by providing the funds directly to the issuer. 742 Finally, some
non-carrying broker-dealers act as finders by referring prospective purchasers of securities to
issuers. 743
The broker-dealer industry is the primary industry affected by the rule amendments and
the new form. In some cases, the amendments impose different requirements on different types
of broker-dealers. For example, carrying broker-dealers must file the compliance report and an
independent public accountant’s report covering the compliance report, while non-carrying
broker-dealers must file the exemption report and an independent public accountant’s report
covering the exemption report. Only carrying and clearing broker-dealers must agree to allow
Commission and DEA examiners to review the audit documentation of their independent public
accountants and to allow accountants to discuss their findings with the examiners. All broker-

741

See, e,g., FINRA Rule 4311 (Carrying Agreements). This FINRA rule governs the requirements applicable
to FINRA members when entering into agreements for the carrying of any customer accounts in which
securities transactions can be effected. Historically, the purpose of this rule has been to ensure that certain
functions and responsibilities are clearly allocated to either the introducing or carrying firm, consistent with
the requirements of the SRO’s and Commission’s financial responsibility and other rules and regulations,
as applicable. See also Notice of Filing of Amendment No. 1 and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of

broker-dealers.
To establish a baseline for competition among broker-dealers, the Commission looks at
the status of the broker-dealer industry detailed below. In terms of size, the following tables
illustrate the variance among broker-dealers with respect to total capital. The information in the
table is based on FOCUS Report data for calendar year 2011.

According to FOCUS Report data, as of December 31, 2011, there were approximately 4,709
broker-dealers registered with the Commission.745 Nine broker-dealers dominate the brokerdealer industry, holding over half of all capital held by broker-dealers. Of the 4,709 registered
broker-dealers, 4,417 firms claimed exemptions from Rule 15c3-3 on their FOCUS Reports.
Accordingly, the Commission estimates that there are approximately 292 carrying broker-dealers
(4,709 – 4,417 = 292). Further, based on FOCUS Report data, the Commission also estimates
that there are approximately 513 broker-dealers that are clearing or carrying firms. The
Commission staff has estimated that approximately 18% of broker-dealers registered with
744

The information in this chart is based on FOCUS Report data filed by broker-dealers in 2011.

745

Not all broker-dealers registered with the Commission are SIPC members. According to SIPC, as of March
31, 2012, 217 broker-dealers claimed exemptions from SIPC membership. The Commission therefore
estimates that 4,492 (4,709 – 217 = 4,492) broker-dealers are members of SIPC.

212

FINRA 746 also are registered as investment advisers with the Commission or with a state. 747

Independent Public Accountants that Audit Broker-Dealer Reports

Independent public accountants that audit broker-dealer reports also will be impacted by
the rule amendments. Based on the audit reports filed by broker-dealers in 2011, approximately
900 accounting firms audited broker-dealer reports that were filed with the Commission.
However, six large accounting firms dominate the market performing audits for approximately
20% of all broker-dealers registered with the Commission, and those broker-dealers audited by
the six large accounting firms had total capital that was more than 90% of the total capital of all
broker-dealers registered with the Commission. 748 These statistics highlight the current baseline
for competition under which the accountants are operating.
Prior to today’s amendments, the AICPA established the auditing and attestation
standards to be followed by the independent public accountants of broker-dealers (i.e., GAAS).
The AICPA’s auditing standards are revised and updated from time to time. For example, the
AICPA recently revised GAAS (including audit standards that apply to audits of broker-dealer
financial statements), and the revised standards were generally effective for fiscal years that
ended on or after December 31, 2012. 749 Consequently, the independent public accountants of
broker-dealers have from time to time had to familiarize themselves with updates and revisions
to GAAS.

Per FINRA’s website, there were 4,456 FINRA member firms at year end 2011. See

SIPC Lawsuits Against Accountants

SIPC was established in 1971. In the period from 1971 to 2011, SIPC initiated 324
proceedings under SIPA to liquidate a failed broker-dealer. 750 This results in an average of
approximately 8 SIPA proceedings per year, though 109 of the 324 proceedings were initiated in
the period from 1971 to 1974, which was the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis of
1968–1970. 751 According to SIPC staff, SIPC has brought 9 lawsuits against accountants since
1971, which is one lawsuit for every 36 SIPA proceedings. 752 The SIPC staff reports that two of
these lawsuits were brought after the 2001 New York decision discussed in section II.B.6.iii. of
this release and three lawsuits were brought in liquidation proceedings that were active at or
about the same time as the 2001 New York decision. The suits initiated around the time of the
2001 decision and thereafter were brought in jurisdictions other than New York.

Overview of Broker-Dealer Reporting, Auditing, and Notification
Requirements Before Today’s Amendments
i.

Broker-Dealer Reporting

Before today’s amendments, Rule 17a-5 generally required broker-dealers to prepare and
file a financial report with the Commission and the broker-dealer’s DEA, as well as a report of a
PCAOB-registered independent public accountant covering the financial report. Brokers-dealers
also were required to file concurrently with the audited financial report a material inadequacy
report prepared by the independent public accountant.
With regard to the material inadequacy report, broker-dealers generally made
representations to their independent public accountants about their compliance with certain
750

See SIPC, Annual Report 2011, at 6.

751

Id. See also Commission, Study of Unsafe and Unsound Practices of Brokers and Dealers: Report and
Recommendations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (December 1971) (discussing the financial
crisis of 1968–1970). Since its inception through 2001, SIPC initiated 299 proceedings under SIPA.

752

See discussion above in section II.B.6. of this release.

214

financial responsibility rules in a representation letter. 753 However, broker-dealers did not file
reports with the Commission or their DEA containing such representations. GAAS does not
prescribe specific or standardized representations to be made by a broker-dealer to its accountant
with regard to an attestation engagement performed under Rule 17a-5. 754 Therefore, brokerdealers’ representations to their independent public accountant relating to compliance with
certain financial responsibility rules varied depending on what was required by the terms of the
individual engagements.
ii.

Engagement of the Accountant

As noted above, prior to today’s amendments, broker-dealers generally were required to
file with the Commission: (1) a report of an independent public accountant based on an audit of
the broker-dealer’s financial statements and supporting schedules; and (2) a material inadequacy
report prepared by the accountant, based on, among other things, a review of a broker-dealer’s
accounting system, internal accounting control, and procedures for safeguarding securities. The
accountant was required to be registered with the PCAOB. However, Rule 17a-5 required that
the audit be performed in accordance with GAAS, which are issued by the AICPA.
Consequently, the standard setting body for broker-dealer audits has been the AICPA (rather
than the PCAOB) notwithstanding the requirement that broker-dealers be audited by a PCAOBregistered independent public accountant. 755

753

See, e.g., AICPA Broker-Dealer Audit Guide app. H (sample representation letter).

754

According to GAAS, auditors “should consider obtaining a representation letter” in an examination or
review engagement, and “specific written representations will depend on the circumstances of the
engagement and the nature of the subject matter and the criteria.” See AICPA, AT Section 101 at ¶ .60.
Further, while the AICPA Broker-Dealer Audit Guide contains a sample representation letter, publications
such as this guide “are not auditing standards” but are “recommendations on the application of the [auditing
standards] in specific circumstances, including engagements for entities in specialized industries.” See
AICPA, AU Section 150, at ¶ .05.

755

See below discussion in section VII.C.1.i. of this release.

215

With regard to the independent public accountant’s preparation of the material
inadequacy report, Rule 17a-5 required that the scope of the accountant’s review be sufficient to
provide “reasonable assurance” that any material inadequacies 756 existing at the date of
examination would be disclosed. As discussed above in section II.D.3. of this release, the
AICPA Broker-Dealer Audit Guide provided guidance regarding preparation of the material
inadequacy report. Specifically, AICPA guidance stated that the material inadequacy report
should address what the independent public accountant concluded in its “study” of the adequacy
of the broker-dealer’s practices and procedures in complying with the financial responsibility
rules in relation to the definition of material inadequacy as stated in Rule 17a-5. The requirement
to issue a “study” does not generally exist outside the context of broker-dealer audits, however,
and, while auditing standards at one time referred to the performance of a study, current auditing
standards no longer contain such references.
If the broker-dealer was exempt from Rule 15c3-3, Rule 17a-5 required the independent
public accountant to ascertain that the conditions of the exemption were being complied with as
of the examination date and that no facts came to the independent public accountant’s attention
to indicate that the exemption had not been complied with during the period since the last
examination.
iii.

Filing of Annual Reports with SIPC

Prior to today’s amendments, broker-dealers that are members of SIPC were required to
756

Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (g)(3) of Rule 17a-5 describes a “material inadequacy” in a brokerdealer’s accounting system, internal accounting controls, procedures for safeguarding securities, and
practices and procedures to include “any condition which has contributed substantially to or, if appropriate
corrective action is not taken, could reasonably be expected to: (i) inhibit a broker or dealer from promptly
completing securities transactions or promptly discharging his responsibilities to customers, other brokers
or dealers or creditors; (ii) result in material financial loss; (iii) result in material misstatements in the
broker’s or dealer’s financial statements; or (iv) result in violations of the Commission’s recordkeeping or
financial responsibility rules to an extent that could reasonably be expected to result in the conditions
described in [(i) through (iii) above].” 17 CFR 240.17a-5.

216

file only limited information with SIPC. This information is elicited on Form SIPC-6, the
“General Assessment Payment Form” and Form SIPC-7, the “Annual General Assessment
Reconciliation.” In addition, for any period during which the SIPC assessment was not a
minimum assessment as provided for in section 4(d)(1)(c) of SIPA, paragraph (e)(4) of Rule 17a5 generally required broker-dealers to submit to SIPC a supplemental report on the status of the
membership of the broker-dealer in SIPC. The supplemental report, among other things, had to
include a comparison of the amounts reflected in the annual financial report the broker-dealer
filed with the Commission with amounts reported on Form SIPC-7. Form SIPC-6 is filed for the
first half of the fiscal year and Form SIPC-7 is filed at the end of the fiscal year with a place to
deduct the assessment due and paid as reflected on Form SIPC-6. These forms elicit information
from a broker-dealer that is a SIPC member about the broker-dealer’s sources of revenue
attributable to its securities business.
Prior to today’s amendments, broker-dealers did not file with SIPC the annual audited
financial statements and accompanying schedules and reports they filed with the Commission
and their DEA under Rule 17a-5. Therefore, for example, broker-dealers did not file their
balance sheets, which contain information concerning their assets, liabilities, and net worth, or
notes to their financial statements with SIPC. This information is necessary to understand the
financial conditions of the broker-dealer and, therefore, in order for SIPC to determine whether
the SIPC Fund is appropriately sized to the risks of the broker-dealer industry.
iv.

Notification Requirements

Prior to today’s amendments, the reporting provisions of Rule 17a-5 included references
to the term “material inadequacy.” 757 The term also was used in the Rule 17a-5 and Rule 17a-11

757

See supra note 756, at 216.

217

notification provisions discussed below.
Rule 17a-5 required that if, during the course of the audit, the independent public
accountant determined that any material inadequacies existed, the independent public accountant
was required to inform the CFO of the broker-dealer, who was required to give notice to the
Commission and the broker-dealer’s DEA within 24 hours. The rule also provided that the
broker-dealer must furnish the independent public accountant with the notice. If the independent
public accountant failed to receive the notice within the 24-hour period, or if the accountant
disagreed with the statements contained in the notice, the accountant was required to inform the
Commission and the DEA within the next 24 hours and describe any material inadequacies found
to exist or, if the broker-dealer filed a notice, detail the aspects of the broker-dealer’s notice with
which the accountant did not agree.
In addition, Rule 17a-11 required that when a broker-dealer discovers a material
inadequacy, or is notified by its independent public accountant under Rule 17a-5 that a material
inadequacy exists, the broker-dealer must notify the Commission and its DEA and must transmit
a report stating what the broker-dealer has done or is doing to correct the situation.
v.

Information Provided to Customers

Prior to today’s amendments, Rule 17a-5 provided that, if the independent public
accountant commented on any material inadequacies, the financial information a broker-dealer
was required to send to customers annually must include a statement that a copy of the
accountant’s report and comments was available for customers’ inspection. In addition, Rule
17a-5 provided a conditional exemption from the requirement that a broker-dealer send paper
copies of financial information to customers, if the broker-dealer was not required during the
prior year to give notice of a material inadequacy.

218

vi.

Access to Accountants

Prior to today’s amendments, carrying and clearing broker-dealers were not required to
provide Commission and DEA examination staff access to their independent public accountants
and accountant work papers. Such access would enable Commission and DEA examiners to
obtain information, for example, regarding areas on which the accountants focused in order to
plan and conduct risk-based examinations of carrying and clearing broker-dealers.
vii.

Form Custody

Generally, prior to today’s amendments, broker-dealers were not required to provide
comprehensive or consolidated information about their custody practices to the Commission or
their DEA. Some information relating to a broker-dealer’s custody practices is included in a
broker-dealer’s exchange membership agreements and clearing agreements, and in the books and
records of the broker-dealer. In addition, some information is included on Form ADV and,
therefore, if the broker-dealer also is a registered investment adviser, the information is available
to the Commission. Although Commission and DEA examiners could obtain the information
provided on Form Custody through detailed examinations of the broker-dealer’s books and
records and by requesting information from other sources, the Commission and the brokerdealer’s DEA did not have a profile of a broker-dealer’s custodial activities that could serve as a
starting point to perform more focused examinations.
C.

Costs and Benefits of the Rule Amendments

This section discusses costs and benefits of the rule amendments and new forms for the
affected parties against the economic baseline identified above, both in terms of each of the
specific changes from the baseline, as well as in terms of the overall impact. In considering
these costs, benefits, and impacts, this discussion addresses, among other things, comments

219

received, modifications made to the proposed amendments and form, and reasonable alternatives,
where applicable.
The costs incurred by a broker-dealer to comply with the rule amendments and new form
generally will depend on its size and the complexity of its business activities. Because the size
and complexity of broker-dealers vary significantly as indicated in the economic baseline, their
costs could vary significantly. In some cases, the Commission is providing estimates of the
average cost per broker-dealer across all broker-dealers, taking into consideration the variance in
the size of broker-dealers and the complexity of their business activities.
1.

Broker-Dealer Annual Reporting Amendments
i.

Changing the Broker-Dealer Audit Standard Setter from the
AICPA to the PCAOB and the Standards from GAAS to
PCAOB Standards

Today’s amendments require that audits of broker-dealer financial statements and
schedules be conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, thereby replacing the
AICPA as the standard setter. The amendments also require that broker-dealers file one of two
new reports – either a compliance report or an exemption report – and a report of an independent
public accountant based on an examination of the compliance report or a review of the
exemption report. This section discusses the costs and benefits of the change from the AICPA to
the PCAOB as the standard setter for broker-dealer audits and the corresponding change from
GAAS to PCAOB standards with respect to the audit of the financial statements and schedules.
The costs and benefits of requiring the use of PCAOB standards with respect to examinations
and reviews of the new compliance report and exemption report are discussed separately below
in section VII.C.1.iii. of this economic analysis regarding the engagement of the accountant.

220

The change from the AICPA to the PCAOB as standard setter for broker-dealer audits
and the corresponding change from GAAS to PCAOB auditing standards for audits of brokerdealer financial reports and supporting schedules provides several benefits. By requiring that
these audits be conducted in accordance with PCAOB standards, the amendments align Rule
17a-5 with statutory provisions. As discussed above, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act amended the
Exchange Act to require that certain broker-dealer financial reports filed with the Commission be
audited by an accounting firm registered with the PCAOB. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July
2010, amended the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to provide the PCAOB with explicit authority to, among
other things, establish (subject to Commission approval) auditing and related attestation, quality
control, ethics, and independence standards for registered public accounting firms with respect to
their preparation of audit reports to be included in broker-dealer filings with the Commission,
and the authority to conduct an inspection program of registered public accounting firms that
audit broker-dealers. 758 However, Rule 17a-5 provided that broker-dealer audits be performed in
accordance with GAAS; namely, auditing standards issued by the AICPA.
After today’s amendments, the PCAOB will be the standard setter for two types of
entities: issuers that are public companies and broker-dealers. Given this mandate, the PCAOB
can focus on establishing standards tailored to these types of entities. For example, with respect
to the audit of the financial report, the PCAOB has proposed a standard for auditing
supplemental information accompanying audited financial statements filed with the Commission,
including supporting schedules broker-dealers must file with the Commission and the brokerdealer’s DEA, such as schedules regarding the computation of net capital and the customer
reserve requirement and information related to the broker-dealer’s possession or control of

758

See Pub. L. No. 111-203 § 982.

221

customer securities. 759 In addition, the PCAOB included the Commission’s proposal to amend
Rule 17a-5 as one of the factors that led the PCAOB to “reexamine its requirements regarding
supplemental information.” 760 Consequently, the PCAOB has proposed a standard that would be
used for the supplemental reports to the broker-dealer’s financial report. 761 The PCAOB stated
that “[t]he proposed standard enhances existing PCAOB standards by: (1) [r]equiring the auditor
to perform certain audit procedures to test and evaluate the supplemental information, and (2)
[e]stablishing requirements that promote enhanced coordination between the work performed on
the supplemental information with work performed on the financial statement audit and other
engagements, such as a compliance attestation engagement for brokers and dealers.” 762
The change to the PCAOB as the audit standard setter for broker-dealers should facilitate
the development of the PCAOB’s permanent inspection program as contemplated by the DoddFrank Act, because audits of broker-dealers will be inspected by the PCAOB in accordance with
its own standards, and not those of another standard setter, and because of feedback that can be
obtained through the inspections process regarding gaps and areas that may need improvement.
Further, the Commission has direct oversight authority over the PCAOB, including the ability to
approve or disapprove the PCAOB’s rules. 763 This may help to increase investor confidence in

759

See Proposed Auditing Standard, Auditing Supplemental Information Accompanying Audited Financial
Statements and Related Amendments to PCAOB Standards, PCAOB Release No. 2011-05, PCAOB
Rulemaking Docket Matter No. 036, 3 (July 12, 2011) (“PCAOB Proposed Auditing Standard for
Supplemental Information”). As discussed above, the PCAOB has also proposed standards for attestation
engagements related to broker-dealer compliance or exemption reports. See PCAOB Proposing Release.

760

See PCAOB Proposed Auditing Standard for Supplemental Information at 2–3.

761

Id. at 2 (“The proposed standard would benefit investors and other users of financial statements by updating
and enhancing the required audit procedures when the auditor of the financial statements is engaged to
audit and report on whether supplemental information accompanying the financial statements is fairly
stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole.”).

762

Id. at 4–5.

763

Section 107 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act states that no rule of the PCAOB “shall become effective without
prior approval of the Commission in accordance with this section, other than as provided in section

222

the independent public accountants that audit broker-dealers. In addition, as previously stated,
the Commission has greater confidence in the quality of audits conducted by an independent
public accountant registered with, and subject to regular inspection by, the PCAOB. 764
As an alternative approach, one commenter argued that GAAS should apply for audits of
non-carrying broker-dealers. 765 Another commenter stated that PCAOB standards should apply
only for broker-dealers “permanently subject to PCAOB inspection,” and that the Commission
should not require that audits of broker-dealers be performed in accordance with PCAOB
standards for non-issuer broker-dealers until the PCAOB determines which non-issuer brokerdealers will be subject to its permanent inspection program. 766
The Commission has determined that all audits of broker-dealer financial statements and
supporting schedules should be performed in accordance with PCAOB standards for several
reasons. First, allowing the use of more than one auditing standard would introduce
inconsistencies in audits of broker-dealer financial reports. Second, allowing the use of nonPCAOB auditing standards for certain broker-dealer audits would reduce the benefits discussed
above of requiring that all audits of broker-dealer financial reports be conducted in accordance
with PCAOB standards. Third, as discussed in more detail below, the switch from GAAS to
PCAOB standards should not result in significant incremental costs.
Independent public accountants that audit issuers are already familiar with PCAOB audit
standards, which should ease any transition to PCAOB standards for their audits of broker103(a)(3)(B) with respect to initial or transitional standards.” See Pub. L. No. 107-204 § 107. This section
also states that the Commission “shall approve a proposed rule, if it finds that the rule is consistent with the
requirements of this Act and the securities laws, or is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors”, and generally provides that the proposed rule procedures follow the same rule
filing procedure for SROs under section 19(b) of the Exchange Act. Id.

dealers. Although the retention of two standards could reduce the incremental costs of switching
from GAAS to PCAOB standards for some independent public accountants that do not audit
issuers, it would not reduce the incremental costs for all such independent public accountants.
For example, a requirement that the financial statements of one class of broker-dealer be audited
in accordance with GAAS and the financial statements of another class of broker-dealer be
audited in accordance with PCAOB standards would avoid the incremental costs only for
independent public accountants that limit their audit engagements to the former class of brokerdealer. These independent public accountants would not need to stay current with PCAOB
standards and adopt their procedures to those standards. However, independent public
accountants that were engaged to audit broker-dealers in both classes would need to stay current
with both sets of standards and adopt their procedures to both sets of standards, which could
increase their incremental costs. Further, the PCAOB may determine, subject to Commission
approval, to adopt specific auditing standards for certain types of broker-dealers (for example,
carrying and non-carrying broker-dealers). This could decrease costs for certain broker-dealer
audits.
The Commission received several comments on the costs of its proposal to replace
GAAS with PCAOB standards with respect to audits of broker-dealer financial reports. Several
commenters stated that the Commission did not address the costs associated with the change
from GAAS to PCAOB standards. 767 One commenter also stated that the transition to PCAOB
standards from GAAS may require substantial revisions to broker-dealer audit programs. 768
Current PCAOB standards for audits of financial information generally incorporate
concepts and requirements contained within GAAS, thereby minimizing the potential costs of
767

See, e.g., McGladrey Letter; SIFMA Letter.

768

See ABA Letter.

224

this change to independent public accountants that audit broker-dealers. For example, in April
2003, the PCAOB adopted interim auditing standards consisting of GAAS then in existence, to
the extent not superseded or amended by the PCAOB. 769 The PCAOB’s website lists 50 such
standards, including, for example, a standard relating to auditing accounting estimates (AU 342)
and a standard relating to auditing fair value measurements and disclosures (AU 328). 770 The
PCAOB has adopted, and the Commission has approved, 16 PCAOB auditing standards,
beginning with a standard relating to references in audit reports to PCAOB standards. 771
While some independent public accountants of broker-dealers may incur one-time
implementation costs to update their broker-dealer audit programs to reflect PCAOB standards,
the costs should not be significant. As stated above, most of the PCAOB’s current standards for
audits of financial reports incorporate concepts and requirements contained within GAAS. Thus,
the independent public accountants of broker-dealers already should be familiar with many of the
PCAOB’s standards. In addition, as discussed in the economic baseline, the AICPA from timeto-time updates and revises its standards. On such an occurrence, an independent public
accountant would need to take steps to become familiar with the updates and revisions and
change its broker-dealer audit program accordingly. This need for continuing education
presumably already is priced into the audit fees independent public accountants charge brokerdealers.
In contrast to the views expressed by some commenters, the Commission does not expect
that a requirement that an audit of financial statements and supporting schedules be conducted in
769

See PCAOB Auditing Standards (AS) and Interim Auditing Standards (AU) (2013), available at
www.pcaobus.org/standards/auditing.

770

Id.

771

See PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1 (AS No. 1). At least one of these audit standards would not apply to
audits of broker-dealer financial reports. See PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5, “An Audit of Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting that is Integrated with an Audit of Financial Statements.”

225

accordance with standards of the PCAOB instead of with GAAS will result in substantial
changes for broker-dealer audit programs and therefore the Commission does not anticipate that
this change will result in significant costs to broker-dealers in the form of increased audit fees. 772
ii.

Requirement to File New Reports

Under the amendments, a broker-dealer will need to file one of two new reports: a
compliance report or an exemption report. 773 A carrying broker-dealer (i.e., one that does not
claim an exemption from Rule 15c3-3) must file the compliance report, and a broker-dealer that
claimed an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year must file the
exemption report. In the reports, a broker-dealer must make certain statements and provide
certain information relating to the financial responsibility rules. In addition to preparing and
filing the compliance report, a carrying broker-dealer must engage the PCAOB-registered
independent public accountant to prepare a report based on an examination of certain statements
in the broker-dealer’s compliance report. 774 A broker-dealer that claimed an exemption from
Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recently ended fiscal year must engage the PCAOB-registered
independent public accountant to prepare a report based on a review of certain statements in the
broker-dealer’s exemption report. In each case, the examination or review must be conducted in
accordance with PCAOB standards.
a.

Compliance Report

Under the amendments, a carrying broker-dealer must prepare and file with the
Commission a new compliance report each year, along with a report prepared by a PCAOB-

772

As discussed in section V. of this release, the Commission has delayed the compliance date for this
requirement to provide sufficient time for broker-dealers and their accountants to prepare to comply with
the new requirement.

773

See discussion above in sections II.B.1., II.B.3., and II.B.4. of this release.

774

See paragraphs (f)(1) and (g)(2)(i) of Rule 17a-5.

226

registered independent public accountant based on an examination of certain statements made in
the compliance report in accordance with PCAOB standards. 775 The compliance report must
contain statements as to whether: (1) the broker-dealer has established and maintained Internal
Control Over Compliance; (2) the Internal Control Over Compliance of the broker-dealer was
effective during the most recent fiscal year; (3) the Internal Control Over Compliance of the
broker-dealer was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year; (4) the broker-dealer was
in compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 as of the end of the most
recent fiscal year; and (5) the information the broker-dealer used to state whether it was in
compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 was derived from the books and
records of the broker-dealer. In addition, if applicable, the compliance report must contain a
description of: (1) each identified material weakness in the Internal Control Over Compliance
during the most recent fiscal year, including those that were identified as of the end of the fiscal
year; and (2) any instance of non-compliance with Rule 15c3-1 or paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3
as of the end of the most recent fiscal year.
The compliance report requirements provide a number of benefits. For example,
specifying and standardizing the statements required in the compliance report should promote
consistent compliance with Rule 17a-5 and should ensure that the Commission receives
information relating to aspects of a carrying broker-dealer’s compliance with the financial
responsibility rules that are of particular concern. Although, as discussed above in section
II.D.3. of this release, current auditing standards require that independent public accountants
obtain written representations from management as part of the audits of financial statements and
attestation engagements, GAAS only provide examples of management representations and do

775

See discussion above in sections II.B.1., II.B.3., and II.D.3. of this release.

227

not mandate that specific management representations be made. By clearly specifying and
standardizing the statements, the compliance report should increase consistency with respect to
the matters examined by the independent public accountants as part of the examination of the
compliance report.
The specification and standardization of the statements also should facilitate Commission
and DEA oversight of broker-dealer compliance with the financial responsibility rules to the
benefit of broker-dealer customers, by helping the Commission and DEAs to more quickly
identify broker-dealers with potential problems. Moreover, as adopted, the final rule requires a
broker-dealer’s compliance report to include information regarding whether the broker-dealer’s
internal control was effective as of the end of the fiscal year, in addition to information regarding
whether there were material weaknesses in the Internal Control Over Compliance during the
fiscal year. This will provide the Commission and the DEA with information on whether the
broker-dealer has taken action by the end of the fiscal year to cure any material weaknesses in
the Internal Control Over Compliance that existed during the fiscal year.
Requiring the compliance report to be filed with the Commission and the broker-dealer’s
DEA also should increase broker-dealers’ focus on ensuring the accuracy of the statements being
made and enhance compliance with the financial responsibility rules given the penalties for false
filings. For example, filers are subject to penalties for willfully making false statements in any
application, report, or document filed with the Commission.776
One commenter stated that incremental benefits of having the assertion in the compliance
report with respect to internal controls pertain to the whole year rather than the fiscal year end

776

See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. 78ff(a).

228

does not justify the costs. 777 In response, the Commission notes that key requirements in the
financial responsibility rules must be complied with on an on-going basis throughout the year.
Therefore, it is critical to have internal controls over compliance with these rules that are
effective throughout the year rather than just at fiscal year end. Therefore, the Commission
believes that there are benefits to having a carrying broker-dealer state that its Internal Control
Over Compliance was effective throughout the year.
Broker-dealers will incur costs associated with preparing the compliance report. The
level of effort required by carrying broker-dealers to prepare a compliance report will depend on
the nature of the activities of the broker-dealer. For example, the controls necessary for a
carrying broker-dealer that engages in limited custodial activities generally should be less
complex than the controls necessary for a carrying broker-dealer that engages in more extensive
custodial activities. Therefore, a carrying broker-dealer with limited custodial activities should
have to expend less effort to make its statements in the compliance report relating to the
effectiveness of its Internal Control Over Compliance. To the extent that the amount of custodial
activity is related to the size of a broker-dealer, the cost of preparing the compliance report
should be lower for smaller carrying broker-dealers.
The Commission estimated in the proposing release that, on average, carrying brokerdealers would spend approximately 60 hours each year to prepare the proposed compliance
report. 778 One commenter stated that the proposal did not “address the additional costs brokerdealers would incur in preparing Compliance Reports.” 779 However, the commenter did not
comment on the estimated hour burden or provide specific data and analysis on the additional
777

229

costs that broker-dealers would incur in preparing compliance reports. Another commenter
stated that the proposed estimate of 60 hours “is not an accurate estimate of the time burden to
complete the Compliance Report” and that the burdens in the proposing release are
understated. 780 This commenter, however, did not provide a quantified alternative estimate of
the costs or specific data to support its statement.
The Commission is retaining the 60-hour estimate for the reasons discussed below. The
final rules contain two changes from the proposal that could result in lower costs than if the rules
had been adopted as proposed: (1) elimination of the concepts of “material non-compliance” and
“compliance in all material respects” with Rule 15c3-1 and 15c3-3 for the purposes of reporting
in the compliance report; and (2) a narrowing of these statements and description requirements
from compliance with all of the financial responsibility rules to compliance with Rule 15c3-1
and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3.
As previously discussed, many commenters raised concerns about how firms would
determine whether an instance of non-compliance constitutes material non-compliance. 781
Commenters urged the Commission to provide guidance with additional specific examples or
quantitative and qualitative factors to be considered when determining whether non-compliance
was material, 782 or proposing alternate definitions or examples of non-compliance that should
not be regarded as material. 783 Under the rules as adopted, broker-dealers will not be required to
conduct a separate evaluation of materiality when determining instances of non-compliance that

230

must be reported. This should reduce the likelihood that inconsistent approaches be taken both
among broker-dealers and between broker-dealers and their independent public accountants.
The “material non-compliance” and “compliance in all material respects” concepts were
designed to limit the types of instances of non-compliance that would need to be identified in the
report. To retain a limiting principle, the final rule focuses on provisions that trigger notification
requirements when they are not complied with, namely, Rule 15c3-1 and the customer reserve
requirement in paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3. 784 Any instances of non-compliance with these
requirements as of the fiscal year end must be described in the compliance report. As stated in
the proposing release, failing to maintain the required minimum amount of net capital under Rule
15c3-1 or failing to maintain the minimum deposit requirement in a special reserve bank account
under Rule 15c3-3 would have been instances of material non-compliance under the proposed
rule. 785 Accordingly, under the proposal, a broker-dealer would have been required to describe
all instances of non-compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3. Under the
proposal, a broker-dealer also would have been required to describe instances of material noncompliance with Rule 17a-13 and the Account Statement Rules. The final rule is narrower in
that a broker-dealer only is required to describe instances of non-compliance with Rule 15c3-1
and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3. While the final rules increase costs relative to the baseline,
they should result in modestly lower costs to broker-dealers relative to the proposal.
The final rule also retains the proposed requirement that the carrying broker-dealer
provide a description of each identified material weakness in the internal control of the brokerdealer over compliance with the financial responsibility rules, but, in conformity with other

784

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(6)(iv)(B), (a)(6)(v), (a)(7)(ii), (a)(7)(iii), (c)(2)(x)(B)(1), (c)(2)(x)(F)(3); 17
CFR 240.17a -11(b)–(c); 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(i).

785

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37577.

231

modifications to the proposal, the final rule specifies that the material weaknesses include those
identified during the most recent fiscal year as well as those that were identified as of the end of
the fiscal year. 786 The Commission believes that the modifications to the final rule discussed
above may modestly reduce the hour burden of the final rule as compared to the hour burden that
would have resulted from the proposed rule; namely, because a broker-dealer will not need to
evaluate whether instances of non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules are material
and will only need to report instances of non-compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of
Rule 15c3-3. While these modifications will result in additional costs to broker-dealers over the
baseline, they are not expected to increase costs over those estimated for the proposed rule. This
is because the proposed statement as to whether the broker-dealer’s Internal Control Over
Compliance was effective during the most recent fiscal year, and the related statement about
material weakness, would also cover the fiscal year end. As noted above, the modification to
require two statements (one covering the fiscal year and one covering the fiscal year end) was
prompted by commenter suggestions that broker-dealers be permitted to report the remediation
of a material weakness, or whether a material weakness still exists, at the end of the fiscal year.
These changes will provide information to the Commission and DEAs as to whether material
weaknesses during the year have been remediated as of the fiscal year end. They also afford the
broker-dealer the opportunity to state in the report that a material weakness has been remediated,
if applicable.
The changes discussed above, in some cases, may result in a modest reduction in burden
relative to the proposal. However, while some commenters suggested that the proposing release
underestimated the burden, the Commission is not changing its estimate of the time required for

786

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(3)(i)(B).

232

a broker-dealer to prepare the compliance report. The Commission notes that, while commenters
questioned the estimate, they did not provide data that would enable the Commission to revise its
estimate.
The Commission, however, is updating its estimates of the number of broker-dealers that
would be required to file the compliance report, which affects the cost estimates. The
Commission now estimates that there are approximately 292 carrying broker-dealers. Therefore,
the Commission estimates that the time required for all 292 carrying broker-dealers to prepare
the report is approximately 17,520 hours per year. 787 Further, the Commission estimates that the
total cost 788 associated with this requirement is approximately $5.6 million per year. 789
b.

Exemption Report

Broker-dealers that claim an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 are required to file an
exemption report and a report of the independent public accountant based on a review of the
exemption report. The exemption report must contain the following statements made to the best
knowledge and belief of the broker-dealer: (1) a statement that identifies the provisions in
787

See discussion above in section VI.D.1.ii. of this release. 60 hours x 292 carrying broker-dealers = 17,520
hours per year.

788

For purposes of this economic analysis, salary data is from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association (“SIFMA”) Report on Management and Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2011
(“SIFMA Report on Management and Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry”), which provides
base salary and bonus information for middle-management and professional positions within the securities
industry. The salary costs derived from the report and referenced in this cost benefit section are modified
to account for an 1800-hour work year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee
benefits, and overhead.

789

See discussion above in section VI.D.1.ii. of this release. Based on staff experience, the Commission
believes that a carrying broker-dealer likely would have a Compliance Manager gather information
necessary to validate the statements to be provided and that it would take the Compliance Manager
approximately 45 hours to perform this task. In addition, the Commission believes that a carrying brokerdealer likely would have a Chief Compliance Officer review the information and make the attestation and
that it would take the Chief Compliance Officer approximately 15 hours per year to perform this task.
According to the SIFMA Report on Management and Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry, as
modified by Commission staff to account for an 1,800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account
for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and overhead, the hourly cost of a Compliance Manager is
approximately $279/hour, and the hourly cost of a Chief Compliance Officer is approximately $433/hour.
292 carrying broker-dealers x 45 hours x $279 = $3,666,060. 292 carrying broker-dealers x 15 hours x
$433 = $1,896,540. $3,666,060 + $1,896,540 = $5,562,600 per year.

233

paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 under which the broker-dealer claimed an exemption from Rule
15c3-3; (2) a statement the broker-dealer met the identified exemption provisions in paragraph
(k) of Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year without exception or that it met the
identified exemption provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent
fiscal year except as described in the exemption report; and (3) if applicable, a statement that
identifies each exception during the most recent fiscal year in meeting the identified provisions
in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 and that briefly describes the nature of each exception and the
approximate date(s) on which the exception existed.
The preparation of exemption reports by broker-dealers that claim an exemption from
Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year, as well as reviews of certain statements in
the exemption reports by independent public accountants, should strengthen and facilitate
consistent compliance with the Commission’s financial responsibility rules, for many of the
same reasons identified above with respect to the compliance report. Among other things, these
reports should enhance compliance with the exemption provisions in Rule 15c3-3, thereby
providing better protection of customer assets. This increased focus is enhanced further by
requiring the direct filing of the exemption report with the Commission and the broker-dealer’s
DEA because of the potential penalties for false statements. In addition, the Commission and the
broker-dealer’s DEA will benefit from the information provided in the exemption report in
conducting their supervisory oversight of the broker-dealer.
The Commission considered an alternative suggested by one commenter to replace the
exemption report with a box to check on the FOCUS Report. 790 After careful consideration of
this alternative, the Commission determined that it is not an appropriate alternative to the

790

See Angel Letter.

234

exemption report. As discussed above in section II.B.4.iii. of this release, a broker-dealer
claiming an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 already is required to indicate the basis for the
exemption on its FOCUS Report. 791 Second, the exemption report requires the broker-dealer to
make certain statements that the independent public accountant must review. Thus, the
exemption report will provide a standardized statement across all broker-dealers claiming an
exemption from Rule 15c3-3 for the independent public accountant to review. Third, the
exemption report will provide the Commission and the broker-dealer’s DEA with more
information than currently is reported by non-carrying broker-dealer’s in the FOCUS Report.
Specifically, it requires the broker-dealer to, among other things, state either that it met the
identified exemption provisions in paragraph (k) throughout the most recent fiscal year without
exception or that it met the identified exemption provisions throughout the most recent fiscal
year except as described in the report. This will provide the Commission and the broker-dealer’s
DEA with information as to whether a broker-dealer is meeting the exemption provisions of
paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 (not simply that the broker-dealer is claiming the exemption as is
reported in the FOCUS Report). The Commission expects that non-carrying broker-dealers
generally track exceptions as part of monitoring compliance with the exemption provisions in
paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3. Fourth, requiring that the exemption report be filed with the
Commission should increase broker-dealers’ focus on the statements being made, facilitating
consistent compliance with the exemption provisions in Rule 15c3-3, and therefore, providing
better protection of customer assets. Further, employing a “check the box” alternative would not
substantially reduce compliance costs because the broker-dealer would need to take steps to
ascertain that it has a valid basis for claiming the exemption, whether or not these steps result in

791

See Item 24 of Part IIa of the FOCUS Report.

235

an exemption report or “check the box.”
The Commission estimated that it would take a non-carrying broker-dealer approximately
five hours to prepare and file the proposed exemption report. 792 The Commission did not receive
comments specifically addressing this estimate. However, because the rule was modified from
the proposal to also require the identification of exceptions to the exemption provisions, the
Commission is increasing the estimate to seven hours. 793 The Commission now estimates that
there are approximately 4,417 non-carrying broker-dealers that must file exemption reports.
Therefore, the Commission estimates that the annual reporting burden for all non-carrying
broker-dealers to prepare and file the exemption report is approximately 30,919 hours per
year. 794 The Commission estimates that the total industry-wide cost to prepare the exemption
report is approximately $9.3 million per year. 795
iii.

Engagement of the Accountant

As discussed above, the amendments to Rule 17a-5 eliminate the requirement that the
broker-dealer’s independent public accountant prepare, and the broker-dealer file with the
Commission and its DEA concurrently with its annual audited financial statements, a material
792

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37596.

793

See discussion above in section VI.D.1.iii. of this release.

794

See discussion above in section VI.D.1.iii. of this release. 7 hours x 4,417 non-carrying broker-dealers =
30,919 hours per year. See the discussion below regarding the external costs associated with obtaining the
accountant’s report on the exemption report.

795

See discussion above in section VI.D.1.iii. of this release. Based on staff experience, a non-carrying
broker-dealer likely would have a Compliance Manager gather information necessary to validate the
information to be provided in the exemption report, and it would take the Compliance Manager
approximately six hours to perform this task. In addition, a non-carrying broker-dealer likely would have a
Chief Compliance Officer review the information and make the attestation, and it would take the Chief
Compliance Officer approximately one hour to perform this task. According to the SIFMA Report on
Management and Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry, as modified by Commission staff to
account for an 1,800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee
benefits and overhead, the hourly cost of a Compliance Manager is approximately $279/hour, and the
hourly cost of a Chief Compliance Officer is approximately $433/hour. 4,417 non-carrying broker-dealers
x 6 hours x $279 = $7,394,058 per year. 4,417 non-carrying broker-dealers x 1 hour x $433 = $1,912,561
per year. $7,394,058 + $1,912,561 = $9,306,619 per year.

236

inadequacy report, based on, among other things, a review of a broker-dealer’s accounting
system, internal accounting control, and procedures for safeguarding securities. The
amendments replace this requirement with a requirement, among other things, that the brokerdealer file with its annual reports a report prepared by an accountant covering either the brokerdealer’s compliance report or exemption report, as applicable. The accountant engaged by the
broker-dealer must, as part of the engagement, undertake to prepare its reports based on an
examination of certain statements in the compliance report or a review of certain statements in
the exemption report, as applicable, in accordance with PCAOB standards.
With regard to the independent public accountant’s preparation of the material
inadequacy report, Rule 17a-5 required that the scope of the accountant’s review be sufficient to
provide “reasonable assurance” that any material inadequacies existing at the date of
examination would be disclosed. If the broker-dealer was exempt from Rule 15c3-3, Rule 17a-5
provided that the accountant must ascertain that the conditions of the exemption were being
complied with as of the examination date and that no facts came to the accountant’s attention to
indicate that the conditions of the exemption had not been complied with since the last
examination. As discussed above, AICPA guidance provided that the material inadequacy report
should address what the independent public accountant concluded in its “study” of the adequacy
of the broker-dealer’s practices and procedures in complying with the financial responsibility
rules in relation to the definition of material inadequacy as stated in Rule 17a-5. 796
However, in the PCAOB’s first report on the progress of its interim inspection program
of broker-dealer audits, the PCAOB stated that as to 21 of the 23 audits inspected, the accountant
“failed to perform sufficient audit procedures to obtain reasonable assurance that any material

796

See AICPA Broker-Dealer Audit Guide at ¶ 3.77.

237

inadequacies found to exist since the date of the last examination . . . would have been disclosed
in the accountant’s supplement report.” 797 Further, for all of the 14 audits of broker-dealers that
claimed an exemption from Rule 15c3-3, the PCAOB stated that the accountant “did not perform
sufficient procedures to ascertain that the broker or dealer complied with the conditions of the
exemption.” 798 The deficiencies noted in the PCAOB’s report on the progress of the interim
inspection program provide further support for the amendments that the Commission is adopting
today to establish the foundation for the PCAOB’s development of standards that are tailored to
Rule 17a-5, and to strengthen and facilitate consistent compliance with broker-dealer audit and
reporting requirements.
Generally, the engagement of accountant amendments should result in higher levels of
compliance with the Commission’s financial responsibility rules by increasing the focus of

carrying broker-dealers and their independent public accountants on specific statements made in
the compliance report relating to the broker-dealer’s compliance, and internal control over
compliance, with the financial responsibility rules and increasing the focus of non-carrying
broker-dealers and their independent public accountants on whether the broker-dealer meets the
exemption provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3. These amendments also clarify the scope
and the standards that apply to broker-dealer audits and conform language in the rule with
terminology in existing audit literature, which should reduce inconsistencies in broker-dealer
compliance with Rule 17a-5. The replacement of the material inadequacy report with the report
based on an examination of the compliance report or review of the exemption report facilitates
the Commission’s objective to provide clear and consistent terminology focused separately on

797

See PCAOB Inspection Report at iii.

798

238

compliance with the financial responsibility rules and internal control over compliance with the
financial responsibility rules.
With regard to the examination of the compliance report, the amendments are intended to
encourage greater focus by the independent public accountant on Internal Control Over
Compliance, including, in particular, broker-dealer custody practices. By specifying the
statements that must be made by a broker-dealer to the Commission, and hence, examined by the
auditor, the compliance report should provide clarity and facilitate consistent compliance with
Rule 17a-5 by independent public accountants. Additionally, the focus of independent public
accountants on internal control over the custody practices of broker-dealers should better identify
broker-dealers that have weak internal controls for safeguarding investor securities and cash.
Similarly, with regard to the review of the exemption report, the amendments encourage greater
focus by the accountant on whether the broker-dealer has appropriately claimed an exemption
from Rule 15c3-3 by, among other things, reviewing whether the broker-dealer’s statements in
the exemption report as to meeting the exemption provisions without or with exceptions, and, if
applicable, identifying exceptions to meeting those provisions, were fairly stated. 799 As stated
above, the terminology in Rule 17a-5 with regard to the material inadequacy report was outdated
and inconsistent with current audit practices.
The PCAOB stated that its proposed attestation standards for examining compliance
reports and reviewing exemption reports were “tailored” to the proposed amendments to Rule
17a-5. 800 These standards, if adopted, are expected to establish a single and broker-dealerspecific approach to examining compliance reports and reviewing exemption reports and are
799

As stated above, a review engagement is designed to provide a moderate level of assurance, and the
accountant’s conclusion could state, for example, that no information came to the accountant’s attention
that indicates that the exemption report is not fairly stated in all material respects.

239

expected to enable the accountant to scale the engagement based on the broker-dealer’s size and
complexity.
Based on its estimates of the costs associated with the cost of an internal control report
under Rule 206(4)-2, the Commission estimated that the external cost to a carrying broker-dealer
of obtaining the independent public accountant’s report based on an examination of the proposed
compliance report would be an average incremental cost of approximately $150,000 per carrying
broker-dealer per year. 801 Based on staff experience, including communications with brokerdealers, broker-dealer independent public accountants, and independent public accountant
industry groups, the Commission estimated that the external cost to a non-carrying broker-dealer
of obtaining the independent public accountant’s report based on a review of the proposed
exemption report would cost an average of approximately $3,000 per non-carrying broker-dealer
per year. 802 Before today’s amendments, independent public accountants of broker-dealers were
required to prepare a material inadequacy report. As that report is no longer required, the costs
associated with engaging the independent public accountant to prepare a material inadequacy
report have been eliminated and replaced by the costs associated with engaging the independent
public accountant to prepare a report covering the compliance report or the exemption report.
Therefore, the incremental cost of today’s amendments related to the engagement of the
independent public accountant is the amount that the cost exceeds the cost of engaging the
independent public accountant to prepare the material inadequacy report. However, the

release.

802

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37600. The Commission estimated that the average cost of an audit
of a non-carrying broker-dealer’s financial report was approximately $30,000 per year, based on a weighted
average of estimates of that cost for broker-dealers with varying levels of net income. The Commission
further estimated that the additional cost for a review of the exemption report would be an average of
approximately $3,000 per non-carrying broker-dealer per year. Id. See also discussion above in section
VI.D.1.vii.c. of this release.

240

Commission has not previously estimated the average cost of preparing the material inadequacy
report. Consequently, the Commission is retaining the cost estimates set forth in the proposing
release, while recognizing that costs could be lower as a result of cost savings attributable to the
elimination of the material inadequacy report requirements.
The Commission received various comments regarding the engagement of accountant
provisions as they relate to examining or reviewing the proposed compliance reports and
exemption reports, respectively. One commenter stated that the Commission underestimated the
cost of examining the compliance report and that the Commission may need to consider the
PCAOB’s proposed rules before it can reasonably estimate this cost. 803 Another commenter
stated that the proposed amendments have “the potential to double the total current audit fees and
have a material impact” on firms. 804 A third commenter stated that the economic analysis was
“inconclusive” because the PCAOB has not yet established auditing and attestation standards for
broker-dealers. 805 The commenters, however, did not provide quantified alternative cost
estimates.
The Commission acknowledges that the total costs associated with these requirements
will depend on the final PCAOB standards for attestation engagements to examine compliance
reports or review exemption reports. However, as the PCAOB’s proposed standards were
tailored to the proposed amendments, nothing in those standards causes the Commission to
change its estimates of the costs associated with these requirements, or to question that the
benefits will justify the costs.

241

Before today’s amendments, Rule 17a-5 required the independent public accountant to,
among other things, review the accounting system, internal accounting control, and procedures
for safeguarding securities of the broker-dealer, including appropriate tests, for the period since
the prior examination date. The scope of the independent public accountant’s review was
required to be sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that any material inadequacies existing
at the date of the auditor examination would be disclosed. Similarly, an examination of a
compliance report performed under the PCAOB’s attestation standard for examination
engagements would require that the auditor obtain reasonable assurance to express an opinion on
whether the broker-dealer’s statements in the compliance report are fairly stated, in all material
respects. 806
Moreover, before today’s amendments, if a broker-dealer was exempt from Rule15c3-3,
Rule 17a-5 required the independent public accountant to “ascertain that the conditions of the
exemption were being complied with as of the examination date and that no facts came to [the
independent public accountant’s] attention to indicate that the exemption had not been complied
with during the period since [the independent public accountant’s] last examination.” 807 The
PCAOB’s proposed review standard for the exemption report would require that the independent
public accountant make inquiries and perform other procedures that are commensurate with the
auditor’s responsibility to obtain moderate assurance that the broker-dealer meets the identified
conditions for an exemption from Rule 15c3-3. 808 These procedures would include evaluating
806

See PCAOB Proposing Release at 5. An examination engagement is designed to provide a high level of
assurance. See, e.g., PCAOB Interim Attestation Standard, AT Section 101 at ¶ .54. In this case, the
accountant’s conclusion will be expressed in the form of an opinion. For example, the accountant’s
conclusion based on an examination of an assertion could state that in the accountant’s opinion, [the
assertion] is fairly stated in all material respects. See, e.g., PCAOB Interim Attestation Standard, AT
Section 101 at ¶ .84.

242

relevant evidence obtained from the audit of the financial statements and supporting schedules
and are designed to enable the auditor to scale the review engagement based on the brokerdealer’s size and complexity. 809
The compliance report as adopted includes an additional statement (relative to the
proposal) as to whether the broker-dealer’s Internal Control Over Compliance was effective as of
the end of the most recent fiscal year. Therefore, costs of compliance with the final rules may be
higher than costs of compliance with the proposed rules to the extent Internal Control Over
Compliance has changed near or as of the fiscal year end. However, this increased cost is not
expected to be significant, since the procedures needed to opine on these matters as of the fiscal
year end should not be materially different from the procedures employed to opine as to the
effectiveness of internal control over the course of the fiscal year.
As proposed, the broker-dealer would have been required to assert whether it was in
compliance, in all material respects, with all of the financial responsibility rules as of its fiscal
year end. As adopted, the broker-dealer must assert whether it is in compliance with Rule 15c31 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 (i.e., a narrower range of rule compliance than proposed).
This modification of the broker-dealer’s assertion could result in lower costs for accountants’
reports on the compliance report as compared to the proposal as the scope of the matters to be
covered by accountants’ examinations will be narrower.
Although these modifications could modestly lower costs associated with the
accountant’s report covering the compliance report as compared to the proposal, the Commission
is not changing its estimate of costs associated with accountants’ reports covering compliance
reports and exemption reports. Based on updated data, the Commission now estimates that there

809

Id. at 9.

243

are approximately 292 carrying broker-dealers. The Commission therefore estimates that the
industry-wide annual average incremental external reporting cost of accountants’ reports based
on examinations of compliance reports is approximately $44 million per year ($150,000 times
292 carrying broker-dealers = $43,800,000). 810 Based on updated data, the Commission now
estimates that there are approximately 4,417 non-carrying broker-dealers. The Commission
therefore estimates that the total industry-wide annual reporting cost of accountant’s reports
based on reviews of exemption reports is approximately $13.3 million per year (4,417 noncarrying broker-dealers times $3,000 = $13,251,000). 811 The Commission therefore estimates
that the total industry-wide incremental external annual reporting cost to broker-dealers
associated with the accountants’ reports covering the compliance report and exemption report is
approximately $57.3 million per year.
Finally, one commenter suggested that the Commission use an “agreed-upon procedures”
engagement for the exemption report. 812 This alternative was considered. The final rule,
however, requires a review engagement as proposed. Under an “agreed-upon procedures”
engagement, the independent public accountant is engaged by a client to issue a report of
findings based on specific procedures performed on subject matter that the specified parties
believe are appropriate. 813 Additionally, in an “agreed-upon procedures” engagement, the
independent public accountant does not perform an examination or a review, and does not
provide an opinion or negative assurance. Thus, no conclusion would be rendered as to the
broker-dealer’s statements in the exemption report.

Another commenter stated that the benefit of receiving an audit report covering the
exemption report would not justify the cost 814 and, similarly, a second commenter did not see a
benefit from the auditor attestation of the exemption report. 815 As noted above, before today’s
amendments, if a broker-dealer was exempt from Rule15c3-3, Rule 17a-5 required the
independent public accountant to “ascertain that the conditions of the exemption were being
complied with as of the examination date and that no facts came to [the independent public
accountant’s] attention to indicate that the exemption had not been complied with during the
period since [the independent public accountant’s] last examination.” 816 Consequently, the
current rule requires the independent public accountant to reach a conclusion with respect to a
broker-dealer’s claimed exemption from Rule 15c3-3.
The Commission believes the rule should continue to require a conclusion from the
independent public accountant on the broker-dealer’s claimed exemption from Rule 15c3-3
because of the importance of safeguarding customer securities and cash. While the Commission
anticipates there will be costs related to the audit of the exemption report, the Commission does
not believe it would be appropriate to use a lower standard (i.e., the agreed-upon procedures
standard) or have no requirement for the independent public accountant to perform any work
with respect to the exemption report.
iv.

Filing of Annual Reports with SIPC

The amendments to Rule 17a-5 require broker-dealers that are SIPC members to file their
annual reports with SIPC. SIPC plays an important role in the securities markets by serving as a
backstop to protect customers of a failed broker-dealer that cannot promptly return customer
814

245

securities and funds. In this capacity, SIPC has a legitimate interest in receiving the annual
reports of its broker-dealer members to assist it with its maintenance of the SIPC Fund and to
monitor trends in the broker-dealer industry. For example, SIPC presently obtains revenue
information from broker-dealers, through Form SIPC-7, to determine how best to structure
broker-dealer assessments to maintain the SIPC Fund at an appropriate level. However, the
information collected in the form is limited and may not assist SIPC in assessing whether the
SIPC Fund is appropriately sized to the risks of a large broker-dealer failure. The annual reports
contain much more detailed information about the assets, liabilities, income, net capital, and
Rule 15c3-3 customer reserve requirements of broker-dealers, and also include, for carrying
broker-dealers, a compliance report containing information about the broker-dealer’s compliance
with, and controls over compliance with, the broker-dealer financial responsibility rules. The
annual reports also generally include the independent public accountant’s reports covering the
financial report and compliance report or exemption report, as applicable, prepared by the
broker-dealer. This information also will assist SIPC in monitoring the financial strength of
broker-dealers and, therefore, in assessing the adequacy of the SIPC Fund.
In addition, by receiving the annual reports, SIPC may be able to overcome a potential
legal hurdle to pursuing claims against a broker-dealer’s accountant where the accountant’s
failure to adhere to professional standards in auditing a broker-dealer causes a loss to the SIPC
Fund. As discussed in section II.B.6. of this release, SIPC has sought to recover money damages
from the broker-dealer’s independent public accountant based on an alleged failure to comply
with auditing standards, but at least one court has held under New York law that SIPC could not
maintain a claim because it was not a recipient of the annual audit filing and could not have

246

relied on it. 817
SIPC’s improved ability to maintain the SIPC Fund will benefit investors. First, if the
SIPC Fund is appropriately sized, customers of a failed broker-dealer in a SIPA liquidation
should be able to recover their assets more quickly through advances from the fund than if the
fund is not adequate. Also, to the extent the amendments overcome a potential legal hurdle to
pursuing claims against a broker-dealer’s accountant, the ability to recover damages from the
broker-dealer’s accountant in the context of a SIPA liquidation proceeding could increase the
size of the estate of a failed broker-dealer. Increasing the size of the estate could benefit
customers with claims that cannot be fully satisfied through distributions of customer property
held by the failed broker-dealer and the SIPC advances.
The new requirement that broker-dealers that are members of SIPC file their annual
reports with SIPC will increase these broker-dealers’ compliance costs. 818 In the proposing
release, the Commission estimated that it would take broker-dealers approximately 30 minutes to
prepare and file the annual reports with SIPC, and commenters did not disagree with this
estimate. Thus, the Commission estimates that the annual industry-wide reporting burden
associated with this amendment is approximately 2,246 hours per year (1/2 hour times 4,492
SIPC members = 2,246 hours) and that the total annual cost is approximately $694,000. 819 There
would be postage costs associated with sending a copy of the annual report to SIPC that are

817

See SIPC v. BDO Seidman, LLP, 746 N.E.2d 1042 (N.Y. 2001); aff’d, 245 F.3d 174 (2d Cir. 2001).

818

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37596.

819

Based on staff experience, a broker-dealer likely would have a Financial Reporting Manager prepare an
additional copy of its annual report and mail it to SIPC. According to the SIFMA Report on Management
and Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry, as modified by Commission staff to account for an
1,800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and
overhead, the hourly cost of a Financial Reporting Manager is approximately $309/hour. 4,492 SIPCmember broker-dealers x 1/2 hour x $309 = $694,014.

247

estimated to be, on average, 820 approximately $12.05 per broker-dealer per year. 821 Thus, the
Commission estimates that the total annual postage costs associated with sending a copy of the
annual report to SIPC would be approximately $54,128 per year for all broker-dealers that are
SIPC members. 822
While they did not provide estimates of potential litigation costs, several commenters
stated that the Commission did not address the potential costs and benefits of requiring brokerdealers to file copies of their annual reports with SIPC, including potential litigation costs for
independent public accountants. 823 The Commission recognizes that there may be increased
litigation costs (or reserves for potential litigation costs) for accountants as a result of the
amendment and that to the extent that there are such costs, some of them may be passed on to
broker-dealers in the form of increased fees charged by broker-dealers’ independent public
accountants. However, commenters did not provide estimates of potential litigation costs, and
Commission staff were unable to find readily-available public information from which to
estimate specific costs of possible litigation. To the extent that SIPC does bring an individual
lawsuit as a direct result of this amendment (e.g., a suit brought in New York), there would be
costs in terms of legal fees. Based on staff experience, depending on the complexity, scope, and

820

The number of pages of an annual report, and consequently the associated postage costs, likely will vary
significantly based on the size of the broker-dealer and the types of business in which it engages.

821

Based on Commission staff experience with annual report filings of broker-dealers under Rule 17a-5, the
Commission staff estimates that approximately 50% of broker-dealers file their annual reports using an
overnight mail delivery service. These broker-dealers would consequently incur higher postage costs than
broker-dealers which choose to mail their annual reports using first class mail or delivery methods other
than overnight mail. Therefore, postages costs will vary depending on the size of the annual report and
method of delivery. The Commission estimates that the cost to mail the additional reports would be, on
average, $12.05 per broker-dealer. As of October 2012, the $12.05 rate is an average rate of the cost of an
Express Mail Flat Rate Envelope of $18.95 and a Priority Mail Flat Rate Envelope of $5.15, based on costs
obtained on the website of the U.S. Postal Service, available at www.usps.gov. ($18.95 + $5.15) = $24.10/2
= $12.05.

822

4,492 broker-dealers x $12.05 = $54,128.

248

length of the litigation, the costs to defend an individual case could be quite significant given the
hourly fees charged by outside counsel. However, the Commission does not believe these costs
would be significant in the aggregate. As indicated in the economic baseline, SIPC initiates a
small number of proceedings each year, and most of these proceedings have not involved
litigation by SIPC against the firm’s independent public accountant. Moreover, SIPC continued
to bring lawsuits against broker-dealer accountants after the 2001 New York decision in
jurisdictions other than New York. 824 Consequently, while the amendment removes one
potential legal hurdle to such suits, it may not significantly increase the frequency with which
SIPC brings such lawsuits. Moreover, the other elements of any relevant cause of action would
be unaffected. Accordingly, the Commission continues to believe that the requirement to file
copies of the annual reports with SIPC is appropriate.
v.

Notification Requirements

As discussed above in section II.F. of this release, the Commission is amending the
notification provisions in Rule 17a-5 and is making conforming amendments to Rule 17a-11.
Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (h)(2) of Rule 17a-5 provided that if, during the course
of the audit or interim work, the independent public accountant determined that any “material
inadequacies” existed, the independent public accountant was required to inform the CFO of the
broker-dealer, who, in turn, was required to give notice to the Commission and the brokerdealer’s DEA within 24 hours in accordance with the provisions of Rule 17a-11. 825
Under Rule 17a-11, a broker-dealer must provide notice to the Commission and its DEA
in certain circumstances. 826 For example, paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17a-11 requires a broker824

See SIPC v. BDO Seidman, LLP, 746 N.E.2d 1042 (N.Y. 2001); aff’d, 245 F.3d 174 (2d Cir. 2001).

dealer to give notice if its net capital declines below the minimum amount required under Rule
15c3-1. 827 Before today’s amendments, Rule 17a-11 required that whenever a broker-dealer
discovered, or was notified by an independent public accountant of the existence of any material
inadequacy, the broker-dealer must give notice to the Commission and transmit a report to the
Commission stating what the broker or dealer has done or is doing to correct the situation. Rule
15c3-1 and Rule 15c3-3 also require broker-dealers to provide notification in certain
circumstances. 828 For example, paragraph (i) of Rule 15c3-3 requires a carrying broker-dealer to
immediately notify the Commission and its DEA if it fails to make a deposit into its customer
reserve account as required by paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3. 829
a.

Amendments to Rule 17a-5

The Commission proposed amending the notification provisions in Rule 17a-5 to replace
the term “material inadequacy” with the term “material non-compliance.” The term “material
non-compliance” was defined in the context of the compliance report, which was required to be
prepared and filed by carrying broker-dealers. This provision would therefore have applied to
broker-dealers that filed compliance reports with the Commission. The Commission also
proposed amending the notification process. Under the proposed new process, the accountant
would be required to notify the Commission and the broker-dealer’s DEA directly.
The Commission received numerous comments in response to this proposal. 830 Most of
these commenters objected to the proposed notification process. 831 Among the reasons given

CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(x)(C)(1); 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(e); 17 CFR 240.15c3-1d(c)(2); 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(i).

were that it would be inappropriate to require the accountant to notify the Commission and the
DEA directly, because, among other things, the broker-dealer is principally responsible for
compliance with the securities laws, including timely notification; 832 that PCAOB standards
provide that “the practitioner should not take on the role of the responsible party;” 833 and that
PCAOB attestation standards (which were referenced in the proposing release) clearly provide
that management is responsible for the subject matter to which it is asserting, and not the
accountant. 834 In addition to suggestions that the notification process that existed prior to
today’s amendments should not be changed, 835 one commenter stated that the rule should require
simultaneous notice by the accountant to the Commission and to the firm’s management. 836
In addition, one commenter asked whether the notification provisions apply to a review of the
exemption report. 837 Another commenter stated that non-compliance also will trigger a Rule
17a-11 notice, which would be duplicative and create confusion. 838
The final rule requires that if the accountant determines that there are any instances of
non-compliance (as opposed to an instance of material non-compliance, as proposed) with the
financial responsibility rules during the course of preparing the accountant’s reports, the
accountant must immediately notify the CFO of the broker-dealer of the nature of the noncompliance. If the accountant provides notice of an instance of non-compliance, the broker-

dealer must notify the Commission and its DEA, but only if required to do so by existing
provisions of Rule 15c3-1, Rule 15c3-3, or Rule 17a-11 that require such notification. 839
Consequently, the final rule requires that any instance of non-compliance identified by the
accountant will trigger a notification by the broker-dealer to the Commission and the firm’s DEA
to the same extent that notification is required if discovered by the broker-dealer other than in
connection with its annual audit. Therefore, under the final rule, if the accountant determines
that an instance of non-compliance with the financial responsibility rules exists, the accountant is
not required to make a determination of whether that instance of non-compliance is material.
This modification likely will result in a lower burden relative to the proposal on the independent
public accountant as the accountant will not need to analyze whether an instance of noncompliance is material to determine whether the notification requirement has been triggered. On
the other hand, the independent public accountant will need to provide notice to the brokerdealer of all instances of non-compliance rather than only instances of material non-compliance.
Therefore, the modification will result in more required notifications from the independent
public accountant to the broker-dealer.
Under the final rule, the independent public accountant also will be required to provide
notice to the broker-dealer if the accountant determines that any material weaknesses exist. As

839

Under Rule 17a-11, a broker-dealer must provide notice to the Commission and its DEA in certain
circumstances. For example, paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17a-11 requires a broker-dealer to give notice if its
net capital declines below the minimum amount required under Rule 15c3-1. In addition, Rule 15c3-1 and
Rule 15c3-3 require broker-dealers to provide notifications in certain circumstances. For example,
paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of Rule 15c3-1 requires a broker-dealer that operates as a specialist or market-maker
and that operates under the provisions of paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 15c3-1 to obtain certain representations
from the broker-dealer that carries its market maker or specialist account. The representations include that
the broker-dealer carrying the account will provide a notification under Rule 17a-11 if the market maker or
specialist fails to deposit the required amount of equity into the account within the required time frame as
prescribed in paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 15c3-1. In addition, under paragraph (i) of Rule 15c3-3, a carrying
broker-dealer must immediately notify the Commission and its DEA if it fails to make a deposit into its
customer reserve account as required by paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3.

252

in the proposal, material weakness is defined with regard to the compliance report and therefore
applies only to broker-dealers that file compliance reports. In that report, a carrying brokerdealer must state whether its internal controls were effective during the fiscal year as well as at
the end of the fiscal year. Internal controls are not effective if there are one or more material
weaknesses in the controls. The broker-dealer also is required to describe any identified material
weaknesses. The independent public accountant must undertake to prepare a report based on an
examination of certain statements in the compliance report, including the statements as to
whether the carrying broker-dealer’s internal controls were effective.
As stated above, before today’s amendments, Rule 17a-5 required the accountant to
notify the broker-dealer if the accountant determined that any material inadequacies existed. The
concept of material inadequacy generally applied to all broker-dealers and, therefore, the
notification requirement applied with respect to independent public accountant engagements for
non-carrying as well as carrying broker-dealers under Rule 17a-5. This requirement, however,
may not have produced the intended benefits.
As discussed in section II.D.3. above, PCAOB inspection staff found that in 21 of 23
broker-dealer audits inspected, the accountant “failed to perform sufficient audit procedures to
obtain reasonable assurance that any material inadequacies found to exist since the date of the
last examination . . . would have been disclosed in the accountant’s supplemental report.” 840
Material inadequacies which were expected to be reported by the accountant included any
condition which contributed substantially to or, if appropriate corrective action was not taken,
could reasonably be expected to: (1) inhibit a broker-dealer from promptly completing securities
transactions or promptly discharging its responsibilities to customers, other broker-dealers, or

840

See PCAOB Inspection Report, at ii.

253

creditors; (2) result in material financial loss; (3) result in material misstatements of the brokerdealer’s financial statements; or (4) result in violations of the Commission’s recordkeeping or
financial responsibility rules to an extent that could reasonably be expected to result in the
conditions described in (1) through (3) above. The definition of material weakness is more
specific: a material weakness includes a deficiency in internal control such that there is a
reasonable possibility that non-compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis or that non-compliance to a material extent
with Rule 15c3-3, except paragraph (e), Rule 17a-13, or the Account Statement Rules will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis.
As discussed above, today’s amendments generally replace the term material inadequacy
and separate it into two components – a compliance component (non-compliance with the
financial responsibility rules) and, for carrying broker-dealers, an internal control component
(material weakness in Internal Control Over Compliance). The change is consistent with one of
the objectives of the amendments: to provide clear and consistent terminology focused separately
on compliance with key financial responsibility rules and internal control over compliance with
the financial responsibility rules. The amended notification provisions in Rule 17a-5 reflect this
change in terminology.
The Commission proposed amending the notification process so that the accountant
would be required to notify the Commission and the broker-dealer’s DEA directly. However, the
Commission is not adopting this alternative because it agrees with the comments, discussed
above, that the notification process in place before today’s amendments should be retained.
As stated above, Rule 17a-5 before today’s amendments required the accountant to notify
the broker-dealer, and the broker-dealer to notify the Commission, if the accountant determined

254

during the course of the audit or interim work that a material inadequacy existed. This
requirement generally applied to all broker-dealer audits. The notification provisions in
themselves did not direct the accountant to perform specific procedures with respect to the audit
– those requirements were contained in other provisions of Rule 17a-5. The notification
provisions in Rule 17a-5 were intended to require notification if, during the course of the audit,
the accountant became aware of any material inadequacies. As amended, the notification
provisions in Rule 17a-5 likewise do not in themselves require the accountant to perform specific
procedures with respect to the examination of the financial report or an examination of a
compliance report or review of an exemption report. Instead, the notification provisions are
triggered when the accountant becomes aware, during the course of preparing the reports of the
accountant required under Rule 17a-5, that the broker-dealer is not in compliance with the
financial responsibility rules or, during the course of preparing a report based on an examination
of a compliance report, that a material weakness exists. These notification requirements are
designed to put the broker-dealer in a position to correct controls, processes, and systems that
have caused or potentially could cause the firm to not comply with the financial responsibility
rules. As discussed throughout this release, the financial responsibility rules serve an important
investor protection function by requiring broker-dealers to maintain prudent levels of net capital
and take steps to safeguard customer securities and cash.
The requirement to notify the broker-dealer when the independent public accountant
determines that the broker-dealer is not in compliance with the financial responsibility rules or
that any material weaknesses exist is not expected to increase costs for broker-dealers when
compared to the baseline requirement to provide the broker-dealer with notice when the
independent public accountant determines that a material inadequacy exists. As discussed above,

255

the notice requirements under today’s amendments do not require the independent public
accountant to perform specific procedures. Instead, they are triggered when the independent
public accountant determines that any non-compliance or material weakness exists during the
course of performing procedures to examine the financial report and to examine the compliance
report or review the exemption report, as applicable. To the extent the obligation to provide the
broker-dealer with notice is factored into the fee charged by the accountant, the Commission
notes that before today’s amendments the independent public accountant was required to give
notice of a material inadequacy. This notification requirement has been eliminated and,
therefore, to the extent it was factored into the fee, that cost has been eliminated. The
Commission does not believe that the component of the independent public accountants’ fee
associated with the new notification requirements would be materially different than the
component of the fee associated with the material inadequacy notification requirements.
Therefore, the Commission believes these requirements would not result in increased compliance
costs relative to the requirements in place before today’s amendments.
b.

Conforming and Technical Amendments to Rule 17a-11

As discussed above in section II.F.2., prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (e) of Rule
17a-11 required that whenever a broker-dealer discovered, or was notified by an independent
public accountant, pursuant to paragraph (h)(2) of Rule 17a-5 or paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-12,
of the existence of any material inadequacy, the broker-dealer was required to give notice to the
Commission and transmit a report to the Commission stating what the broker-dealer has done or
is doing to correct the situation.
The Commission is adopting conforming amendments to paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11 to
substitute a notice of the existence of any material weakness as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of

256

Rule 17a-5 for a notice of the existence of any material inadequacy and to replace a reference to
paragraph (h)(2) of Rule 17a-5 with a reference to paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5. 841 Specifically,
the final rule provides that whenever a broker-dealer discovers, or is notified by its accountant
under paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5 of the existence of any material weakness, the broker-dealer
must: (1) give notice of the material weakness within 24 hours of the discovery or notification;
and (2) transmit a report within 48 hours of the notice stating what the broker-dealer has done or
is doing to correct the situation. 842
The notification requirements, among other things, alert the Commission and the DEA of
the need to increase their monitoring of a broker-dealer and to obtain additional information
when appropriate in order to address any concerns the Commission or the DEA may have as a
result of the notification. A notification of a material weakness will alert the Commission and
the broker-dealer’s DEA to the existence of a condition that could impact the broker-dealer’s
ability to remain in compliance with the financial responsibility rules, which serve an important
investor protection function by requiring broker-dealers to maintain prudent levels of net capital
and take steps to safeguard customer securities and cash. Once alerted, the Commission and the
DEA can respond to the situation through, for example, heightened monitoring of the brokerdealer to assess whether it has corrected the problem and whether it is properly safeguarding
customer securities and cash.
The Commission believes these amendments will not result in increased compliance costs
to broker-dealers. Material weakness is defined with regard to the compliance report and
therefore applies only to broker-dealers that file compliance reports (i.e., carrying broker841

The final rule retains a reference to material inadequacy as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of Rule 17a-12, but
amendments correct citations to that rule.

842

See paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11. The rule retains provisions referencing the term material inadequacy as
defined in Rule 17a-12.

257

dealers). In contrast, the concept of material inadequacy generally applied to all broker-dealers
and, therefore, the notification requirement applied with respect to independent public
accountant engagements under Rule 17a-5 for non-carrying as well as carrying broker-dealers.
As discussed above in section VII.B.1. of this release, the Commission estimates that there are
approximately 4,709 broker-dealers registered with the Commission and that of those firms,
approximately 292 are carrying broker-dealers. Consequently, before today’s amendments, the
notification requirements with respect to material inadequacy applied to approximately 4,709
broker-dealers, whereas after today’s amendments the notification requirement with respect to
material weakness will apply to approximately 292 broker-dealers.
The Commission proposed amending paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11 to delete the
references to Rule 17a-5. However, the Commission is not adopting this alternative because it
agrees with a commenter that notification should be provided to the Commission when a
deficiency in internal control is discovered by the broker-dealer. 843
vi.

Information Provided to Customers

Prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of Rule 17a-5 provided that if, in
conjunction with a broker-dealer’s most recent audit report, the broker-dealer’s independent
public accountant commented on any material inadequacies in the broker-dealer’s internal
controls, its accounting system, or certain of its practices and procedures 844 under paragraphs (g)
and (h) of Rule 17a-5, and paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11, the broker-dealer’s audited statements
sent to customers were required to include a statement that a copy of the auditor’s comments
were available for inspection at the Commission’s principal office in Washington, DC, and the

843

These practices and procedures include, for example, periodic net capital computations under Rule 15c3-1
and periodic counts of securities under Rule 17a-13.

258

regional office of the Commission in which the broker-dealer had its principal place of
business. 845
The Commission is revising its proposal with respect to amending paragraph (c)(2) of
Rule 17a-5 to be consistent with the new notification provisions in paragraph (h) described above
relating to the identification by a broker-dealer’s accountant of a material weakness rather than
an instance of material non-compliance. 846 Specifically, if, in connection with the most recent
annual reports, the report of the independent public accountant on the broker-dealer’s
compliance report identifies a material weakness, the broker-dealer must include a statement that
one or more material weaknesses have been identified and that a copy of the report of the
independent public accountant is currently available for the customer’s inspection at the principal
office of the Commission in Washington, DC, and the regional office of the Commission for the
region in which the broker-dealer has its principal place of business. 847
The Commission does not believe these amendments will result in incremental costs to
broker-dealers over the baseline. Material weakness is defined with regard to the compliance
report and therefore applies only to broker-dealers that file compliance reports (i.e., carrying
broker-dealers). In contrast, the concept of material inadequacy generally applied to all brokerdealers and, therefore, the customer notification requirement applied with respect to independent
public accountant engagements under Rule 17a-5 for non-carrying as well as carrying brokerdealers. As discussed above in section VII.B.1. of this release, the Commission estimates that
there are approximately 4,709 broker-dealers registered with the Commission and that of those
firms, approximately 292 are carrying broker-dealers. Consequently, before today’s
845

amendments, the notification requirements with respect to material inadequacy applied to
approximately 4,709 broker-dealers, whereas after today’s amendments the notification
requirement with respect to material weakness will apply to approximately 292 broker-dealers.
Rule 17a-5 also provides a conditional exemption from the requirement to send paper
copies of financial information to customers if the broker-dealer mails a financial disclosure
statement with summary information and an Internet link to the balance sheet and other
information on the broker-dealer’s website. Before today’s amendments, one of the conditions
of the exemption was that the broker-dealer was not required during the prior year to give notice
of a material inadequacy. The Commission proposed revising this condition for using website
disclosure to provide that the broker-dealer’s financial statements must receive an unqualified
opinion from the accountant and that neither the broker-dealer nor the accountant identified a
material weakness or an instance of material non-compliance.
One commenter stated that a broker-dealer should be able to deliver the financial
information available to customers via its website regardless of whether an instance of material
non-compliance or material weakness was identified. 848 Another commenter stated that the rule
should not require a 100% rate of compliance with the financial responsibility rules to qualify for
the exemption. 849 A third commenter stated that the proposed amendment should be eliminated,
or replaced with the requirement that broker-dealers include a notice of the material weakness or

848

See ABA Letter.

See CAI Letter. This commenter stated that FINRA has proposed that broker-dealers send customer
account statements monthly instead of quarterly, broker-dealers are already potentially facing “extremely
high” costs of sending information to customers. FINRA withdrew its proposals to send customer account
statements monthly instead of quarterly on July 30, 2012. See SR-FINRA-2009-028, Proposed Rule
Change to Adopt FINRA Rule 2231 (Customer Account Statements) in the Consolidated FINRA
Rulebook, Withdrawal of Proposed Rule Change (July 30, 2012), available at

non-compliance on customer account statements for a year following its identification. 850
The Commission has decided not to adopt the proposed condition for qualifying for the
conditional exemption. The decision not to adopt should result in lower costs than would have
been incurred had the Commission adopted the proposal without modification. Using the
Internet to disclose information should be less costly and more efficient for the broker-dealer
than mailing paper copies to all customers. It also will benefit customers, since they will be able
to access relevant broker-dealer information more efficiently through the Internet (alternatively,
customers can request a paper copy by phone at no cost to the customer). 851
vii.

Coordination with Investment Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-2

Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-2 provides that when a registered investment adviser or its
related person maintains client funds and securities as a qualified custodian in connection with
advisory services provided to clients, the adviser annually must obtain, or receive from its related
person, a written internal control report prepared by an independent public accountant registered
with, and subject to regular inspection by, the PCAOB. This report must be supported by the
accountant’s examination of the qualified custodian’s custody controls. Under the amendments,
a broker-dealer that also acts as a qualified custodian for itself as an investment adviser or for its
related investment advisers may use the report of the independent public accountant based on an
examination of its compliance report to meet the reporting obligations under Rule 206(4)-2.
Therefore, such a broker-dealer will not be required to obtain an internal control report under
Rule 206(4)-2 in addition to a report covering the compliance report from its independent public
accountant. It also will result in efficiencies as a single audit will be able to address two audit
requirements.

Access to Accountant and Audit Documentation

The amendments to Rule 17a-5 require that carrying or clearing broker-dealers agree to
allow Commission and DEA staff, if requested in writing for purposes of an examination of the
broker-dealer, to review the work papers of the independent public accountant and to allow the
accountant to discuss the its findings with the examiners.
This requirement will enable the Commission and DEAs to more efficiently deploy
examination resources. 852 Examiners reviewing the accountant’s work papers will be able to
tailor the scope of their examinations by identifying areas where extensive audit work was
performed by the independent public accountant and focusing their examinations on other areas,
allowing for more efficient oversight of broker-dealers by the Commission and DEA
examination staff. Enabling Commission and DEA examination staff to conduct more focused
and efficient examinations of broker-dealers could, in turn, allow for examination resources to be
allocated more strategically.
The Commission is amending paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-5 to revise the statement
regarding identification of a broker-dealer’s independent public accountant that broker-dealers
must file each year with the Commission and their DEA (except that if the engagement is of a
continuing nature, no further filing is required). 853 The revised statement contains additional
information that includes a representation that the independent public accountant has undertaken
to provide a report regarding the broker-dealer’s financial reports and a report regarding the
broker-dealer’s compliance or exemption report, as applicable. 854 In addition, the statement

852

As discussed previously, where an independent public accountant has performed extensive testing of a
carrying broker-dealer’s custody of securities and cash by confirming holdings at subcustodians, examiners
could focus their efforts on matters that had not been the subject of prior testing and review.

853

See discussion above in section III. of this release.

854

See 17 CFR 240. 17a-5(f)(2)(ii).

262

provided by a clearing or carrying broker-dealer must include representations regarding the
access to accountant requirements described above. 855 Therefore, all broker-dealers will
generally be required to file a new statement regarding their independent public accountant.
As discussed above in section III. of this release, one commenter stated that, the
amendments would discourage or “chill” communications between a broker-dealer and its
auditor because of the possibility that an auditor may misconstrue communications from
representatives of the broker-dealer and wrongly conclude that the representatives lack
knowledge or admit to an issue. 856 Presumably, this “chilling effect” would result from a brokerdealer’s desire to avoid the creation of audit documentation memorializing misunderstandings
and miscommunications, which when accessed by Commission and DEA examiners could result
in regulatory scrutiny. As stated in section III. of this release, the Commission is not persuaded
by this comment; while it is possible for miscommunications to occur between representatives of
a broker-dealer and its auditor, potential misunderstandings or miscommunications should not
limit the ability of the Commission or a DEA to have access to audit documentation or a brokerdealer’s independent public accountant. Further, to the extent a misunderstanding or
miscommunication between a broker-dealer and its accountant is reflected in the accountant’s
audit documentation relating to the broker-dealer, the broker-dealer could clarify the nature of
the misunderstanding or miscommunication to examiners and how it was rectified if such
clarification and rectification is not already described in subsequent audit documentation.
The Commission estimated that the one-time hour burden associated with amending its
existing statement and filing the new statement with the Commission, in order to comply with

855

See 17 CFR 17a-5(f)(2)(ii)(F)–(G).

856

See CAI Letter.

263

the proposed amendments, would be an average of approximately two hours on a one-time basis
for each broker-dealer, as the statement can be continuing in nature. 857
As discussed in the PRA, the Commission is revising this estimate for clearing and
carrying broker-dealers, as these broker-dealers will likely be required to renegotiate their
agreements with their independent public accountants. The Commission estimates that the total
one-time cost associated with this burden is approximately $5.2 million. 858 Additionally, the
Commission believes there will be postage costs associated with sending the amended statement
regarding the accountant and estimates that each mailing will cost approximately $0.45, for a
total cost of approximately $6,357 for all broker-dealers on a one-time basis. 859
In addition, in the proposing release, the Commission estimated that a carrying or
clearing broker-dealer’s accountant would charge the broker-dealer for time its personnel spend
speaking with the Commission or the broker-dealer’s DEA or providing them with audit
documents and that, on average, the Commission or the broker-dealer’s DEA may speak with
each accountant for approximately five hours per year. Thus, the Commission estimated that the
additional cost of accountant time associated with this amendment to all clearing and carrying

857

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37596.

858

See Section VI.D.1.vi. Based on staff experience, a broker-dealer that carries customer accounts or clears
transactions likely would have its Controller and an Assistant General Counsel involved in renegotiating
the agreement with auditors, and that those discussions would take, on average, approximately four hours.
Broker-dealers would likely have an attorney prepare a new notification of designation of accountant, and
that task would take the attorney, on average, approximately two hours. According to the SIFMA Report
on Management and Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry, as modified by Commission staff to
account for an 1,800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee
benefits and overhead, the hourly cost of a Controller is approximately $409/hour, the hourly cost of an
Assistant General Counsel is approximately $407/hour, and the hourly cost of an Attorney is approximately
$378/hour. 513 broker-dealers that carry customer accounts or clear transactions x 4 hours x $409 =
$839,268. 513 broker-dealers that carry customer accounts or clear transactions x 4 hours x $407 =
$835,164. 4,709 broker-dealers x 2 hours x $378 = $3,560,004. $839,268 + $835,164 + $3,560,004 =
$5,234,436.

859

See Section VI.D.1.vi. 4,709 broker-dealers x $0.45 cost for first class postage x 3 mailings = $6,375.15.

264

broker-dealers would be approximately $660,000 annually. 860 As the Commission now
estimates that the number of carrying or clearing broker-dealers is 513, the new estimate is
approximately $641,250. 861
3.

Form Custody

The newly adopted Form Custody is to be filed quarterly at the same time that a brokerdealer is required to file its FOCUS Reports. The form elicits information concerning whether,
and if so, how, a broker-dealer maintains custody of customer assets and, as discussed above,
consolidates information about the broker-dealer’s custodial responsibility and relationships with
other custodians in one report so that the Commission and other securities regulators will be
provided with a comprehensive profile of the broker-dealer’s custody practices and
arrangements. This should reduce the likelihood that fraudulent conduct, including
misappropriation or other misuse of investor assets, can continue undetected. Further, the
information provided in Form Custody should aid in the examination of broker-dealers, because
the examination staff can use the information provided as another tool to prioritize and plan
examinations.
The Form Custody amendments also should enhance investor confidence in the ability of
the securities regulators to oversee broker-dealers and broker-dealer custody of investor assets.
By establishing a discipline under which broker-dealers are required to report greater detail as to
their custodial functions, investor perception as to the safety of their funds and securities held by
broker-dealers should improve. Investors may be more willing to provide capital for investment.
Further, the requirement by broker-dealers to provide detail as to their custodial practices may
860

See Section VI.D.1.vii.d. In the proposing release the Commission multiplied 528 clearing and carrying
broker-dealers x 5 hours x $250/hour = $660,000.

861

See Section VI.D.1.vii.d. 513 clearing and carrying broker-dealers x $1,250 in increased costs per clearing
broker-dealer = $641,250.

265

prompt them to identify and correct deficiencies. For example, if a broker-dealer preparing the
information to be disclosed on the form discovers a discrepancy between its own records and the
records of a custodian as to the nature or quantity of assets held by the custodian, the brokerdealer can act to resolve the discrepancy before filing the form.
The Commission estimated that the time required to complete and file Form Custody
would be approximately 12 hours per quarter, or 48 hours per year, on average, for each brokerdealer. 862 The Commission did not receive comments regarding this estimate. The Commission
now estimates that there are approximately 4,709 broker-dealers that must file Form Custody.
The Commission therefore estimates that the total time required to complete and file Form
Custody for all 4,709 broker-dealers is approximately 226,032 hours per year (4,709 brokerdealer times four responses per year times 12 hours = 226,032 hours). Further, the Commission
estimates that the total cost associated with completing and filing Form Custody is
approximately $69.8 million. 863
One commenter stated that the estimated costs to the industry of $69,179,670 in the
proposing release was “staggering,” and that such costs would likely indirectly be passed on to
customers. 864 The commenter did not disagree with the estimated cost in the proposing release;
rather, the commenter focused on the size of the total estimated costs. The Commission notes
that the $69 million estimate in the proposing release and the $69.8 million estimate in this
862

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37597.

863

Based on staff experience, a broker-dealer likely would have a Financial Reporting Manager complete and
file Form Custody. According to the SIFMA Report on Management and Professional Earnings in the
Securities Industry, as modified by Commission staff to account for an 1,800-hour work-year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and overhead, the hourly cost of a
Financial Reporting Manager is approximately $309/hour. 4,709 broker-dealers x 48 hours x $309 =
$69,843,888.

864

See IMS Letter. The cost of $69,179,670 was reflected in the economic analysis in the proposing release.
See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37601. This cost was calculated as an internal cost of the estimated
PRA hours and is the total cost divided among 5,057 firms. Id. at 37601 n.215. This internal cost would
amount to an average of $13,680 per broker-dealer. Id.

266

release are estimates of the aggregate cost to the industry. The average cost to an individual
broker-dealer would be approximately $15,000 per year. 865 As an average, the costs incurred by
a broker-dealer to comply with the requirement to file Form Custody will depend on its size and
the complexity of its business activities.
The Commission recognizes that the requirement to file Form Custody will increase
compliance costs for broker-dealers and that these costs may be passed on to customers. The
Commission, however, believes the investor protection benefits of the Form Custody
requirements outweigh these costs. As noted above, Form Custody is designed to assist
Commission and DEA examiners in identifying potential misrepresentations relating to brokerdealers’ custody of assets. Further, the requirements to file the form will promote greater focus
and attention to custody practices by requiring that broker-dealers make specific representations
in this regard. The safeguarding of customer securities and cash held by broker-dealers is of
paramount importance as demonstrated by recent cases where broker-dealers failed to protect
customer securities and cash. 866
4.

Consideration of Burden on Competition, and Promotion of
Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation

As discussed above, incremental costs will result from the annual reporting requirement
amendments, the access to accountant amendments, and the Form Custody amendments. These
incremental costs could result in higher barriers to entry for broker-dealers as compared with the
baseline that existed prior to the amendments. This could be the case particularly for carrying
broker-dealers given the incremental costs associated with the compliance report requirements,
the applicability of the access to accountant amendments to carrying and clearing broker-dealers,

865

1 broker-dealer x 48 hours x $309 = $14,832.

866

See, e.g., SEC v. Bernard L. Madoff, et al., Litigation Release No. 20889 (Feb. 9, 2009).

267

and that most of the information elicited in Form Custody relates to carrying broker-dealer
activities.
The annual reporting requirements have a mixed effect on competition across brokerdealers. The requirement to prepare and file a compliance report or exemption report may
impose a burden on competition for smaller carrying broker-dealers to the extent that it imposes
relatively high fixed costs, which would represent a greater amount of net income for smaller
broker-dealers. On the other hand, as previously noted, a carrying broker-dealer with limited
custodial activities should have to expend less effort to support its statements in the compliance
report than a broker-dealer with more extensive custodial activities, and the attendant costs
should similarly be lower. While the incremental costs of the annual reporting requirements may
be lower for non-carrying broker-dealers (which generally are smaller broker-dealers), the costs
could disproportionately impact smaller broker-dealers due to fixed cost components of the cost
of compliance with these requirements.
The access to accountant amendments may place a burden on carrying and clearing
broker dealers. To the extent that addressing contracts between auditors and broker-dealers is a
fixed cost, the rule may impact smaller broker-dealers to a greater extent than it will larger
broker-dealers. The amendments should not place a burden on competition for non-carrying
broker-dealers.
The requirement to file Form Custody could have a burden on competition because it will
increase compliance costs for broker-dealers. However, the requirement should not have a
disproportionate effect on smaller broker-dealers. Smaller firms will incur fewer costs to
complete Form Custody because less information is required to be disclosed. For example,

268

broker-dealers that introduce customers on a fully disclosed basis and do not have custody of
customer funds or assets would leave much of the form blank.
In sum, the costs of compliance resulting from the requirements in these amendments
should not impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the
purposes of the Exchange Act and in light of the benefits discussed above.
Today’s amendments are designed to reduce the likelihood that fraudulent conduct, or
lack of appropriate custody procedures or other internal controls, will jeopardize customer
securities and funds held by broker-dealers. To the extent that the amendments achieve that
goal, investors should be more confident that the customer assets held by broker-dealers are safe.
This in turn may promote capital formation as investor assets are able to be allocated more
efficiently across the opportunity set.
One commenter asserted that the proposed amendments “place unnecessary regulatory
burdens and costs on industry, in general, and smaller firms, in particular” and that “brokerdealers compete against investment advisers who are not burdened by the same regulatory
requirements,” including the requirements in the proposed amendments. 867 The Commission
recognizes, as explained above, that the amendments adopted today impose costs on brokerdealers that could result in higher barriers to entry. However, the Commission is of the opinion
that these costs are justified by the numerous and significant benefits, in particular with respect
to protection of customer assets, described in this economic analysis.
With respect to the commenter’s statement about broker-dealers competing with
investment advisers, recent Commission amendments to investment adviser rules are “designed
to provide additional safeguards . . . when a registered adviser has custody of client funds or

867

See IMS Letter.

269

securities” including a requirement to undergo an annual surprise examination by an independent
public accountant to verify client assets and a requirement to have a report of the internal
controls relating to the custody of client assets from an accountant registered with, and subject to
inspection by, the PCAOB unless client assets are maintained by an independent custodian. 868
Consequently, the regulations governing investment advisers have been strengthened in recent
years through new requirements aimed at safeguarding customer assets. Today’s amendments
also are aimed at safeguarding customer assets. As both investment advisers and broker-dealers
are now subject to new requirements, today’s amendments should not create a competitive
advantage for either class of registrant. Moreover, the recently adopted requirements for
investment advisers and the amendments adopted today are, among other things, part of an effort
to strengthen the Commission’s rules regarding the safekeeping of customer assets, in part in
response to several fraud cases brought by the Commission involving investment advisers and
broker-dealers. 869
If the amendments increase investor confidence in broker-dealers, they will promote
capital formation. Moreover, for the reasons discussed above, today’s amendments should not
unduly restrict competition and should promote capital formation. 870
The amendments also should increase efficiencies. With respect to the annual reporting
amendments, updating the language of Rule 17a-5 to replace outdated or inconsistent audit
terminology is designed to ensure that the requirements of the rule are better aligned with
applicable current audit standards. Further, the amendments facilitate PCAOB oversight

868

See Custody of Funds or Securities of Clients by Investment Advisers, 75 FR at 1456.

869

Id.

870

The Commission stated in the proposing release that its preliminary view was that the proposed rule
amendments promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation and that any burden on competition is
justified by the benefits provided by the amendments. See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37598.

270

authority, including its ability to inspect audits of broker-dealers, by providing that examinations
or reviews of broker-dealer annual reports be made in accordance with PCAOB standards. In
addition, the amendments strengthen and promote consistent compliance with the financial
responsibility rules for broker-dealers that maintain custody of customer securities and funds by
increasing the focus of these broker-dealers and their independent public accountants on
compliance, and internal control over compliance, with the financial responsibility rules. This,
in turn, should help the Commission and the broker-dealer’s DEA identify broker-dealers that
have weak internal controls for safeguarding investor assets and improve the financial and
operational condition of broker-dealers and thereby provide more protection for investor assets
held by broker-dealers.
The access to accountant amendments should increase efficiencies by promoting more
risk-based examinations by Commission and DEA staff. For example, the examiners in some
cases may be able to leverage the work performed by the independent public accountants and,
therefore, focus on areas the accountants did not review. Similarly, the Form Custody
amendments should increase efficiencies by promoting more risk-based examinations by
Commission and DEA staff as they will be able to use the profile of the broker-dealer’s custody
practices documented in Form Custody to focus their reviews. For this reason, examinations
may also place fewer time demands on broker-dealer personnel.
In significant part, the effect of these rules on efficiency and capital formation are linked
to the effect of these rules on competition. For example, markets that are competitive and trusted
may be expected to promote the efficient allocation of capital. Similarly, rules that promote, or
do not unduly restrict, trust in broker-dealers can be accompanied by regulatory benefits that
minimize the risk of market failure and thus promote efficiency within the market. Such

271

competitive markets would increase the efficiency by which market participants could transact
with broker-dealers.
VIII. FINAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) 871 requires Federal agencies, in promulgating
rules, to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. Section 603(a) 872 of the
Administrative Procedure Act, 873 as amended by the RFA, generally requires the Commission to
undertake a regulatory flexibility analysis of all proposed rules, or proposed rule amendments, to
determine the impact of such rulemaking on small entities. 874 Section 605(b) of the RFA
provides that this requirement does not apply to any proposed rule or proposed rule amendment,
which if adopted, would not “have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities.” 875
The Commission proposed amendments to Rules 17a-5 and 17a-11 and proposed new
Form Custody. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“IRFA”) was included in the
proposing release. 876 This Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared in
accordance with the provisions of the RFA.
A.

Need for and Objectives of the Amendments and New Form

The final rules amend certain broker-dealer annual reporting, audit, and notification

871

5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

872

5 U.S.C. 603(a).

873

5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.

874

Although section 601(b) of the RFA defines the term small entity, the statute permits agencies to formulate
their own definitions. The Commission has adopted definitions for the term “small entity” for the purposes
of Commission rulemaking in accordance with the RFA. Those definitions, as relevant to this rulemaking,
are set forth in Rule 0-10. See 17 CFR 240.0-10. See Statement of Management on Internal Accounting
Control, Exchange Act Release No. 18451 (Jan. 28, 1982), 47 FR 5215 (Feb. 4, 1982).

272

requirements. The amendments include a requirement that broker-dealer audits be conducted in
accordance with standards of the PCAOB, that broker-dealers file either a compliance report or
an exemption report covered by a report prepared by an independent public accountant, and that
clearing broker-dealers allow representatives of the Commission or the broker-dealer’s DEA to
review the documentation associated with certain reports of the broker-dealer’s independent
public accountant and to allow the accountant to discuss its findings with the representatives
when requested in connection with a regulatory examination of the broker-dealer. The
amendments also require a broker-dealer to file a new form with its DEA that elicits information
about the broker-dealer’s practices with respect to the custody of securities and funds of
customers and others.
The amendments and new form are designed, among other things, to provide additional
safeguards with respect to broker-dealer custody of customer securities and funds, to enhance the
ability of the Commission to oversee broker-dealer custody practices, to increase the focus of
carrying broker-dealers and their independent public accountants on compliance, and internal
control over compliance, with certain financial and custodial requirements, to facilitate the
ability of the PCAOB to implement the explicit oversight authority over broker-dealer audits
provided to the PCAOB by the Dodd-Frank Act, and to satisfy the internal control report
requirement in Rule 206(4)-2 for certain broker-dealers affiliated with, or dually-registered as,
investment advisers.
B.

Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments

The Commission requested comment with regard to matters discussed in the IRFA,
including comments with respect to the number of small entities that may be affected by the

273

proposed rule amendments and whether the effect on small entities would be economically
significant. 877
The Commission did not receive any comments specifically addressing the IRFA.
However, several commenters discussed the impact of the proposal on small broker-dealers.
One commenter stated that the proposed amendments “place unnecessary regulatory burdens and
costs on the industry, in general, and smaller firms in particular.” 878 Another commenter stated
that small broker-dealers may find the timing of the transition to be a “burden,” and requested
that the Commission provide a longer transition period. 879 A third commenter suggested that the
exemption report and the accountant’s report on the exemption report be replaced with a “check
box on the FOCUS report” and that with regard to these reports “[t]he amount of paperwork
involved for small firms that do not carry customer securities seems rather excessive.” 880 A
fourth commenter stated that the proposed transition period may burden smaller broker-dealers,
and suggested that to facilitate the transition, the Commission should provide examples of best
practices and deficiencies, with the cooperation of the AICPA. 881 This commenter also
suggested that the effective date for the annual reporting requirements should be one year after
publication of the final rule. 882
The Commission is sensitive to the burdens the rule amendments and new form will have
on small broker-dealers. To remove unnecessary burdens, the final rule amendments contain

Id. The commenter also specifically suggested that if non-carrying and smaller broker-dealers must use
PCAOB standards, that the Commission should defer the effective date for one year after the approval of
the amendments. Id.

274

certain modifications from the proposal designed to alleviate some of the concerns regarding
small broker-dealers. 883 The modifications are discussed in the following paragraphs.
As is discussed above, the Commission has modified the proposed amendments with
respect to the exemption report in a manner that will likely result in lower costs for small brokerdealers than would have been the case if the Commission had adopted the proposed amendments
without the modifications. In particular, the final rule provides that a broker-dealer can file the
exemption report if it “claimed that it was exempt” from Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent
fiscal year. This modification from the proposal – which provided that a broker-dealer could file
the exemption report if the broker-dealer “is exempt from Rule 15c3-3” – is designed to address
concerns raised by commenters that a non-carrying broker-dealer might be required to file the
compliance report because of an instance during the year in which it did not meet the relied on
exemption provision in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3. 884 As discussed in the economic analysis,
the compliance report costs are significantly greater than the exemption report costs. The final
rule clarifies that a non-carrying broker-dealer that has an exception to meeting the exemption
provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 need not file the compliance report; however, the
broker-dealer would be required to identify, to its best knowledge and belief, in its exemption
report each exception during the most recent fiscal year, if applicable, including a brief
description of the exception and the approximate date on which the exception existed.

883

As is discussed below, small broker-dealers are in most instances not carrying broker-dealers. See section
VIII.C. of this release.

884

See SIFMA Letter. As discussed above in section II.B.1. of this release, there will be cases where a brokerdealer changes its business model to convert from a carrying broker-dealer to a non-carrying broker-dealer
during the fiscal year. In this case, the broker-dealer could seek exemptive relief under section 36 of the
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78mm) from the requirement to file the compliance report and to instead file the
exemption report. In analyzing such a request, the period of time the broker-dealer operated as a carrying
broker-dealer would be a relevant consideration.

275

In addition, only clearing broker-dealers will be subject to the requirements that the
Commission is adopting today that provide Commission and DEA examination staff with the
ability to review audit documentation associated with broker-dealers’ annual audit reports and
allow their independent public accountants to discuss findings relating to the audit reports with
Commission and DEA examination staff.
To alleviate burdens associated with Form Custody, the Commission has modified the
form’s instructions to make clear that questions on the form that cannot be answered because the
broker-dealer does not engage in a particular activity do not need to be answered.
In response to comments, the Commission also has delayed the effective dates associated
with the proposed reporting and attestation amendments, which will provide all broker-dealers,
including smaller broker-dealers, with a longer transition period to prepare for the new
requirements.
As is discussed above, the Commission considered the comment that it should replace the
exemption report with a box to check on the FOCUS Report as the amount of paperwork for
small firms “seems rather excessive.” 885 After careful consideration of this and other
alternatives, the Commission determined that of the alternatives considered, none are appropriate
alternatives to the exemption report. Requiring the broker-dealer to (1) create a separate written
report stating that it is claiming the exemption and identifying the basis for the exemption,
including any identified exceptions in meeting the conditions set forth in § 240.15c3-3(k) and (2)
file this report with the Commission and the broker-dealer’s DEA should increase brokerdealers’ focus on the accuracy of its compliance with the statements being made because of the
potential for liability for false statements, enhance compliance with the exemption conditions in

276

Rule 15c3-3, and therefore provide better protection of customer assets.
Finally, with respect to the comment that the Commission should provide examples of
best practices and deficiencies with the cooperation of the AICPA, the Commission notes that
the question of whether further guidance is necessary is best answered after the requirements
become effective and practical compliance questions arise. In addition, the Commission will
publish a Small Entity Compliance Guide relating to these amendments.
C.

Small Entities Subject to the Rules

Paragraph (c) of Rule 0-10 provides that, for purposes of the RFA, a small entity when
used with reference to a broker-dealer (“small broker-dealer”) means a broker-dealer that: (1) had
total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior
fiscal year as of which its audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5(d)
or, if not required to file such statements, a broker-dealer that had total capital (net worth plus
subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last business day of the preceding fiscal
year (or in the time that it has been in business if shorter); and (2) is not affiliated with any
person (other than a natural person) that is not a small business or small organization. 886 Based
on December 31, 2011 FOCUS Report data, the Commission estimates that there are
approximately 812 broker-dealers that are classified as “small” entities for purposes of the RFA.
Of these, the Commission estimates that there are approximately eight broker-dealers that are
carrying broker-dealers. The Commission estimated for purposes of the IRFA that there were
approximately 871 broker-dealers that were classified as small entities for purposes of the RFA
and that there were no broker-dealers that were carrying firms that satisfied the definition of a

886

17 CFR 240.0-10(c).

small broker-dealer. 887
D.

Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements

The Commission’s amendments to Rule 17a-5 retain the current requirement that brokerdealers annually file financial statements and supporting schedules (“financial report”) that must
be audited by a PCAOB-registered accountant. Under the amendments, the financial report must
be audited in accordance with standards of the PCAOB, instead of in accordance with GAAS, as
previously required.
In addition to the financial report, the amendments require broker-dealers to file one of
two new reports: either a compliance report or an exemption report. If a broker-dealer did not
claim that it was exempt from Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year, the brokerdealer must prepare and file with the Commission a compliance report containing certain
statements regarding the broker-dealer’s internal control over compliance with the financial
responsibility rules and compliance with certain of those rules. Alternatively, if the brokerdealer claimed that it was exempt from Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year, the
broker-dealer must prepare and file with the Commission an exemption report containing a
statement that it claimed that it was exempt from Rule 15c3-3 during that period and identify the
provisions under which it claimed that it was exempt from Rule 15c3-3.
The amendments to Rule 17a-5 also eliminate the “material inadequacy” concept and,
among other things, replace the requirement that the broker-dealer’s independent public
accountant prepare, and the broker-dealer file with the Commission, a material inadequacy report
with a requirement for the accountant to prepare a new report covering either the compliance

887

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 76 FR at 37602. Although the Commission received no comments regarding
the its initial estimate that there were no small carrying broker-dealers, the estimate is nonetheless being
revised based on additional analysis of available information.

278

report or the exemption report, as applicable. If the broker-dealer is a carrying broker-dealer, the
accountant must prepare a report based on an examination, in accordance with PCAOB
standards, of certain statements by the broker-dealer in the compliance report. If the brokerdealer claimed an exemption from Rule 15c3-3, the accountant must prepare a report based on a
review, in accordance with PCAOB standards, of the exemption report. Broker-dealers must file
these reports of the accountant with the Commission along with the financial report and either
the compliance report or the exemption report.
Together, the financial report and the compliance report or the exemption report and the
accountant’s reports covering those reports comprise the annual reports that the broker-dealer
must file each fiscal year with the Commission and the broker-dealer’s DEA. The amendments
require that the broker-dealer also file the annual reports with SIPC if the broker-dealer is a
member of SIPC.
Amendments to Rule 17a-5 also require that if, during the course of an audit, a brokerdealer’s independent public accountant determines that the broker-dealer is not in compliance
with the financial responsibility rules, or that any material weaknesses exist, the accountant must
immediately notify the broker-dealer. The broker-dealer must notify the Commission and its
DEA of the material weakness and must notify the Commission and the DEA of the noncompliance if that non-compliance would otherwise trigger a notification requirement.
Amendments to Rule 17a-11 require that when a broker-dealer discovers, or is notified by
its independent public accountant, of the existence of any material weakness under Rule 17a-5,
the broker-dealer must notify the Commission and transmit a report to the Commission stating
what the broker-dealer has done or is doing to correct the situation. The amendments substituted
the term material weakness for the term material inadequacy with regard to Rule 17a-5.

279

Under the amendments, carrying broker-dealers or those that clear transactions must
agree to allow Commission or DEA examination staff, if requested in writing for purposes of an
examination of the broker-dealer, to review “the documentation associated with the reports of the
accountant” and to discuss the accountant’s findings with the accountant.
The amendments require broker-dealers to file a new “Form Custody” each quarter to
elicit information concerning whether a broker-dealer maintains custody of customer and noncustomer assets, and, if so, how such assets are maintained. Form Custody must be filed with the
broker-dealer’s DEA. The DEA must transmit the information obtained from Form Custody to
the Commission at the same time that it transmits FOCUS Report data to the Commission under
paragraph (a)(4) of Rule 17a-5.
The impact of the amendments on small broker-dealers will be substantially less than on
larger firms. Most small broker-dealers are exempt from Rule 15c3-3 and therefore must file the
exemption report. As discussed above, the exemption report must be reviewed by the
independent public accountant, in lieu of the compliance report, which must be examined by the
accountant. In addition, Form Custody would elicit less information from broker-dealers that do
not maintain custody of customer assets, and therefore the form should be less burdensome for
these broker-dealers.
E.

Agency Action to Minimize Effect on Small Entities

Pursuant to section 3(a) of the RFA, 888 the Commission must consider significant
alternatives that would accomplish the Commission’s stated objectives, while minimizing any
significant adverse impact on small entities. In connection with the final rules, the Commission
considered the following alternatives: (1) establishing differing compliance or reporting

888

5 U.S.C. 603(c).

280

requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to smaller entities; (2)
clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements for smaller
entities; (3) the use of performance standards rather than design standards; and (4) exempting
smaller entities from coverage of the rules, or any part of the rules.
The Commission considered differing compliance and reporting requirements and
timetables in adopting the amendments discussed in this release, which took into account the
resources available to smaller entities. For example, as is discussed above, the Commission
considered alternatives to the exemption report requirements, which resulted in modifications to
the final rule that make clear that broker-dealers claiming exemptions from Rule 15c3-3 will
remain subject to those requirements even if certain exceptions arise. 889 This reduces the burden
on small broker-dealers that would otherwise be subject to the more resource-intensive
compliance and examination report requirements applicable to carrying broker-dealers.
In addition, the Commission, in establishing effective dates for these amendments,
considered the resources available to small broker-dealers. In this regard, the Commission is
delaying the effective dates for the audit and reporting requirements, which will provide small
broker-dealers with greater flexibility in allocating their resources while preparing to comply
with applicable amendments.
The Commission also clarified, consolidated, and simplified compliance and reporting
requirements for broker-dealers in connection with the amendments. As discussed above, the
Commission clarified and simplified requirements applicable to Form Custody by specifying in
the final form that broker-dealers are not required to answer questions that do not apply to their
business activities. Further, in terms of consolidating regulatory requirements applicable to

889

See sections II.B.4.iii. and VII.C.1.ii.b. of this release.

281

broker-dealers, a broker-dealer affiliated with, or dually-registered as, an investment adviser that
is subject to the compliance report requirement can use the independent public accountant’s
examination of the compliance report to satisfy reporting obligations under Advisers Act Rule
206(4)-2.
The Commission generally used design standards rather than performance standards in
connection with the final rule amendments because the Commission believes design standards
will better accomplish its objectives of enhancing safeguards with respect to broker-dealer
custody of securities and funds. The specific disclosure requirements in the final rule will
promote comparable and consistent types of disclosures by broker-dealers, which will facilitate
the ability of Commission and DEA staff to assess broker-dealer compliance with applicable
requirements.
The Commission also considered, and is adopting, amendments that exempt certain types
of broker-dealers from certain requirements. For example, broker-dealers that are not clearing
broker-dealers, which include most small broker-dealers, do not need to comply with the access
to accountant and audit documentation amendments. Most small broker-dealers also will not be
subject to the new compliance and examination report requirements, as small broker-dealers are
in most instances not carrying broker-dealers.
In addition, if the Commission subsequently determines that it is appropriate to exempt a
broker-dealer, or type of broker-dealer, from such requirements, the Commission has existing
authority under which it can act. In particular, under Exchange Act section 36, the Commission,
by rule, regulation, or order, may exempt any person, or any class or classes of persons, from any
rule under the Exchange Act to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the

282

public interest and is consistent with the protection of investors. 890

Commission for the region in which the broker or dealer has its principal place of business.

288

(iii) A broker or dealer succeeding to and continuing the business of another broker or

paragraph (d) as of a date in such fiscal year.
(iv) A broker or dealer that is a member of a national securities exchange, has transacted
a business in securities solely with or for other members of a national securities exchange, and

(d).
(2) Financial report. The financial report must contain:
(i) A Statement of Financial Condition, a Statement of Income, a Statement of Cash
Flows, a Statement of Changes in Stockholders’ or Partners’ or Sole Proprietor’s Equity, and a

statements must be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
and must be in a format that is consistent with the statements contained in Form X-17A-5 (§
249.617 of this chapter) Part II or Part IIA. If the Statement of Financial Condition filed in
accordance with instructions to Form X-17A-5, Part II or Part IIA, is not consolidated, a
summary of financial data, including the assets, liabilities, and net worth or stockholders’ equity,
for subsidiaries not consolidated in the Part II or Part IIA Statement of Financial Condition as

289

Determination of the Reserve Requirements under Exhibit A of § 240.15c3-3, and Information

(iii) If either the Computation of Net Capital under § 240.15c3-1 or the Computation for
Determination of the Reserve Requirements Under Exhibit A of § 240.15c3-3 in the financial
report is materially different from the corresponding computation in the most recent Part II or
Part IIA of Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter) filed by the broker or dealer pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this section, a reconciliation, including appropriate explanations, between the
computation in the financial report and the computation in the most recent Part II or Part IIA of
Form X-17A-5 filed by the broker or dealer. If no material differences exist, a statement so
indicating must be included in the financial report.
(3) Compliance report. (i) The compliance report must contain:
(A) Statements as to whether:
(1) The broker or dealer has established and maintained Internal Control Over
Compliance as that term is defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section;
(2) The Internal Control Over Compliance of the broker or dealer was effective during
the most recent fiscal year;
(3) The Internal Control Over Compliance of the broker or dealer was effective as of the
end of the most recent fiscal year;
(4) The broker or dealer was in compliance with §§ 240.15c3-1 and 240.15c3-3(e) as of
the end of the most recent fiscal year; and
(5) The information the broker or dealer used to state whether it was in compliance with
§§ 240.15c3-1 and 240.15c3-3(e) was derived from the books and records of the broker or
dealer.

290

(B) If applicable, a description of each material weakness in the Internal Control Over
Compliance of the broker or dealer during the most recent fiscal year.
(C) If applicable, a description of any instance of non-compliance with §§ 240.15c3-1 or
240.15c3-3(e) as of the end of the most recent fiscal year.
(ii) The term Internal Control Over Compliance means internal controls that have the
objective of providing the broker or dealer with reasonable assurance that non-compliance with §
240.15c3-1, § 240.15c3-3, § 240.17a-13, or any rule of the designated examining authority of the
broker or dealer that requires account statements to be sent to the customers of the broker or
dealer (an “Account Statement Rule”) will be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
(iii) The broker or dealer is not permitted to conclude that its Internal Control Over
Compliance was effective during the most recent fiscal year if there were one or more material
weaknesses in its Internal Control Over Compliance during the most recent fiscal year. The
broker or dealer is not permitted to conclude that its Internal Control Over Compliance was
effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year if there were one or more material
weaknesses in its internal control as of the end of the most recent fiscal year. A material
weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in Internal Control Over Compliance
such that there is a reasonable possibility that non-compliance with §§ 240.15c3-1 or 240.15c33(e) will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis or that non-compliance to a material
extent with § 240.15c3-3, except for paragraph (e), § 240.17a-13, or any Account Statement Rule
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A deficiency in Internal Control Over
Compliance exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow the management or
employees of the broker or dealer, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,

291

to prevent or detect on a timely basis non-compliance with § 240.15c3-1, § 240.15c3-3, §
240.17a-13, or any Account Statement Rule.
(4) Exemption report. The exemption report must contain the following statements made
to the best knowledge and belief of the broker or dealer:
(i) A statement that identifies the provisions in § 240.15c3-3(k) under which the broker or
dealer claimed an exemption from § 240.15c3-3;
(ii) A statement that the broker or dealer met the identified exemption provisions in §
240.15c3-3(k) throughout the most recent fiscal year without exception or that it met the
identified exemption provisions in § 240.15c3-3(k) throughout the most recent fiscal year except
as described under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section; and
(iii) If applicable, a statement that identifies each exception during the most recent fiscal
year in meeting the identified exemption provisions in § 240.15c3-3(k) and that briefly describes
the nature of each exception and the approximate date(s) on which the exception existed.
(5) The annual reports must be filed not more than sixty (60) calendar days after the end
of the fiscal year of the broker or dealer.
(6) The annual reports must be filed at the regional office of the Commission for the
region in which the broker or dealer has its principal place of business, the Commission’s
principal office in Washington, DC, the principal office of the designated examining authority
for the broker or dealer, and with the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) if the
broker or dealer is a member of SIPC. Copies of the reports must be provided to all selfregulatory organizations of which the broker or dealer is a member, unless the self-regulatory
organization by rule waives this requirement.
(e) * * *

292

(1)(i) The broker or dealer is not required to engage an independent public accountant to
provide the reports required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section if, since the date of the
registration of the broker or dealer under section 15 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o) or of the previous
annual reports filed under paragraph (d) of this section:
(A) The securities business of the broker or dealer has been limited to acting as broker
(agent) for the issuer in soliciting subscriptions for securities of the issuer, the broker has
promptly transmitted to the issuer all funds and promptly delivered to the subscriber all securities
received in connection with the transaction, and the broker has not otherwise held funds or
securities for or owed money or securities to customers; or
(B) The securities business of the broker or dealer has been limited to buying and selling
evidences of indebtedness secured by mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien upon real estate or
leasehold interests, and the broker or dealer has not carried any margin account, credit balance,
or security for any securities customer.
(ii) A broker or dealer that files annual reports under paragraph (d) of this section that
are not covered by reports prepared by an independent public accountant must include in the oath
or affirmation required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section a statement of the facts and
circumstances relied upon as a basis for exemption from the requirement that the annual reports
filed under paragraph (d) of this section be covered by reports prepared by an independent public
accountant.
(2) The broker or dealer must attach to the financial report an oath or affirmation that, to
the best knowledge and belief of the person making the oath or affirmation,
(i) The financial report is true and correct; and

293

(ii) Neither the broker or dealer, nor any partner, officer, director, or equivalent person, as
the case may be, has any proprietary interest in any account classified solely as that of a
customer.
The oath or affirmation must be made before a person duly authorized to administer such oaths
or affirmations. If the broker or dealer is a sole proprietorship, the oath or affirmation must be
made by the proprietor; if a partnership, by a general partner; if a corporation, by a duly
authorized officer; or if a limited liability company or limited liability partnership, by the chief
executive officer, chief financial officer, manager, managing member, or those members vested
with management authority for the limited liability company or limited liability partnership.

(3) The annual reports filed under paragraph (d) of this section are not confidential,
except that, if the Statement of Financial Condition in a format that is consistent with Form X17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter), Part II, or Part IIA, is bound separately from the balance of
the annual reports filed under paragraph (d) of this section, and each page of the balance of the
annual reports is stamped “confidential,” then the balance of the annual reports shall be deemed
confidential to the extent permitted by law. However, the annual reports, including the
confidential portions, will be available for official use by any official or employee of the U.S. or
any State, by national securities exchanges and registered national securities associations of
which the broker or dealer filing such a report is a member, by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, and by any other person if the Commission authorizes disclosure of the annual
reports to that person as being in the public interest. Nothing contained in this paragraph may be
construed to be in derogation of the rules of any registered national securities association or

294

national securities exchange that give to customers of a member broker or dealer the right, upon
request to the member broker or dealer, to obtain information relative to its financial condition.
(4)(i) The broker or dealer must file with SIPC a report on the SIPC annual general
assessment reconciliation or exclusion from membership forms that contains such information
and is in such format as determined by SIPC by rule and approved by the Commission.
(ii) Until the earlier of two years after the date paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section is
effective or SIPC adopts a rule under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section and the rule is approved
by the Commission, the broker or dealer must file with SIPC a supplemental report on the status
of the membership of the broker or dealer in SIPC if, under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section,
the broker or dealer is required to file reports prepared by an independent public accountant. The
supplemental report must include the independent public accountant’s report on applying agreedupon procedures based on the performance of the procedures enumerated in paragraph
(e)(4)(ii)(C) of this section. The supplemental report must cover the SIPC annual general
assessment reconciliation or exclusion from membership forms not previously reported on under
this paragraph (e)(4) that were required to be filed on or prior to the date of the annual reports
required by paragraph (d) of this section: Provided, that the broker or dealer is not required to file
the supplemental report on the SIPC annual general assessment reconciliation or exclusion from
membership form for any period during which the SIPC assessment is a specified dollar value as
provided for in section 4(d)(1)(c) of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, as amended.
The supplemental report must be filed with the regional office of the Commission for the region
in which the broker or dealer has its principal place of business, the Commission's principal
office in Washington, DC, the principal office of the designated examining authority for the

295

broker or dealer, and the principal office of SIPC. The supplemental report must include the
following:
(A) A schedule of assessment payments showing any overpayments applied and
overpayments carried forward including: payment dates, amounts, and name of SIPC collection
agent to whom mailed; or
(B) If exclusion from membership was claimed, a statement that the broker or dealer
qualified for exclusion from membership under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, as
amended; and
(C) An independent public accountant’s report. The independent public accountant must
be engaged to perform the following procedures:
(1) Comparison of listed assessment payments with respective cash disbursements record
entries;
(2) For all or any portion of a fiscal year, comparison of amounts reflected in the annual
reports required by paragraph (d) of this section with amounts reported in the Annual General
Assessment Reconciliation (Form SIPC-7);
(3) Comparison of adjustments reported in Form SIPC-7 with supporting schedules and
working papers supporting the adjustments;
(4) Proof of the arithmetical accuracy of the calculations reflected in Form SIPC-7 and in
the schedules and working papers supporting any adjustments; and
(5) Comparison of the amount of any overpayment applied with the Form SIPC-7 on
which it was computed; or
(6) If exclusion from membership is claimed, a comparison of the income or loss reported
in the financial report required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section with the Certification of

296

Exclusion from Membership (Form SIPC-3).
(f)(1) Qualifications of independent public accountant. The independent public
accountant must be qualified and independent in accordance with § 210.2-01 of this chapter and
the independent public accountant must be registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board if required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
(2) Statement regarding independent public accountant. (i) Every broker or dealer that is
required to file annual reports under paragraph (d) of this section must file no later than
December 10 of each year (or 30 calendar days after the effective date of its registration as a
broker or dealer, if earlier) a statement as prescribed in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section with
the Commission’s principal office in Washington, DC, the regional office of the Commission for
the region in which its principal place of business is located, and the principal office of the
designated examining authority for the broker or dealer. The statement must be dated no later
than December 1 (or 20 calendar days after the effective date of its registration as a broker or
dealer, if earlier). If the engagement of an independent public accountant is of a continuing
nature, providing for successive engagements, no further filing is required. If the engagement is
for a single year, or if the most recent engagement has been terminated or amended, a new
statement must be filed by the required date.
(ii) The statement must be headed “Statement regarding independent public accountant
under Rule 17a-5(f)(2)” and must contain the following information and representations:
(A) Name, address, telephone number, and registration number of the broker or dealer.
(B) Name, address, and telephone number of the independent public accountant.
(C) The date of the fiscal year of the annual reports of the broker or dealer covered by the
engagement.

297

(D) Whether the engagement is for a single year or is of a continuing nature.
(E) A representation that the independent public accountant has undertaken the items
enumerated in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section.
(F) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, a representation that the
broker or dealer agrees to allow representatives of the Commission or its designated examining
authority, if requested in writing for purposes of an examination of the broker or dealer, to
review the audit documentation associated with the reports of the independent public accountant
filed under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, “audit
documentation” has the meaning provided in standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board. The Commission anticipates that, if requested, it will accord confidential
treatment to all documents it may obtain from an independent public accountant under this
paragraph to the extent permitted by law.
(G) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, a representation that the
broker or dealer agrees to allow the independent public accountant to discuss with
representatives of the Commission and its designated examining authority, if requested in writing
for purposes of an examination of the broker or dealer, the findings associated with the reports of
the independent public accountant filed under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section.
(iii) If a broker or dealer neither clears transactions nor carries customer accounts, the
broker or dealer is not required to include the representations in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii)(F) and (G)
of this section.
(iv) Any broker or dealer that is not required to file reports prepared by an independent
public accountant under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section must file a statement required
under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section indicating the date as of which the unaudited reports will

298

be prepared.
(3) Replacement of accountant. A broker or dealer must file a notice that must be
received by the Commission’s principal office in Washington, DC, the regional office of the
Commission for the region in which its principal place of business is located, and the principal
office of the designated examining authority for the broker or dealer not more than 15 business
days after:
(i) The broker or dealer has notified the independent public accountant that provided the
reports the broker or dealer filed under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section for the most recent
fiscal year that the independent public accountant’s services will not be used in future
engagements; or
(ii) The broker or dealer has notified an independent public accountant that was engaged
to provide the reports required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section that the engagement
has been terminated; or
(iii) An independent public accountant has notified the broker or dealer that the
independent public accountant would not continue under an engagement to provide the reports
required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section; or
(iv) A new independent public accountant has been engaged to provide the reports
required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section without any notice of termination having
been given to or by the previously engaged independent public accountant.
(v) The notice must include:
(A) The date of notification of the termination of the engagement or of the engagement of
the new independent public accountant, as applicable; and

299

(B) The details of any issues arising during the 24 months (or the period of the
engagement, if less than 24 months) preceding the termination or new engagement relating to
any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, auditing scope or
procedure, or compliance with applicable rules of the Commission, which issues, if not resolved
to the satisfaction of the former independent public accountant, would have caused the
independent public accountant to make reference to them in the report of the independent public
accountant. The issues required to be reported include both those resolved to the former
independent public accountant’s satisfaction and those not resolved to the former accountant’s
satisfaction. Issues contemplated by this section are those that occur at the decision-making
level – that is, between principal financial officers of the broker or dealer and personnel of the
accounting firm responsible for rendering its report. The notice must also state whether the
accountant’s report filed under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section for any of the past two fiscal
years contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion or was qualified as to
uncertainties, audit scope, or accounting principles, and must describe the nature of each such
adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, or qualification. The broker or dealer must also request
the former independent public accountant to furnish the broker or dealer with a letter addressed
to the Commission stating whether the independent public accountant agrees with the statements
contained in the notice of the broker or dealer and, if not, stating the respects in which
independent public accountant does not agree. The broker or dealer must file three copies of the
notice and the accountant’s letter, one copy of which must be manually signed by the sole
proprietor, a general partner, or a duly authorized corporate, limited liability company, or limited
liability partnership officer or member, as appropriate, and by the independent public accountant,
respectively.

300

(g) Engagement of independent public accountant. The independent public accountant
engaged by the broker or dealer to provide the reports required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of
this section must, as part of the engagement, undertake the following, as applicable:
(1) To prepare an independent public accountant’s report based on an examination of the
financial report required to be filed by the broker or dealer under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this
section in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; and
(2)(i) To prepare an independent public accountant’s report based on an examination of
the statements required under paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A)(2) through (5) of this section in the
compliance report required to be filed by the broker or dealer under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B)(1) of
this section in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;
or
(ii) To prepare an independent public accountant’s report based on a review of the
statements required under paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section in the exemption
report required to be filed by the broker or dealer under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B)(2) of this section
in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
(h) Notification of non-compliance or material weakness. If, during the course of
preparing the independent public accountant’s reports required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of
this section, the independent public accountant determines that the broker or dealer is not in
compliance with § 240.15c3-1, § 240.15c3-3, or § 240.17a-13 or any rule of the designated
examining authority of the broker or dealer that requires account statements to be sent to the
customers of the broker or dealer, as applicable, or the independent public accountant determines
that any material weaknesses (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section) exist, the
independent public accountant must immediately notify the chief financial officer of the broker

301

or dealer of the nature of the non-compliance or material weakness. If the notice from the
accountant concerns an instance of non-compliance that would require a broker or dealer to
provide a notification under § 240.15c3-1, § 240.15c3-3, or § 240.17a-11, or if the notice
concerns a material weakness, the broker or dealer must provide a notification in accordance
with § 240.15c3-1, § 240.15c3-3, or § 240.17a-11, as applicable, and provide a copy of the
notification to the independent public accountant. If the independent public accountant does not
receive the notification within one business day, or if the independent public accountant does not
agree with the statements in the notification, then the independent public accountant must notify
the Commission and the designated examining authority within one business day. The report
from the accountant must, if the broker or dealer failed to file a notification, describe any
instances of non-compliance that required a notification under § 240.15c3-1, § 240.15c3-3, or §
240.17a-11, or any material weaknesses. If the broker or dealer filed a notification, the report
from the accountant must detail the aspects of the notification of the broker or dealer with which
the accountant does not agree.
Note to paragraph (h): The attention of the broker or dealer and the independent public
accountant is called to the fact that under § 240.17a-11(b)(1), among other things, a broker or
dealer whose net capital declines below the minimum required pursuant to § 240.15c3-1 shall
give notice of such deficiency that same day in accordance with § 240.17a-11(g) and the notice
shall specify the broker or dealer's net capital requirement and its current amount of net capital.
The attention of the broker or dealer and accountant also is called to the fact that under §
240.15c3-3(i), if a broker or dealer shall fail to make a reserve bank account or special account
deposit, as required by § 240.15c3-3, the broker or dealer shall by telegram immediately notify
the Commission and the regulatory authority for the broker or dealer, which examines such

302

broker or dealer as to financial responsibility and shall promptly thereafter confirm such
notification in writing.
(i) Reports of the independent public accountant required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of
this section—(1) Technical requirements. The independent public accountant’s reports must:
(i) Be dated;
(ii) Be signed manually;
(iii) Indicate the city and state where issued; and
(iv) Identify without detailed enumeration the items covered by the reports.
(2) Representations. The independent public accountant’s reports must:
(i) State whether the examinations or review, as applicable, were made in accordance
with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;
(ii) Identify any examination and, if applicable, review procedures deemed necessary by
the independent public accountant under the circumstances of the particular case that have been
omitted and the reason for their omission.
(iii) Nothing in this section may be construed to imply authority for the omission of any
procedure that independent public accountants would ordinarily employ in the course of an
examination or review made for the purpose of expressing the opinions or conclusions required
under this section.
(3) Opinion or conclusion to be expressed. The independent public accountant’s reports
must state clearly:
(i) The opinion of the independent public accountant with respect to the financial report
required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section and the accounting principles and practices
reflected in that report;

303

(ii) The opinion of the independent public accountant with respect to the financial report
required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section, as to the consistency of the application of
the accounting principles, or as to any changes in those principles, that have a material effect on
the financial statements; and
(iii)(A) The opinion of the independent public accountant with respect to the statements
required under paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A)(2) through (5) of this section in the compliance report
required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B)(1) of this section; or
(B) The conclusion of the independent public accountant with respect to the statements
required under paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section in the exemption report required
under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B)(2) of this section.
(4) Exceptions. Any matters to which the independent public accountant takes exception
must be clearly identified, the exceptions must be specifically and clearly stated, and, to the
extent practicable, the effect of each such exception on any related items contained in the annual
reports required under paragraph (d) of this section must be given.

INSTRUCTIONS
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
A.

Answer questions applicable to the broker-dealer’s business activities and all “Yes” or “No” questions.
Questions that cannot be answered because the broker-dealer does not engage in a particular activity do not
need to be answered. For example, a broker-dealer that does not hold customer and non-customer funds or
securities does not need to answer Items 3.C-3.E.

B.

Definitions: for purposes of this Form:
1.

“Affiliate” means any person who directly or indirectly controls the broker-dealer or any person who is
directly or indirectly controlled by or under common control with the broker-dealer. Ownership of 25% or
more of the common stock of an entity is deemed prima facie evidence of control.

2.

“Bank” has the same meaning as in 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(6).

3.

“Broker” has the same meaning as in 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4).

4.

“Dealer” has the same meaning as in 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(5).

307

8.

“Free credit balance” means any liabilities of a broker-dealer to customers and non-customers that are
subject to immediate cash payment to customers and non-customers on demand, whether resulting from
sales of securities, dividends, interest, deposits, or otherwise, excluding, however, funds in commodity
accounts that are segregated in accordance with the Commodity Exchange Act or in a similar manner.

9.

“Money Market Fund” means any security issued by an investment company registered under section 8 of
the Investment Company Act of 1940 that is considered a money market fund under Investment Company
Act Rule 2a-7.

10. “Omnibus account” means an account carried and cleared by another broker-dealer and containing accounts
of undisclosed customers on a commingled basis that are carried individually on the books of the brokerdealer introducing the accounts.
11. “Private Fund” means an issuer that would be an investment company as defined in section 3 of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act.
12. “Structured debt” means any security or money market instrument issued by an asset pool or as part of any
asset-backed or mortgage-backed securities transaction. Structured debt is a broad category of financial
instrument and includes, but is not limited to, asset-backed securities such as residential mortgage-backed

(“CDOs”), including synthetic and hybrid CDOs, or collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”).
INSTRUCTIONS FOR SPECIFIC LINE ITEMS
Item 1.A

Answer the question by checking the appropriate box. A broker-dealer must check “Yes” if it
introduces any customer accounts to another broker-dealer on a fully disclosed basis. A brokerdealer that carries customer accounts and/or introduces customer accounts on an omnibus basis
must check “Yes” if it also introduces one or more customer accounts to another broker-dealer on
a fully disclosed basis.

Item 1.B

Item 1.B applies to broker-dealers that introduce customer accounts on a fully disclosed basis to
one or more other broker-dealers. If Item 1.B applies, identify each broker-dealer to which
customer accounts are introduced on a fully disclosed basis.

Item 2.A

Answer the question by checking the appropriate box. A broker-dealer must check “Yes” if it
introduces any customer accounts to another broker-dealer on an omnibus basis. A broker-dealer
that carries customer accounts (other than those introduced on an omnibus basis) and/or introduces
customer accounts on a fully disclosed basis must check “Yes” if it also introduces one or more
customer accounts to another broker-dealer on an omnibus basis.

Item 2.B

Item 2.B applies to broker-dealers that introduce customer accounts on an omnibus basis to one or
more other broker-dealers. If Item 2.B applies, identify each broker-dealer to which customer
accounts are introduced on an omnibus basis.

Item 3.A

Answer the question by checking the appropriate box. A broker-dealer that introduces customer
accounts to another broker-dealer on an omnibus basis is a carrying broker-dealer with respect to
those accounts under the Commission’s broker-dealer financial responsibility rules. If those
accounts are the only accounts carried by the broker-dealer, check “No” in Item 3.A, as those
accounts are addressed in Items 2.A and 2.B.

Item 3.B

Answer the question by checking the appropriate box. Answer “Yes” if accounts are carried by
the broker-dealer for persons that are not “customers” as that term is defined in Rule 15c3-3 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Examples of persons that are not customers of a brokerdealer include general partners, directors, or principal officers – such as the president, executive
vice presidents, treasurer, secretary or any person performing similar functions – of the broker-

308

dealer and accountholders that are themselves broker-dealers (unless such broker-dealer
accountholders are required to be treated as customers under Rule 15c3-3).
Item 3.C

Identify the types of locations where the broker-dealer holds securities. Only identify types of
locations where the broker-dealer holds securities directly in the name of the broker-dealer (i.e., do
not identify a type of location if the broker-dealer only holds securities at the location through an
intermediary). A location holds securities directly in the name of the broker-dealer if the location
is aware of the identity of the broker-dealer and acts directly upon the broker-dealer’s instructions.
A location holds securities through an intermediary if the location is not aware of the identity of
the broker-dealer or will not act on instructions directly from the broker-dealer (i.e., the location
holding securities for the broker-dealer would only act on instructions relating to the brokerdealer’s securities from the broker-dealer’s intermediary). The information required by Items
3.C.i-iii is intended to identify all locations used by the broker-dealer to hold securities listed on
the broker-dealer’s stock record, and to elicit information concerning the frequency with which the
broker-dealer performs reconciliations between the information on its stock record and
information about the securities provided by the location. In Item 3.C.i, check all applicable
boxes, and in Items 3.C.i-iii provide all applicable information as specified for each Item.

Item 3.D

Answer the questions in Items 3.D.i-iii by checking appropriate boxes and entering appropriate
financial information, where applicable, and by providing explanations as requested. In Item
3.D.i, check “Other” if a type of security carried by the broker-dealer for customers is not listed on
the chart, and for each category of security, indicate by checking the approximate box for the
approximate U.S. dollar market value of the securities.

Item 3.E

Answer the questions in Items 3.E.i-iii by checking appropriate boxes and entering appropriate
financial information, where applicable, and by providing explanations as requested. In Item
3.E.i, check “Other” if a type of security carried by the broker-dealer for persons that are not
customers is not listed on the chart, and for each category of security, indicate by checking the
appropriate box the approximate U.S. dollar market value of the securities.

Item 4

Answer the questions in Items 4.A.i-iii and 4.B.i-iii by checking appropriate boxes and, if
applicable, providing requested information.

Item 5

Answer the questions in Items 5.A and 5.B by checking the appropriate box and, if applicable,
providing requested information. A broker-dealer should respond to Item 5.A by checking “Yes”
if it employs a vendor to send trade confirmations to customers on its behalf because the brokerdealer is ultimately responsible for complying with its trade confirmation obligations, not the
vendor.

Item 6

Answer the questions by checking the appropriate boxes and, if applicable, providing requested
information. In Item 6.C, check “Yes” if (i) a broker-dealer sends account statements to persons
other than the beneficial owner of the account; or (ii) if a broker-dealer sends account statements
to the beneficial owner of an account and duplicate account statements to persons other than the
beneficial owner of the account.

Item 7

Answer the question by checking the appropriate box.

Item 8

Answer the questions in Item 8 by checking appropriate boxes and, if applicable, providing
requested information.

Item 9

Answer the questions in Item 9 by checking appropriate boxes and, if applicable, providing
requested information.
