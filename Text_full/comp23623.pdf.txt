COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” and “Commission”),
hereby files this civil enforcement action against John M. Ragsdale (“Defendant”
or “Ragsdale”), alleging the following:
Overview
1.

From August 2013 through mid-2014, Global Earth Energy, Inc.

(“Global Earth”), a now-defunct public company formerly based in North
Carolina, made materially false and misleading statements in press releases to the
public and in public filings with the Commission. Most of the false and misleading
statements involved Global Earth's alleged partner, Hawk Manufacturing
Corporation (“Hawk”), a now-defunct private company based in South Carolina.

Defendant Ragsdale was Hawk’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and principal
decision-maker.

Global Earth falsely and misleadingly claimed, among other

things: (1) that Global Earth and Hawk had exchanged 20 percent of their common
stock, when they had not; (2) that the value of the Hawk stock exchange was
nearly $5,000,000, when there was no reasonable basis for that valuation; (3) that
Hawk proposed to acquire businesses with existing credit facilities of $10 million
or $25 million, when Hawk had no such funding; (4) that Hawk had completed
various material business acquisitions, when Hawk had not; and, (5) that Global
Earth and Hawk had merged, when they had not.
2.

As set forth in more detail below, Global Earth violated antifraud

provisions of the federal securities laws by making misrepresentations and
omissions of material facts about Hawk to the investing public.
3.

Through the actions and inactions set forth below, Defendant

Ragsdale aided and abetted violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal
securities laws.
Jurisdiction and Venue
4.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 21(d) and

21(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§
78u(d) and 78u(e)] to enjoin Defendant from engaging in the transactions, acts,

practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint, and transactions, acts,
practices, and courses of business of similar purport and object, for civil penalties,
for an order barring Defendant from serving as an officer or director of a public
company and from participating in any offer or sale of a penny stock, and for other
equitable relief.
5.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d),

21(e), and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].
6.

Defendant, directly and indirectly, made use of the means and

instrumentalities of interstate commerce and of the mails in connection with the
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.
7.

Venue is proper because certain of the transactions, acts, practices,

and courses of business constituting violations of the Exchange Act occurred in the
District of South Carolina.
8.

Defendant, unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, will continue

to engage in the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this
Complaint, and in transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business of similar
purport and object.

The Defendant
9.

John M. Ragsdale, age 44, resides near Charleston, South Carolina.

During the period described herein, he was the CEO of Hawk.
Relevant Entities
10.

Global Earth Energy, Inc., formerly based in Wilmington, North

Carolina, is a now-defunct public company incorporated in Nevada. During the
relevant period, Global Earth's stock was registered under Section 12(g) of the
Exchange Act and was quoted on OTC Link under the symbol GLER.
11.
Hawk

Hawk Manufacturing Corp., also sometimes erroneously referred to as

Manufacturing,

Inc.,

is

a

now-defunct,

privately-held

company

headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina. Incorporated in Florida on July 1,
2013, Hawk claimed to be in the business of, among other things, acquiring
operating businesses in the plastics and metal manufacturing industries.
FACTS
12.

During the period August 2013 through April 2014 (“relevant

period”), Ragsdale was Hawk's CEO and principal decision-maker.
13.

During the relevant period, Global Earth’s common stock typically

closed at between $0.0001 and $0.0003 per share, on thin trading volume.

2:16-cv-02889-DCN

14.

Date Filed 08/19/16

Entry Number 1

Page 5 of 21

During the relevant period, Global Earth’s common stock was a

“penny stock,” as defined in Section 3(a)(51) of the Exchange Act and Rule 3a51-1
thereunder.
15.

Prior to the relevant period, Global Earth touted a wide variety of

proposed business plans involving, among others, fresh water technologies, carbon
credits, coal mining, and commercial real estate. All of those business plans
eventually were abandoned.
16.

For at least several years before the relevant period, Global Earth

generated little or no revenue and had substantial net losses.
17.

In August 2013, Global Earth was in poor financial condition, with

continuing substantial net losses and no material operations, assets, or revenues.
Hawk was a newly-formed Florida corporation based in Charleston, South
Carolina.
Press Release Regarding Supposed
Exchange of Stock Between Global Earth and Hawk
18.

On August 23, 2013, Global Earth and Hawk (through Defendant

Ragsdale) signed an “Exchange Agreement” expressing an intention to exchange
20 percent of each company's common stock. The exchange never came to pass.
5

2:16-cv-02889-DCN

19.

Date Filed 08/19/16

Entry Number 1

Page 6 of 21

Nevertheless, on August 28, 2013, Global Earth and Hawk

misleadingly announced in a press release that Global Earth and Hawk had
completed the 20 percent stock exchange pursuant to the Exchange Agreement,
when both Global Earth and Defendant Ragsdale knew that no such stock
exchange had in fact been completed.
20.

Specifically, on August 28, 2013, Global Earth issued a press release

announcing that: “GLER and HAWK Manufacturing [i.e., Hawk] have completed
a stock swap of 20% in each company, giving one another ownership in each
respective corporation.”
21.

The August 28, 2013 press release also stated: “The value of the

transaction is nearly $5,000,000.00 between the two firms. GLER is receiving
$4,300,000.00 worth of stock from Hawk.”
22.

In the August 28, 2013 press release, Defendant Ragsdale was quoted

as stating, as CEO of Hawk: “We feel we can work with our client companies to
provide quality products and profitable prices . . .
manufacturing base.”

Date Filed 08/19/16

Entry Number 1

Page 7 of 21

As Defendant Ragsdale knew, and contrary to what Global Earth

represented in the August 28, 2013 press release, Global Earth acquired no interest
in Hawk, much less a 20 percent stake.
24.

In addition, as Defendant Ragsdale knew, the stock valuations

included in the August 28, 2013 press release were false and misleading because
there was no reasonable basis to claim that Global Earth was receiving $4,300,000
worth of Hawk stock or that the value of the transaction was nearly $5,000,000.
25.

Moreover, as Defendant Ragsdale knew, Hawk had no “client

companies,” let alone client companies sufficient to justify a representation that
Global Earth was receiving $4,300,000 worth of Hawk stock.
26.

For several months after the announcement of the Exchange

Agreement, Global Earth issued press releases that falsely and misleadingly touted
its purported “partner” Hawk’s actual and proposed operations, when in fact
Global Earth and Defendant Ragsdale knew that the two companies had not
acquired any equity interest in the other.
27.

In each instance detailed below Defendant Ragsdale reviewed and

approved the press releases before issuance.

Page 8 of 21

In each instance detailed below Defendant Ragsdale knew or was

reckless in not knowing that the press releases were materially false and
misleading.
29.

In each instance detailed below Defendant Ragsdale nevertheless

drafted and/or approved the press releases for issuance to the public.
Press Release Regarding Hawk’s Non-Existent “Credit Facilities”
30.

On September 9, 2013, Global Earth announced in a press release that

Hawk was working on acquisition agreements with four businesses with
“combined 2012 annual revenues of $27 million and 2012 annual EBITA profits of
$4 million.”
31.

Global Earth’s press release stated:

“Expecting to close these

acquisitions before the end of 2013, HAWK anticipates using existing financial
facilities of more than $10 million to close on these transactions.”
32.

Also in that press release, Global Earth reported that Hawk “intends to

use existing credit facilities for more than $10 million to complete this transaction
and similar transactions going forwards [sic] . . ..”
33.

Global Earth repeated the representation that Hawk had existing credit

facilities of more than $10 million and/or more than $25 million in seven

8

2:16-cv-02889-DCN

Date Filed 08/19/16

Entry Number 1

Page 9 of 21

subsequent press releases dated October 17, 2013, November 7, 2013, November
22, 2013, December 3, 2013, January 9, 2014, February 5, 2014, and February 7,
2014.
34.

In truth, as Defendant Ragsdale knew, Global Earth’s press releases

were false and misleading because Hawk never had any material, existing credit
facilities, let alone credit facilities of more than $10 million or more than $25
million.
35.

Ragsdale was the source of Global Earth’s false and misleading

statements about Hawk’s existing credit facilities.
36.

At a minimum, Ragsdale reviewed and approved Global Earth’s

September 9, 2013 press release, which he knew would falsely and misleadingly
inform the public that Hawk had existing credit facilities of $10 million and/or $25
million.
37.

Global Earth omitted to disclose in the September 9, 2013 press

release that no acquisition by Hawk would benefit Global Earth or its shareholders,
as Global Earth owned no interest in Hawk.
Press Release Regarding Supposed Acquisition of Trump Equipment
38.

On September 27, 2013, Global Earth announced in a press release

that Hawk acquired Trump Equipment Company, Inc. (“Trump Equipment”),
9

2:16-cv-02889-DCN

Date Filed 08/19/16

Entry Number 1

Page 10 of 21

stating that Trump Equipment “is Hawk's first acquisition in oil services,” and that
Hawk “completed this TEC transaction as an equity transaction valuing Trump
Equipment at $9.5 million.”
39.

The statements in that press release were false and misleading

because, as Defendant Ragsdale knew, Hawk had only entered into a letter of
intent to acquire 65 percent of Trump's stock and the acquisition never closed.
40.

On October 17, 2013, Global Earth announced in a press release that

Hawk had signed a “letter-of-intent through its Trump . . . subsidiary to acquire
Swing Equipment Company, ” that the acquisition was expected to close on or
before December 1, 2013, and that Hawk “expects to use existing financing
facilities of more than $25 million to close the transaction on behalf of its
subsidiary.”
41.

In the same press release, Global Earth stated that Hawk intended to

use “existing credit facilities for more than $10 million to complete transactions.”
42.

These statements were false and misleading because, as Defendant

Ragsdale knew, Trump Equipment never was Hawk's subsidiary, Trump
Equipment’s letter of intent did not benefit Hawk, and Hawk had no existing credit
facilities, let alone credit facilities of $10 million or $25 million.

10

Page 11 of 21

Ragsdale was the source of Global Earth’s false and misleading

statements in the September 27, 2013 and October 17, 2013 press releases.
44.

At a minimum, Ragsdale reviewed and approved Global Earth’s

September 27, 2013 and October 17, 2013 press releases, which he knew would
mislead the public.
45.

Global Earth omitted to disclose in the September 27, 2013 and

October 17, 2013 press releases that no acquisition by Hawk would benefit Global
Earth or its shareholders, as Global Earth owned no interest in Hawk.
Press Release Regarding Supposed Partnership with SouthStar Capital
46.

On November 7, 2013, Global Earth announced Hawk's partnership

with SouthStar Capital (“SouthStar”), stating that SouthStar would be providing
Hawk and Trump Equipment with additional operating capital, and that “SouthStar
… will initially provide Trump … with a three year revolving line of credit that
initially can be drawn at up to $2.5 million per month.”
47.

These statements were false and misleading because, as Defendant

Ragsdale knew, Hawk had merely applied for financing from SouthStar, a South
Carolina-based financing company, and SouthStar never committed to fund Hawk
or Trump Equipment.

11

2:16-cv-02889-DCN

48.

Date Filed 08/19/16

Entry Number 1

Page 12 of 21

In addition, these statements were false and misleading because

Trump Equipment never was Hawk's subsidiary, any such transaction did not
benefit Global Earth, and Hawk had no existing credit facilities, let alone credit
facilities of $10 million or $25 million.
49.

Ragsdale was the source of Global Earth’s false and misleading

statements in the November 7, 2013 press release.
50.

At a minimum, Ragsdale reviewed and approved Global Earth’s

November 7, 2013 press release, which he knew would mislead the public.
51.

Global Earth omitted to disclose in the November 7, 2013 press

release that no acquisition by Hawk would benefit Global Earth or its shareholders,
as Global Earth owned no interest in Hawk.
Press Release Regarding Supposed Acquisition of NQM, Inc.
52.

On February 5, 2014, a press release issued by Global Earth and/or

Hawk announced Hawk's “closing the acquisition of NQM, Inc.,” that the
“acquisition is immediately accretive to HAWK's revenues and earnings,” that
“monthly revenues are targeted to be around $500,000 per month” throughout
2014 and that “[m]anagement remains confident that revenues could reach or
exceed $1M per month upon closing pending contracts.”

12

2:16-cv-02889-DCN

53.

Date Filed 08/19/16

Entry Number 1

Page 13 of 21

These statements were false and misleading because, as Defendant

Ragsdale knew, although Hawk had entered into a stock purchase agreement with
Neodesha Quality Machining, Inc. (“NQM”), not NQM, Inc. as stated in the press
release, Hawk never closed the NQM acquisition, none of NQM's revenues were
“immediately accretive” to Hawk, and there was no reasonable basis for projecting
that its revenues would benefit Hawk.
54.

Ragsdale was the source of Global Earth’s false and misleading

statements in the February 5, 2014 press release.
55.

Ragsdale reviewed and approved Global Earth’s February 5, 2014

press release, which he knew would mislead the public.
56.

Global Earth omitted to disclose in the February 5, 2014 press release

that no acquisition by Hawk would benefit Global Earth or its shareholders, as
Global Earth owned no interest in Hawk.
57.

Ragsdale reviewed and approved Global Earth’s February 5, 2014

press releases, which he knew would mislead the public.
Press Release Regarding Supposed Merger of Global Earth and Hawk
58.

On January 22, 2014, Hawk announced in a press release that Hawk

and Global Earth had “signed a definitive agreement” in which Hawk would

13

2:16-cv-02889-DCN

Date Filed 08/19/16

Entry Number 1

Page 14 of 21

acquire a “significant majority” of Global Earth stock, and that the new senior
management team would include Ragsdale as CEO.
59.

The press release described Ragsdale as having “experience in

managing organizations that have dealt primarily in the technology field.”
60.

In that press release, Global Earth’s CEO stated: “We are excited and

pleased for the quality of the new management team and where the Company is
headed.”
61.

In truth, as Defendant Ragsdale knew, Global Earth and Hawk merely

had signed a letter of intent, not a definitive agreement.
62.

The press release also misleadingly failed to provide adequate

information about the new management, including, as Defendant Ragsdale knew,
that Ragsdale's “experience” included a 2002 felony conviction for arson, for
which he was imprisoned until 2007 and on supervised release until 2010.
63.

On February 5, 2014, Global Earth and Hawk announced in a press

release “the closing of the transaction to acquire and merger [sic] into Global Earth
Energy.”

14

2:16-cv-02889-DCN

64.

Page 15 of 21

Global Earth and Hawk stated: “Under the completed transaction,

GLER delivered to Hawk Manufacturing common and preferred shares ” They
represented that the “new senior management team” would include Ragsdale as
CEO.
65.

The press release was false and misleading because, as Defendant

Ragsdale knew, although Global Earth and Hawk entered into merger agreements,
the merger never closed and no shares of stock were ever exchanged between
Global Earth and Hawk. Thus, there was no new management team.
66.

Yet, after the merger announcement, Ragsdale purported to act as

Global Earth's President by signing questionable loan documents dated February
2014, including a promissory note committing Global Earth to pay $1,500,000 to
Ragsdale himself.
67.

Ragsdale knew that Global Earth’s statements in the January 22, 2014

and February 5, 2014 press releases were false and misleading.
68.

At a minimum, Ragsdale reviewed and approved Global Earth’s

January 22 and February 5, 2014 press releases, which he knew would mislead the
public.

The Central Omission
69.

In addition to the above-cited material misrepresentations, each press

release omitted a highly material fact which Global Earth was under a duty to
disclose.
70.

By announcing supposed positive developments at Hawk, Global

Earth implied that such developments were positive for Global Earth; they were
not.
71.

Global Earth’s announcements of purported positive developments at

Hawk, which were fictitious in any event, would have been misleading even if
true, because they created the impression that Global Earth owned a stake in Hawk
and omitted the fact that Global Earth did not own a stake in Hawk. The purported
positive developments at Hawk, even if true, would have been no more relevant to
Global Earth than positive developments at any other company in which Global
Earth held no stake.
72.

By giving the investing public the false impression that positive

developments at Hawk benefitted Global Earth, Global Earth acquired a duty
affirmatively to disclose that Global Earth owned no interest in Hawk and that any
positive developments at Hawk would not benefit Global Earth.

A reasonable investor would have considered the information in the

above press releases, and the information omitted, significant.
74.

Global Earth made the above misrepresentations in, and omissions

from, the above press releases with an intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud, or,
at the very least, recklessly.
Defendant Ragsdale’s Role
75.

At the time of the issuance of each of the press releases detailed

above, both the CEO of Global Earth and Defendant Ragsdale knew that Global
Earth held no interest in Hawk, and that any positive developments at Hawk would
not benefit Global Earth or its shareholders.
76.

Ragsdale was the source of all or substantially all of Global Earth’s

false and misleading statements in the press releases detailed above.
77.

Defendant Ragsdale reviewed and approved the above-mentioned

press releases.
78.

Defendant Ragsdale knew or was reckless in not knowing that the

press releases described above were materially false and misleading.

Defendant Ragsdale nevertheless drafted and/or approved the press

releases for issuance to the public.
80.

Defendant Ragsdale thereby deliberately associated himself with

Global Earth’s effort to mislead the investing public through the described press
releases and sought to bring about such deception.
AIDING AND ABETTING FRAUD
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)]
and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]

Paragraphs 1 through 80 are hereby re-alleged and are incorporated

herein by reference.
82.

Global Earth, in connection with the purchase and sale of securities

described herein, by the use of the means and instrumentalities of interstate
commerce and by use of the mails, directly and indirectly:
a.

Global Earth knowingly, intentionally, and/or recklessly engaged in

the aforementioned devices, schemes and artifices to defraud, made untrue
statements of material facts and omitted to state material facts, and engaged in
fraudulent acts, practices and courses of business.
84.

Defendant Ragsdale knowingly or recklessly substantially assisted

Global Earth’s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §
78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5].
85.

By reason of the foregoing, Defendant Ragsdale aided and abetted

violations of and, unless enjoined, will continue to aid and abet violations of
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder
[17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5].
