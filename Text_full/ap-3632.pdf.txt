ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-15764
In the Matter of
GARY L. MCDUFF

ORDER FOLLOWING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

On October 2, 2015, I denied the Division of Enforcement’s summary disposition
motion. Gary L. McDuff, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3190, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4040, at
*24-25. On January 11, 2016, I denied Respondent Gary L. McDuff’s summary disposition
motion and directed that this matter proceed to a hearing. Gary L. McDuff, Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3482, 2016 SEC LEXIS 82, at *5. As McDuff is currently incarcerated at
FCI Beaumont Low, the parties both submitted letters regarding the logistics of holding a
hearing.
Both parties attended a telephonic prehearing conference on February 18, and the issue of
hearing logistics was discussed. The parties agreed that, due to the institution’s policies and
procedures, it would be extremely difficult to hold the hearing at FCI Beaumont Low. McDuff
did not consent to the Division’s suggestion to instead hold the hearing via video
teleconferencing. The Division raised the option of obtaining a writ of habeas corpus for
McDuff and transferring him to a federal detention center with facilities capable of holding a live
hearing. McDuff suggested the possibility of obtaining a furlough from prison in order to attend
the hearing. Both parties indicated that they required more time to determine the feasibility of
their suggestions.
Accordingly, the parties are ORDERED to file status reports on their efforts by March
25, 2016.
