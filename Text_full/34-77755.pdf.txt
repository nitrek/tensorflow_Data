In the Matter of
MALONEBAILEY, LLP, and
JAY PHILLIP NORRIS, CPA,
Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that public
administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against
MaloneBailey, LLP (“MaloneBailey”), and Jay Phillip Norris, CPA (“Norris”) (collectively,
“Respondents”) pursuant to Sections 4C1 and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(“Exchange Act”) and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) and 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.2
1

Section 4C provides, in relevant part, that:
The Commission may censure any person, or deny, temporarily or permanently,
to any person the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission in
any way, if that person is found . . . (1) not to possess the requisite qualifications
to represent others . . . (2) to be lacking in character or integrity, or to have
engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct; or (3) to have willfully
violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of, any provision of the
securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.

II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers
of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these
proceedings, and except as provided herein in Section V with regard to Respondent Norris, which
are admitted, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Public Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing
Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds that:
A.

SUMMARY

1.
These proceedings arise out of the Respondents’ audit of the financial statements of
Left Behind Games, Inc. (“LBG”), a penny-stock public company which sold religious themed
video games, for LBG’s fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011. Respondents’
audit report, dated August 3, 2011, was included in LBG’s Form 10-K filed August 4, 2011.
2.
Approximately 88% of LBG’s net revenues for its 2011 fiscal year resulted from
purported sales of its religious themed video games to Lighthouse Distributors, Inc. (“Lighthouse”).
In fact, these revenues were improperly recognized, and were the result of circular sham
transactions between LBG and the principal of Lighthouse, Ronald Zaucha (“Zaucha”), a former
consultant to LBG and close personal friend of LBG’s principal, Troy Lyndon (“Lyndon”). As a
result of the recognition of these phony revenues, LBG was purportedly profitable, for the first time
in its history. On September 24, 2013, the Commission sued Lyndon and Zaucha alleging

2

Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) provides, in pertinent part, that:
The Commission may censure a person or deny, temporarily or permanently, the
privilege of appearing or practicing before it . . . to any person who is found . . . to
have engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct.
Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) provides, in pertinent part, that:
The Commission may censure a person or deny, temporarily or permanently, the
privilege of appearing or practicing before it . . . to any person who is found…to
have willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of any
provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.

2

violations of, among other provisions, the securities registration and antifraud provisions of Sections
5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), and the antifraud provisions of
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and obtained permanent injunctions
and other relief against them. SEC v. Troy Lyndon and Ronald Zaucha, CV 13-00486 SOM-KSC
(D. Hawaii).
3.
Respondents’ conduct in auditing LBG for fiscal year 2011 resulted in the violation
of applicable professional standards constituting improper professional conduct. Additionally, the
conduct of Respondent MaloneBailey constituted willful violation of Regulation S-X Rule 202(b)(1), and the conduct of Respondent Norris willfully aided and abetted and caused
MaloneBailey’s violation of Regulation S-X Rule 2-02(b)(1).3

RESPONDENTS

4.
MaloneBailey, LLP is a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) which is based in Houston, Texas. It
specializes in auditing small public companies. At all relevant times, MaloneBailey had
approximately five audit partners. It currently has seven audit partners.
5.
Jay Phillip Norris, CPA, age 51, was a partner of MaloneBailey from 2009 until
December 2015 and is a certified public accountant licensed in the state of Texas. He was also
licensed in Oklahoma from August 6, 1999 until his license was canceled on June 13, 2002.
During the time period relevant to this proceeding, Norris served as the engagement partner for the
services MaloneBailey performed for LBG. These services included audits of the financial
statements of LBG for its fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011.

FACTS
1.

The Audit Client and its Related Party, Zaucha

6.
Left Behind Games, Inc. d/b/a Inspired Media Entertainment was
headquartered in Murrieta, California. It was founded by Lyndon on December 31, 2001, and
incorporated in Delaware on August 22, 2002. LBG became a public company on February 7,
2006. LBG’s stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78l(g). During the relevant period, LBG’s stock traded on the OTCQB exchange
under the ticker symbol “LFBG.” LBG terminated all of its employees and closed its office at the
end of 2011. On January 13, 2014, an Initial Decision was issued in In the Matter of Left Behind
Games, Inc., AP File No. 3-15522, revoking the registration of the securities of LBG based on
LBG’s failure to timely file required periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period
ended September 30, 2011. (Initial Decision Release No. 551.) That decision became final on
February 24, 2014. (Exchange Act Release No. 71603.)

A willful violation of the securities laws means merely “that the person charged with the
duty knows what he is doing.” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting
Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1949).

7.
Between September 2008 and September 30, 2010, LBG hired Zaucha as a
“consultant,” pursuant to three successive agreements, which provided that Zaucha would be
compensated with LBG stock.
8.
The agreements provided that the shares Zaucha received were restricted,
and could not be sold pursuant to SEC Rule 144 for six months. Zaucha completed a
“Seller’s Representation Letter” for a “NON-AFFILIATE.” [Emphasis original.] In the
letter, Zaucha represented that he was not an “affiliate” of LBG. Zaucha also stated that he
was not a “promoter” of the issuer, LBG, and that the stock “has been owned and fully paid
for by the undersigned in excess of one (1) year.” Based on these representations, between
November 9, 2009, and September 20, 2011, two attorneys issued at least 22 opinion letters
addressed to LBG’s transfer agent opining that the LBG shares issued to Zaucha were
permitted to be sold by Zaucha without registration, pursuant to Rule 144.
9.
Zaucha’s representations were false. Zaucha in fact was an “affiliate” because he
and LBG were both controlled by Lyndon. Zaucha had virtually no source of funds except from
the sale of LBG shares.
10.
Between August 4, 2009, and October 10, 2011, Zaucha sold over 1.74 billion LBG
shares after the restrictive legends were removed, realizing over $4.6 million in proceeds. The
sales were made pursuant to Lyndon’s instructions, often in emails, regarding the prices at which
to sell the shares, how much of the proceeds LBG, Lyndon and Zaucha would each receive, and at
which brokerage firms Zaucha should open accounts. Pursuant to instructions from Lyndon,
Zaucha repaid $3,282,626 of these proceeds to LBG as purported “early sell fees” under the
consulting agreements ($871,169), monies paid by Lighthouse for LBG products ($1,385,649), and
other payments ($1,025,808); made net payments to Lyndon of $55,000; paid $5,000 to LBG’s
auditor, MaloneBailey, and kept $1,278,165 for himself.
11.
The sham sales to Lighthouse constituted $1,385,649 in revenues reported by LBG
for its fiscal year 2011 ended March 31, 2011. These sales accounted for 88% of the $1,600,407 in
net revenues LBG reported that year, as well as the vast majority of LBG’s reported $1,485,044
increase in revenues over the prior year’s revenues of $115,363.
2.

MaloneBailey’s Audit of LBG for Fiscal Year 2011
a.

MaloneBailey Solicits and Obtains LBG as a Client and Learns
Shortly Thereafter that LBG May Have Engaged in Illegal
Conduct and Was Under Investigation by the Commission

12.
On January 19, 2011, the PCAOB permanently revoked the registration of LBG’s
then-auditor. Norris contacted LBG when he received a notice that LBG’s auditor was
deregistered by the PCAOB, and solicited LBG as a client. LBG engaged MaloneBailey shortly
thereafter.
13.
On January 26, 2011, Lyndon sent an email to Norris purporting to provide Norris
with a “solid snapshot regarding our company.” Although the email purported to disclose the

4

company’s leadership, history, and corporate staff, including “Exclusive Contractor Staff,”
Zaucha’s consulting arrangement with LBG and his role at the company were nowhere described.
Lighthouse is described, however, as LBG’s largest client, but without any disclosure that Zaucha
was its principal or in any way connected to it.
14.
Shortly after MaloneBailey was engaged, Respondents learned of the consulting
arrangement that LBG had with Zaucha, and that Zaucha was compensated with LBG shares.
Respondents also learned that Zaucha was giving cash back to LBG, purportedly because he sold
“too many” of the LBG shares he received in compensation. These payments were referred to,
variously, as “early sell fees” and “penalties.”
15.
The Respondents viewed this transaction as unique because of the provision that
Zaucha pay LBG “penalties” for selling too many LBG shares. The Respondents also viewed the
arrangement as a potentially illegal attempt to evade the federal securities laws, including the
Commission Rule 144 prohibition against selling “restricted” shares.
16.
In questioning at least one of the two attorneys who wrote the opinion letters
permitting removal of the Rule 144 restrictive legends from Zaucha’s shares, Norris learned that
the attorney was unaware that Zaucha was giving cash back to LBG. Norris was also unable to
obtain an opinion from the company or its attorneys that Zaucha’s payment of cash “penalties”
back to LBG was legal.
17.
Respondents were unaware of any documentation by Zaucha, such as invoices, of
any services he provided to LBG. Respondents understood that Zaucha’s consulting agreement
was the only consulting agreement that resulted in money coming back to LBG.
18.
As a result of MaloneBailey’s determination that LBG had understated its expenses
in previously filed financial statements, on February 15, 2011, LBG filed a Form 8-K current
report announcing its restatement of its financial results previously reported in its Form 10-K for its
fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, and its Forms 10-Q for its quarters ended June 30, 2009,
September 30, 2009, December 31, 2009, June 30, 2010, and September 30, 2010. LBG explained
that the prior financial reports “should no longer be relied [upon] due to errors in the accounting for
certain share-based compensation arrangements with consultants,” because LBG failed to
recognize the fair value of the share-based awards in accordance with GAAP, resulting in an
understatement of general and administrative expenses. This restatement related primarily to the
consulting arrangement that LBG had with Zaucha.
19.
After learning about the consulting arrangement, and Zaucha’s payments to LBG of
“early-sell” fees or penalties derived from the proceeds of his sales of LBG stock, on February 22,
2011, Norris included MaloneBailey’s now-retired founding partner on an email exchange
regarding whether MaloneBailey should resign from the LBG engagement. The founding partner
stated in response, in part, that with regard to whether the firm should resign:
I view the email you sent to me from Troy Lyndon as both threatening and
confusing – he doesn’t know what he is doing. His actions are highly illegal
and best case is his attorney talked him into it. I really hate resigning (as

5

you know) – I regard such as a challenge. However, I’d resign before
compromising where such a problem exists. I haven’t read the disclosure
you proposed and so don’t have an opinion, but your situation sounds very
bleak.
Norris responded:
I think we’re okay on the disclosure and [sic]. The only question is whether
this guy is a nut job we are ready to issue barring any intervention. If you
don’t have a problem, then we should issue.
The founding partner responded to Norris, copying MaloneBailey’s partner who had been the
quality control partner for several years until about February 14, 2011, and another audit partner.
The only MaloneBailey audit partner not included on the email chain was the engagement quality
review partner assigned to the LBG audit who had joined the firm on February 14, 2011 as its new
quality control partner. The founding partner’s response stated:
This isn’t my job and you haven’t kept me informed. Troy [Lyndon] isn’t
rational on this issue and the question is when and how he’ll get taken
down. I request and assume you’ll have clear and explicit disclosures and
resign if not.
20.
Norris responded to all of the recipients: “No Okay. Disregard my request.” The
engagement quality review partner, who had recently been hired by MaloneBailey, was unaware of
any discussions regarding MaloneBailey resigning from the LBG engagement. Moreover, the
engagement quality review partner had limited experience in auditing microcap companies.
21.
Subsequently, on March 25, 2011, after consulting with MaloneBailey, LBG sent a
letter to the Commission, purportedly pursuant to Section 10A of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §
78j-1, stating that “certain transactions between the Company and a former Consultant [Zaucha]
between September 28, 2009 and June 29, 2010, resulting in $871,169 proceeds which were
provided back to the Company as settlement regarding a contractual issue, may have constituted a
[Securities Act] Section 5 violation. . . .”
22.

Norris subsequently learned that Zaucha was an ex-convict.

23.
On May 3, 2011, Commission staff served a subpoena concerning LBG on the
founding partner in his capacity as custodian of records of MaloneBailey. Norris became aware of
the Commission investigation no later than May 4, 2011. The engagement quality review partner
became aware of the investigation no later than May 8, 2011, when he provided a written response
to the Commission subpoena, copying Norris.

b.

LBG Engages in Sales to Lighthouse, Which Respondents
Identify as Potential Sham Circular Transactions

24.
After the consulting arrangement between LBG and Zaucha ended, Lyndon and
Zaucha came up with a new scheme, which was intended to generate purported LBG revenue.
25.
In December 2010, Zaucha formed Lighthouse, which purportedly “purchased”
LBG product. LBG and Lighthouse entered into a distribution agreement during the period
MaloneBailey was questioning the payment of early-sell “penalties” by Zaucha to LBG.
Specifically, pursuant to instructions by Lyndon in a February 8, 2011 email, and orally from
Zaucha, in order to conceal Zaucha’s control over Lighthouse, including from MaloneBailey, a
Lighthouse employee signed the agreement as the purported “general manager” of Lighthouse. As
a result, Zaucha’s control of Lighthouse was not disclosed. The agreement was also backdated,
stating that it was effective “as of” July 2010. The Respondents never spoke with the employee
who signed the document on behalf of Lighthouse.
26.
During LBG’s fiscal year 2011, Lighthouse “purchased” LBG product using
$1,385,649 of Zaucha’s LBG stock sale proceeds, in sham roundtrip related party transactions.
27.
Lighthouse was, by far, LBG’s largest customer. In the fiscal year ended March 31,
2011, Lighthouse’s $1,385,649 in purchases were 88% of LBG’s $1,600,407 in net revenues,
which LBG touted in its Form 10-K as an increase of $1,485,044 over its prior year’s revenues of
$115,363.
28.
Rather than re-selling the LBG products, in most instances, Lighthouse distributed
them for free. That Lighthouse was giving away LBG product was not disclosed in LBG’s
financial statements or its Forms 10-Q, 10-Q/A or 10-K, even though MaloneBailey’s manager
assigned to the engagement was aware that Lighthouse was likely giving away at least some LBG
product.
c.

Respondents’ Audit Failures Regarding LBG’s Purported Sales
to Lighthouse
i.

Lighthouse Materially Modifies a Third-Party Written
Confirmation that Respondents Sought and Respondents
Fail to Review it or Consider its Contents Consistent
with PCAOB Standards

29.
Notwithstanding Lyndon’s and Zaucha’s attempts to conceal Zaucha’s ownership
of Lighthouse, by at least March 27, 2011, MaloneBailey nevertheless did discover the relationship
between Lighthouse and Zaucha. Respondents did not inquire of Lyndon why he did not inform
MaloneBailey that Zaucha owned and controlled Lighthouse.
30.
Once they discovered Zaucha’s role with Lighthouse, Respondents were concerned
that Zaucha may have used the proceeds from his sales of LBG stock to fund Lighthouse’s
purchases of LBG product in a transaction that merely consisted of a “circle of cash.”

7

31.
Norris was aware by at least May 5, 2011 that Zaucha was potentially a related
party to LBG, notwithstanding that Lyndon had told him that Zaucha was not a related party, and
Norris was further aware that he needed to determine whether Zaucha was, in fact, a related party.
32.
The only step that MaloneBailey took to determine whether Lighthouse was a real
entity was that Norris reviewed its website, which contained a mission statement and a form for
potential suppliers to complete. The identity of Lighthouse’s principal, Zaucha, was not disclosed
on the website. Respondents did not attempt to obtain financial statements from Lighthouse.
33.

Respondents did not detect that Lighthouse was in the same building as LBG.

34.
Moreover, Respondents failed to detect that Lighthouse was not incorporated until
December 2010, five months after the distribution agreement was purportedly entered into in July
2010 and LBG’s sales to Lighthouse purportedly began. Respondents also reviewed entries in
LBG’s books purporting to represent sales to Lighthouse. Those entries indicate sales beginning in
July 2010, well before Zaucha incorporated Lighthouse in December 2010.
35.
Respondents determined that they did not have sufficient audit evidence to support
the transaction between LBG and Lighthouse, and they therefore sought a written third-party
confirmation from Lighthouse.
36.
Accordingly, on July 27, 2011, Norris caused MaloneBailey to send an email to
Zaucha attaching a confirmation request Norris had written. That request asked Zaucha to confirm
that:
(1)

the sale and purchase transactions between Lighthouse Distributors
(“Lighthouse”) and Left Behind Games Inc. (“LBG”) were “real
transactions” whereby Lighthouse purchased and LBG sold copies of LBG
video games

(2)

the sale and purchase transactions were not in any way connected with the
consulting arrangement whereby Ron Zaucha performed consulting services
for LBG and received shares of LBG common stock

(3)

whether or not the proceeds from the sale of LBG’s stock were used to
purchase the video games from LBG [and]

(4)

there were no side agreements related to the consulting agreement or the
sale/purchase transactions[.]

Prior to sending the request, Norris emailed two of MaloneBailey’s four partners, including the
engagement quality review partner, advising them of the evidence obtained, his concerns over the
nature of the relationship between Zaucha and LBG, and explaining that a consultant who had
provided cash back to the company was also the owner of the company that was buying substantial
amounts of LBG product and contributing a significant amount of the company’s revenue. The
only suggestion in response to the email was made by the engagement quality review partner, who

8

suggested that Lighthouse should confirm there was no right of return. This suggestion did not
address, however, the adequacy of the confirmation for determining whether Lighthouse or Zaucha
was a related party to LBG, or whether the sale of product by LBG to Lighthouse was part of a
“circle of cash,” as suspected by Norris.
37.
On or about July 29, 2011, Zaucha transmitted to MaloneBailey a letter he signed
on behalf of Lighthouse which confirmed each of the above points, except that rather than
confirming the key point of whether the proceeds from the sale of LBG stock were used to
purchase the video games from LBG, Zaucha merely stated that “[a]ll decisions to invest monies
into my distribution company were independent from any sale of LBG common stock.” No one at
MaloneBailey inquired of Zaucha what he meant by this statement or why he altered the language
provided to him by MaloneBailey in the original proposed confirmation letter.
38.
In particular, Norris did not discuss the confirmation response with anyone. Nor
did he notice that the confirmation was differently worded than his confirmation request. Norris
also never attempted to obtain access to Lighthouse’s financial statements to verify its source of
funds for purchasing over $1.3 million of games from LBG, or whether Lighthouse ever generated
any revenue.
39.
Notwithstanding that Zaucha had altered the wording of the confirmation and did
not confirm that proceeds from the sale of LBG stock were not used to purchase the video games
from LBG, MaloneBailey stated in its Engagement Completion Document, prepared by the audit
manager and included in the audit work papers, that the confirmation “specifically” confirmed that
Lighthouse’s sales to LBG were “completely unrelated” to the consulting arrangements and there
were no side agreements “indicating that Ron Zaucha would use proceeds from sales of LBG stock
to re-purchase games from the Company.”
40.
All of the representations Zaucha made were materially false. As described above,
the transaction between LBG and Lighthouse was, in fact, a “circle of cash” and a sham, as
Respondents suspected. Had Respondents known Zaucha’s representations were false, they would
likely not have viewed the $1.38 million in sales to Lighthouse as legitimate revenue. In fact,
MaloneBailey likely would not have certified the financial statements and would have resigned if it
had learned that Zaucha was transferring proceeds from his sale of LBG shares directly to Lyndon
or LBG.
ii.

Respondents Rely on LBG’s CEO’s Representation that
He Did Not Have the Necessary Information to Make a
Requested Management Representation

41.
Norris caused MaloneBailey to request that Lyndon sign a management
representation letter confirming, among other things, many of the same facts Respondents had
asked Zaucha to confirm.
42.
Lyndon made various standard representations in the management representation
letter, which he signed on August 3, 2011. Lyndon’s representations included that the financial
information was recorded consistent with GAAP and that there were no material transactions that
had not been properly recorded, and that LBG management had no knowledge of any fraud
9

affecting the company which involved management. Additionally, Lyndon confirmed that
transactions involving “related parties,” as defined by GAAP provision FASB ASC 850-10, were
properly recorded or disclosed.
43.
Regarding LBG’s transactions with Lighthouse, Lyndon made the following
specific representations in the August 3rd management representation letter: (1) the sale and
purchase transactions between Lighthouse and LBG were “real transactions whereby Lighthouse
purchased and LBG sold copies of LBG video games”; (2) the sale and purchase transactions
“were not in any way connected with the consulting arrangement whereby Ron Zaucha performed
consulting services for LBG and received shares of LBG common stock”; and (3) “there were no
side agreements related to the consulting agreement or the sale and purchase transactions.”
44.
Each of Lyndon’s representations was false and consequently the purported sales to
Lighthouse should not have been recognized as revenue in accordance with GAAP. These
improperly recognized sales, constituting about 88% of LBG’s reported 2011 revenues, were
material to LBG’s financial statements. Moreover, when he signed the management representation
letter, Lyndon removed the representation requested by the Respondents that the consulting fees
paid by LBG to Zaucha were not a source of funds for Lighthouse’s purchases from LBG, falsely
claiming that “I do not have access to the information that would be necessary to make a
determination regarding the source of funds regarding Lighthouse’s purchases.”
45.
Upon MaloneBailey’s receipt on August 4, 2011, of Lyndon’s email making the
above representation and attaching the signed management representation letter, a senior auditor on
the engagement team inquired of the audit manager in an email “Is it OK that he took that line out
of the rep letter?” There is no record that the audit manager responded to this inquiry.
46.
Norris had requested that Lyndon make the specific representations regarding the
transactions with Lighthouse because, in his view, revenue recognition of the Lighthouse
purchases from LBG was dependent on the answers to some of the questions asked of Lyndon.
Respondents nevertheless relied on the management representation letter provided by Lyndon and
accepted Lyndon’s omission of the representation that the consulting fees paid by LBG were not a
source of funds for Lighthouse’s purchases from LBG without taking further audit steps,
notwithstanding that one of the engagement team members had specifically inquired whether
omission of the representation from the letter was all right. In particular, Respondents took no
steps to obtain financial information from Lighthouse or its bank regarding its source of funds to
purchase LBG products.
iii.

Certain Language Proposed by Respondents for
Inclusion in the 10-K that Would Have Disclosed that the
True Source of Funds for Lighthouse to Purchase Games
from LBG was Zaucha’s LBG Stock Sale Proceeds, was
Not Included in the Form 10-K

47.
During the audit of LBG for fiscal year 2011 ended March 31, 2011, Respondents
identified management override, revenue recognition and the consulting agreements with Zaucha
including share-based compensation as audit risks requiring heightened scrutiny. Respondents also

10

identified the transactions between Lighthouse and LBG as warranting additional scrutiny because
of the share-based compensation arrangement and consulting agreement that had existed between
Zaucha and LBG.
48.
On or about July 29, 2011, Respondents presented Lyndon the following draft
language as a proposed audit adjustment to be inserted into the footnotes to the financial statements
contained in LBG’s Form 10-K. The proposed language would have disclosed that Lighthouse
had, in fact, purchased video games from LBG with proceeds from sales of LBG stock originally
issued to Zaucha:
During the year ended March 31, 2011, the company recorded $1,385,649
of revenues from Lighthouse Distributors, Inc., a Company owned by
Consultant # 1. Lighthouse Distributors, Inc. purchased the video games
from the Company with the proceeds from sales of the Company’s common
stock originally issued under the consulting arrangements described above.
These sales transactions were not related to the original consulting
agreements and were not contemplated at the time the consulting
agreements were entered into.
[Emphasis added.] Norris believed that it was appropriate to disclose these facts, if true, as part of
the relationship between LBG and Zaucha in the Form 10-K.
49.
The Form 10-K was nevertheless filed with the Commission on August 4, 2011,
without the italicized language, rendering the Form 10-K materially false and misleading. Prior to
the Form 10-K being filed, Respondents possessed a draft with Respondents’ proposed language
clearly marked as deleted.
d.

LBG Files a False and Misleading Form 10-K

50.
Among other results, LBG’s financial statements included in its Form 10-K
reported net revenues of $1,600,407 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, compared to
$115,363 in restated net revenues for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. These revenues
included approximately $1,385,649 in revenues purportedly earned from sales to Lighthouse which
were, in fact, the result of the sham transactions described above. Additionally, the Form 10-K
stated that LBG’s $1,600,407 in annual revenues “represented an increase in our revenues of
$1,485,044,” and that “The revenue level increased primarily due to sales of $1,427,091 in the year
ended March 31, 2011 without comparable sales in the prior fiscal year, primarily because such
sales were to a new customer which focuses on distribution to non-profit organizations,” and that
customer accounted for approximately 88% of LBG’s revenues.
51.
These reported revenue figures were false and misleading because they were
generated mostly from sham transactions using the proceeds of the sale of Zaucha’s stock. Also,
the Form 10-K did not disclose that the sales to the distributor, Lighthouse, were sham transactions
for which revenues were not in fact properly recognized.
52.
The Form 10-K failed to disclose that the transactions between LBG and
Lighthouse were related party transactions. Instead, the “Transactions with Related Persons”
11

portion of Item 13 of LBG’s Form 10-K, entitled “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions,
and Director Independence,” falsely stated “We have not entered into any arrangements which are
considered transactions with related persons.” Nor was the related party nature of the transactions
disclosed anywhere else in the annual report, including in the financial statements and notes
thereto.
53. Notwithstanding that Norris was concerned by at least May 5, 2011 that Zaucha
might be a related party, the only audit step Respondents took to determine if Zaucha was in fact a
related party was to review an LBG stock ledger to determine whether Zaucha owned more than
5% of LBG stock. Although during the audit MaloneBailey transmitted a “Related Party
Worksheet” to Lyndon which stated in part that related parties were defined as “affiliates,”
Respondents had no discussions with Lyndon as to what constituted an “affiliate.” Nor did
Respondents discuss with Lyndon whether Lighthouse or Zaucha met another definition of “related
party” included in the worksheet – “other parties with which the company may deal with if one
party controls or can significantly influence management or operating policies of the other to an
extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate
interests.” Instead, Respondents simply accepted Lyndon’s representation on the form he signed
on or about July 13, 2011, that the number of transactions with related parties was “none.” They
did so even though they were aware that Lyndon represented to Norris in a March 28, 2011 email
that Zaucha was not a related party merely “because he is not an officer, director, family member
or 5% owner of the company,” and Norris knew that this definition of related party was too
narrow.
54. On or about November 9, 2011, Zaucha wired $5,000 to MaloneBailey in partial
payment of LBG’s audit fee. Norris was unaware that Zaucha paid part of LBG’s audit fee; had he
known, it would have raised concerns in his mind that Zaucha was a related party. MaloneBailey,
however, had no internal controls that would cause the audit partner to be notified if someone other
than the client is paying the audit fee. This is so even though it is not uncommon for MaloneBailey
clients to have “funding sources [that] are not traditional.”
55.
MaloneBailey’s audit report contained an opinion in which it represented that it had
conducted its audit of LBG’s fiscal 2011 financial statements in accordance with standards of the
PCAOB. In fact, as set forth below, Respondents’ audit was not conducted in accordance with
PCAOB standards.
3.

Respondents Engaged In Improper Professional Conduct

56.
In performing the audit of LBG for fiscal year 2011, the Respondents engaged in
improper professional conduct that resulted in a violation of applicable professional standards, as
set forth below.
a.

Numerous “Red Flags” were Present, Indicating Heightened
Scrutiny was Warranted

57.
Respondents identified revenue recognition as an area requiring heightened
scrutiny, and further identified the sales to Lighthouse, which accounted for 88% of LBG’s

12

revenues, as potential related party transactions and/or circular sham transactions. Numerous
additional “red flags” were present, including:
a.

Early in the audit process, Respondents learned a number of facts which
indicated that Lyndon had made misrepresentations and omissions of
material fact to other professionals and that Respondents therefore could not
rely on management representations, including that: (1) at least one of two
attorneys who wrote the opinion letters that the restrictions on Zaucha’s
shares should be lifted was unaware of LBG stock sale proceeds being paid
back by Zaucha to LBG as purported “early sell” fees or penalties, and
would not opine that the “penalties” were legal; (2) the attorney retained by
LBG as an independent counsel to conduct an internal investigation
resigned shortly after being hired by LBG, prior to Respondents
commencing the audit.

b.

Respondents also learned early in the audit process facts which indicated
that Lyndon had made misrepresentations and omissions to the Respondents
themselves, including that: (1) Lyndon failed to disclose or identify Zaucha
as a major contractor, or explain his relationship to Lighthouse, in his
January 26, 2011 email to Norris describing the company; and (2) in early
February 2011, Lyndon provided a distribution agreement between LBG
and Lighthouse which did not identify Zaucha as its principal, a fact
Respondents learned during the course of the audit.

c.

Respondents learned in May 2011 that the Commission was conducting an
investigation of LBG.

d.

The consulting agreement with Zaucha was the only consulting agreement
LBG had where monies were paid back to LBG by the consultant.

e.

Zaucha was an ex-convict, a fact which Norris learned during the course of
the audit.

f.

There was little documentation supporting the sales by LBG to Lighthouse.

g.

Lyndon and Zaucha altered language proposed by Respondents for
inclusion in three major documents regarding Lighthouse’s source of funds
to purchase LBG products: (i) the third-party confirmation which was to be
signed by Zaucha on behalf of Lighthouse; (ii) the management
representation letter signed by Lyndon; and (iii) LBG’s Form 10-K.

13

b.

Respondents Violated Applicable Professional Standards
i.

Respondents Failed to Act with Due Professional Care or
Exercise Professional Skepticism

58.
PCAOB standards require that “[d]ue professional care is to be exercised in the
performance of the audit and the preparation of the report.” AU 150. Additionally, “[d]ue
professional care requires the auditor to exercise professional skepticism. Professional skepticism
is an attitude that includes a questioning mind and a critical assessment of audit evidence. The
auditor uses the knowledge, skill, and ability called for by the profession of public accounting to
diligently perform, in good faith and with integrity, the gathering and objective evaluation of
evidence.” AU 230.07. Furthermore, “[i]n exercising professional skepticism, the auditor should
not be satisfied with less than persuasive evidence because of a belief that management is honest.”
AU 230.09. Exercise of due professional care also requires that an auditor obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by error or fraud. AU 230.10. PCAOB standard AU 230.12 also provides that
“Characteristics of fraud include (a) concealment through collusion among management. . . or
third parties; (b) withheld, misrepresented, or falsified documentation; and (c) the ability of
management to override or instruct others to override what otherwise appears to be effective
controls.”
59.
Respondents failed to act with due professional care because, in spite of the
materiality of the revenue from Lighthouse – it was 88% of LBG’s total revenue, representing a
1,287% revenue increase over the prior year – and the many “red flags” presented that neither LBG
management nor Lighthouse’s principal, Zaucha were, in fact, being truthful, Respondents
nevertheless accepted a confirmation, management representation letter, and Form 10-K which did
not make the representations they themselves had requested regarding Lighthouse’s source of
funds to purchase LBG product. Respondents accepted the deficient documentation as adequate
even after they themselves: (1) identified revenue recognition as an area requiring heightened
scrutiny because of the risk of fraud and (2) identified Zaucha as a potential related party.
60.
Moreover, all three “characteristics of fraud” described in AU 230.12 were present.
Respondents were: (1) aware of the potential for collusion between management (Lyndon) and
third party Zaucha; (2) presented with documentation that withheld key representations
Respondents themselves had sought, specifically the confirmation from Lighthouse, the
management representation letter and the Form 10-K; and (3) aware that LBG had ineffective
internal controls over financial reporting, as disclosed in LBG’s Form 10-K.
61.
Additionally, Respondents detected possible illegal acts by LBG, as evidenced by
large payments by LBG for unspecified services to a consultant, Zaucha, and the fact that the
Commission was conducting an investigation of LBG. AU 317.09. Although Respondents did
identify LBG’s illegal acts to the extent that they caused LBG to issue a letter to the Commission
purportedly pursuant to Section 10A of the Exchange Act, and considered whether other similar
transactions or events may have occurred, Respondents failed to act with due care in that they
failed to apply adequate procedures to identify potential additional illegal acts, as required by AU
317.11. Nor did Respondents consider the implications of LBG’s prior illegal acts in relation to

14

other aspects of the audit. Among other things, Respondents failed to consider the reliability of
representations by management, as required by AU 317.16, in light of “the relationship of the
perpetration and concealment, if any, of the illegal act to specific control procedures and the level
of management or employees involved.” In particular, Respondents were aware that Lyndon,
LBG’s CEO, had failed to disclose Zaucha’s role as a consultant when initially describing major
company contractors, and had failed to disclose Zaucha’s relationship to Lighthouse. Respondents
nevertheless relied on Lyndon’s representations in the management representation letter and Form
10-K, and Zaucha’s representations in the confirmation. Moreover, Respondents were aware that
LBG had disclosed that its internal control over financial reporting was ineffective.
ii.

Respondents Failed to Obtain Sufficient Competent
Evidence

62.
The PCAOB standards require that an auditor obtain sufficient competent evidential
matter concerning the assertions in an issuer’s financial statements, and state that an auditor’s
substantive procedures “must include reconciling the financial statements to the [underlying]
accounting records.” AU 326.19.
63.
Respondents did not obtain sufficient evidential matter concerning the sales by
LBG to Lighthouse. In particular, because there was little or no underlying documentation
supporting these sales, Respondents viewed a confirmation from Zaucha as essential, but then
failed to obtain a confirmation which, as Respondents requested, confirmed whether the source of
funds for Lighthouse to make the purchases was proceeds from Zaucha’s sales of LBG stock.
iii.

Respondents Failed to Evaluate the Confirmation
Received from Lighthouse

64.
The PCAOB standards require that “the auditor should evaluate the combined
evidence provided by the confirmations and the alternative procedures to determine whether
sufficient evidence has been obtained about all the applicable financial statement assertions.” AU
330.33. In particular, the auditor should consider: (a) the reliability of the confirmation; (b) the
nature of any exceptions; (c) the evidence provided by other procedures and (d) whether additional
evidence is needed. AU 330.33.
65.
Respondents failed to consider that the confirmation provided by Lighthouse was
differently worded from the confirmation they requested, in that the confirmation provided did not
clearly state whether Lighthouse’s source of funds for the purchases of LBG products was, in fact,
the proceeds from Zaucha’s LBG stock sales. They further failed to consider that the same
omission was made by Lyndon from the management representation letter he signed on behalf of
LBG.
iv.

Respondents Improperly Relied on Management
Representations

66.
PCAOB standards require that the independent auditor obtain written
representations from management as part of an audit, and provide guidance concerning the

15

representations to be obtained. AU Section 333.01. Among other things, management’s refusal to
furnish a written representation constitutes a limitation on the scope of the audit. AU 333.13.
67.
Respondents failed to consider whether Lyndon’s purported inability to furnish a
written representation that Zaucha’s LBG stock sale proceeds did not constitute a source of funds
for Lighthouse to purchase LBG products was a limitation on the scope of the audit. Instead, they
simply relied on Lyndon’s representation that he did not have access to information regarding the
source of funds used by Lighthouse to make the purchases. This failure was significant because
Zaucha’s similar failure to explicitly confirm that the sales proceeds were not a source of funds
meant that Respondents had no evidence confirming that LBG’s sales to Lighthouse were not
circular sham transactions, as Respondents suspected.
v.

Respondents Failed to Properly Audit the Related Party
Transactions Between LBG and Zaucha and Lighthouse

68.
PCAOB standards require that an auditor seek to identify related party relationships
and transactions and to satisfy himself concerning the required financial statement accounting and
disclosure. AU 334.01. The standards caution that “[t]he auditor should . . . be aware of the
possibility that transactions with related parties may have been motivated solely, or in large
measure” by certain conditions, including lack of sufficient working capital to continue the
business, and dependence on a single or relatively few customers or transactions for the continuing
success of the company. AU 334.06.
69.
Although Respondents identified the transactions with Lighthouse as potential
related party transactions, they failed to take adequate steps and gather sufficient competent
evidence to determine the true nature of these transactions and ensure their disclosure. In
particular, the only audit step Respondents took was to ask Lyndon to complete and sign a form
identifying related parties. Lyndon identified no related parties. PCAOB standards provide that,
when necessary to fully understand a particular transaction, certain additional procedures should be
considered, including confirming the transaction amount and terms, inspecting evidence in
possession of the other party to the transaction, and confirming or discussing significant
information with intermediaries, such as banks, to obtain a better understanding of the transaction.
AU 334.10. In this case, the only step Respondents took was to prepare and transmit a
confirmation request to Lighthouse, which they failed to detect was materially modified by Zaucha
in his confirmation response. Notwithstanding that Zaucha had modified the key portion of the
confirmation so that it did not state whether the source of Lighthouse’s funds to purchase LBG
product was Zaucha’s LBG stock sale proceeds, Respondents did not seek bank or other records to
determine Lighthouse’s source of funds.
vi.

Respondents Failed to Follow PCAOB Reporting
Standards

70.
PCAOB standards require that the auditor can determine that he or she is able to
express an unqualified opinion only if the audit has been conducted in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards and the auditor has been able to apply all the procedures the auditor
considers necessary in the circumstances. AU 508.22. Restrictions on the scope of the audit,

16

whether imposed by the client or by circumstances, including the inability to obtain sufficient
competent evidential matter, or an inadequacy in the accounting records, may require the auditor to
qualify or disclaim an opinion. AU 508.22.
71.
Respondents failed to properly qualify or disclaim an opinion notwithstanding their
inability to gather sufficient competent evidence that the funds used by Lighthouse to purchase
LBG product in transactions constituting 88% of LBG’s net revenue did not consist of proceeds
from Zaucha’s stock sales.
vii.

Respondent MaloneBailey Failed to Comply with
PCAOB Quality Control Standards

72.
PCAOB standards require that each CPA firm have a system of quality control for
its auditing practice. QC 20.01. Among other requirements, policies and procedures should be
established for deciding whether to accept or continue a client relationship and whether to perform
a specific engagement for that client. QC 20.14. “Such policies and procedures should provide the
firm with reasonable assurance that the likelihood of association with a client whose management
lacks integrity is minimized.” QC 20.14. Such policies and procedures should also provide
reasonable assurance that the audit firm appropriately considers the risks associated with providing
professional services in the particular circumstances. QC 20.15(b).
73.
MaloneBailey did not have procedures that provided reasonable assurance that
minimized the likelihood of association with a client whose management lacked integrity,
particularly where the client’s prior audit firm had had its PCAOB registration revoked.
74.
MaloneBailey’s lack of adequate quality control procedures is also evident from the
email chain between Norris, MaloneBailey’s founding partner, and every other MaloneBailey audit
partner except the engagement quality review partner. PCAOB standards require that policies and
procedures be established to provide reasonable assurance that audit personnel consult with
individuals within or outside the firm when appropriate, including when dealing with complex,
unusual or unfamiliar issues. QC 20.19. Although Norris attempted to consult with the founding
partner regarding whether or not to resign from the LBG engagement, and the founding partner
specifically stated that what Lyndon was doing was “highly illegal,” the founding partner left it to
Norris to decide whether to resign, while appearing to in fact discourage resignation, thus
undermining the attempt by Norris to consult consistent with quality control standards. Norris in
fact did then tell his partners to “Disregard my request” for advice.
75.
MaloneBailey also failed to prepare appropriate documentation to demonstrate
compliance with any policies and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the
likelihood of association with a client whose management lacks integrity is minimized, as required
by PCAOB standards. QC 20.25. MaloneBailey failed to document the above email
communications in the work papers. Accordingly, the engagement quality review partner was
unaware that resignation from the engagement had ever been considered.
76.
MaloneBailey also did not have monitoring procedures in place which would have
enabled it to obtain reasonable assurance that its system of quality control was effective, as
required by PCAOB standards. QC 30.03. Among other things, MaloneBailey did not have

17

procedures which included analysis and assessment of decisions related to acceptance and
continuance of client relationships and engagements. QC 30.03.
77.
Finally, the firm’s procedures shielded the engagement partner from knowledge of
who was paying the client’s audit fee, even though, as Norris knew, MaloneBailey’s clients often
had “funding sources [that] are not traditional.” As explained above, Lighthouse paid part of
LBG’s audit fee. Had Norris been aware of this fact, it would have raised concerns in his mind
about the relationship of LBG and Lighthouse.
4.

MaloneBailey Violated Regulation S-X Rule 2-02(b)(1) and Norris
Willfully Aided and Abetted and Caused MaloneBailey’s Violation of
Rule 2-02(b)(1)

78.
Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X requires an accountant’s report to state whether
the audit was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. “Thus, an auditor
violates Regulation S-X Rule 2-02(b)(1) if it issues a report stating that it had conducted its audit in
accordance with PCAOB Standards when it had not.” See In re Andrew Sims, CPA, Rel. No. 3459584, AAER No. 2950 (Mar. 17, 2009).
79.
As a result of the conduct described above, MaloneBailey violated Rule 2-02(b)(1)
of Regulation S-X by issuing an audit report stating that it had conducted its audit in accordance
with PCAOB Standards when it had not, and Norris willfully aided and abetted and caused
MaloneBailey’s violation of Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X.
D.

FINDINGS

80.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the Respondents engaged in
improper professional conduct within the meaning of Section 4C(a)(2) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
81.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that MaloneBailey willfully violated
and Norris willfully aided and abetted and caused MaloneBailey’s violation of Rule 2-02(b)(1) of
Regulation S-X within the meaning of Section 4C(a)(3) of the Exchange Act and Rule
102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
E.

83.
Retention of an Independent Consultant. MaloneBailey shall retain, within sixty
(60) days after entry of this Order, an independent consultant (“Independent Consultant”), not
unacceptable to the Commission staff. MaloneBailey will require the Independent Consultant to
review and evaluate the audit and interim review policies and procedures of MaloneBailey
including but not limited to those set forth in paragraph 82 above. MaloneBailey will require that
the Independent Consultant’s review and evaluation assess the foregoing areas to determine
whether MaloneBailey’s policies and procedures are adequate and sufficient to ensure compliance
with (a) the relevant Commission regulations and (b) audit standards relevant to appearing and

MaloneBailey shall adopt, as soon as practicable, all recommendations of the
Independent Consultant in the Report. Provided, however, that within thirty (30) days of issuance
of the Report, MaloneBailey may advise the Independent Consultant in writing of any
recommendation that it considers to be unnecessary, outside the scope of this Order, unduly
burdensome, or impractical. MaloneBailey need not adopt any such recommendation at that time,
but instead may propose in writing to the Independent Consultant and the Commission staff an
alternative policy or procedure designed to achieve the same objective or purpose. MaloneBailey
and the Independent Consultant shall engage in good-faith negotiations in an effort to reach
agreement on any recommendations objected to by MaloneBailey. In the event that the

hours being devoted to related party identification and testing. The audit-related training
requirement may be fulfilled by completing course(s) conducted in accordance with the
applicable state boards of accountancy.
b.
A Minimum of Eight (8) Hours of Fraud-Detection Training. The training shall
include techniques in detecting and responding to possible fraud in the course of public

not have the authority to terminate the Independent Consultant or substitute another independent
compliance consultant for the initial Independent Consultant, without the prior written approval of
the Commission staff; and (2) shall compensate the Independent Consultant and persons engaged
to assist the Independent Consultant for services rendered pursuant to this Order at their reasonable
and customary rates.
88.
MaloneBailey shall require the Independent Consultant to enter into an agreement
that provides that for the period of engagement and for a period of two years from completion of
the engagement, the Independent Consultant shall not enter into any employment, consultant,
attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with MaloneBailey, or any of its present
or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity. The
agreement will also provide that the Independent Consultant will require that any firm with which
he/she is affiliated or of which he/she is a member, and any person engaged to assist the
Independent Consultant in performance of his/her duties under this Order shall not, without prior
written consent of the Commission’s Los Angeles Regional Office, enter into any employment,
consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with MaloneBailey, or any of
its present or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity as
such for the period of the engagement and for a period of two years after the engagement.
89.
Provision of a Copy of this Order to New Public Company Audit Clients.
MaloneBailey undertakes that it shall forthwith provide a copy of this Order to any new public
company audit client which engages it between the date this Order is issued and the date that the
Independent Consultant certifies in writing that the undertakings discussed herein have been
completed to the satisfaction of the Independent Consultant.
90.
Certification of Compliance. MaloneBailey shall certify, in writing, compliance
with the undertakings set forth above. The certification shall identify the undertakings, provide
written evidence of compliance in the form of a narrative, and be supported by exhibits sufficient

of compliance, and Respondent agrees to provide such evidence. The certification and supporting
material shall be submitted to Karen Matteson, Senior Trial Counsel, Los Angeles Regional Office,
with a copy to the Office of Chief Counsel of the Enforcement Division, no later than sixty (60)
days from the date of the completion of the undertakings.

20

IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondents’ Offers.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:
A.
MaloneBailey shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and
any future violations of Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X.
B.

MaloneBailey is censured.

C.

MaloneBailey shall comply with the undertakings set forth in Section III.E. above.

D.
Norris shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any
future violations of Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X.
E.
Norris is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as
an accountant.
F.
After three years from the date of this order, Respondent Norris may request that the
Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the Chief
Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as:
1.

a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with
the Commission. Such an application must satisfy the Commission that
Respondent’s work in his practice before the Commission will be
reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company
for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he
practices before the Commission in this capacity; and/or

2.

an independent accountant. Such an application must satisfy the
Commission that:
(a)

Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which he is
associated, is registered with the PCAOB in accordance with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be
effective;

(b)

Respondent, or the registered public accounting firm with which he
is associated, has been inspected by the PCAOB and that
inspection did not identify any criticisms of or potential defects in
the Respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that would
indicate that the respondent will not receive appropriate
supervision;

21

(c)

Respondent has resolved all disciplinary issues with the PCAOB,
and has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions
imposed by the PCAOB (other than reinstatement by the
Commission); and

(d)

Respondent acknowledges his responsibility, as long as
Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an
independent accountant, to comply with all requirements of the
Commission and the PCAOB, including, but not limited to, all
requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring
partner reviews and quality control standards.

G.
The Commission will consider an application by Respondent Norris to resume
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and
he has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.
However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission
will consider an application on its other merits. The Commission’s review may include
consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to
Respondent’s character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice
before the Commission.

treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents agree that in any Related Investor
Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction of
any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondents’ payment of a civil
penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
Penalty Offset, Respondents agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order
granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission’s counsel in this action and pay the amount of
the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be
deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil
penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action”
means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more
investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.
V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by
Respondent Norris, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or
other amounts due by Respondent Norris under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent
order, decree or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the
violation by Respondent of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such
laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(19).
By the Commission.
