In the Matter of
MIDDLEBURY SECURITIES, LLC

ORDER

GREGORY OSBORN

On September 9, 2016, Respondent Gregory Osborn filed a letter with the Office of the
Secretary. Because the harm resulting from the disclosure of the personal and medical information
contained in the letter would outweigh the benefits, I SEAL the document. See 17 C.F.R.
ยง 201.322(b). The document shall be disclosed only to Commissioners, employees, and agents of
the Commission. Any party may move to unseal the document by filing a written motion.
