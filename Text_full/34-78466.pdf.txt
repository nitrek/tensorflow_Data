In the Matter of
JOHN B. GUYETTE

ORDER DENYING REQUEST TO VACATE BARS
John B. Guyette seeks to vacate an administrative order, dated November 25, 2013 (the
"Order"), to the extent that it bars him from association with any nationally recognized statistical
rating organization ("NRSRO") or municipal advisor.1
The Order barred Guyette from "association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser,
municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent" and from "participating in any offering of a penny
stock, including: acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in
activities with a broker, dealer or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny
stock, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock. . . ." It did
not, however, bar him from association with an NRSRO or a municipal advisor. Accordingly,
John B. Guyette's request to vacate NRSRO and municipal advisor bars is denied.
By the Commission.
