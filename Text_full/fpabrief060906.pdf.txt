COUNTERSTATEMENT OF JURISDICTION AND STANDING
The Securities and Exchange Commission had authority to issue its final rule,
Certain Broker-Dealers Deemed Not To Be Investment Advisers, Release Nos. 34-51523; IA2376 (April 12, 2005), published at 70 FR 20424 (April 19, 2005) (JA1-32) (“IA/BD
Rule”; “Rule”; “final rule” or Rule 202(a)(11)-1), under Sections 202(a)(11)(F), 15
U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(11)(F), and 211(a), 15 U.S.C. 80b-11(a), of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80b-1 et seq. (“IAA”). Under 15 U.S.C. 80b-13, this Court has
jurisdiction over challenges to administrative actions such as the Rule. Investment Co.
Inst. v. Board of Governors, 551 F.2d 1270, 1277-78 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Because the
Financial Planning Association (“FPA”) lacks standing to challenge the Rule,
however, this Court is without jurisdiction here.
The sole—conclusory—assertion in FPA’s brief that the Rule “injures the
FPA’s members by creating a dual standard for providing investment advice,” Br. 1
(citing Moisand Decl. ¶¶7-20), is insufficient to establish the injury required for
constitutional standing. See Sierra Club v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 899-901 (D.C. Cir.
2002) (party must produce, with opening brief, evidence establishing standing,
including a “substantial probability” of injury); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.
555, 560 (1992) (requiring “concrete and particularized” injury that is “actual or
imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical’ ”).
Nor does the cited declaration remedy the deficiency. Paragraph twenty’s
statement that the final rule “harms the financial planning profession” (Decl. ¶20) adds

nothing to the bare allegation in FPA’s brief. And, although paragraph eighteen alleges
devaluation of the “higher-quality” services of financial planners and other damage to
their reputation, it does so only in describing FPA’s February 7, 2005 comments on the
reproposed rule. See Decl. ¶18. Even if FPA could use the comment letter to
supplement the declaration, the letter, like the declaration, merely contains broad,
unsupported assertions of reputational harm.1 See 2/7/05 Letter at 2, 22-23 (JA128,
148-49). It is insufficient to demonstrate standing. See Center for Law and Educ. v. DOE,
396 F.3d 1152, 1161 (D.C. Cir. 2005).
Indeed, the letter underscores the lack of current injury, stating that
“[i]ndependent studies have concluded that the public generally has a highly favorable,
albeit fuzzy, picture of the benefits of financial planning.” JA148. Other record

1

The letter also asserts competitive injury. JA148. If, ignoring that the Rule
subjects financial planning to the IAA, FPA asserts competitive harm here, it
lacks prudential standing. Nothing in the language or legislative history of IAA
Section 202(a)(11) shows an intent to protect the market position of investment
advisers vis-à-vis other providers of legitimate investment advice; FPA’s
members are therefore not intended beneficiaries. See Hazardous Waste
Treatment Council v. EPA, 861 F.2d 277, 283 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (per curiam).
Further, in defining “investment adviser,” Section 202(a)(11) merely
determines the level and type of regulation of advice—e.g., broker-dealer
regulation alone or broker-dealer regulation and adviser regulation. It does not
prohibit rendering advice, and is therefore not an “entry-restriction”
competitors have prudential standing to challenge. See, e.g., Honeywell v. EPA,
374 F.3d 1363, 1370-71 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (per curiam), opin. withdrawn in part on
other grounds, 393 F.3d 1315 (D.C. Cir. 2005). Accordingly, FPA’s members are
not “suitable challengers.” See, e.g., Hazardous Waste Treatment Council v. Thomas,
885 F.2d 918, 922, 924-25 (D.C. Cir. 1989).
2

evidence undermines any assertion of future harm. See, e.g., T.D. Waterhouse, 2004
U.S. Investor Perception Study at JA118 (over 80% of investors surveyed would likely seek
advice from an investment adviser, and likely not from a broker-dealer, if aware of
differing standards of conduct). Any claim that a diminution in the public perception
of the integrity of financial planners is “certainly impending” would thus be pure
conjecture. See Advanced Mgmt. Tech. v. FAA, 211 F.3d 633, 636-37 (D.C. Cir. 2000); J.
Roderick MacArthur Found. v. FBI, 102 F.3d 600, 606 (D.C. Cir. 1996).
COUNTERSTATEMENT OF ISSUES
1.

In adopting the IA/BD Rule, did the Commission properly act, as

Congress intended in IAA Section 202(a)(11)(F), to except from the definition of
“investment adviser” in paragraph (11) broker-dealers (other than those already
identified in the paragraph) not within the paragraph’s intent?
2.

Did the Commission make reasonable judgments about other

matters—such as the Rule’s benefits—committed to its assessment?
STATUTES AND REGULATIONS
Pertinent statutes and regulations are set forth in FPA’s brief and in the
Commission’s separately bound Addendum of Statutory and Historical Materials.

COUNTERSTATEMENT OF CASE
A.

Nature of Case

This petition for review is from a final rule addressing application of the IAA to
broker-dealers offering two relatively new types of brokerage programs: (a) full-service
programs in which brokerage services, including investment advice,2 are provided for a
fixed or asset-based fee (“fee-based brokerage”) instead of the traditional commissions,
mark-ups, or mark-downs charged for “commission-based brokerage”;3 and
(b) discount programs, such as execution-only programs (“discount brokerage”). The
final rule also addresses, regardless of the type of compensation, the IAA’s application
to certain broker-dealer advisory services.
Paragraph (11) of IAA Section 202(a), 15 U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(11), defines an
“investment adviser” as “any person who, for compensation, engages in the business of
advising others . . . as to the value of securities or . . . the advisability of investing in,
purchasing, or selling securities . . . .” FPA’s Statutory Appendix at 1. Excepted from
that definition are five groups of persons who would otherwise fall within its broad
scope, including, in subparagraph (C), 15 U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(11)(C), any broker-dealer
2

Full-service brokerage includes services traditionally provided throughout a
securities transaction, including providing research and advice prior to the
decision to buy or sell, executing the transaction, arranging for delivery of
securities by the seller and payment by the buyer, and providing records of the
transaction. See JA6 n.37 (discussing “traditional brokerage services”).

3

References in this brief to “commissions” likewise include dealer mark-ups or
mark-downs. See JA3 & n.10.
4

“whose performance of [advisory] services is solely incidental to the conduct of [its]
business as a broker or dealer and who receives no special compensation therefor.” Id.
The paragraph concludes with subparagraph (F), 15 U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(11)(F), giving the
Commission express authority to issue rules, regulations or orders designating “other
persons” to be excepted from the definition because they are “not within the intent of
this paragraph.” Id.
The IA/BD Rule (Commission’s Addendum of Statutory and Historical
Materials at SA4-5) addresses fee-based brokerage through an exercise of the
Commission’s subparagraph (F) authority. It excepts broker-dealers offering such
accounts from the definition of investment adviser (and hence from the IAA). It does
so in response to changes in the brokerage industry: when the IAA was passed, no
broker-dealers offered fee-based brokerage—and they could not do so until decades
later. As explained below, the new exception reflects the Commission’s conclusion
that Congress would not have intended that broker-dealers offering a traditional
package of brokerage services for a fee be regulated under the IAA.
The Rule separately interprets the term “special compensation” in subparagraph
(C) of paragraph (11) to address discount brokerage. SA4. Finally, it addresses what
broker-dealer advisory services should be governed by the IAA through an
interpretation of the phrase “solely incidental to” in subparagraph (C) and the
exception for fee-based brokerage. SA4-5.

B.

Proceedings Below
1.

Proposed Rule

In 1999, the Commission issued for notice and comment a proposed rule to
address uncertainty about application of the IAA to broker-dealers offering fee-based
or discount brokerage programs. Release Nos. 34-42099; IA-1845 (November 4,
1999), published at 64 FR 61226 (November 10, 1999) (JA33-39) (“Proposing Release”).
The Commission viewed these new programs as positive developments for investors,
explaining first that “fee-based programs benefit customers by better aligning their
interests with those of their broker-dealers and thus are responsive” to the suggestions
in a report—prepared by a committee formed in 1994 at then-Commission Chairman
Levitt’s request—that identified the brokerage industry’s “best practices.” JA35 & n.9,
citing Report of the Committee on Compensation Practices (April 10, 1995) (“Tully
Report”) at JA69-90. The Commission continued:
Under these programs, broker-dealers’ . . . compensation no longer
depends on the number of transactions or the size of mark-ups or markdowns charged, thus reducing incentives for . . . churn[ing] accounts,
recommend[ing] unsuitable securities, or engag[ing] in high-pressure sales
tactics.
JA35. Second, discount brokerage programs, which resulted from the “unbundling” of
traditional brokerage services, enhanced customer choice by, for example, offering
customers who did not want or need investment advice the ability to trade securities at
lower commission rates. Id.

6

Uncertainty about whether the IAA applied to firms offering these programs
arose from past interpretations of certain terms in Section 202(a)(11)(C) of the Act. As
stated, subparagraph (C) excepts from paragraph (11)’s definition of “investment
adviser” any broker or dealer whose performance of advisory services is solely
incidental to its business and “who receives no special compensation therefor.” Unlike
broker-dealers offering only “commission-based” traditional brokerage services—who
have always been covered by the exception—full-service broker-dealers offering feebased or discount brokerage accounts might not be covered by the exception because
they might be seen to have received “special compensation.” The proposing release
explained (JA35):
Fee-based compensation may constitute special compensation . . . because
it involves the receipt . . . of compensation other than traditional
brokerage commissions. . . . [A]ddition[ally], the introduction of
execution-only services at a lower commission rate may trigger application
of the Act to . . . full service accounts . . . because the difference between
full service and execution-only commission rates represents a clearly
definable portion of a brokerage commission that is attributable, at least
in part, to investment advice.4

4

Historically, Congress and the Commission interpreted “special compensation” to
include “compensation other than brokerage commissions or dealer
compensation.” JA3 & n.10. Commission staff further viewed “special
compensation” as embracing a “clearly definable” charge for advice. See JA3 &
n.11, citing, e.g., Rel. No. IA-2 (October 28, 1940); Rel. No. IA-626 (April 27,
1978) (setting forth “staff views on the meaning of the term ‘special
compensation’”). See also Rel. No. IA-640 (October 5, 1978) (staff “intend[ed]
for the present to continue to interpret [the term] in the manner described in
. . . Release No. 626”). Under this staff view, a two-tiered commission
(continued...)
7

In examining the new programs, however, the Commission concluded that
Congress would not have intended that the IAA govern broker-dealers offering them.
For example, fee-based brokerage was “not . . . fundamentally different from
traditional brokerage . . . not subject to the [IAA],” thus “suggest[ing] strongly” that
compensation had become an unreliable guide to identifying the broker-dealer advice
Congress intended the Act to cover. Id. Furthermore, widespread customer
acceptance of the new programs could subject most brokerage arrangements to dual
regulation under the IAA and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange
Act”)—a result the Commission concluded Congress could not have intended. Id.
In light of these developments, the Commission proposed to exercise its
authority under IAA Section 202(a)(11)(F) to except, as not within the intent of the
definition of “investment adviser,” persons offering fee-based brokerage programs. See
JA39. Under the proposed fee-based brokerage provision, a broker-dealer providing
investment advice to customers, regardless of the form of compensation received,
would be excepted from the Act’s coverage if: (i) the advice was provided on a nondiscretionary basis; (ii) the advice was solely incidental to brokerage services; and (iii)

4

(...continued)
structure involved special compensation when the difference in price for upper
tier service was attributable to the provision of advice. See, e.g., Robert S. Strevell,
Staff No-Action Letter (April 29, 1985).
8

the broker-dealer disclosed to its affected customers that their accounts were brokerage
accounts. JA34.
Also consistent with the Commission’s understanding of congressional intent,
the proposal included a “discount-brokerage” provision designed to keep full-service
broker-dealers from being subject to the IAA simply because they introduced discount
brokerage services and, conversely, to keep discount broker-dealers from being subject
to the IAA simply because they introduced full-service brokerage. JA36. Under this
exercise of the Commission’s authority to interpret statutory terms, a broker-dealer
would not be considered to have received “special compensation” under Section
202(a)(11)(C) simply because it charged one customer more or less for brokerage
services than it charged another (“two-tiered” pricing). Id.
2.

First Petition for Review, Reopening of Comment
Period, and Stay of Appellate Proceedings

In July 2004, FPA petitioned for judicial review of the pending proposal. The
Commission then reopened the comment period and stated its intention to take final
action by December 31, 2004. Release Nos. 34-50213; IA-2278 (August 18, 2004),
published at 69 FR 51620 (August 20, 2004) (JA40). The Commission also sought, and
this Court issued, an order holding the petition in abeyance. In a December 2004
status report, the Commission stated it had determined to repropose the rule. The
reproposal was necessary in light of comments raising significant issues extending

9

beyond those contemplated in the proposing release. See Release Nos. 34-50979; IA2339 (January 6, 2005), published at 70 FR 2712 (January 14, 2005) (JA101-05).
3.

Reproposal and Order Continuing Abeyance

The Commission reproposed the rule in January 2005. Release Nos. 34-50980;
IA-2340 (January 6, 2005), published at 70 FR 2716 (January 14, 2005) (JA41-66)
(“Reproposing Release”). In some respects—including the discount brokerage
interpretation—the reproposal mirrored the proposal. In other respects, it was
significantly different. For example, while the fee-based brokerage provision continued
to except persons offering such accounts from the IAA, the reproposal enhanced
disclosure about the nature of fee-based brokerage accounts. JA48-49.
In response to comments, the Commission proposed to provide greater
guidance on when the performance of advisory services is “solely incidental to”
brokerage services, tentatively concluding that such advisory services are performed “in
connection with and reasonably related to” brokerage services. JA51-52. The
Commission explained the legal and policy reasons that led it to reject narrower
interpretations while, at the same time, adhering to the “limitation inherent in the
‘solely incidental’ standard.” JA52. Additionally, the reproposed rule provided that
discretionary asset management is not “solely incidental to” brokerage
services—regardless of the type of compensation paid for that advisory service. JA4951.

10

The Commission stated that it intended to take final action by April 15, 2005.
See JA103. The Commission then sought, and this Court issued, an order continuing to
hold the review proceeding in abeyance.
4.

Final Rule
a.

The Rule

On April 12, 2005, the Commission adopted a final rule now codified at 17
C.F.R. 275.202(a)(11)-1. See SA4-5. The Rule has three separate, yet related, parts:
•

Paragraph (a) is closely patterned after the “fee-based” and “discount”

brokerage provisions of the proposed and reproposed rules. It has two parts.
Fee-Based Brokerage. Under paragraph (a)(1), a broker-dealer receiving from
a customer compensation that can be considered “special compensation” is eligible for
a new exception from the IAA (adopted pursuant to Section 202(a)(11)(F)) if the
broker-dealer provides:
(i) advice solely incidental to brokerage services provided to the
customer’s account; and
(ii) disclosure enhanced from that originally proposed and reproposed.
All customer documents, including advertisements, must state:
Your account is a brokerage account and not an advisory account. Our
interests may not always be the same as yours. Please ask us questions
to make sure you understand your rights and our obligations to you,
including the extent of our obligations to disclose conflicts of interest
and to act in your best interest. We are paid both by you and,
sometimes, by people who compensate us based on what you buy.
11

Therefore, our profits, and our salespersons’ compensation, may vary
by product and over time.
Discount (Two-Tier) Brokerage. Paragraph (a)(2) provides that a broker-dealer will
not be deemed to have received “special compensation”—and thereby lose entitlement
to the subparagraph (C) exception—merely because it charges one customer more or
less for brokerage services than it charges another customer.
•

Paragraph (b). The second part of the Rule gives examples of broker-

dealer advisory activities included within the IAA because their performance is not
“solely incidental to” the conduct of the business of a broker or dealer (within the
meaning of the statute) or to the brokerage services provided to accounts covered
under paragraph (a)(1) of the Rule. It applies regardless of the type of compensation
charged. It identifies three non-exclusive circumstances in which advisory services
would not be performed “solely incidental to” brokerage:
1.

Separate Fee or Contract. Under paragraph (b)(1), when a

broker-dealer charges a customer a separate fee or enters into a separate contract for
advisory services, it must treat the customer as an advisory client.
2.

Financial Planning. Under paragraph (b)(2), a broker-dealer must,

under certain circumstances, treat a customer who receives financial planning services
as an advisory client.

12

3.

Discretionary Asset Management. Under paragraph (b)(3), with limited

exceptions, all accounts over which a broker-dealer has investment discretion are
treated as advisory accounts.
•

Paragraph (c). The third part of the Rule clarifies that broker-dealers

registered under both the Exchange Act (as broker-dealers) and the IAA (as investment
advisers) are investment advisers “solely with respect to those accounts for which
[they] provide[] services or receive[] compensation that subject [them] . . . to the
Advisers Act.”
b.

The Rationale

At the outset of the Adopting Release (JA2) and again later (JA20), the
Commission stated that the rulemaking was limited in scope and was “not the
appropriate mechanism for resolving” the wide-ranging policy concerns expressed by
commenters about broker-dealer conduct in general. JA20. Instead, many of those
concerns (including concerns about investor confusion, broker-dealer marketing, and
the extent of a broker-dealer’s fiduciary obligations to its customers) were more
appropriately addressed under the Exchange Act and would be the subject of a study,
which has recently been announced. Id.; see also JA2, 13 n.122, 14, 17 n.163.5

5

On March 3, 2006, Chairman Cox announced that “a study will be conducted
to address the issues specified” in the Adopting Release. Rel. Nos. 34-53406;
IA-2492 (March 3, 2006), published at 71 FR 12224 (March 9, 2006). See also
Chairman Cox, Opening Remarks to the Practising Law Institute’s SEC Speaks Series
(continued...)
13

Next, the Commission reiterated that its goal in fashioning the Rule was to
respond to change—the advent of brokerage programs that could not have been
foreseen when the IAA was enacted—and, in light of that change, to ensure that the
IAA continues to apply only to broker-dealers providing advice in a context that
Congress intended to cover. JA4, 5. To discern that intent, the Commission analyzed
the language, legislative history, and contemporaneous construction of Section
202(a)(11), including subparagraph (C), as well as the brokerage customs of 1940. JA612 (and materials cited, see CR5B-5F, 3H (JA106, 111, 113, 114, 115-16, 95-96) and
Addendum of Statutory and Historical Materials at HA1-170).
The Commission concluded that subparagraph (C) reflected a congressional
intent to except from coverage under the IAA broker-dealers who provided advice to
customers as part of a package of traditional brokerage services and, conversely, to cover
those that provided advice as a distinct service for which clients separately contracted
and paid. JA8-9. Congress thus intended to distinguish between broker-dealers
offering advice as a component of traditional brokerage services and broker-dealers
offering the sort of “purely advisory” or “discretionary” accounts investors typically
maintained in special investment advisory departments. JA6-7. By covering broker-

dealers under the IAA only to the extent that they offered advice as a distinct service,
Congress avoided additional and largely duplicative regulation of other brokerdealers—only six years earlier Congress had enacted the Exchange Act, including
provisions regulating broker-dealers, and had modified it to provide for further
oversight of broker-dealers only two years earlier. JA8 & n.67.
Focusing on fee-based brokerage, the Commission considered whether Congress
would have intended to subject broker-dealers offering such accounts to the IAA
simply because customers pay compensation other than commissions. JA9. The
Commission concluded that the answer was “no.” First, doing so would subject many
brokerage relationships to the regulatory overlap the historical evidence demonstrated
subparagraph (C) was drafted to avoid: “If anything, broker-dealers today are subject
to a level of regulation far greater than in 1940,” and much of that regulation concerns
their advice-giving function. JA9; see also JA10-11 & nn.93, 94.
Additionally, the Commission concluded that there is no historical evidence that
Congress viewed the type of compensation a broker-dealer received as having “any
independent relevance in terms of the advisory services the [IAA] was intended to
reach”—beyond identifying the advice that was being supplied by broker-dealers in a
context that Congress intended the Act to cover. JA9 (emphasis in original). When the
IAA was enacted, broker-dealers charged commissions for their traditional package of
services (including advice), and Congress understood “no special compensation” to

15

mean “only brokerage commissions.” Id. & nn.74-75; see HA164, 168. As such, to the
extent that a broker-dealer was charging something other than traditional transaction-based
broker-dealer compensation for advice, it was not eligible for the subparagraph (C)
exception. The “no special compensation” limitation thus served as a reliable brightline test for broker-dealers that should be subject to the Act. JA9 & n.76.
In the decades following 1940, however, things changed, undermining the
continuing validity of that test. In 1975, Congress and the Commission eliminated the
fixed commission rate structure, and thereby allowed broker-dealers to charge
something other than traditional broker-dealer compensation for their services. See
Exchange Act Section 6(e), 15 U.S.C. 78f(e); JA9 n.74. More recently, broker-dealers
began offering fee-based brokerage programs that provided the broad package of
brokerage services, including advice, formerly available only to commission-paying
customers. JA3, 9. Accordingly, the Commission concluded that these changes called
for the exercise of its authority under Section 202(a)(11)(F) to except broker-dealers
offering fee-based brokerage. JA9 n.78. “To the extent fee-based brokerage programs
offer a package of the same types of services that Congress intended the Advisers Act
not to cover, [the fee-based brokerage provision of] the [R]ule . . . is necessary to
prevent the Act from reaching beyond Congress’ intent.” JA9 (emphasis in original).
In so concluding, the Commission rejected a number of comments as contrary
to congressional intent. For example, although commenters urged that the fee-based

16

brokerage exception might harm investors by depriving them of IAA protections, it
was evident to Congress that excepted broker-dealers would be regulated not under the
IAA but under a different regulatory regime, that they would have certain conflicts of
interest with their customers, and that they would not in all instances function as full
fiduciaries. JA10-11 & n.93. Moreover, while acknowledging that the lines between
full-service broker-dealers and persons providing investment advice as a distinct service
had blurred, the Commission concluded that Congress drafted a statute that
accommodated—and empowered the Commission to respond to—change. JA12.
The Commission’s focus on the nature and context of the advice provided by
broker-dealers culminated in its interpretation of the phrase “solely incidental to the
conduct of his business as a broker or dealer.” In interpreting the phrase “solely
incidental to” to mean “in connection with and reasonably related to,” the Commission
considered, among other things: (a) the dictionary; (b) the statutory context of the
phrase; (c) the legislative history of Section 202(a)(11); and (d) the pertinent practices of
broker-dealers. JA14-15 & nn.134-135, 139-143 (see CR3I (JA97-98)); HA98; 119-120,
154, 157, 172-174, 175-181); see also JA51-52 & nn.100, 101.
The Commission acknowledged the phrase is not susceptible to a “bright-line”
definition and requires judgment based on the facts and circumstances. JA9 n.76. In
paragraph (b) of the Rule, however, the Commission identified three non-exclusive
circumstances in which the performance of advisory services would not be solely

17

incidental to brokerage. See supra pp. 12-13. In each of these circumstances, either the
advice is not rendered “in connection” with brokerage services (i.e., it is provided
essentially independently of brokerage services (e.g., JA16-17) or otherwise does not
follow as a consequence of conducting brokerage business (JA17)), or it is not
“reasonably related” to brokerage (i.e., it has a character that cannot reasonably be
understood to be part of the traditional package of brokerage services).6

Petition for Review and Consolidation

FPA petitioned for review of the final rule, and that petition was consolidated
with the earlier one. FPA’s brief does not press the earlier petition.
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
1.

In light of IAA Section 202(a)(11)’s language, history, and background,

the Commission reasonably concluded, under subparagraph (F), that: (a) broker-dealers
offering fee-based brokerage accounts covered by the Rule—who indisputably could
not have existed in 1940—are “other persons” than the subgroup of broker-dealers
already excepted from the Act; and (b) it would be inconsistent with congressional
intent to subject them to IAA regulation. FPA and the amici offer no supportable
basis for overturning these determinations.

6

See, e.g., JA18 (exercise of discretion is not “reasonably related” to brokerage
because it is “qualitatively distinct from simply providing advice as part of a
package of brokerage services”—its “quintessentially supervisory or managerial
character warrants [IAA] protection”); see also id. at n.176.
18

They argue, in essence, that the Commission lacked authority to except the
broker-dealers at issue because Congress did not except them when it excepted other
broker-dealers in 1940. But, they fail to appreciate that, to address circumstances
unforeseen when the IAA was drafted, subparagraph (F) gives the Commission express
authority to determine whether persons who fall within the literal definition of
“investment adviser” are nonetheless persons Congress would have intended to except
from the Act. Subparagraph (F) thus expressly contemplates disconnects between the
literal definition of “investment adviser” and congressional intent—and empowers the
Commission to remedy such variances as it did in this case.
The arguments about “rewriting” the statute and the impropriety of looking
behind the statute’s plain language are thus inapposite. Similarly, because subparagraph
(F) exceptions apply to situations in which Congress intended no IAA regulation, there
is no merit to arguments—raised only by amici—that the Commission was required to
consider alternatives to a blanket exception or that the Rule’s disclosure requirement
was intended to “substitute” for IAA protections.
Finally, the inflammatory and baseless contention that the Commission distorted
the IAA’s legislative history to “protect broker-dealers”—who FPA likens to the
unregulated tipsters and touts that were principal targets of the Act—misconstrues the
Commission’s findings and the relevant history, and ignores Congress’s determination

19

that not all broker-dealers who supply investment advice should be regulated as
investment advisers.
2.

FPA’s remaining attacks on the Rule as harming investors are similarly

misplaced. Its claims of a “shrinking statute” and facilitation of conflicts of interest
reflect a basic disagreement with Congress’s judgments about which advice providers
should be subject to the Act’s fiduciary obligations. Its challenges to the Commission’s
assessment of the Rule’s benefits misstate the Commission’s views and distort the
Rule’s effect.
3.

The Court should not countenance the repeated attempts by the amici to

raise issues on which FPA is silent or to which it only vaguely alludes, including the
propriety of the Commission’s approaches to “special compensation” (in the context
of discount brokerage) and “solely incidental to” and the efficacy of the Rule’s
disclosure requirement. In any event, the confused contentions about discount
brokerage offer no basis for overturning the Rule. The Commission’s interpretation of
“solely incidental to”—unlike the challengers’—reasonably accounts for all words in
that phrase and the relevant statutory and historical context. And, finally, the
challengers’ critique of the disclosure requirement misapprehends its purpose and
misjudges its likely effectiveness.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
Under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 706, this Court considers
whether an agency action is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise
not in accordance with law. The Commission’s findings of fact are conclusive if
supported by substantial evidence. 15 U.S.C. 80b-13. In informal rulemakings, the
substantial evidence standard and the “arbitrary [or] capricious” test converge, Williams
Natural Gas v. FERC, 943 F.2d 1320, 1328 (D.C. Cir. 1991), requiring a “rational
connection between the facts found and the choice made.” Public Citizen v. NHTSA,
374 F.3d 1251, 1260 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (internal quotation omitted). Under Chevron v.
NRDC, 467 U.S. 837, 842-44 (1984), this Court defers to the Commission’s
interpretation of the IAA, so long as Congress has not “unambiguously forbidden [the
interpretation] and it is . . . ‘based on a permissible construction of the statute.’ ”
Northpoint Tech. v. FCC, 414 F.3d 61, 69 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quoting Chevron); see also
Consumer Electronics Ass’n v. FCC, 347 F.3d 291, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (applying Chevron
to whether FCC had authority to promulgate rule).
ARGUMENT
I.

THE COMMISSION ACTED WITHIN ITS AUTHORITY IN ADOPTING
THE FEE-BASED BROKERAGE PROVISION.
In adopting the Rule’s fee-based brokerage provision—paragraph (a)(1) of the

Rule—the Commission did not, as FPA and NASAA repeatedly assert (e.g., FPA Br.
27-29; NASAA Br. 8, 14 ), “rewrite” IAA Section 202(a)(11)(C). The fee-based
21

brokerage provision makes no change to subparagraph (C). Instead, the Commission
exercised its express authority under Section 202(a)(11)(F) to except certain brokerdealers from the “investment adviser” definition—after properly finding that: (1) those
broker-dealers offering fee-based brokerage covered by the Rule are “other persons”
under subparagraph (F); and (2) it would be inconsistent with the intent underlying
Section 202(a)(11) to regulate them under the IAA. Supra pp. 14-17; see also, e.g., JA6
n.35, 9 n.78, 31 & n.284.
A.

The Challengers Misperceive the Commission’s Authority
under IAA Section 202(a)(11)(F).

Most of the challenges to the Commission’s authority rest on the assumption
that it was “extraordinary” and inconsistent with governing law for the Commission
(1) to except broker-dealers that are otherwise expressly covered by the language of
Section 202(a)(11), and (2) to do so based on the conclusion that, despite subparagraph
(C)’s language, such broker-dealers are not within the intent of paragraph (11). See, e.g.,
FPA Br. 25-35, 38-41; NASAA Br. 4-9. These arguments ignore the plain language and
purpose of subparagraph (F): Every person excepted under subparagraph (F) is one
who otherwise falls within the definition of “investment adviser” in paragraph (11)
(and does not fall within an exception), and the only basis for a subparagraph (F)
exception is a Commission finding that it nonetheless would be inconsistent with the
paragraph’s “intent” to subject that person to the Act. Subparagraph (F) thus
recognizes the fact that—due to circumstances unforeseen when the Act was
22

drafted—applying the express language of paragraph (11) (including the specific
exceptions adopted by Congress in 1940) will sometimes lead to results that conflict
with the intent underlying that paragraph.
The challengers never recognize this essential and dispositive point. None of
the cases cited for the proposition that an agency may not deviate from a statute’s plain
language (FPA Br. 27-30; NASAA Br. 7-9) or “update” its reach (FPA Br. 20, 31)
involves a provision like subparagraph (F). Subparagraph (F) is neither “vague” nor
“ancillary” (FPA Br. 31), but a critical component of Congress’s intentionally flexible
regulatory scheme—one that expressly vests the Commission with authority to make
adjustments by a rule or order to carry out congressional intent. See NASD v. SEC,
420 F.2d 83, 92 (D.C. Cir. 1969) (noting, in discussing Commission’s authority under
Investment Company Act (ICA) Section 6(c), 15 U.S.C. 80a-6(c) (SA2)—which, in this
regard, is similar to subparagraph (F)—that “[t]he Commission has exercised this
authority to exempt persons not within the intent of the Act and generally to adjust its
provisions to take account of special situations not foreseen when the Act was
drafted”), vacated on other grounds, Investment Co. Inst. v. Camp, 401 U.S. 617 (1971).
The Commission’s reliance on subparagraph (F) also distinguishes American
Bankers Ass’n v. SEC, 804 F.2d 739 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (see FPA Br. 34-35), which
concluded that neither the Commission’s general authority to define technical, trade,
accounting, or other terms under the Exchange Act nor the phrase “unless the context

23

otherwise requires” preceding Exchange Act definitions authorized the Commission to
“redefine” the term “bank” in that Act. 804 F.2d at 753-55. Here, rather than relying
on a non-specific source of authority, the Commission acted pursuant to subparagraph
(F)’s explicit delegation of authority to formulate a definitional exception. The
American Bankers court itself suggested that this sort of delegation to “take account of
future changes” could allow an agency wide latitude to implement a statute. Id. at 749.
The challengers’ failure to recognize the purpose and effect of congressional
grants of authority like subparagraph (F) also is shown by their extended discussions of
Congress’s intent to protect investors through the IAA (e.g., FPA Br. 41-44; NASAA
Br. 10-11, 16-17; PIABA Br. 5-6)(discussing, e.g., the Capital Gains decision and the
Commission’s recent brief in Chamber of Commerce v. SEC, No. 04–1300 (filed D.C. Cir.
Feb. 16, 2005) (addressing the ICA)). In fact, the Commission explicitly and carefully
considered this intent in ensuring that the IA/BD Rule comported with the purposes
of the Act. See JA7-8. But, unlike the Commission, the challengers exclusively
emphasize this aspect of Congress’s intent, while downplaying the exceptions in
subparagraphs (A)-(E) and essentially ignoring subparagraph (F). In so doing, they
disregard the balance Congress struck in paragraph (11) and, in particular, its express
determination in subparagraph (F) that the Commission should maintain that balance.

24

The Commission’s reliance on subparagraph (F) also defeats claims—which are
raised only by amici and therefore should not be considered by this Court7—that the
Rule is “arbitrary and capricious” because the Commission was required to consider
alternatives to a “blanket exemption” from the IAA (FD Br. 4-12) or because the Rule
“substitutes” a “notice” provision for the IAA’s “comprehensive fiduciary obligations
and genuine ongoing disclosure” requirements. PIABA Br. 2; see also 3, 6-9, 13; FD Br.
8. These arguments ignore the Commission’s finding that Congress would not have
intended the broker-dealers covered by the fee-based brokerage exception to be
regulated as investment advisers. Consistent with that finding, the Commission could
not have considered any “alternative” that involved IAA regulation.8 Nor would it
have fashioned a disclosure requirement as a “substitute” for IAA fiduciary obligations
or disclosures it concluded Congress did not intend to impose. Instead, the fee-based
brokerage provision’s disclosure requirement is a limited response to investor
7

See, e.g., Knetsch v. U.S., 364 U.S. 361, 370 (1960); Narragansett Indian Tribe v.
National Indian Gaming Comm’n, 158 F.3d 1335, 1338 (D.C. Cir. 1998); cf.
Lamprecht v. FCC, 958 F.2d 382, 389 (D.C. Cir. 1992); see also Cellnet Comm. v.
FCC, 149 F.3d 429, 443 (6th Cir. 1998) (refusing to consider challenge to rule as
arbitrary and capricious, raised only by amicus, that went beyond scope of
petitioner’s particular challenge to the rule as arbitrary and capricious).

8

Chamber of Commerce v. SEC, 412 F.3d 133, 136, 144-45 (D.C. Cir. 2005), review
granted, 443 F.3d 890 (D.C. Cir. 2006), is not to the contrary. See FD Br. 10-11.
In that case, the challenged provisions were adopted pursuant to ICA Section
6(c), which, unlike Section 202(a)(11)(F), does not require a determination that
regulation under a statute is precluded by congressional intent. Thus, in
Chamber, unlike here, the Commission had authority to consider various
options under a statute for achieving its regulatory goal.
25

confusion that could result from the same change in circumstances— compensation no
longer reliably identifying advisory services the IAA was intended to cover—that
justified the fee-based brokerage exception in the first instance. See supra pp. 15-16 and
infra pp. 50-51.
Beyond this, the Commission properly concluded that it was appropriate to
study ways to use applicable broker-dealer regulatory authority to address investor
protection concerns identified in the rulemaking. See supra pp. 13-14 & n.5. This was
not, as amici erroneously assert (FD Br. 9), a concession that an exception from the
IAA might be unwarranted. Instead, it was an acknowledgment that, as between the
pertinent two of the family of statutes Congress empowered the Commission to
administer, Congress would have intended that the broker-dealers excepted by the Rule
be regulated under the Exchange Act (and related Commission and self-regulatory
organization authority) and not under the IAA.
There is likewise no merit to NASAA’s position (NASAA Br. 24)—on an issue
that only it raises and thus is outside the scope of this appeal (see supra n.7)—that the
Commission acted inconsistently with the public interest by excepting broker-dealers
under subparagraph (F) and thereby “preempting the authority of state securities
regulators to perform an independent assessment of the proper treatment of those
acting as investment advisers.” It assumes, contrary to the Commission’s finding, that
the broker-dealers at issue are acting as those that Congress intended to regulate as

26

“investment advisers.” And, ultimately, it quarrels with Congress’s judgment that
where, as here, the Commission acts pursuant to subparagraph (F), certain state laws
are preempted.9 15 U.S.C. 80b-3a(b)(1) (SA1).
Finally, FPA’s argument (Br. 34-35) that the Commission lacked sufficient
authority under IAA Section 211(a) alone to promulgate paragraph (a)(1) of the Rule is
irrelevant. The Commission acted pursuant to both Section 202(a)(11)(F) (which
expressly authorized the exception) and Section 211(a) (see SA2), which buttresses the
subparagraph (F) authority by giving the Commission the power to issue rules
“necessary or appropriate to the exercise of the functions and powers conferred upon
the Commission elsewhere in this title.” 15 U.S.C. 80b-11(a); see Action on Smoking and
Health v. CAB, 699 F.2d 1209, 1212 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (quoting Mourning v. Family
Publications Serv., 411 U.S. 356, 369 (1973)), opin. supplemented, 713 F.2d 795 (D.C. Cir.
1983).10

9

NASAA did not raise this preemption issue in its comment letters. Moreover,
this challenge, as well as its authority challenge, is inconsistent with statements
of support in those letters. See CR6 (Letters 12, 1491) (JA120-23; 124-26).

10

Furthermore, because, as FPA correctly states (Br. 18, 36), the Commission did
not rely on IAA Section 206A, 15 U.S.C. 80b-6a (see JA31 & n.284), it is
unnecessary to address FPA’s Section 206A argument (see Br. 36-38).
27

B.

Broker-Dealers Excepted by the Fee-Based Brokerage Provision Are
“Other Persons” within the Meaning of Section 202(a)(11)(F).

As FPA acknowledges (Br. 32), “other” has always meant “different” or “distinct
from.” FUNK & WAGNALL’S NEW STANDARD DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH
LANGUAGE 1752 (1937); BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 761 (6th ed. 1991). But, contrary
to FPA’s further assertions (Br. 31-34), broker-dealers excepted under the Rule are
“other persons” under subparagraph (F)—a class of persons “different from” those
described in subparagraphs (A)-(E) of Section 202(a)(11). JA9 n.78.
Specifically, broker-dealers covered by the Rule’s fee-based brokerage exception
are those that offer advice as part of a package of brokerage services for which they
receive compensation other than traditional transaction-based compensation—a subset
of broker-dealers that could not have existed and was unforeseen when the IAA was
passed. Supra p. 16. On its face, then, the Rule complies with subparagraph (F)’s
“other persons” requirement by designating a class of broker-dealers different from
those identified in subparagraph (C), who receive only traditional compensation for
providing advice as part of brokerage. Id.
FPA argues (Br. 31-34) that the broker-dealers covered by the new rule are not
“other persons” under subparagraph (F) because they are not “different from” brokerdealers covered by subparagraph (C). This argument—essentially, “a broker-dealer is a
broker-dealer”—ignores the basic structure of Section 202(a)(11). Each of the groups
of “persons” Congress excepted in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (11) is
28

only one possible subset of a larger group of “persons” that meets the broad definition
of “investment adviser” and is differentiated (and excepted) based on specific facts
relating to the way in which advice is provided. The broker-dealers excepted by
subparagraph (C) are one subset of broker-dealers covered by the definition; the brokerdealers excepted by the Rule are a different subset.
Thus, the Commission’s determination that broker-dealers covered by paragraph
(a)(1) of the Rule are “other persons” is not inconsistent with cases FPA cites in
support of its argument that “other” means “ ‘different ’ from things already mentioned.”
Br. 32-33 (emphasis FPA’s). Further, none of those cases interprets a provision—like
subparagraph (F)—that vests an administrative agency with authority to except persons
from a statute based on a finding that literal application of the statutory language
produces a result inconsistent with underlying intent. See supra pp. 22-24. Finally, in
each of the cited cases, the interpretation of “other” adopted by the court was
necessary, in context, to avoid contravening particular legislative—or contractual
—intent. Here, the narrow reading of “other” FPA urges would, for the reasons
discussed above, affirmatively undermine the purpose of subparagraph (F).
FPA also argues (Br. 27-31)—ironically—that the broker-dealers covered by the
Rule cannot be excepted because they are “different from” the broker-dealers excepted
by subparagraph (C) in a critical sense—they receive compensation other than the
commissions to which the subparagraph (C) exception is limited. But, of course,

29

subparagraph (F) was written precisely to allow the Commission to except persons who
are not covered by the paragraph’s existing exceptions. See supra pp. 22-23.11
Even if the Court concluded that “other persons” in subparagraph (F) is
ambiguous, it should defer to the Commission’s interpretation because it is consistent
with the statute’s language and reasonably achieves the administrative flexibility that
delegations such as subparagraph (F) are intended to promote. See United States v. Mead
Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 227 (2001); see also NASD v. SEC, 420 F.2d at 92. FPA’s reading
would unreasonably limit the Commission’s ability to respond to unanticipated
circumstances—a result contrary to Congress’s intent. See In re Permanent Surface Mining
Regulation Litig., 653 F.2d 514, 522 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (en banc) (quoting American Trucking
Ass’ns v. U.S., 344 U.S. 298, 309-310 (1953)).
C.

The Commission Reasonably Concluded That Congress Did
Not Intend the IAA to Apply to Broker-Dealers Excepted
by the Fee-Based Brokerage Provision.

Contrary to the challengers’ arguments (Br. 29-31, 38-41; NASAA Br. 7-8, 11), it
was not merely permissible but necessary under subparagraph (F) for the Commission to
look not only to the IAA’s language but also to the context in which the Act was
written to determine whether—notwithstanding the literal language of Section

11

FPA’s argument that the Commission’s interpretation of subparagraph (F)
could result in an “unconstitutional delegation” of legislative and/or judicial
power (Br. 30-31) is baseless. Subparagraph (F) permits only those exceptions
necessary to comply with Congress’s intent, and the Commission’s
determination of that intent is subject to judicial review.
30

202(a)(11) and subparagraph (C)—Congress’s “intent” would have been to apply the
Act to a group of broker-dealers that could not have existed when it was drafted.12
As a general matter, courts have long recognized the propriety of considering the
historical background of an enactment in discerning the intent underlying statutory
provisions. See, e.g., South Dakota v. Yankton Sioux Tribe, 522 U.S. 329, 343-44, 351-52
(1998); Penn Allegh Coal v. Holland, 183 F.3d 860, 864 (D.C. Cir. 1999). That is
especially true where, as here, the circumstances to which a particular provision is being
applied did not exist when the provision was enacted. See, e.g., SEC v. VALIC, 359
U.S. 65, 75-76 (1959) (concurring opinion) (“At th[e] time [the exclusions were drafted]
. . . the sort of ‘variable annuity’ contract . . . in this case did not exist. . . .[I]f a brandnew form of investment . . . emerges . . . labeled ‘insurance’ or ‘annuity’ by its
promoters, the functional distinction that Congress set up in 1933 and 1940 must be
examined to test whether the contract falls within the sort of investment form that
Congress was then willing to leave exclusively to the [states]. . . . [T]he regulatory and
protective purposes of the Federal Acts and of state insurance regulation as it then
existed becomes relevant.”).
The Commission thus properly analyzed the intent of Section 202(a)(11) by
examining that provision and its legislative history in the context of the prevailing

12

For the same reason, there is no merit to FPA’s argument (Br. 42) that the
Commission improperly ignored statements in congressional committee
reports essentially reciting the language of Section 202(a)(11)(A)-(E).
31

practices in the financial services industry that gave rise to the IAA. JA6-8 & nn.37-66
(and authorities cited). Against that background—which FPA does not challenge—the
Commission determined that, in two respects, it would be contrary to congressional
intent to regulate broker-dealers as “investment advisers” simply because they may be
receiving “special compensation.”
First, the Commission determined (JA9) that supplying advice for compensation
other than commissions is no longer in itself sufficient to establish that the brokerdealer is providing advice in a context that Congress intended to subject to the IAA.
Although the challengers disagree with that determination (Br. 38-39; NASAA Br. 1112), they do not contest the Commission’s underlying findings (supra pp. 14-16).
Critically, they have not disputed that—until the emergence of the fee-based brokerage
programs at issue—the requirement that broker-dealers receive only traditional brokerdealer compensation (“no special compensation”) for investment advice meant that the
Act applied to broker-dealers who supplied advice as a distinct service and did not
apply to those who supplied advice as part of a package of brokerage services. Instead,
they dispute only the Commission’s conclusion that the “no special compensation”
requirement was intended to serve that line-drawing function.

32

Although FPA’s argument assumes some alternative purpose for “no special
compensation” (see Br. 39-40), FPA does not suggest one.13 Instead, FPA attacks—as
“ambiguous” and “weak”—evidence the Commission identified as indicating the
contemporaneous understanding of “no special compensation” in particular and the
scope of the subparagraph (C) exception in general. But, the lack of clarity that FPA
professes to find in the legislative history relied on by the Commission (Br. 45-52)
results in large part from FPA’s own failure to read that history in the broader context
of contemporaneous industry and regulatory practice set forth in the Adopting Release
(JA6-12, 14-15; see also supra pp. 14-16 and infra p. 55). When read consistently with
those undisputed background facts, the legislative history FPA discusses fully supports
the Commission’s findings (JA8-9).14
Those findings are supported even by certain statements by members of
Congress and witnesses that FPA distorts and then falsely accuses the Commission of
13

FPA does note (Br. 8, 40) that the “no special compensation” requirement is
included in the exception for broker-dealers but not for the other professionals
excepted in Section 202(a)(11)(B), but it offers no suggestion as to why
Congress made this distinction. We note that—unlike lawyers, accountants,
engineers, and teachers—in 1940, only broker-dealers charged a particular type
of compensation (commissions, mark-ups, or mark-downs) for the advice that
Congress intended to except from the Act and another type of compensation
(fees) for advice Congress intended the Act to govern.

improperly omitting. For example, the statement from Senator Boren that FPA
purports to reproduce (Br. 48-49) was actually a question, the premise of which the
responding witness did not accept. Read in context, and in light of the undisputed
historical background, the witness’s testimony clearly echoed the prevailing view that
broker-dealers supplying advice would be subject to the IAA only to the extent that
they were specifically compensated for that advice—“the term as used in this bill
includes only investment advisers who get paid for giving advice” (HA154)—as
distinguished from those supplying advice as part of a package of brokerage services
for which they received only commissions. See also HA8-11, 41 n.1, 95.15
Likewise, FPA’s reading of the statements of Representatives Sabath and
Hinshaw (Br. 50-51) makes no sense in context. See HA172-174. The concerns the
representatives expressed about excepting brokers and other advice providers make
sense only if, as the Commission concluded, they understood that the exceptions for
broker-dealers and others broadly excepted those advice givers. Further, FPA
mischaracterizes the additional statement of Representative Sabath quoted on page 51
of its brief, which referred not to the IAA alone, but also to the ameliorative effects of

15

The other testimony FPA accuses the Commission of improperly omitting (Br.
49) is irrelevant. It involves the ICA—not the IAA—and concerns restrictions
on broker-dealer management and oversight of investment companies at the
same time as they are supplying investment advice to individual investors.

all of the legislation that had been passed in the seven years preceding the IAA to deal
with the problems that led to the market crash in 1929. HA173-174.
Second, the Commission concluded (JA9) that extending the Act to brokerdealers supplying fee-based brokerage would run afoul of Congress’s intent to avoid
unnecessary and duplicative regulation of broker-dealers. Although FPA disagrees with
that determination as well (Br. 38-40), it again does not dispute the Commission’s
underlying findings as to broker-dealer regulation (supra pp. 15, 17 and infra p. 37).
Instead, FPA mischaracterizes the Commission’s conclusion as based on a purported
congressional “intent to protect broker-dealers” that is irreconcilable with Congress’s
intent to protect investors. See, e.g., Br. 41, 42, 45; see also NASAA Br. 11.
The Commission never stated or implied that Section 202(a)(11)—or the
Rule—was based on or drafted to further a congressional intent to “protect” brokerdealers rather than investors. (Nor, as described infra pp. 41-47, 49-50, is this the effect
of the IA/BD Rule). Rather, the Commission correctly stated (see supra p. 16-17) that
Congress decided that only certain broker-dealers supplying investment advice should
be subject to the IAA. In so deciding, Congress necessarily determined that, with
regard to the broker-dealers that it was excepting from the Act, investors were
adequately protected by existing broker-dealer regulation. This has long been the
accepted view of the underlying purpose of this and other such exceptions. JA8 n.66
(citing Illinois Legislative Council Report (1939), HA137 (describing as one of the

35

reasons for such exceptions “that [excepted] persons and firms are already subject to
governmental regulation of one type or another”)); see also JA8 n.68.16
The challengers again offer no alternative rationale for the statutory brokerdealer exception. Instead, they attempt to sidestep the logic of the Commission’s
reasoning by implying that, in 1940, Congress could not have intended both to relieve
many broker-dealers supplying investment advice from the additional regulation of the
IAA and to protect investors. E.g., Br. 41-44; see also NASAA Br. 10-12. To bolster this
position, they repeatedly liken broker-dealers to the “touts and tipsters” referred to in
the legislative history (e.g., Br. 26, 42, 44-45), suggesting erroneously that, when the Act
was drafted, broker-dealers were in no different position than the members of the
largely unregulated “fringe” who were a principal target of the Act (JA7).
In fact, both Congress and the Commission were fully aware of the progress that
had been made in the preceding six years in the regulation of broker-dealers under the
Exchange Act and otherwise. See, e.g., JA8 n.64. Indeed, in contrast to the Exchange
Act, the IAA as originally enacted was “little more than a continuing census of the
nation’s investment advisers.” 7 Louis Loss & Joel Seligman, Securities Regulation 3312-

16

Notwithstanding NASAA’s contrary assertion (NASAA Br. 14), the
Commission did not “pronounce” anywhere in the Adopting Release that
complying with the IAA was “unduly burdensome,” in “direct contradiction”
of Rel. No. IA-626 (April 27, 1978), published at 43 FR 19224 (May 4, 1978).
The Commission did, however, specifically consider and “reject” any statement
in Release 626 that might be “interpreted to be inconsistent” with its
judgments underlying paragraph (a)(1) of the Rule. JA12 n.102.
36

14 (3d ed. 2003); see also JA7. As such, it was entirely reasonable for Congress to
conclude that, in order to protect investors, it was unnecessary to subject the brokerdealers who were supplying advice as part of the traditional package of brokerage
services—and were already subject to a comprehensive regulatory scheme—to the
IAA.
Thus, contrary to amici’s arguments (FD Br. 5, 6, 8-9, 10; see also NASAA Br.
12), the Commission supported its conclusion that Congress would have considered it
unnecessary and/or duplicative to apply the IAA’s provisions to certain broker-dealers.
It did so by specifically referring to the congressional action in the 1930s (described
above) regulating broker-dealer conduct. JA8 & nn.67, 68. And, in concluding that the
Rule “is consistent with the statute’s intent to avoid largely duplicative regulation”
(JA11), the Commission elaborated on those references, detailing the regulation that
has continued to be and is now applicable to broker-dealers under the Exchange Act,
resulting in an overall regulatory regime that today contains substantial duplication and
overlap with IAA regulation. JA10-11 & nn.93, 94; see also, e.g., JA23-24 (stating that
certain costs engendered by paragraph (b) of the Rule to broker-dealers not already
complying with the IAA would be “mitigated” by “infrastructure” already in place at
those broker-dealers, “much of which overlaps with Advisers Act requirements” and
giving examples).

D.

FPA Confuses the Rule’s Fee-Based Brokerage Exception with
Its Discount (Two-Tier) Brokerage Interpretation.

FPA confuses (e.g., Br. 9-14, 53-54, 56) “fee-based” brokerage—addressed in
paragraph (a)(1) of the Rule through an exception adopted pursuant to IAA Section
202(a)(11)(F)—with discount (two-tier) brokerage—addressed in paragraph (a)(2) of
the Rule through an interpretation of Section 202(a)(11)(C). Most pointedly, in asserting
that the Rule’s fee-based brokerage provision changes over 60 years of precedent
interpreting subparagraph (C)’s “no special compensation” requirement, FPA relies, for
the most part, on staff statements about two-tiered pricing that have nothing to do
with fee-based brokerage. See Br. 53-54 (arguing that the Commission’s treatment of
“fee-based brokerage programs” deviates from precedent and citing Br. 9-11 (dealing, for
the most part, with “special compensation” in the context of two-tier pricing))
(emphasis supplied); see also Br. 56 (the “large expansion of fee-based programs occurred
notwithstanding . . . that . . . (2) the SEC had consistently interpreted two-tiered pricing
programs as beyond the broker-dealer exception”) (emphasis supplied).
Contrary to FPA’s assertion, the Commission acknowledged that broker-dealers
supplying fee-based brokerage might be receiving “special compensation” as it had
been interpreted by Congress and the Commission (see supra n.4) and therefore be
ineligible for the statutory exception. JA3, 9. The fee-based brokerage exception thus
makes no change to the meaning of “special compensation.” Instead, it states that a

38

broker or dealer (who meets certain requirements) “[w]ill not be deemed to be an
investment adviser based solely on its receipt of special compensation . . . .” SA4.
To the extent that FPA’s statements (e.g., Br. 10-13, 14) could be construed as
asserting that the discount (two-tier) brokerage interpretation (of paragraph (a)(2))
deviates from precedent, they do not raise an issue for this Court’s consideration.
FPA’s statements only hint at a legal issue and are made in the brief’s background
section, unanalyzed, and without citation to relevant case law or other relevant sources.
See, e.g., Edmond v. Postal Service, 953 F.2d 1398, 1399-1400 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (per curiam)
(stating that this Court’s precedent “makes it absolutely clear that, unless a legal
argument is appropriately identified as such—appearing in a section of the brief
devoted to that argument and not as an obscure or passing reference under an
unrelated heading, with citations to authorities in its favor—the argument is waived”);
see also, e.g., SEC v. Banner Fund, 211 F.3d 602, 613-14 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Carducci v.
Regan, 714 F.2d 171, 177 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). Consequently, if NASAA challenges the
discount (two-tier) interpretation (NASAA Br. 13-15), it should not be heard (see supra
n.7).
In any event, the Commission properly exercised its inherent authority (see Trans
Union v. FTC, 295 F.3d 42, 50 (D.C. Cir. 2002)) to interpret “special compensation” in a

39

way that “supersede[d]” the “odd result” of previous staff interpretations17 “not
compelled by the Act” (see supra n.4) that “a full-service broker-dealer cannot offer
discount brokerage without treating its full-service brokerage accounts as advisory
accounts even though the services offered to those full-service accounts remained
unchanged” (JA14). The Commission’s interpretation reasonably makes a brokerdealer’s eligibility for an exception with respect to an account turn on the
characteristics of that account and not other accounts. Id.; see Kaseman v. DC, 444 F.3d.
637, 642 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“When possible, statutes should be interpreted to avoid
‘untenable distinctions,’ ‘unreasonable results’ or ‘unjust or absurd consequences.’ ”)
(citations omitted).
E.

The Commission’s Judgments in This Rulemaking Are
Otherwise Consistent with Congress’s Intent.

The challengers present no basis for this Court to conclude that the Commission
lacked authority to promulgate the Rule. Consequently, they are relegated to urging, in
an emotional and often misleading way, that the Rule is bad for investors. To the
extent these arguments concern and ultimately disagree with Congress’s policy
judgments—rather than the Commission’s (addressed infra pp. 46-52)—they are invalid
bases for challenging the Rule as set forth here.

17

Staff no-action letters and interpretations are not precedents binding on the
Commission. See, e.g., Rel. No. 33-5098 (October 29, 1970).
40

FPA is wrong when it asserts that the Commission “decide[d] that, because
brokers are providing more and more investment advisory services, Congress would want
the IAA to cover less and less.” Br. 20 (emphasis FPA’s); see also Br. 54. In fact, the
Commission concluded that Congress would not have intended the IAA to apply to
broker-dealers providing advice to customers maintaining the fee-based accounts at
issue because of the context in which those advisory services are performed—as part
of a package of traditional brokerage services—not because of the amount of advice
provided. See supra pp. 15-17 and infra pp. 52-57.
It is uncertain whether, as an absolute matter, hewing to Congress’s intent about
which broker-dealer advice should and should not be covered by the Act will result in
more or less broker-dealer advisory activity being subject to the IAA. While it is true
that fee-based accounts have grown in popularity and industry observers expect firms
will continue to move away from transaction-based compensation (see, e.g., JA9), not all
fee-based accounts will be exempt from the Act—the advice rendered to such accounts
might not be solely incidental to brokerage. JA12, 14; see also supra pp. 12-13, 17-18 and
infra pp. 52-58. Thus, the amount of advisory services subject to the IAA will, to a
large extent, be determined by which services investors elect to purchase. Indeed,

41

investors may, in increasing numbers, seek advisory services, such as financial planning
and discretionary management, that the Rule now expressly subjects to the IAA.18
FPA also wrongly claims (Br. 22, 54, 57; see also NASAA Br. 19-20) that the Rule
“facilitates the making of self-interested principal transactions . . . that would not take
place” (Br. 54, emphasis FPA’s) because “clients would otherwise object ” (Br. 57, emphasis
supplied) if they received the pre-settlement disclosure required by IAA Section
206(3).19 And FPA is doubly wrong when, by attributing its own views to the
Commission and taking Commission statements out of context, it claims the
Commission placed its imprimatur on such a result. See Br. 54; id. 22-23; see also FD Br.
5; NASAA Br. 20.
Although the Commission did conclude that one of the Rule’s benefits would be
to “preserve the ability” of broker-dealers to engage in principal transactions (e.g.,
18

If the Rule’s discount (two-tier) brokerage interpretation had been challenged
on the ground that it too results in “less and less” advisory services being
covered that argument would fail for the same reasons set forth above
regarding fee-based brokerage.

19

IAA Section 206(3), 15 U.S.C. 80b-6(3), prohibits, among other things, an
adviser, acting as principal, from knowingly selling to or purchasing from a
client any security, without disclosing to the client in writing the capacity in
which it (or an affiliate) is acting and obtaining the client’s consent. SA1.
Disclosure and consent must be obtained separately for each transaction (Rel.
No. IA-40 (February 5, 1945)) prior to the transaction’s settlement (Rel. No.
IA-1732 (July 17, 1998)). The Section reflects Congress’s recognition that
principal transactions have a potential for abuse, such as price manipulation or
the placing of unwanted securities into client accounts. Rel. No. IA-1732.
Congress did not, however, prohibit these transactions. Instead, it addressed
potential abuses by imposing disclosure and consent requirements. Id.
42

JA21), it did not do so to deprive investors of the opportunity to object to transactions
to which they would “otherwise object.” On the contrary, principal trading (e.g., when
a broker-dealer sells securities from its inventory) has long been a necessary and
beneficial part of the U.S. securities markets. As the Commission stated, it is “an
important source of liquidity in some market sectors” (JA21) and can provide
customers with efficient execution and access to types of securities not widely available
(see JA25). It is not client objections, but often the time and effort on the part of the
client and the broker-dealer needed to satisfy Section 206(3)’s disclosure and consent
requirements, that can make principal trading impractical and, hence, unavailable to
persons who might otherwise benefit from it. E.g., Clifford E. Kirsch, Investment Adviser
Regulation (2005), § 15:2.2 at 15-10[C] (stating that, because of the “onerous”
requirements of Section 206(3), advisers typically do not engage in principal
transactions and rely instead on a Commission rule that permits them to engage in
agency cross-transactions without obtaining consent before each specific transaction
(see 17 C.F.R. 275.206(3)-2)).
To a significant extent, the IA/BD Rule addresses the congressional concerns
(supra n.19) underlying Section 206(3): discretionary authority is made subject to the
Act and, in the absence of such authority, a broker-dealer does not have the power
(unchecked by the customer) to sell a customer unwanted securities. In any event,
when Congress passed the IAA, it was well aware of the conflicts posed when firms

43

functioned both as dealers and brokers while also advising customers about purchasing
and selling securities. See, e.g., JA10-11 & n.93 (citing, e.g., SEC, Report on the
Feasibility and Advisability of the Complete Segregation of the Functions of Dealer
and Broker (June 20, 1936) (HA35-39) (submitted to Congress)). Congress nonetheless
excepted from the IAA broker-dealers providing advice as part of a package of
brokerage services. And, notwithstanding FPA’s assertion (Br. 26), the Commission’s
recognition of these undisputed facts does not mean it concluded that “Congress
meant the [IAA] to preserve undisclosed self-dealing” (emphasis FPA’s) that would harm
investors.20 If broker-dealer misconduct harms a customer, Exchange Act and selfregulatory organization remedies (such as actions for unsuitable recommendations) can
redress that harm.
At bottom, this and other contentions about fiduciary duties (e.g., NASAA Br.
17-18; PIABA Br. 9-13), including assertions—express and implied—that brokerdealer regulation is an inadequate substitute for adviser regulation, reduce to the
contention that it would be preferable, in the challengers’ view, for all (or almost all)
broker-dealer advice to be subject to the IAA. Indeed, NASAA lays this bare, stating
(NASAA Br. 17) that “adequate protection of investors requires that those dispensing
investment advice be subject to a fiduciary obligation with its attendant disclosure

20

In fact, broker-dealers are required to disclose their capacity in a given
transaction. See, e.g., 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-10; NASD Rule 2230.
44

requirements.” Such a result, however, would contravene Congress’s judgments in
passing the Act with exceptions. See JA10 (“[w]hatever policy advantages . . . could be
gained by” extending the IAA to all broker-dealers providing advice, “it would be
inconsistent with the conclusions reached by Congress when it passed the Act”).21
The distinction between Exchange Act and IAA regulation Congress recognized
in Section 202(a)(11)(C) lets investors choose the type of relationships they want to
establish with securities professionals, including the cost and contractual terms they
prefer. FPA and the amici seek to impose a one-size-fits-all regulation of different
relationships, together with attendant costs, when Congress determined otherwise. As
the Commission recognized, “broker-dealers often play roles substantially different
from investment advisers and in such roles they should not be held to standards to
which advisers are held.” JA11. And, notwithstanding FPA’s contrary position (Br.
59), part of what determines the nature of a broker-dealer’s role is its context.
Consistent with congressional intent, the IA/BD Rule attempts to ensure that when
broker-dealers render advice in connection with and reasonably related to brokerage
services, they will be subject to broker-dealer—and not adviser—regulation. When
they render advice of a different character or in a manner essentially independent of

21

Of course, as the Commission explained, in some instances, “such as when
broker-dealers assume positions of trust and confidence with their customers
similar to those of advisers,” broker-dealers are held to fiduciary standards
under other law. See JA11 & n.98.
45

other brokerage services (supra pp. 17-18 & n.6 and infra pp. 53-55, 57), they also will
be subject to the IAA.
II.

THE RULE REFLECTS THE COMMISSION’S REASONABLE CHOICES
ABOUT MATTERS ENTRUSTED TO ITS ASSESSMENT.
A.

The Commission’s Reasonable Determinations about
Benefits and Protections of the Rule Should Not Be
Disturbed.

Not only is the Rule within the Commission’s authority, it also reflects the
Commission’s reasonable assessment of the benefits of the fee-based brokerage
exception and its considered judgment about the content of a disclosure requirement
designed to inform investors about excepted accounts.
As a matter of policy, the Commission determined that the fee-based brokerage
provision could benefit investors by encouraging brokerage programs that enhance
investor choice and remove incentives for improper practices such as churning and
unsuitable recommendations. See supra p. 6. FPA and NASAA contest this assessment.
First, FPA disputes the Commission’s predictive judgment that the Rule will encourage
fee-based brokerage, claiming that any expansion of such programs “is an independent
event—fueled by brokers’ own desire to provide steady revenue sources.” Br. 21; id.
55-56. It is hardly unreasonable, however, to believe that the regulatory clarity supplied
by the Rule will facilitate these programs. See, e.g., JA103 (observing that “[m]any
broker-dealers . . . established these programs since 1999 when [the Commission]

46

issued [its] Proposing Release, which announced a staff no-action position relating to
such programs”).
Second, FPA and NASAA are mistaken when they claim that the Commission
concluded that fee-based brokerage “necessarily align[s] the interests” of broker-dealers
and their customers. FPA Br. 56; NASAA Br. 20-22. The Commission actually
concluded that, when compensation does not depend on the number of transactions,
certain incentives, e.g., to churn accounts, recommend unsuitable securities, or engage in
high-pressure sales tactics, are reduced. See JA35; see also JA42-43 (fee-based brokerage
“offer[s] at least a partial solution” to investor losses that “can be traced to individual
representatives responding to the need to generate commissions rather than service
customers”); JA3. That fee-based compensation may engender other sorts of conflicts
and induce other sorts of misconduct does not undermine that conclusion. Moreover,
as the Adopting Release notes (JA11 n.95), self-regulatory organizations have already
taken steps to address those instances in which firms inappropriately maintain feebased accounts for customers. E.g., NASD Notice to Members 03-68 (November
2003) (JA91-94) (requiring firms to establish procedures to determine whether feebased accounts are appropriate for customers and to provide periodic review to ensure
they remain appropriate); see also NYSE Rule 405A (same).
FPA also attacks the Commission’s cost-benefit analysis (e.g., Br. 23-24, 57-59).
First, it asserts (Br. 23; id. 58) that the Commission compared “apples” (the “overall

47

benefits” of excepting some broker-dealers from the IAA) to “oranges” (the
“incremental cost” of not excepting others). But it is FPA, not the Commission, that
compares “apples” to “oranges.” The Commission viewed as benefits of paragraph (a)
of the Rule—which includes the fee-based brokerage exception in paragraph (a)(1) and
the interpretation in paragraph (a)(2) of “special compensation” as not arising from twotiered pricing—the avoidance of IAA compliance costs, amelioration of certain
conflicts, and enhancement of investor choice. JA20-21. The Commission then
compared those benefits to like costs by addressing, e.g., commenters’ concerns about
possible costs in the form of investor confusion and differences in fiduciary duties, as
well as the “incremental costs” of the disclosure requirement of paragraph (a)(1).
JA21-23. The Commission did not, however, view as costs of paragraph (a) the
“incremental costs of not exempting others.” Br. 23. Rather, those costs, which FPA
describes as including “requiring broker-dealers to print brochures or not exempting
those who do financial plans” (Br. 23), are the costs associated with an entirely
different part of the Rule (paragraph(b)) that subjects broker-dealers, who, e.g., offer
financial plans, to the IAA. JA23-26.22
Nor, in considering costs, did the Commission “switch[] between assuming that
protections do or do not already exist” (Br. 23) or, stated another way, that brokers will

22

Contrary to amici’s argument (FD Br. 8-9), this same portion of the Adopting
Release (i.e., JA23-26) discusses “how brokers that provide non-incidental
advice” are affected by specific requirements of the IAA.
48

or will not be subject to the IAA (Br. 24, 58). Instead, the Commission reasonably
concluded that although changing forms of compensation unanticipated in 1940 might
now subject certain broker-dealers to the IAA absent the Rule, paragraph (a) of the
Rule “does not establish new opportunities for broker-dealers to compete with advisers
on the nature of their investment advice,” because neither the practice of broker-dealers
offering advice as part of a package of brokerage services nor the attendant costs of
broker-dealer regulation under the Exchange Act were materially changed by the Rule.
JA22 (emphasis added); see also JA26. This hardly equates to the Commission’s
assuming, in FPA’s words, that either there is “no harm because broker-dealers were
already covered” by the IAA or that there is “no harm because broker-dealers were not
covered before” by the IAA. Br. 24; see also Br. 58.
FPA also asserts (Br. 57) that paragraph (a) is unjustified, in terms of its benefits,
because many firms are dually registered. However, as even FPA seems to recognize,
this argument ignores the benefits achieved by relieving firms of the costs associated
with complying with the Act, with respect to those accounts for which it does not act
as an adviser, on an account-by-account basis. That FPA does not believe the exception
benefits investors or “honest advisers” (Br. 58) is simply another quarrel with
congressional judgment (see supra pp. 44-46).
Again inappropriately expanding the scope of the appeal (see n.7, supra), the amici
alone claim (see NASAA Br. 15, 22-24; PIABA Br. 3, 13) that the Rule harms investors

49

in yet another way—by exacerbating confusion—although how they believe it does so
is at best unclear. To the extent NASAA asserts (NASAA Br. 23) that confusion may
be engendered by “[a]llowing a broker-dealer to provide extensive advisory services,”
such confusion could be no worse after the Rule than before. By providing guidance
about advice that is “solely incidental to” brokerage, the Commission has, if anything,
more clearly circumscribed excepted advice. See infra pp. 52-58 and see supra pp. 10, 1718.
PIABA may believe confusion is engendered by permitting broker-dealers,
without complying with the IAA, to receive fixed or asset-based fees. Erroneously
terming these fees “management fees,” PIABA asserts (PIABA Br. 13) that they
“create[] the illusion of ongoing monitoring and protection”—something not all
broker-dealers (or, depending on contractual arrangements, even advisers) provide. To
the extent investor confusion could be exacerbated by the fee-based nature of an
excepted account, the Rule’s disclosure requirement is aimed at alleviating it.
Nothing in the record necessarily suggests, however, that investor confusion is a
function of the type of compensation an investor pays a financial services provider. See
JA2. Instead, confusion extends beyond fee-based accounts (id.) and may stem from a
variety of sources alluded to in the Adopting Release—lack of adequate investor
education (see, e.g., JA14), broker-dealer marketing of all types of accounts (including
commission-based) (JA2, 17 & n.163), and blurring of functions in general (see JA12).

50

It was not the purpose of this Rule to resolve all concerns about investor confusion.
See supra pp. 13-14 & n.5. Rather, the Commission reasonably focused on addressing
confusion that might attend the fee-based accounts excepted by the Rule.
Alternatively, perhaps the amici believe (see NASAA Br. 22-24; PIABA Br. 4-5,
10-14) that the absence of a marketing restraint in the Rule will exacerbate confusion
and limit the efficacy of the required disclosure.23 But questions about whether and
how to limit marketing are not susceptible to simplistic solutions. For example, the
Commission declined repeated calls to place limits on titles used by broker-dealer
representatives, such as “financial advisor” and “financial consultant,” because such
titles are descriptive of permissible services provided by excepted broker-dealers.
JA17. And, to the extent marketing is misleading or untruthful, investors are not left
without recourse—Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78j(b), and other
antifraud provisions can provide meaningful remedies. See, e.g., JA36 n.19 (citing In re
Haight & Co., Release No. 34-9082 (February 19, 1971)).
Nonetheless, the Commission noted its concerns about broker-dealer marketing
and investor confusion, including that such marketing might exacerbate confusion.
E.g., JA2. Given the nature of these concerns and the fact that they extend beyond the
programs addressed in the Rule, however, the Commission determined that they were

23

PIABA’s further argument that the disclosure “does not communicate”
(PIABA Br. 7-9 & n.12) is based in large part on speculation and criticisms of
disclosure that the Commission proposed but did not adopt.

better addressed under the Exchange Act and in the upcoming study. See supra pp. 1314 & n.5. An agency is not required to solve all problems at once, but may take a
measured, graduated approach toward administering its statutes. See National Mining
Ass’n v. Mine Safety & Health Admin., 116 F.3d 520, 549 (D.C. Cir. 1997); United States
Air Tour Ass’n v. FAA, 298 F.3d 997, 1010 (D.C. Cir. 2002). That is what the
Commission has done here.
B.

The Commission’s Determination about When Advice Is
“Solely Incidental to” Brokerage Is Entitled to Deference.

The Commission’s interpretation of the phrase “solely incidental to the conduct
of his business as a broker or dealer” is faithful to the language of Section 202(a)(11)(C)
and Congress’s intent. Therefore, notwithstanding amici’s challenge (FD Br. 13-17;
NASAA Br. 9-12), it should be upheld.24 As the phrase was understood in 1940 (see
JA52 & n.100, JA14 & n.134) and as it is understood today, it means “following as a
consequence of,” “attendant,” “concomitant,” and the like. See JA52 & n.100; see also
WordNet 2.0, 2003 Princeton University (defining “incidental to” as “following as a
consequence; ‘an excessive growth of bureaucracy, with related problems’; ‘snags
incidental to the changeover in management’ [syn: accompanying, attendant,

24

Unlike the amici, FPA does not challenge the Commission’s interpretation of
“solely incidental to.” Its handful of asides about the interpretation’s being
without limit (Br. 15-16, 25, 28, 59) do not raise an issue for this Court to
resolve (see supra p. 39). Accordingly, this Court should not consider the
amici’s challenge to this aspect of the Rule. Supra n.7.
52

concomitant, incidental . . . .]” (available at http://www.dictionary.com)). Accordingly,
the Commission properly concluded that the only limits on the importance, amount,
continuity, quality, or other characteristics of the advice excepted brokers can give are
that the advice be rendered “in connection with and reasonably related to the
brokerage services provided.” JA14-15 & n.135.
The amici maintain, however, that the Commission’s reading is unreasonable,
particularly its conclusion that even when advice is substantial, it can be “solely
incidental to” brokerage. E.g., NASAA Br. 9; FD Br. 15. Referring to “solely
incidental,” amici argue that the phrase limits excepted advice to that which is
“incidental” in the sense of being ‘‘minor,” ‘‘secondary,” ‘‘occurring merely by chance”
or execution-related. E.g., FD Br. 14; NASAA Br. 10, 12. As the Commission
explained (JA14-15 & nn.133-143), this construction is based on a misreading of both
the statutory language and historical context of the IAA.
The amici’s interpretation assumes erroneously that Section 202(a)(11)(C)
excepts ‘‘solely incidental” advisory services instead of advisory services that are ‘‘solely
incidental to” a broker-dealer’s business. “[I]ncidental to”—the relevant statutory
language—denotes a circumstance in which something occurs (here, the “performance
of [advisory] services”) that can be expected to arise in connection with an action (here,
the “conduct of . . . business as a broker or dealer”), whereas “incidental” denotes a
circumstance in which the occurrence is something that merely happens “by chance” or on

53

an “isolated,” “unpredictable” and/or “occasional” basis. See JA52 & n.100; JA14-15
& n.135; compare COMPACT OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY (2005)(available at
http://www.askoxford.com) (defining “incidental to” as “liable to happen as a
consequence of”) with id. (defining “incidental” as “occurring as a minor
accompaniment or by chance in connection with something else”). Unlike the amici,
the Commission properly interpreted the phrase “solely incidental to” in a way that
gives effect to all, not merely some, of its words. See Association of Bituminous Contractors
v. Andrus, 581 F.2d 853, 861-62 & n.22 (D.C. Cir. 1978).25
The narrow construction amici urge also is inconsistent with the meaning
indicated by the statutory context in which “solely incidental to” occurs. See City of
Roseville v. Norton, 348 F.3d 1020, 1027-28 (D.C. Cir. 2003). As the Commission
explained:
Following the broad description of the type of services rendered by
advisers in paragraph (11) (i.e., ‘‘advising others . . . as to the value of
securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling
securities’’), . . . subparagraph (C) excepts broker-dealers ‘‘whose
performance of such services is solely incidental to the conduct of [their
business as a broker or dealer] and for no special compensation.”
JA52 n.101 (emphasis in original). If Congress had meant to restrict the nature, quality,
or other substantive characteristics of the advice of excepted brokers as amici contend,

25

Amici are wrong when they claim (FD Br. 15) that the Commission’s
interpretation conflicts with Congress’s use of the term “solely.” See JA14
n.135 (discussing the meaning of “solely” in context).
54

it would not have used the words “performance of such services” to refer back to the
entire range of investment advice encompassed within the broad language of paragraph
(11). See id.
The view that only minor, accidental, or transaction-specific advice can be
excepted also is flawed because it ignores the IAA’s historical backdrop. See Yankton
Sioux Tribe, 522 U.S. at 343-44, 351-52; Penn Allegh Coal, 183 F.3d at 864. In 1940, the
advice broker-dealers gave as part of their traditional brokerage services often was
substantial in amount and importance to the customer. See JA52; JA6-7; JA15; CR5B5F, 3H (JA106, 111, 113, 114, 115-16, 95-96); HA3-5, 8-21. Then, as now, brokers did
not render advice only “by chance” or “without intention” or limit advice to situations
in which trades are effected. In addition, as stated, by 1940, broker-dealers were
already subject to regulation under the Exchange Act. It defies the historical evidence,
therefore, to believe, as amici do (FD Br. 15-16; NASAA Br. 12), that, in enacting
Section 202(a)(11), Congress would have sought to impose additional and largely
overlapping regulation on broker-dealers who render advice as part of a package of
brokerage services any time that advice is extensive and varied.
Finally, the amici erroneously contend that the Commission’s interpretation of
“solely incidental to” as meaning “in connection with and reasonably related to” is so
broad as to “write[] [the phrase] out of” the statute (FD Br. 16) or “render it
meaningless” (NASAA Br. 9). Indeed, NASAA argues that the Commission’s

55

interpretation of the phrase “makes brokerage services incidental to advisory services”
(NASAA Br. 10), and CFA and Fund Democracy claim that, under the Commission’s
interpretation, “advisory services may be the primary services, with brokerage services
being ‘solely incidental’ thereto” (FD Br. 14).26
In fact, the standard is neither unlimited nor unprecedented. It is the standard
Commission staff and state regulators traditionally have used to determine whether the
investment advice of lawyers and certain other professionals is “solely incidental to”
the performance of their professional functions. See JA51-52 n.98 (citing staff noaction letters); Md. Code Corps. & Ass’ns § 11-101(h)(2)(iii) (2001) (Maryland
Securities Act) (SA2-3) (services by a lawyer, certified public accountant, or other
professionals are not “solely incidental” unless, among other things, “[t]he investment
advisory services rendered are connected with and reasonably related to the other
professional services rendered”).

26

FPA similarly states (Br. 15-16) that the Commission “advised” in the
Adopting Release that broker-dealer advisory services are not “more than
‘solely incidental’ ” even if, in practice, “ ‘brokerage is incidental to the
advisory services.’ ” To the contrary, the Commission merely so summarized
the characterizations of brokerage advice included in comment letters
opposing the rule proposal. JA10. It is at best inappropriate to use the
background section, as FPA has in this and other instances, to mix fact and
argument in a way that makes it difficult, if not impossible, to separate the two.
See, e.g., Hayes v. Invesco, 907 F.2d 853, 854 n.3 (8th Cir. 1990) (citing Markowitz &
Co. v. Toledo Metro. Hous. Auth., 608 F.2d 699, 704 (6th Cir. 1979)).
56

The amici’s statements that all advice meets the Commission’s standard (e.g., FD
Br. 15; NASAA Br. 10) are further belied by the fact that both the Rule and the
Adopting Release give examples of advice that will not be considered to be performed
“solely incidental to” the conduct of brokerage business. See Rule 202(a)(11)-1(b);
JA16-19. As explained supra p. 18 & n.6, advice provided essentially independently of
other brokerage services,27 that does not otherwise follow as a consequence of
rendering brokerage services, or that cannot reasonably be understood to be part of the
traditional package of brokerage services does not meet the Commission’s standard.
For example (and contrary to FD Br. 16), discretionary management does not meet the
standard because it is not “reasonably related” to brokerage services. See supra id.
Although the interpretation depends on facts and circumstances (JA45 n.46), so
too do many legal standards. Such non-bright-line tests are common in the law. See,
e.g., City of Monroe Employees Retirement Sys. v. Bridgestone, 399 F.3d 651, 669 & n.18 (6th
Cir.) (recognizing that the standard for materiality in the securities laws is a “factintensive test”), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 423 (2005).
In sum, the Commission’s interpretation of “solely incidental to” as applied to
broker-dealers is consistent with the language of the IAA and is appropriately tailored
to the realities of the industry. By contrast, the amici’s reading of the phrase would

27

For example, under paragraph (b)(1) of the Rule, when a broker-dealer charges
a customer a separate fee or enters into a separate contract for advisory
services, it must treat the customer as an advisory client.
57

lead to illogical results, detailed in the Adopting Release, that neither Congress nor
even they could have intended. See JA15. The Commission’s interpretation is thus the
only reasonable interpretation before this Court. See FTC v. Ken Roberts Co., 276 F.3d
583, 590 (D.C. Cir. 2001). But even if any question of ambiguity remained, the
Commission’s reasonable interpretation is the one that must be chosen. See Chevron,
467 U.S. at 842-45.

The petition should be dismissed for lack of standing or, alternatively, the
Commission’s order should be affirmed.
