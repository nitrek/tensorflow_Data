March 10, 2015

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision revokes the registrations of the registered securities of Akesis
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Skye International, Inc., Stellar Resources, Ltd., and Thwapr, Inc.
(collectively, Respondents). The revocations are based on Respondents’ repeated failure to file
required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission).
I. BACKGROUND
The Commission initiated this proceeding on February 20, 2015, with an Order Instituting
Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange
Act). The OIP alleges that each Respondent is a corporation with a class of securities registered
with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and that each has repeatedly
failed to file with the Commission annual and quarterly reports in compliance with the Exchange
Act. Each was served with the OIP in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii) on February
24, 2015.1 To date, none has filed an Answer to the OIP, due ten days after service. See OIP at 3;
17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). Thus, Respondents have failed to answer or otherwise to defend the
proceeding within the meaning of 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a)(2). Accordingly, Respondents are in

Each Respondent was served with the OIP by USPS Express Mail delivery or attempted
delivery at “the most recent address shown on [its] most recent filing with the Commission.” 17
C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii).

default, and the undersigned finds that the allegations in the OIP are true as to them. See OIP at 3;
17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f). Official notice has been taken of the Commission’s public official
records concerning Respondents, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.323.

III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
By failing to file required annual and quarterly reports, Respondents violated Exchange
Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
IV. SANCTION
Revocation of the registrations of the registered securities of Respondents will serve the
public interest and the protection of investors, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act.
Revocation will help ensure that the corporate shell is not later put to an illicit use involving
publicly traded securities manipulated to the detriment of market participants. Further,
revocation accords with Commission sanction considerations set forth in Gateway International
Holdings, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31,
2006) (citing Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1139-40 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds,
450 U.S. 91 (1981)), and with the sanctions imposed in similar cases in which corporations
violated Exchange Act Section 13(a) by failing to file required annual and quarterly reports. See
Cobalis Corp., Exchange Act Release No. 64813, 2011 SEC LEXIS 2313 (July 6, 2011);
Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81 (Jan. 21,
2009); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197 (May 23,
2008); America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241
(Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1242 (June
6, 2007); Eagletech Commc’ns, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 54095, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1534
(July 5, 2006). Respondents’ violations were recurrent, egregious, and deprived the investing
public of current and accurate financial information on which to make informed decisions.
Failure to file periodic reports violates a crucial provision of the Exchange Act. The
purpose of the periodic reporting requirements is to publicly disclose current, accurate financial
information about an issuer so that investors may make informed decisions:
The reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is the primary
tool which Congress has fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent,
careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the sale of stock and securities.
Congress has extended the reporting requirements even to companies which are
“relatively unknown and insubstantial.”
SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977) (quoting legislative history);
accord e-Smart Techs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 50514, 2004 SEC LEXIS 2361, at *8-9
(Oct. 12, 2004). The Commission has warned that “many publicly traded companies that fail to
file on a timely basis are ‘shell companies’ and, as such, attractive vehicles for fraudulent stock
manipulation schemes.” e-Smart Techs., Inc., 2004 SEC LEXIS 2361, at *9 n.14.
