In the Matter of the Application of
Christopher A. Parris
For Review of Action Taken by

ORDER DENYING STAY
AND SCHEDULING
BRIEFS

FINRA

Christopher A. Parris (“Parris”) appeals from a FINRA order barring him from
association with any FINRA member for failing to comply with requests that he provide
documents pursuant to FINRA Rule 8210. Parris moves for a stay of that order pending his
appeal to the Commission. FINRA opposes his motion. Because Parris fails to show that a stay
is warranted under the applicable four-part standard, his motion is denied.
I.

Background

This matter arises out of FINRA’s investigation of First American Securities (“FAS”), a
FINRA member firm, and Parris, the 50% owner of its parent entity. FINRA states that it is
investigating FAS and Parris with respect to their involvement with two potentially fraudulent
private placements. FINRA Rule 8210(a)(1) authorizes FINRA “[f]or the purpose of an
investigation” or other authorized proceeding to “require a member, person associated with a
member, or any other person subject to FINRA’s jurisdiction to provide information orally, in
writing, or electronically” or to testify.
On September 15, 2015, FINRA requested that Parris provide 16 categories of documents
in connection with its investigation, including certain documents that FINRA requested from
Parris during on-the-record testimony provided on September 10 and 11, 2015. FINRA
reiterated its requests on September 23, 2015, and October 1, 2015.
On October 16, 2015, FINRA sent Parris a letter informing him he failed to respond
completely to its requests. The letter stated that Parris had failed to respond to 12 of the 16

2
requests. FINRA also stated that although he had provided some documents responsive to them,
it was unclear whether Parris had fully complied with two of the remaining four requests.1 The
letter informed Parris that unless he took corrective action by November 9, 2015 by complying
with FINRA’s requests, he would be suspended from associating with any FINRA member in
any capacity.2 The notice also stated that Parris could request a hearing in response to the letter,
or file a written request for termination of the suspension with the Executive Vice President of
FINRA’s Department of Enforcement on the ground of full compliance with FINRA’s requests.
Under the heading “Default,” the letter also informed Parris that if he failed to request
termination of the suspension within three months, i.e., by January 19, 2016, he would
automatically be barred from associating with any FINRA member in any capacity pursuant to
FINRA Rule 9552(h).3
On November 9, 2015, FINRA informed Parris that he had been suspended from
associating with any FINRA member in any capacity.4 FINRA reiterated that Parris could file a
written request for termination of the suspension on the ground of full compliance, and that, in
the absence of such a request, he would be barred on January 19, 2016. On January 6, 2016,
FINRA sent Parris a letter acknowledging that he had produced certain documents in response to
its requests, including on December 2, 2015 and December 11, 2015. But FINRA also identified
12 of its requests for which responsive documents had not been produced or for which the
document production was incomplete. Among other things, FINRA stated that, although Parris
had produced redacted copies of bank statements responsive to its Request No. 5, he was
required to produce unredacted copies of those documents to comply with the request. FINRA
also stated that, although Parris had declined to produce requested documents responsive to its
Request No. 15 on the ground that they related to transactions that “were not done through
[FAS], or anyone associated with” it, Parris was required to produce the requested documents
under FINRA rules because he was subject to FINRA’s jurisdiction.
On January 19, 2016, Parris sent FINRA a letter that specifically addressed the categories
of documents it believed he had not produced. Parris stated that he would produce certain
additional documents the same day. Among other things, he also maintained previously stated

FINRA did not raise any issues with respect to Parris’s response to the final two requests.

Under FINRA Rule 9552(a), if a “person associated with a member or person subject to
FINRA’s jurisdiction fails to provide any information, report, material, data, or testimony
requested . . . pursuant to . . . FINRA rules, . . . FINRA staff may provide written notice to such
. . . person specifying the nature of the failure and stating that the failure to take corrective action
within 21 days after service of the notice will result in suspension of . . . association of the person
with any member.”
3

See FINRA Rule 9552(h) (“A member or person who is suspended under this Rule and
fails to request termination of the suspension within three months of issuance of the original
notice of suspension will automatically be expelled or barred.”).
4

FINRA Rule 9552(d) provides that a suspension notice under Rule 9552(a) “shall become
effective 21 days after service of the notice, unless stayed by a request for a hearing pursuant to
Rule 9559.”

3
objections to FINRA’s Requests Nos. 5 and 15 and rejected FINRA’s “conclusion that he [wa]s
subject to Rule 8210 jurisdiction.” Also on January 19, 2016, Parris requested in a separate letter
to FINRA’s Executive Vice President, Department of Enforcement, that “the suspension
imposed upon him on November 9, 2015, be terminated on the grounds that he ha[d] fully
complied with FINRA’s 8210 requests.” Parris supported that request with a copy of his other
January 19, 2016 letter.
On January 21, 2016, the Executive Vice President in FINRA’s Department of
Enforcement informed Parris by letter that, as head of the FINRA department that had issued the
suspension notice to Parris, he had concluded that good cause did not exist to terminate Parris’s
suspension.5 The letter also stated that FINRA staff had determined that Parris had “not
responded to at least two request items,” i.e., Requests Nos. 5 and 15, and that staff was
“working to determine whether [Parris’s] last minute response dated January 19, 2016 [wa]s
sufficient to satisfy” the other requests. On the same day, the Regional Chief Counsel in the
FINRA office conducting the investigation of FAS and Parris sent Parris a separate letter
informing him that he had been barred pursuant to Rule 9552(h).6 That letter did not otherwise
explain the basis for the bar.
II.

Analysis

The Commission considers the following factors in determining whether to grant a stay
of FINRA action under Rule of Practice 4017: (i) whether there is a strong likelihood that the
moving party will succeed on the merits of its appeal; (ii) whether the moving party will suffer
irreparable harm without a stay; (iii) whether any person will suffer substantial harm as a result
of a stay; and (iv) whether a stay is likely to serve the public interest.8 The party seeking a stay
has the burden of establishing that relief is warranted.9 Because Parris has failed to satisfy this
burden, his motion is denied.
First, Parris has failed to show a strong likelihood of success on the merits. Parris argues
that he was not required to respond to FINRA’s Rule 8210 requests because he is not subject to
its jurisdiction. Parris relies on an affidavit generally denying involvement in the securities
5

See FINRA Rule 9552(f) (generally providing that a request for termination of a
suspension on the ground of full compliance must be “filed with the head of the FINRA
department or office that issued the notice” and that such person “may grant relief for good cause
shown”).

industry. In response, FINRA argues that Parris is a “person associated with a member” who
must comply with Rule 8210 because he is a “natural person engaged in the investment banking
or securities business who is directly or indirectly controlling” a FINRA member.10 FINRA
asserts that evidence that Parris was involved in FAS’s operations and hiring establishes that he
is engaged in the securities business, and that Parris’s 50% indirect ownership of FAS provides
him with control over it.11 Parris argues that the evidence will disprove FINRA’s assertions and
that certain of its statements are false.12 Although final resolution of Parris’s appeal must await
the Commission’s determination on the merits, there does not appear to be a strong likelihood
that he will succeed based on the briefs the parties have filed.
Second, Parris also has failed to demonstrate that he will suffer irreparable harm absent a
stay. To establish irreparable injury, Parris must do more than show he is subject to a bar
order.13 Rather, he must show an injury that is “both certain and great” and “actual and not
theoretical.”14 A stay “will not be granted [based on] something merely feared as liable to occur
at some indefinite time.”15 Parris argues that the bar will cause him irreparable harm because it
prevents him from pursuing employment in the securities industry and renders him statutorily
disqualified.16 Even assuming that loss of employment (or an employment opportunity)
constitutes irreparable injury, rather than monetary harm,17 the basis of Parris’s challenge to

Id., (h) (“A person who is the owner of 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock of
any corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other entity shall be presumed to
have control of such entity, in the absence of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to the
contrary.”).
12

Parris also disputes FINRA’s argument that Parris failed to exhaust his administrative
remedies before FINRA because he did not request a hearing to raise his objections to its
exercise of jurisdiction over him.
13

See, e.g., Dawson James Sec., 2015 WL 7074282, at *3 (finding that applicants failed to
establish irreparable injury where they moved to stay bar order); North Woodward Fin. Corp.,
Exchange Act Release No. 72828, 2014 WL 3937496, at *4 (Aug. 12, 2014) (same); The Dratel
Grp., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 72293, 2014 WL 2448896, at *5 (June 2, 2014) (same).

Section 3(a)(39)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 makes subject to “statutory
disqualification” any person who “has been and is . . . barred or suspended from being associated
with a member of, any self-regulatory organization.” 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(39)(A).
17

But see Dawson James Sec., 2015 WL 7074282, at *3 (“[T]he Commission and courts
have held, that ‘[m]ere injuries, however substantial, in terms of money, time, and energy
necessarily expended in the absence of a stay, are not enough’ to constitute irreparable harm.”
(quoting William Timpinaro, Exchange Act Release No. 29927, 1991 WL 288326, at *3 (Nov.
12, 1991)); see also Va. Petroleum Jobbers Ass’n v. FPC, 259 F.2d 921, 925 (D.C. Cir. 1958).

5
FINRA’s jurisdiction over him is that he is not associated with any FINRA member, and he does
not identify any employment opportunity that he has foregone because of the bar.18 Nor does
Parris point to any specific injury flowing from statutory disqualification.19 Although he has
been suspended since November 9, 2015, and barred since January 21, 2016, Parris has not
identified any irreparable injury he will suffer in the absence of a stay.20
Finally, Parris has failed to address the two remaining factors: whether any person will
suffer substantial harm as a result of a stay and whether a stay is likely to serve the public
interest. In the absence of any showing by Parris, these factors do not favor a stay in this case;
for example, failure to comply with a Rule 8210 information request “is a serious violation
because it subverts [FINRA’s] ability to execute its regulatory responsibilities.”21
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the motion by Christopher A. Parris to stay the effect
of FINRA’s decision is denied; and it is further
ORDERED that, pursuant to Rule 450(a) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice,22 that a
brief in support of the application for review shall be filed by April 29, 2016, a brief in
opposition shall be filed by May 30, 2016, and any reply brief shall be filed by June 13, 2016;23
and it is further

Cf. Dratel Grp., 2014 WL 2448896, at *5 (finding that applicant’s statement that he
would be “barred from a business he has been a part of for over thirty-seven years and [that is]
his only source of income,” without greater elucidation, did not establish irreparable injury).
19

See Koch, 2014 WL 2800778, at *2 (explaining that “speculation about possible
collateral proceedings does not satisfy the irreparable injury requirement”); cf. Dratel Grp., 2014
WL 2448896, at *5 (finding that applicant’s “vague reference” to his customers’ losing access to
his services did not demonstrate irreparable harm).
20

Parris also asserts that “FINRA’s summary declaration of jurisdiction and ejection of
[him] constitutes irreparable harm.” But this is merely another way of describing the action that
he challenges; it does not identify any irreparable harm associated with it.

17 C.F.R. § 201.450(a).

As provided by Rule 450(a), no briefs in addition to those specified in this schedule may
be filed without leave of the Commission. Attention is called to Rules of Practice 150-153, 17
C.F.R. § 201.150-153, with respect to form and service, and Rule of Practice 450(b) and (c), 17
C.F.R. § 201.450(b) and (c), with respect to content and length limitations. Requests for
extensions of time to file briefs will be disfavored. Pursuant to Rule of Practice 180(c), failure to
file a brief in support of the application may result in dismissal of this review proceeding. 17
C.F.R. § 201.180(c).

6
ORDERED that, in addition to any matters that the parties choose to raise in their briefs,
the parties shall address the following issues and explain the basis for their conclusions with
respect to them:
1. FINRA maintains that Parris was required to request a hearing to object to its
jurisdiction. Is this consistent with FINRA’s rules and the process requirements
of Exchange Act Section 15A(b)(8) and (h)(1), 15 U.S.C. § 78-o3(b)(8) and
(h)(1)?
2. Parris requested that FINRA terminate his suspension under Rule 9552(f), which
permits a person to “file a written request for termination of [a] suspension on the
ground of full compliance” with the relevant Rule 8210 requests. Did Parris
properly invoke this rule when he requested termination of his suspension on the
ground of full compliance while he continued to object to certain requests?
3. FINRA Rule 9552(h), entitled “Defaults,” provides that “[a] member or person
who is suspended under this Rule and fails to request termination of the
suspension within three months of issuance of the original notice of suspension
will automatically be expelled or barred.” Does this rule authorize FINRA to bar
an individual who timely requests termination of a suspension under Rule 9552(f)
if FINRA declines to grant that request?
4. FINRA’s Sanctions Guidelines,
https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/Sanctions_Guidelines.pdf, list several
considerations relevant to FINRA adjudicators’ determination of sanctions for a
failure to provide documents or testimony under Rule 8210. These considerations
include that “[w]here the individual provided a partial but incomplete response, a
bar is standard unless the person can demonstrate that the information provided
substantially complied with all aspects of the request.” Are the considerations
identified in the Sanctions Guidelines relevant where FINRA bars an individual
under the default procedure provided in Rule 9552(h)?
5. Parris argues that FINRA barred him without explaining the basis for its
determination that he was an associated person of FAS. Should the Commission
remand this case to FINRA to explain in the first instance its determination with
respect to Parris’s status as an associated person and/or explain in more detail its
reasons for imposing a bar on him?
For the Commission, by the Office of the General Counsel, pursuant to delegated
authority.
