In the Matter of
TIMBERVEST, LLC, JOEL BARTH
SHAPIRO, WALTER WILLIAM ANTHONY ORDER SCHEDULING BRIEFS
BODEN, III, DONALD DAVID ZELL, JR., and
GORDON JONES II

This matter is before the Commission on the limited remand order issued by the United
States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on June 24, 2016.1
On September 17, 2015, the Commission issued an opinion and order finding that
respondents2 defrauded BellSouth, one of their pension fund clients, by selling an asset owned by
BellSouth to another client at a below-market rate without disclosing respondents’ conflict of
interest in the transaction.3 The Commission determined that respondents were unjustly enriched
as a result of this conduct in that they inappropriately charged BellSouth a disposition fee of
$403,500 on the sale of the asset. The Commission ordered respondents to disgorge that fee as
well as $181,814.05 in prejudgment interest.
Respondents sought review in the D.C. Circuit. They filed a motion for leave to adduce
additional evidence that, in respondents’ view, calls for modification of the disgorgement order.
Respondents sought to adduce two items of additional evidence. The first item is a letter
authored by a lawyer at AT&T (BellSouth’s successor) stating that AT&T had reached a
settlement in a private action it had instituted against respondents. The letter stated, among other
things, that respondents agreed to pay AT&T an unspecified amount “in full and complete
satisfaction” of AT&T’s claims against respondents, “including any claims for any relief

including interest or losses relating to the $403,000 disposition fee.” The second item is a
declaration by one of the respondents stating that respondents have completed their obligations
under the settlement agreement and that AT&T has dismissed its lawsuit with prejudice.
On June 24, 2016, the D.C. Circuit remanded the record to the Commission “for the
limited purpose of allowing the Commission to consider the additional evidence identified by
[respondents] and determine its effect, if any, on the Commission’s disgorgement order.”
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Rule of Practice 450(a),4 that respondents
file a brief addressing this issue, not to exceed 4,000 words, by July 15, 2016; that the Division
of Enforcement file a response, not to exceed 4,000 words, by July 25, 2016; and that
respondents may file a reply brief, not to exceed 2,000 words, by August 1, 2016.
Any evidentiary materials relied upon shall be attached to the briefs.5 The briefs shall be
limited to the “effect, if any, on the Commission’s disgorgement order” of the additional
evidence identified by respondents. The parties are encouraged to address the precedent
regarding the evidentiary showing required to support an offset against or reduction of
disgorgement.6
No briefs in addition to those specified in this order may be filed without leave of the
Commission. All briefs must be served by e-mail and/or facsimile, as well as by mail.
For the Commission, by the Office of General Counsel, pursuant to delegated authority.

SEC v. Solow, 554 F. Supp. 2d 1356, 1364 (S.D. Fla. 2008), aff’d, 308 F. App’x 364 (11th Cir.
2009); Ralph Calabro, Exchange Act Release No. 75076, 2015 WL 3439152, at *44 & nn. 226227 (May 29, 2015); Montford & Co., Advisers Act Release No. 3829, 2014 WL 1744130, at
*23 & nn. 201-202 (May 2, 2014); David Henry Disraeli, Advisers Act Release No. 2686, 2007
WL 4481515, at *17 & n.106 (Dec. 21, 2007). Relevant considerations may include the basis of
AT&T’s lawsuit against respondents, the extent to which the settlement amount is attributable to
the misconduct underlying the Commission’s disgorgement order, and whether respondents
themselves paid the settlement amount.
