ORDER FOLLOWING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE AND GRANTING
PROTECTIVE ORDER

A telephonic prehearing conference was held today, attended by counsel for the Division of
Enforcement and Respondent Joseph P. Doxey. During the prehearing conference, with the parties’
agreement, and for good cause shown, I modified the prehearing schedule as follows:
November 4, 2016:

Parties exchange and file their witness lists.

November 10, 2016: Parties file their exhibit lists1 and exchange, but not file, pre-marked
exhibits.
November 18, 2016: Parties file motions in limine and objections to proposed exhibits.
November 29, 2016: Final telephonic prehearing conference held at 11:00 a.m. Eastern.
December 5, 2016:

Hearing commences at a venue to be determined, near West Palm
Beach, Florida. The hearing will conclude by December 8, 2016.

The previous scheduling order is otherwise not affected. See Joseph P. Doxey, Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3863, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1825 (ALJ May 23, 2016).
A portion of today’s prehearing conference was held under seal, after I determined that the
harm resulting from disclosure of the information discussed outweighed the benefits. See 17 C.F.R.
201.322(b). The unredacted version of the prehearing conference transcript may be disclosed only
to the parties to this proceeding, legal counsel, and any trial teams, including experts and
contractors, the undersigned, the Commission, and its employees, staff, and agents.
SO ORDERED.
