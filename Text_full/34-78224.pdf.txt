PAYMENT OF FEES AND
EXPENSES

On June 6, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) issued an
Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of
the Securities Act of 1933, Section 15(b)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections
203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a
Cease-and-Desist Order against Oppenheimerfunds, Inc. (“OFI”) and Oppenheimerfunds
Distributor, Inc. (collectively, “Respondents”) (the “Order”).1 As set forth in the Order, prior to
and during the height of the 2008 financial crisis, Respondents made misrepresentations regarding
two fixed income mutual funds managed by OFI: Oppenheimer Champion Income Fund and
Oppenheimer Core Bond Fund. The Order required OFI to pay disgorgement of $9,879,706,
prejudgment interest of $1,487,190, and a civil money penalty of $24 million, for a total of
approximately $35.4 million. The Order also created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of

On March 14, 2013, the Commission issued an order appointing Epiq Class Actions &
Claims Solutions, Inc. (“Epiq”) as the Fund Administrator and approving the Fund Administrator
bond in the amount of $35,500,000. 2 On December 18, 2013, the Commission issued a Notice of
Proposed Plan of Distribution and Opportunity for Comment. 3 No comments were received, and
subsequently, the Plan of Distribution (“Plan”) was approved on February 5, 2014.4 The Plan
provides for the payment of the Fund Administrator for administering the Plan. The Plan states
that all payments to the Fund Administrator will be paid from the Fair Fund after review by
Commission staff and approval by the Commission.
On January 6, 2015, the Commission issued an order directing the Office of Financial
Management to pay the outstanding Fund Administrator fees and expenses incurred from March 14, 2013
to September 30, 2014, and authorized the Assistant Director of the Office of Distributions to approve
and direct payment of the Fund Administrator’s future fees and expenses up to, but not to exceed,
$35,000 per monthly invoice, so long as the total amount paid to the Fund Administrator does not exceed
the total amount of the cost proposal submitted by the Fund Administrator by more than $5,000.5
The Fund Administrator has submitted two invoices totaling $291,041.98 to Commission
staff for the months of August 2015 and September 2015. The Commission staff has reviewed
the Fund Administrator’s invoices, confirms that the services have been provided, and finds the
fees and expenses of $291,041.98 to be reasonable and in accordance with the Plan. The
Commission staff has requested that the Commission authorize the payment of the Fund
