On December 18, 2013, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s (“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17
C.F.R. § 201.1103, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Plan of Distribution
and Opportunity for Comment (Exchange Act Rel. No. 71119 (December 18, 2013))
(“Notice”). The Notice advised interested parties that they could obtain a copy of the
Proposed Plan of Distribution (“Proposed Plan”) from the Commission’s public
website or by submitting a written request to Nancy Chase Burton, Esq., United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-5631.
All persons who desired to comment on the Proposed Plan could submit their
comments, in writing, no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the Notice. No
comments were received, and subsequently, on February 5, 2014, the Commission
issued an Order Approving Plan of Distribution (Exchange Act Rel. No. 71493
(February 5, 2014)).

The Plan of Distribution (“Distribution Plan”) provides for the distribution of
$35,366,896.00 paid by OppenheimerFunds, Inc., plus interest, less any amounts
expended or to be expended for administering the Oppenheimer Fair Fund, to investors
according to the methodology set forth in the Distribution Plan. Pursuant to the
Distribution Plan, the Fund Administrator has submitted a payment file to the
Commission staff with a reasonable assurance letter as to the completeness and
accuracy of the information contained therein. The staff has reviewed this material.
Pursuant to Rule 1101(b)(6) of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1101(b)(6), the Commission staff requests that
the Commission authorize the disbursement of $34,427,424.90 to Huntington Bank to
be distributed to investors in accordance with the Distribution Plan.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, that Commission staff shall disburse
$34,427,424.90 of the Fair Fund to Huntington National Bank, and that the Fund
Administrator shall distribute such monies to investors as provided for in the
Distribution Plan.
By the Commission.
