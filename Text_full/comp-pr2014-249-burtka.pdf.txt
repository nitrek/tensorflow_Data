SOUTHERN DIVISION

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION,
Plaintiff,

CIVIL ACTION No.

v.

HON.

GARY J. BURTKA,
Defendant.
___________________________________/
COMPLAINT
Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), alleges and states as
follows:
SUMMARY
1.

The Securities and Exchange Commission brings this civil action in connection

with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by the City of Allen
Park, Michigan (“the City” or “Allen Park”) and the Allen Park City Administrator from
approximately 2008 through at least May 2011.
2.

During that period Defendant Gary J. Burtka (“Burtka”) was the Mayor of Allen

Park and a member of the Allen Park City Council, which governed the City. Defendant also
appointed the City Administrator, who oversaw the daily operations of the City. The City
Administrator reported on a daily basis to Defendant.

1

2:14-cv-14278-AC-DRG Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 2 of 15

3.

Pg ID 2

Defendant accordingly participated in the operations of, and possessed the

practical ability to direct the actions of, both the City and the City Administrator while he was
the Mayor of Allen Park. He therefore was a “control person” within the meaning of Section
20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78t(a)].
4.

Because Defendant Burtka controlled the City and the City Administrator during

the period that each one violated the federal securities laws, he is liable for their violations to the
same extent each one of them is liable.
5.

In 2008 the City began planning an economic development project in the form of

a $146 million movie studio (“Studio Project”) with eight sound stages, led by a Hollywood
executive director.
6.

Defendant championed the Studio Project idea and made numerous public

pronouncements promoting it. Defendant advocated for the Studio Project and reported that it
was proceeding well in numerous meetings with other municipal officials and City residents. He
did not inform residents and other City Council members about difficulties the Studio Project
was encountering. Many public statements Defendant Burtka made about the status of the
Studio Project were not accurate.
7.

During the period that Defendant was making these public statements regarding

the Studio Project, the City voted to issue municipal bonds to ensure that the Studio Project took
place. In November 2009 the City issued a total of $28.275 million in municipal general
obligation limited tax bonds (“2009 Bonds”). It issued another $2.725 million of such bonds in
June 2010 (“2010 Bonds”) (collectively “Bonds”).

2

2:14-cv-14278-AC-DRG Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 3 of 15

8.

Pg ID 3

The offering documents for the Bonds stated that the Bonds were to be repaid, at

least initially, from revenues the City expected to generate from leasing space to numerous
media-related entities. The offering documents also described the Studio Project as a $146
million facility consisting of 750,000 square feet of space including eight sound stages, which
would employ thousands of union and skilled workers, and be led by an experienced Hollywood
production executive.
9.

By the time the City issued the Bonds, however, the plans to implement and pay

for the Studio Project had deteriorated significantly. None of these changes, however, were
reflected in the Bond offering documents nor in any of the City’s other public statements.
10.

The Bond offering documents also included outdated City budget information

which did not disclose that the City faced a budget deficit for Fiscal 2010 of at least $2 million,
or over 8.4% of its total general revenue fund.
11.

At the time the City offered and sold the Bonds, Defendant and other City

officials knew of the deterioration in the scope and viability of the Studio Project.
12.

Through the activities alleged in this Complaint, as a control person of the City

and the City Administrator, Defendant Burtka is liable for violations by the City and the City
Administrator of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15
U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5(b) [17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5] promulgated thereunder.
DEFENDANT
13.

Defendant Gary J. Burtka, age 65, resides in the City of Allen Park, Michigan.

He was a member of the City Council from 1995 to November 2007, when he was elected to be

the Mayor of Allen Park. Defendant was the Mayor of Allen Park from November 2007 until he
resigned in May 2011.

FACTS
Background
17.

The City of Allen Park is located 13 miles from the City of Detroit, Michigan. It

previously has been governed by a City Council consisting of six elected members and the
Mayor. The City is currently in receivership and governed by an Emergency Manager whose
appointment expired at the end of September 2014. After the Emergency Manager departed, a
Receivership Transition Advisory Board (RTAB) consisting of members appointed via a final
Order of the Emergency Manager was installed to oversee the transition of the City to home rule.

4

2:14-cv-14278-AC-DRG Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 5 of 15

Pg ID 5

The City ultimately will return to being governed by a seven-member City Council consisting of
the Mayor and six elected members.
18.

Allen Park operates pursuant to a City Charter which sets out the responsibilities

of various City officials. According to the City Charter, the Mayor appoints a City
Administrator, subject to the approval of the City Council. The City Administrator is responsible
for running the City’s daily operations. When Defendant was elected as the City’s Mayor, he
immediately appointed a City Administrator.
19.

The City Administrator’s responsibilities included preparing and submitting an

annual budget to the City Council, and carrying out the directives of the City Council. The City
Administrator also was required to report to the City Council on “any and all matters” that “may
require the Council’s attention and action” and to perform “such other duties as may be
prescribed…by ordinance or by direction of the Council.”
20.

In April 2008 the State of Michigan enacted legislation that provided significant

tax credits to film studios conducting business in Michigan. In August 2008 the City was
approached by an owner and operator of a California film and post-production sound studio
(“Producer”) who inquired about building the Studio Project in the City.
21.

The City Council believed that the Studio Project would bring much-needed

economic development to the City. To support the Project, the City Council therefore agreed to
offer what ultimately became a total of $28.275 million of general obligation limited tax bonds
issued on November 12, 2009 (“2009 Bonds”) and another $2.725 million of general obligation
limited tax bonds issued on June 16, 2010 (“2010 Bonds”).

Movie Studio Project
23.

The City and the Producer planned that the Studio Project would be financed and

built through a Public Private Partnership (“PPP”), consisting of a limited liability corporation
with the City, the Producer and a private developer (“Developer”) as members. The City would
use the municipal bond proceeds to buy land which it then would donate to the PPP to use for the
Studio Project. The Developer would finance and build necessary structures on the land while
the Producer would manage the Project and find investors to fund the film production.
24.

In April 2009, the City issued a press release about the Studio Project. The

release quoted Defendant Burtka as saying the Studio Project amounted to an “economic
development blockbuster” representing “job opportunities for thousands . . . who have lost their
jobs” and that the City “did not need to raise taxes a penny to win this project . . . .”
25.

Defendant Burtka also participated in drafting other documents that were publicly

distributed with the April 2009 press release and maintained on the City’s website through at
least June 2010. Those documents described the Studio Project as a full-service film and media
production facility that would employ thousands of unionized, skilled workers, be located on 104
acres, consist of 750,000 square feet of facilities including eight sound stages, and be led by a
Hollywood production executive, at a cost of $146 million.
26.

In May 2009, as the City Administrator was preparing the City’s Fiscal 2010

budget, the City faced a deficit of approximately $2 million. The Producer offered to provide up
to $2 million to remove the deficit. Although the City Administrator originally understood the
$2 million would be a “financial gift,” the Producer sent the City Administrator a letter on May

6

2:14-cv-14278-AC-DRG Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 7 of 15

Pg ID 7

14, 2009, stating that the $2 million was a “capital repayment” contingent on the City’s
contribution of land to the PPP.
27.

In early June 2009, the Producer, the City, and a Developer signed an agreement

for the PPP, pursuant to which the Developer committed $20 million for the Project’s first phase.
Defendant Burtka signed the contract on behalf of the City.
The Collapse of the PPP and the City’s $2 Million Budget Shortfall
27.

In July 2009 the City’s bond counsel advised the City that bond proceeds could

not be used to purchase land that then would be donated to the PPP.
28.

Because the City could not donate assets purchased with bond proceeds, it could

not meet the contribution requirements necessary for membership in the PPP. As a result, the
plans for the PPP collapsed. The collapse of the PPP meant that the Developer, who had pledged
to contribute $20 million, no longer had any obligations to the Studio Project.
29.

The collapse of the PPP also meant that the City had a projected deficit for Fiscal

2010 of $2 million, because the Producer no longer was obligated to pay the City $2 million.
The City Administrator knew this but took steps to create the false impression that the City
would still receive the $2 million. The $2 million purported “donation” represented 8.4% of the
City’s budgeted $22 million in Fiscal 2010 revenue and was instrumental in creating the false
appearance that the City’s budget for Fiscal 2010 had no deficit.
30.

In addition, the Producer’s proposal to attract investors, media producers and

tenants for the Studio Project had been based on the assumption that he would manage and
control the entire Project. When the PPP collapsed, however, the City decided to own and
manage the property itself. By August 2009, the plan was that the Producer was only going to

7

2:14-cv-14278-AC-DRG Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 8 of 15

Pg ID 8

lease 100,000 square feet and to operate a vocational school to train potential workers in the
movie production business.
Wayne County and the City’s Public Statements
32.

Wayne County originally planned to support the Studio Project by issuing up to

$12 million of municipal bonds and granting favorable tax status to the Studio Property. The
County, however, raised numerous concerns about the viability of the Project from the start,
expressing these concerns in writing and meetings with both Defendant Burtka and the City
Administrator.
33.

By August 2009, the County informed the City that it would not grant favorable

tax status to the property.
34.

The City nevertheless issued a press release on August 14, 2009 in which

Defendant Burtka announced that ground breaking for construction was beginning at the Studio
Project. The press release also announced that all details of the Studio Project, including
financing, were complete and that the “all-encompassing film, TV and media production facility
will open in October.” None of these statements was true.
35.

In late September 2009, the County further advised the City that it would not

issue the $12 million municipal bonds without additional information. The City Administrator
advised Defendant Burtka that without the County’s municipal bonds, the City could incur up to
$4 million of additional interest. On October 6, 2009, the County confirmed that it would not
provide any municipal bond financing for the Studio Project.
36.

In response to concerns raised by a resident during an October 13, 2009 public

City Council meeting, Defendant Burtka stated falsely that the Producer’s company would move

8

2:14-cv-14278-AC-DRG Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 9 of 15

Pg ID 9

in shortly “creating four stages, four movie stages” and serve as an anchor for an entertainment
district. Throughout the October 13, 2009 public meeting, neither Defendant Burtka nor the City
Administrator discussed any of the negative developments that were impairing the Studio
Project, including the fact that there were no prospects for building sound stages.
The 2009 Bonds Did Not Disclose Material Negative Information
37.

The City Administrator was the primary source of information used in drafting the

offering documents for the 2009 Bonds. He also received drafts of the offering documents,
provided comments that were incorporated into the final versions, and certified on behalf of the
City that, to its best knowledge and belief, the document was “true and correct” and did not
“contain, nor omit, any material facts or info which would make the statements contained herein
misleading.”
38.

The City, however, did not disclose any of the adverse developments in the

offering documents for the 2009 Bonds. Similarly, the offering documents had no disclosure or
discussions regarding any potential risks.
39.

In fact, the offering documents contained a number of material misstatements.

First, the offering documents repeated substantially all of the information about the Studio
Project that had been contained in the City’s initial April 2009 press release announcing the
Project, even though the plans for the Studio Project had deteriorated significantly after April
2009.
40.

In addition, the offering documents stated that the City intended initially to repay

the Bonds by leasing facilities at the Studio Project and using the lease revenues towards
payment of the Bonds. This representation was highly relevant to the City’s ability to service its

9

2:14-cv-14278-AC-DRG Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 10 of 15

Pg ID 10

debt since the expected annual debt service otherwise would have constituted approximately
10% of the City’s budget. The offering documents also stated that the City had existing leases
“under contract” totaling $1.6 million for 48% of the available space and that additional lease
arrangements, representing 27% of the available space, were currently in negotiation.
41.

By the time the 2009 Bonds were issued, however, the projected $1.6 million of

annual lease revenue included at least $300,000 from the Producer, which the City’s
Administrator knew to be uncertain. The City Administrator also was aware that there were no
existing negotiations regarding 27% of available space.
42.

Finally, the City attached its projected Fiscal Year 2010 budget as an appendix to

both its 2009 and its 2010 offering documents. The budget, which reflected the City’s
expectation that it would have a general fund surplus at the end of Fiscal Year 2010, appeared to
be balanced because it was based on the assumption that the Producer would donate $2 million to
the City. The City Administrator, however, knew that the Producer no longer intended to pay $2
million to the City. The budget attached to the 2009 offering documents thus was materially
misleading. The City really faced a projected $2 million deficit for Fiscal 2010.
The Bonds were rated “A” and Issued in November 2009
43.

Standard & Poor (“S&P”) reviewed information provided by the City and others

in order to rate the City’s 2009 Bonds. The City Administrator did not inform S&P that the
Producer no longer intended to pay $2 million to the City and thus misled S&P regarding the
actual condition of the City’s Fiscal Year 2010 budget.
44.

S&P assigned the City’s 2009 Bonds an “A” rating, based on its

misunderstanding that the City’s FY 2010 budget was balance. S&P’s write-up noted, however,

10

2:14-cv-14278-AC-DRG Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 11 of 15

Pg ID 11

that the FY 2010 budget was balanced only because of the $2 million donation, and it pointed out
that the City would have to address this structural imbalance.
45.

The “A” rating by S&P was material to investors who purchased the 2009 Bonds.

Additional Adverse Developments Occurred Before the City Issued its June 2010 Bonds
46.

After the 2009 Bonds were issued, the City retained a company to manage the

Studio Project site. On February 12, 2010, the management company advised that the City
would experience a significant decrease in net cash flow at the site at least for the first three
years, rather than the increase from lease revenues it had expected. This was due to hiring agents
to solicit prospective tenants, management companies, providing rent forgiveness and building
out properties.
47.

On May 6, 2010 the City served the Producer with an eviction notice. The City

and the Producer then negotiated an amended lease for only one-half the amount of space at onehalf the rent, with rent payments postponed until August 2010. Defendant Burtka signed the
amended lease on behalf of the City.
48.

Despite these additional significant negative developments affecting the Studio

Project, the City issued the 2010 Bonds on June 16, 2010. Although two weeks before the 2010
Bonds were issued, the City Council had adopted a budget for Fiscal Year 2011 which
acknowledged the $2 million budget shortfall, the offering documents for the 2010 Bonds again
incorporated the City’s Fiscal 2010 budget figures which omitted the $2 million shortfall.
49.

The 2010 Bond offering documents misleadingly continued to list tenants at the

Studio Property with purported “total leases under contract represent[ing] approximately $1.6

11

2:14-cv-14278-AC-DRG Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 12 of 15

Pg ID 12

million of annual revenue.” The 2010 Bond offering documents stated that the total annual debt
service was $2.6 million, an increase from the $2.2 million stated in the 2009 Bonds.
50.

Finally, notwithstanding that the Producer by this time had reduced his presence

at the Studio Project by half, the offering documents falsely continued describing the Studio
Project as a “$146 million, full-service movie, television and new media production studio” that
would include 750,000 square feet, eight sound stages, employ thousands of unionized skilled
workers and be managed by the Producer.
51.

The City Administrator again was the primary source of information for the 2010

Bond offering documents. He also reviewed and approved them and certified, on behalf of the
City, that, to the City’s best knowledge and belief, the document was “true and correct” and did
not “contain, nor omit, any material facts or info which would make the statements contained
herein misleading.”
52.

On September 29, 2010 the Producer advised the City that he was terminating his

lease at the Studio Property. He vacated the site on October 4, 2010. The City Administrator
resigned on February 27, 2011 and Defendant Burtka resigned on May 24, 2011.
The Effect of the Studio Project Collapse on the City
53.

The collapse of the Studio Project had a significant impact on the City’s financial

condition. The City filed a notice on the Electronic Municipal Market Access system
(“EMMA”) on December 29, 2010 that it was not filing an annual report for fiscal year 2010.
54.

On March 8, 2011 S&P downgraded the City’s unlimited tax bonds to BB+ and

its limited tax GO bonds to BB+.

12

2:14-cv-14278-AC-DRG Doc # 1 Filed 11/06/14 Pg 13 of 15

55.

Pg ID 13

The City did not file any continuing disclosure until January 4, 2012, at which

time it announced it had received a “going concern” opinion from its auditors. On June 21, 2012
the Michigan State Treasurer began a Preliminary Review of the City, pursuant to State law, and
issued a Final Report on August 8, 2012 recommending the appointment of an Emergency
Manager. The Studio Project was listed as a primary factor in the City’s deteriorating economic
condition. An Emergency Manager was appointed in October 2012.
56.

The City’s most recent annual audit report, dated December 16, 2013, for Fiscal

2013, again includes a “going concern” opinion because of the City’s general fund deficit of
$694,185 and its Studio Project fund deficit of $10,370,611.
