pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
II.
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or
denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject
matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that 1 :
1.
Dragon Bright (CIK No. 1516810) is a Cayman Islands corporation
located in Hong Kong. At all times relevant to this proceeding, the securities of Dragon
Bright have been registered under Exchange Act Section 12(g). As of May 9, 2016, the
company’s stock (symbol “DGBMF”) was quoted on OTC Link (previously, “Pink
Sheets”) operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. (“OTC Link”), had two market makers,
and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
2.
Dragon Bright has failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and
Rule 13a-1 thereunder because it has not filed any periodic reports with the Commission
since the period ended December 31, 2012.

IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it necessary and appropriate for the
protection of investors to impose the sanction specified in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
Pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j), registration of each class of Respondent’s
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 be, and hereby is, revoked.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary

binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
