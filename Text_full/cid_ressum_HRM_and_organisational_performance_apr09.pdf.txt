Human resource policies, accounting and organisational performance

1. Project overview
This project examined the relationship between human
resource management (HRM), management accounting
and organisational performance in six case study
companies (two in Canada, two in Japan and two in the
UK) and in 100 telephone interviews (40 in Japan, 30 in
Canada and 30 in the UK).
The companies studied in this project made great
efforts to link specific HR policies with organisational
performance. In all six cases, HR managers and
management accountants were working closely together
to develop strategic plans and annual budgets. In four
of the cases, they also developed performance related
bonus schemes in close collaboration and were involved
in frequent communication on decision making.

6. There is a link between training and an organisation’s 	
	 performance.
7. Benchmarking is a useful technique for exploring the 	
	 relationship between HR policies and an
	 organisation’s 	performance.
8. Specific HR policies can be linked to an organisation’s 	
	 performance.
9. Statements could be made in an organisation’s 		
	 published report about the impact of HR policies on 	
	 an organisation’s performance.

Through interviews with executives in each of the six
cases, the researchers found five areas of HR policy
that were cited as having an impact on organisational
performance, namely:
1. recruitment
2. training
3. job for life
4. teamwork
5. organisational culture.
Whilst the link between HR policies and organisational
performance was not always easy to establish, in the
six cases the most common method of attempting
to make links between HR policies and organisational
performance was the use of employee surveys combined
with benchmarking over a number of years.
This project did find support, amongst at least 50%
of the telephone interviewees, for the following nine
findings that emerged from the six cases:
1. A mix of financial and non-financial measures leads 	
	 to improved organisational performance.
2. The role of employees is critical in achieving an 		
	 organisation’s targeted performance.
3. Teamwork has a major impact on an organisation’s 	
	 performance.
4. Organisational culture (with regards to employees) 	
	 has a major impact on an organisation’s performance.
5. When employees are viewed as assets rather 		
	 than simply costs, there is a positive impact on an 		
	 organisation’s performance.

2. Objectives

3. Findings

The purpose of the project was to build on the results
of a previous project funded by CIMA on management
accounting and strategic human resource management
(Innes, Kouhy and Vedd, 2001) by:

3.1 Performance measures used

•
	
	
	
	
•
	
	
•

•
	

Case A – achievement of budget, growth, market share 	
and sales per employee.

•
	
	
	

Case B – cash flow, customer satisfaction, economic 	
value added (EVA - a registered trade mark of Stern, 	
Stewart and Co.), morale, social contribution and 		
sustainable growth.

•
	

Case C – customer satisfaction, economic value added, 	
productivity, quadruple bottom line, quality and safety.

•
	

Case D – delivery, environment, productivity, return on 	
net assets and safety.

•
	

Case E – cash flow, customer satisfaction, delivery, 		
quality and sales.

•
	

Case F – customer service, profitability, safety and 		
total shareholder return.

Extending the research into the relationship between 	
different HR policies and organisational performance 	
and, in particular, how management accountants 		
help to establish links between HR policies and 		
organisational performance.
Extending the research into Japanese companies 		
to give a different perspective and another point of 	
comparison.
Testing the case study results in a telephone survey.

The research was carried out on the basis of six case
studies and 100 telephone interviews (40 in Japan, 30 in
Canada and 30 in the UK). The six case studies covered
building materials, consumer products, electronics,
software development, timber products and a utility
company. Details of the six cases are given in Table 1 in the
appendix. Each case study concentrated on three general
areas:
1. Performance measures
2. Links between HR managers and management 		
	 accountants
3. Links between HR policies and organisational 		
	 performance.
The telephone interviews were used to test key findings
identified by the project team during their research of the
six cases.

All six cases used a mix of financial and non-financial
performance measures including the following:

3.2 Links between HR managers and management
accountants
In all six cases, HR managers and management
accountants co-operated very closely on the strategic
plans and the annual budget (such as number of
employees, the mix of skills and the budgeted salaries).
There were also regular meetings to discuss comparisons
of actual results against budgeted results.
In four cases (A, B, C and F), HR managers and
management accountants worked closely together on a
performance related bonus scheme. The management
accountants discussed the financial and non-financial
performance measures with HR managers before the
proposed bonus scheme was finalised and later interpreted
the actual results from the bonus scheme. However, the
most frequent communication between managers and
management accountants was about decision making.

3.3 HR policies and organisational performance
The HR policies mentioned by the interviewees as affecting organisational performance in at least three of the six
case studies included:
1. 	
2. 	
3. 	
4. 	
5. 	

Recruitment
Training
Job for life
Teamwork
Organisational culture (with regard to employees).

Recruitment
It was commonly thought among the interviewees that
recruitment decisions were critical for their organisation’s
future performance, in order to hire the necessary
quality and mix of employees. In all six case studies
the employees were regarded as ‘assets’ who created
additional value rather than ‘costs’ that the organisation
had to recover. In the short-term, viewing employees
as assets led to increased expenditure on training and
other costs. The interviewees, however, said that viewing
employees as assets had a positive impact on their
organisation’s long-term performance.

Training
In all six cases the interviewees emphatically endorsed
the positive effect that training had on organisational
performance, albeit that this effect came with a time lag.
In Japanese Case B, interviewees expressed their belief
that training had increased the knowledge and skills of
employees leading to increased customer satisfaction that
in turn led to improved performance. In Canadian Case
C, existing employees were trained to develop new skills
(including leadership and soft skills) so that employees
could become multi-skilled.
The company linked training to organisational
performance by compiling a list of required skills for the
future and monitored such skills emerging from its training
programme. They also required all employees to write
a report both 30 days and 90 days after their training
programme, to analyse how well that specific training
met the employee’s own personal development training
contract that was linked to the performance of that
particular individual.
In Japanese Case A, several interviewees considered that
its improving financial performance was directly linked
to the investments the company had made in training
a few years ago. To evaluate the effect of training on
organisational performance, the company conducted
a number of surveys with employees. By comparing
the results of these surveys over a number of years, the
company was attempting to link the effects of specific HR

policies (such as training) with its performance, taking into
account any time lag.

Job for life
The two Japanese companies had a job for life policy,
although this policy had come under increased pressure
from international competition and other factors. One
British company (the utility) had a similar job for life
policy. Employees did leave voluntarily, but the average
length of service was 15 years. When jobs disappeared (for
example, after restructuring), employees were not made
redundant but went into a resource centre where other
parts of the business would look first when job vacancies
arose. Employees were paid in this resource centre
(sometimes for several months) and were also offered
further training or retraining (to develop the skills required
by this utility). In the monthly performance report for top
management there was a section on the employees in this
resource centre and job vacancies available.
The interviewees in the two Japanese cases and the British
utility considered that their job for life policy encouraged
employees to take a long term view on decision making.
It also increased employee motivation and organisational
loyalty, and had a positive effect on organisational longterm performance, although the policy involved additional
short-term costs.

Teamwork
In Cases B, D, E and F interviewees emphasised the
importance of teamwork and its positive effect on
organisational performance. For interviewees in Japanese
Case B, teamwork was considered to be the second most
positive impact on their organisation’s performance after
their job for life policy. In the case of the British utility,
interviewees considered that the strong ethos of crossfunctional teams had undoubtedly improved the overall
performance of their organisation.

Organisational culture
In Canadian Case D the change from the ‘bad’ culture
of the 1990s to its existing ‘good’ culture was cited by
interviewees as one of the major reasons for the recent
improvement in its organisational performance.
The good culture included:
•
•
•
•

open communication
low absenteeism
good union relations
excellent employee relations.

Canadian Case C was trying explicitly to change its culture.
Its ‘leader for tomorrow’ programme involved more
employee empowerment to develop a more performance
orientated culture. British Case E, which was relatively

small in size, had developed a family culture that helped
the organisation to improve its performance. In British
Case F all the interviewees mentioned its family culture,
despite the relatively large size of the organisation, and
emphasised its important contribution to organisational
performance.

level. 90% of Canadian interviewees agreed that a pension
scheme can have a major impact on an organisation’s
performance against 33% of the Japanese interviewees
and just 20% of the UK interviewees. Some interviewees
cited the problem of the rising cost of funding final salary
pension schemes.

3.4 Cross-case analysis of the six case studies

•
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

After the six case studies were completed, a cross-case
analysis of these companies was undertaken and the
following ten findings were tested during the telephone
interviews in Canada, Japan and the UK:
•
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
•
	
	
	
•
	
	
	
•
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

A mix of financial and non-financial measures leads 	
to improved performance
Companies in the telephone survey used a variety of 	
financial and non-financial performance measures. 	
These included: actual versus budget, cash flow, 		
customer satisfaction, economic value added, 		
employee satisfaction, employee turnover, 		
environmental impact, gross profit percentage, 		
market share, number of new customers, productivity, 	
profitability, quality, safety, sales and shareholders’ 	
total 	return.
83% of the interviewees agreed that the use of a 		
mix of financial and non-financial measures
led to improved organisational performance (see Table 	
2 - Appendix).

• There is a link between training and an 			
	 organisation’s performance
	 77% of all interviewees agreed with this statement 	
	 (see Table 8 - Appendix). However, of the Japanese 	
		
interviewees only 43% agreed with this
statement. 		
It appeared that Japanese
interviewees placed 			
more
emphasis on organisational culture and their 			
treatment of employees (such as a job for life policy) 		
than on other issues such as training.

•
	
The role of employees is critical in achieving an 		
	
organisation’s targeted performance	
	
Nearly all of the interviewees (97%) agreed with this 	
	
statement (see Table 3 - Appendix).
	
Teamwork has a major impact on an organisation’s 	 	
performance
	
Again, nearly all of the interviewees (93%) agreed with 	 	
this statement (see Table 4 - Appendix).
	
Organisational culture (with regard to employees) 	 	
has a major impact on an organisation’s 		
	
performance
	
75% of all interviewees agreed with this statement, 	
	
with a further 20% neutral (see Table 5 - Appendix). 	
	
However, of the Japanese interviewees, 85% 		
	
considered that organisational culture and, in 		
	
particular the way the employees were treated (for 	
	
example, with a job for life policy) had a major impact 	 	
on their organisation’s performance.
	

• A pension scheme can have a major impact on an 	
	 organisation’s performance	
	 Less than half of the interviewees (46%) agreed 		
	 with this statement – with a further 40% neutral (see
	 Table 6 - Appendix). The difference in the responses
between the three countries was significant at the 1%

When employees are viewed as assets rather 		
than simply costs, this has a positive impact on an 	
organisation’s performance
77% of interviewees considered employees as 		
assets, 16% as costs and 7% as both (see 			
Table 7 - Appendix). Overall, those interviewees 		
who considered employees as assets were in no 		
doubt that this view helped to improve their 		
organisation’s performance in the long-term.

	
	
	
	
	
	

Benchmarking is a useful technique for 			
exploring the relationship between HR policies and 	
an organisation’s performance
52% of interviewees said that their organisation 		
benchmarked its performance measurement 		
within the organisation (see Table 9 - Appendix). 		
However, there was a significant difference between 	
the three countries, with 70% of UK 			
interviewees benchmarking internally against 50% 	
of Japanese interviewees and just 37% of the Canadian 	
interviewees.
In the case of external benchmarking, again 52% of 	
interviewees said that their organisation compared 	
its performance measures against other organisations 	
(see Table 9 - Appendix). This time 90% of UK 		
interviewees confirmed that their organisation 		
benchmarked externally against 40% of the Canadian 	
interviewees and 33% of the Japanese interviewees.
In terms of benchmarking as a technique for 		
exploring the relationship between HR policies 		
and their organisation’s performance, 53% of the 		
interviewees considered that benchmarking was 		
useful (see Table 10 - Appendix). The highest support 	
for benchmarking was in Canada (67%) and the UK 	
(60%), whereas in Japan only 38% of interviewees 		
thought that the technique was useful for exploring

the relationship between HR policies 			
and their organisation’s performance.

•
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

Specific HR policies can be linked to an 			
organisation’s performance
62% of the interviewees responded that their 		
organisation tried to link specific HR policies with their 	
organisation’s performance (see Table 11- Appendix). 	
Japanese companies were at the forefront of this 		
approach, with 88% of Japanese interviewees 		
responding that their organisations tried to make the 	
link between specific HR policies and organisational 	
performance. This compares to 53% of the Canadian 	
interviewees and 37% of the UK interviewees. 		
This finding again highlighted the emphasis given by 	
the Japanese interviewees to human resource issues.

4. Conclusion
This research project found three main findings of
particular interest to HR managers and management
accountants. Firstly that recruitment, training, teamwork
and organisational culture were the four HR policies
mentioned by most interviewees in the six case studies as
affecting organisational performance.
Secondly, it was found that management accountants
were working closely with their HR colleagues to
support the HRM function in improving organisational
performance. Areas of collaboration included strategic
planning, budgeting, development of performance related
bonus schemes and decision making.

Thirdly, it was evident that the companies in this study
had made great efforts to link specific HR policies with
