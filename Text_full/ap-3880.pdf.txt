ORDER FOLLOWING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

In the Matter of
DANIEL CHRISTIAN STANLEY POWELL

On April 19, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. Respondent was served with the OIP on May 9 and his answer was originally due May
31, 2016. Daniel Christian Stanley Powell, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3861, 2016 SEC
LEXIS 1822 (ALJ May 23, 2016).
Yesterday, I held a telephonic prehearing conference at which both the Division of
Enforcement and Respondent appeared. The parties advised that settlement discussions are
ongoing. As discussed during the conference, in the event this proceeding is not resolved by
settlement, I ORDER the following procedural schedule:
June 21, 2016:

Respondent’s answer is due.

July 1, 2016:

The Division’s motion for summary disposition is due.

July 29, 2016:

Respondent’s summary disposition opposition is due.

August 8, 2016:

The Division’s summary disposition reply is due.

During the prehearing conference, counsel for the Division informed Respondent that
based on information obtained from Respondent’s former employer, the dates alleged in the first
operative paragraph of the OIP are incorrect. Counsel also stated what he believed are the
correct dates. I left it to the Division to determine whether it should move to amend the OIP.
Nothing that occurred during the prehearing conference should be construed as an indication by
me as to whether the OIP should be amended.
