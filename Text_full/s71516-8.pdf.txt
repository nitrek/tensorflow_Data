Dear Sir.

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to comment on your Proposed rule on: Disclosure
Update and Simplification.
You are proposing amendments to certain disclosure requirements that may have become
redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded, in light of other SEC disclosure
requirements, US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), or changes in the information environment. You are
also considering certain SEC disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require
information incremental to, US GAAP to determine whether to retain, modify, eliminate, or
refer them to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for potential incorporation
into US GAAP. The proposed amendments are intended to facilitate the disclosure of
information to investors, while simplifying compliance efforts, without significantly altering the
total mix of information provided to investors.

Insurance companies
For insurance policy liabilities, Rule 7-03(a)(13)(b) of Regulation S-X requires disclosure in
the notes to the financial statements of “assumptions (interest rates, mortality, withdrawals)
for future policy benefits and claims and settlements which are stated at present value”. US
GAAP requires similar disclosure, but does not limit its disclosures to these three stated

assumptions.1 For example, of particular interest to investors and other stakeholders could
be disclosure of expense and inflation assumptions, morbidity assumptions, and paid-up and
policy conversion assumptions. US GAAP therefore requires broader, more complete and
more useful disclosures of relevant assumptions used in estimating the liability for future
policy benefits.
Therefore, in answer to your specific question number 28: deletion of the requirement in
Rule 7-03(a)(13)(b) for disclosures of the above three assumptions would not affect, in any
material respect, the usefulness of information that investors receive.

Yours faithfully

Chris Barnard
