FOREWORD
This.is the eighteenth annual report of the Securities and Exchange
Commission to the Congress, summarizing the work of the Commission during the fiscal year July 1,1951, to June 30, 1952.
The year has been one of continued intensive activity for the
Commission, which has operated under difficult conditions of reduced manpower resulting from a substantial cut in the appropriation
to the Commission for the fiscal year amounting to almost 16 percent.
Registrations of securities were the largest amount for any fiscal
year since securities have been registered with the Commission
and corporations raised more funds in the United States capita i
market in fiscal year 1952 than in any 12-month period since 1929.
Registrations, totaling $9.5 billion in the fiscal year, brought the
average for the post-war fiscal years 1946 to 1952 to $6.7 billion,
compared with a $2.1 billion average for the fiscal years 1939 to
1945. Total corporate securities offered for cash sale during the
1952 fiscal year exceeded $9.0 billion. The large volume of securities
primarily reflected the greater need for funds by corporations, particularly those in defense industries, to finance their record expenditures for plant expansion and new equipment. The successful
flotation of securities of this magnitude was possible because of
the prevailing favorable economic conditions, with the financial
position of corporations generally satisfactory and the securities
market strong.
In addition, the Commission, under the statutes which it administers and under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, is charged with
many other important duties, such as the surveillance of the securities
markets, the regulation of the activities of brokers, dealers and
investment advisers, the direction and supervision of the integration
and simplification of public utility holding company systems, and
advisory participation in Chapter X reorganizations. The Commission's activities under the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935 during the past fiscal year and the early months thereafter
have been highlighted by a series of successful compromises among
various classes of security holders, effected with the assistance of the
staff of the Commission, which have substantially reduced the time
necessary to conclude many of the pending reorganization proceedings
under section 11 of the Act. The report discusses these and the other
activities of the Commission.
A significant development during the fiscal year which will aid
in the prevention of securities frauds in connection with the sale in
the United States of securities by Canadian brokers and dealers
was the signing of a Supplementary Extradition Convention between
Canada and the United States. This Convention provides for the
rendition of such persons charged with securities frauds.
The Commission has endeavored to maintain a high standard of
accomplishment in the face of an increasing work-load, notwithstanding successive drastic reductions in its staff in this and preceding
fiscal years made necessary by budget limitations. The number
of employees of the Commission today- is less than one-half of the
average number employed in 1941. Srnce the end of the 1952 fiscal
XI

FOREWORD

year, the over-all staff was reduced from 866 to 793, or by 8.4 percent,
as of December 31, 1952, and because of the unavailability of funds
a further decrease to about 770 is likely by June 30, 1953. Despite
the streamlining of procedures it has been necessary to eliminate
or curtail various services valuable to the public, and the reduction
in staff seriously hampers the Commission's performance of essential
duties and threatens its ability to cooperate promptly and fully in the
financing of the defense effort.
During the fiscal year a subcommittee of the House Committee
on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, under the chairmanship of the
Honorable Louis B. Heller, was engaged in an extensive investigation of all phases of the Commission's activities, and heard testimony
by members of the Commission and staff officials. A large amount
of material was prepared and submitted at the request of the subcommittee, relating both to specific cases and to the activities of the
Commission generally,
The Commission cooperated with the sub:'
committee in every way possible, devoting about 20,000 man-hours
to the matter, which was still pending at the end of the fiscal year.

PART I
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE SECURITIES

xcr

OF 1933

The objectives of the Securities Act of 1933 are to provide investors
with full disclosure of material facts regarding securities publicly
'offered for sale through the mails or instrumentalities of interstate
commerce, and to prevent misrepresentation, deceit, or other fraudulent practices in the sale of securities. Disclosure is obtained by
requiring the issuer of such securities to file with the Commission
a registration statement, and related prospectus, containing significant information about the issuer and the offering which meets the
standards prescribed by the statute. These documents are available
for inspection by the public as soon as they are filed. In addition,
the prospectus, which must be furnished to prospective investors
at or before delivery of the security, effectually brings the prescribed
disclosure directly to the attention of the individual investor.
It is the underlying theory of the Act that an investor equipped
with such information will be in a position intelligently to decide
for himself whether or not to buy the security offered. Thus, the
Commission is not empowered by this legislation to pass upon the
merits of the security; and, in order to make this fundamental principle
abundantly clear, every prospectus is required by the Act and the
Commission's rules and regulations to carry the following statement
boldly on its face:
THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED
BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE
COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF
THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY
IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRATION PROCESS
The Registration Statem.ent and Prospectus

Any security may be registered with the Commission under the
Act by filing a registration statement on the appropriate form. Correspondingly, no security may be sold in interstate and foreign commerce and through the mails unless it has been so registered.' Listed
below are the various forms prescribed for registration of securities:
Form 8-1. General Form for Commercial and Industrial Companies.
Form 8-2. For Shares of Certain Corporations in the Development
Stage.
Form 8-3. For Shares of Mining Corporations in the Promotional
Stage.
'Form 8-4. For Closed-End Management Investment Companies

Form D-l. For Certificates of Deposit.

â€¢

Form F -1. For Voting Trust Certificates.
Each form is designed to disclose appropriately for the class of
issuer involved the types of information prescribed in Schedule A
of the Act. As provided therein, these disclosures therefore cover
such matters as the names of persons who exercise control and direction of the business enterprise; the security holdings, remuneration,
options, and bonus and profit-sharing privileges, of each such corporation insider; the character and size of the business; financial statements,
certified by independent public or certified accountants, showing the
profitableness or unprofitableness of operations; the capital structure;
underwriters' commissions; pending or threatened legal proceedings;
and the specific detailed purposes to which the proceeds of the offering
are to be applied.
The prospectus, which as heretofore stated must be furnished to
the purchaser at or before the delivery of the security, and which
is an integral part of the registration statement, contains in abbreviated Iorm the more essential items disclosed in the registration
statement proper.
Schedule B of the Act specifies the corresponding types of information that must be disclosed in registration statements filed by foreign
governments. The Commission has adopted no particular form for
the use of Schedule B registrants; hence, foreign governments may
employ any form which adequately discloses the specified information,
As a part of its continuing program to make the prospectus a more
readable and understandable document, the Commission gave public
notice immediately after the close of the fiscal year of a proposal
further to change its rules governing the preparation and use of this
document which is so vital to the accomplishment of the objectives
of the Act. In view of the importance of the proposed changes, they
will be discussed at some length elsewhere in this report.
~nation

Procedure

The staff of the Division of Corporation Finance examines each
registration statement to determine its compliance with the Act and
the Commission's rules and regulations which implement the Act.
This analysis of a registration statement is never a simple or routine
undertaking for the security analysts, accountants and lawyers who
must work together as a coordinated team in completing the examination procedure within the short time limitation imposed by statute.
Always comprehensive, the processing frequently is an exacting task.
Especially is this so when the staff encounters in the registration
statement novel or complex financial problems peculiar to the line
of business in which the registrant is engaged, or finds that the
registrant has an unusually complicated capital structure, or multiple
and far-flung subsidiary companies.

EIGHTE,ENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

3

From the outset of its administration of the Act, the Commission
has employed various informal techniques which have simplified,
speeded-up, and made more effective the examination procedure.
Devices used for these purposes have elicited widespread commendation of registrants generally and are continually being improved.
Even before a statement is filed, the registrant's lawyer, accountant
or other representative has the opportunity to visit the Commission
snd -engage in an informal prefiling conference freely made available
by the Commission's expert staff in any case where such help is
desired in solving any problem that has arisen or may be anticipated
in the preparation of the proposed registration statement.
As a
result, types or methods of disclosure appropriate under the circumstances of the particular case are determined in advance of the filing.
Where a statement has been filed and is shown upon examination
to be inaccurate or incomplete in disclosure of material information,
the registrant is customarily advised by means of an informal letter
of comment specifying the information which must be corrected or
supplemented in order to meet the prescribed standards of disclosure.
The significance of this device lies in the opportunity it affords the
registrant to file correcting amendments before the statement becomes
effective.
It is not desired by the Commission, the issuer, or the underwriter,
that a registration statement should become effective unless it complies with the Act. Often when the staff discovers deficiencies in the
statement as filed, or when the issuer or underwriter on its own motion
wishes to amend the statement or simply to delay its effectiveness
because of swift-moving developments in the highly sensitive and
competitive securities market or other business reasons, some risk is
created that the registration statement may become effective in
defective form or inopportunely for the purposes of the registrant.
Accordingly a practice has been developed whereby a registrant
facing such a risk may file a delaying amendment which has the sole
purpose of starting the statutory 20-day waiting period running
anew. During the 1952 fiscal year a total of 678 delaying amendments
and 1055 material amendments were filed before the effective date
of registration.
The Commission has power to issue a formal order under section 8
of the Act preventing or suspending the effectiveness of a registration
statement.
The substantial nature of the deficiencies found in a
statement against which a stop order was issued under section 8 (d)
during the 1952 fiscal year will be discussed elsewhere in this report.
The Commission's vital examination functions face a risk of serious
impairment resulting from the continued reductions in appropriations
to the Commission in recent years. During the year, budgetary
limitations forced the Commission to close its registration unit in
the San Francisco Regional Office where registrants located in the
Pacific Coast area or in Hawaii could convemently file their registration statements instead of being required to submit them to the
headquarters office of the Commission in Washington.
It also became necessary to abolish the small field office in Tulsa in charge of
a staff geologist which had made effective contributions in the prevention and punishment of fraud in the sale of registered and exempt
oil and gas securities.

SECURIl'IES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Effective Date of Registration Statement,

Congress provided for a lapse of 20 days in the ordinary case between the filing date of a registration statement and the time it may
become effective. The purpose of the waiting period is to provide
investors with an opportunity to become familiar with the proposed
security before it may lawfully be offered to them. The possibility
of achieving this purpose is greatly enhanced by the fact that immediately upon the filing of a registration statement extra copies of it
are made available by the Commission to representatives of financial
news services, financial writers, and newspapers generally. These
representatives in turn prepare releases covering all information
disclosed in the registration statement, or various items selected
therefrom as they prefer, and set in motion widespread publicity
about the contemplated offering which is immediately put on the
wire and distributed to their subscribers scattered from coast to coast.
The Commission is empowered in its discretion to accelerate the
effective date so as to shorten the 20-day waiting period where the
facts are deemed to justify such action. In exercising this power,
the Commission must take into account the adequacy of the information about the security which is already available to the public,
the complexity of the particular financing, and the public interest
and protection of investors.
Time Required to Complete Registration

The time required to complete the registration process is influenced
by certain variable factors, largely beyond the control of the Commission, such as the following: the time required by the staff to examine
the registration statement and send its letter of comment; the time
required by the registrant to prepare and file a correcting amendment;
and finally the time required by the staff to examine such an amendment in the same manner as the original filing-including any extension
of time which may have resulted from the filing by the registrant of a
delaying amendment. The average time required in each month of
the 1952 fiscal year for each of these principal stages as well as for all
steps combined in the registration process is shown in the accompanying table. This table shows little change from results achieved during

ANNUAL REPORT

the preceding two fiscal years. The average time required to complete
the registration process for the median statement, which amounted
to 21}12 days in both 1950 and 1951, was 21~ days in 1952. In view
of the currently increased work load, aggravated by the acute manpower shortage, this favorable result is attributable in no small part
to the loyalty and devotion of the members of the staff, many of whom
frequently work a considerable number of hours of overtime without
receiving extra compensation therefor.
VOLUME OF SECURITIES REGISTERED

The amount of securities effectively registered during the 1952
fiscal year was $9,500,{)00,DOO,
the greatest amount for any fiscal year
since securities have been registered with the Commission and a third
greater than the previous high of $7,073,000,000, the amount for the
1946 fiscal year," This is the seventh consecutive fiscal year for which
registrations were in excess of $5,000,000,000. Figures are presented
below on the annual volume of effective registrations since 1939 and
the extent to which these registrations were for cash sale for account
of issuers. More detailed information on registered issues for fiscal
year 1952, including monthly figures on the number and volume of
registrations, is given in tables 1 and 2 of the Appendix.

From this and similar tables in recent annual reports, it can be
ascertained that of approximately $36.6 billion effective registrations
for cash sale for account of issuers during the past seven fiscal years,
$12.3 billion were electric, gas, and water, $7.6 billion were manufacturing, $7.4 billion were transportation and communication, $7.0
billion were financial and investment, $1.3 billion were foreign government, and all others were somewhat over $1.0 billion. The transportation group does not include issues, primarily railroad securities,
subject to Interstate Commerce Commission filings and therefore
exempt from registration.
Electric, gas, and water company issues
were the largest during the past four fiscal years, transportation and
communication issues the largest for the 1948 fiscal year, and manufacturing issues the largest for the 1947 and 1946 fiscal years.
Type of Security

Bonds amounted to 44.4 percent of the total registered in the

These expanding figures deal with proposed offerings and not
necessarily sales. Nevertheless they reflect informed underwriters'
opinion that the public has a growing ability and willingness to invest
in additional securities. Especially significant of the increasing work
load carried by the reduced staff available for processing these registration statements is the fact that the 665 statements filed during
the 1952 fiscal year represent 22% more statements than the number
filed in 1951 and 34% more than the number filed in 1950. It is also
significant in this connection that new registrants-those
without
previous experience in filing registration statements-accounted
for
119, or 22%, of all statements filed in 1951. The number and proportion of such new registrants rose in the 1952 fiscal year to 165, or
25% of the total filing statements.
In all cases the examination
process is necessarily exhaustive and time-consuming; in the case of
new registrants it undeniably requires the application of additional
man-hours.
Particulars regarding the disposition of all registration statements
filed are summarized in the following tables:

UNDER TIlE ACT

The Congress, recognizing the need to encourage small business
enterprise, authorized the Commission under section 3 (b) of the Act
by its rules and regulations to exempt from the registration requirements security offerings up to $100,000, subsequently raised by
statutory amendment enacted May 15, 1945, to $300,000. Acting
under this authority the Commission has adopted five types of
exemptions of small offerings as identified below:
Regulation A. General exemption for small issues up to $300,000 for issuers
_ (limited to $100,000 for controlling stockholders).
Regulation A-R. Special exemption for notes and bonds secured by first liens
on family dwellings up to $25,000.
Regulation A-M. Special exemption for assessable shares of stock of mining
companies up to $100,000.
Regulation B. Exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights
up to $100,000.
Regulation B-T. Exemption for interests in oil royalty trusts or similar types
of trusts or unincorporated associations up to $100,000.

B~ far the most frequent of these exemptions are the ones provided
A and B, which call for the filing, respectively, of a
letter of notification and an offering sheet. These documents call
for a disclosure ill. brief summary of pertinent information regarding
the security which is far less complete than what is prescribed by the
Act for a registered security.
After such filing, little time elapses
before the offering may be made-five business days under Regulation
A, and eight calendar days under Regulation B. Any sales literature
to be used must be filed III advance with the Commission.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Exemption from registration afforded by any of the regulations
adopted pursuant to section 3 (b) does not carry exemption from the
civil liabilities for material untruths or omissions imposed by section
12 or from the criminal liabilities for fraud imposed by section 17.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A

During the 1952 fiscal year 1,494 letters of notification were filed to
cover proposed offerings of $210,672,956. While the amount of these
offerings does not represent an increase comparable to that shown for
the year in offerings of registered securities, it reflects a substantial
increase over the 1,358 filings in the amount of $174,277,762 under
Regulation A in the preceding year.

Included in the 1952 fiscal year totals are 196 letters of notification
covering stock offerings of $25,531,264 with respect to companies
engaged in the oil and gas business.
In connection with the total of 1,494 letters of notification there were
also received and examined by the staff during the fiscal year 1,417
amendments, so that roughly speaking the average letter of notification
required the filing of one amendment in order to meet the limited
applicable standards.
Likewise received and examined were 1,831
copies of sales literature to be used to promote these offerings.
Information is available as to 1,488 of the small offerings filed in the
1952 fiscal year to show their relative size; whether made by the issuer
or stockholders; and the extent to which and by what class of persons
underwritten.
As to size, 756 covered offerings of $100,000 or less; 276
over $100,000 and not over $200,000; and 456 over $200,000 but less
than $300,000. Issuers made 1,209 of these offerings; stockholders
267; and issuers and stockholders jointly 12. Practically half, or 742
of the offerings were underwritten, mostly by commercial underwriters who handled 568, and otherwise by officers and directors or
other persons not regularly engaged in the underwriting business who
accounted for the remaining 174.

EIGHTE.ENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A-M

During the year the Commission received a total of five prospectuses under Regulation A-M covering an aggregate offering price of
$203,368 of assessable shares of stock of mining companies. All were
filed at the Seattle Regional Office.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B-Oil and Gas Securities

The Commission maintains in the Division of Corporation Finance
an Oil and Gas Unit dealing especially with the technical and complex
problems peculiar to offerings of oil and gas securities. As noted
above, it was necessary during the year to abolish the Tulsa office
previously maintained as an important outpost to handle this specialized work.
During the 1952 fiscal year the staff of the Oil and Gas Unit examined a total of 93 offering sheets filed with the Commission under
Regulation B, and 54 amendments to such offering sheets; 196 of the
letters of notification filed under Regulation A which covered stock of
companies engaged in the oil and gas business; and 114 of the registration statements, and 101 amendments thereto, filed under the Act by
oil, natural gas, or refining companies. A by-product of these examinations was the necessary preparation of 135 memoranda dealing with
such technical matters as the accuracy or reasonableness of geological
reports, estimates of oil reserves, etc., intended to be used by offerors
of registered securities as a part of their registration statements.
In
addition, as an aid to the Commission's enforcement of the provisions
of sections 12 and 17, regional offices submitted to this specialized staff
for technical analysis and review 315 exhibits of sales literature proposed to be used by offerors of exempt oil and gas securities.
The following formal actions were taken during the year with respect
to the filings under Regulation B.

Oil and gas investigations.-The Commission conducts numerous
investigations, which arise largely out of complaints received from
individual investors, to determine whether there has been any violation
of any other provision of law in the sale of oil and gas securities
exempted under Regulation B. Litigation resulting from these
investigations is discussed later in this report.

COMMISSION

FORMAL ACTION UNDER SECTION 8

As previously indicated, the Commission has power to institute
formal proceedmgs under section 8 (b) to determine whether to issue
a stop order to prevent a registration statement from becoming
effective when it appears to be inaccurate or incomplete in any material
respect; under section 8 (d) to determine whether to issue a stop order
to suspend the effectiveness of a registration statement so defective;
and under section 8 (e) to make an examination to determine whether
to issue a stop order under section 8 (d).
Stop-order Proceedings Under Seetion 8 (d)

Cristina Copper Minee, Ine-r-File No. 2-8487.-During the 1952
fiscal year a stop order was issued under section 8 (d) suspending the
effectiveness of the registration statement of Cristina Mines, Ltd., a
Delaware corporation organized in 1945. This registration statement
became effective August 22, 1950, as to 400,000 shares of 50~ par
value common stock to be offered publicly at $1.00 per share. After
the sale of 31,610 shares pursuant to the registration statement,
Cristina withdrew the unsold 368,390 shares from registration on
June 13, 1951. Between May 23 and 29, 1951, an examination was
held under section 8 (e), and after the institution of stop-order proceedings on June 29, 1951, the record of that examination was incorporated in these proceedings. The Commission's findings and
opinion resulting in the issuance of a stop order suspending the
effectiveness of this registration statement on May 1,1952, is available
as Securities Act Release No. 3439. Certain data relating to Cristina's
public offering of unregistered shares, the sale of promoters' holdings,
the market price of its shares, and the false and misleading character
of relevant financial statements which were held to require the stop
order are briefly discussed below.
Cristina holds 37 leases of mining properties covering a total area
of about ten square miles in Cuba. It acquired these leases in 1945
from its president and principal promoter, H. Cortez Johnson. The
only shipment of ore from the property in the nine years the leases
had been held by Cristina or Johnson was of approximately 2,200
tons in 1948 from which proceeds of $41,350.87 were received. The
registration statement recited that the proceeds of $340,000 expected
from the offering were to be expended, after payment of the expenses
of the offering, to explore and develop the present mine area and to
extend workings into new areas.
The registration statement represented that Cristina had sold
162,000 shares of its stock "privately" by April 1950 to "eighteen
private individuals for investment purposes only 'and not for distribution." However, the record developed in these proceedings shows
that these 162,000 shares were in fact sold to approximately seventy
persons, and that an additional 28,000 shares, of which no mention
was made in the registration statement, were also sold by Cristina in
July and August 1950. The Commission, after reviewing the record,
found that the statement that 162,000 shares had been privately
offered, and the failure to disclose the offering of the 28,000 shares
and the existence of a contingent liability under the Act because of
Cristina's failure to register any of these 190,000 shares, rendered the
registration statement materially false and misleading.
.

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

13

During the period the registration statement was in effect and the
registered shares were being offered at $1.00 per share .. at least 28,650
shares of Cristina stock owned personally by individuals who were
directors or promoters of Cristina or closely associated with the
company were offered and sold by them at prices ranging from 40~
to 75~ per share. In addition, beginning about January 1951, there
was an active over-the-counter market in Cristina stock at prices substantially lower than the $1.00 offering price of the registered shares,
and transactions were effected between January 17 and March 5, 1951,
in the total amount of 22,900 shares, at prices ranging from 50~ to 75~.
Although Cristina filed several amendments to the registration statement after these sales had been made by these individuals and the
over-the-counter market had been developed, disclosure of those facts
was not made therein.
The Commission found that such disclosure
should have been made in connection with the continued use of the
stated offering price of $1.00 per share, since it would have indicated
that such price was considerably higber than the current price on the
open market.
The registration statement filed by Cristina disclosed no liabilities.
The record in these proceedings showed, however, that as of June 30,
1950, Cristina owed approximately $2,000 for expenses incurred in
connection with its operations; around $1,000 to its accountant;
approximately $6,000 to one promoter fol' back commissions; $3,000
to another promoter; and was in default on its royalty payments to
the extent of over $9,000. In addition, Cristina owed its attorney
an amount that was in dispute, and, as suggested above, it was
contingently liable for selling unregistered securities in violation of
the statute.
Besides the materially misleading omission of liabilities,
which exceeded the current assets of the company stated at $6,536.11,
the financial data included in the registration statement were found by
the Commission to be inaccurate and incomplete in certain other
respects.
The Commission concluded that, in view of the substantial nature
of the various deficiencies found in this registration statement, the
issuance of a stop order was required in the public interest.
DISCLOSURES RESULTING FROM EXAMINATION OF
REGISTRATION STATEMENTS

The results of the Commission's work in the examination of registration statements are illustrated below.
Summaries oj earnings.-In announcing the adoption on November
1, 1951, of the revised Form 8-1 for the registration of securities under
the Securities Act, which will be discussed more fully later in this
report, the Commission called particular attention to a new provision
in the form pertaining to the summary of earnings in the prospectus.
Under this provision, if the summary of earnings set forth in the
prospectus is certified for the required period and contains the same
disclosure as would be contained in conventional profit and loss statements, the summary will be accepted as meeting the requirements for
profit and loss statements and such statements will not be required to
be included elsewhere in the prospectus or in the registration statement. It was anticipated that this provision for the elimination of
unnecessary duplication and the consequent reduction in the length of

14

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the prospectus would appeal particularly to registrants in the public
utilities field since it had been customary for such registrants to include practically the same detail in the summaries as was prescribed
for the profit and loss statements.
Not surprisingly, therefore, the
first use of this permissive rule, commencing in December, was made
by certain utility registrants.
Of course the new rule does not apply
solely to public utilities, and it has subsequently been used by various
manufacturing
and industrial registrants with equally beneficial
results.
The summary of earnings is generally considered to be one of the
most important parts of the prospectus and as such must be prepared
with great care to be sure that no misleading inferences may be drawn
from it. The following cases illustrate the results achieved by the
staff's examination of the summary.
The registration statement, as originally filed by a company deriving
its income principally from long-term contracts, included in the summary of earnings and in the financial statements unaudited interim
figures for the 12-week period subsequent to the close of its last fiscal
year. The summary, in addition to its figures for ten full fiscal years
and the 12-week interim period, also included figures for the 16-week
period subsequent to the close of the fiscal year. Comparison of the
two interim periods disclosed net income in the last 4 weeks of the
16-week period approximately equal to the net income in the first
twelve weeks. In view of the possible interpretation that this comparison indicated a substantial improvement in earnings, which was
unwarranted because of the nature of the business, it was agreed in a
discussion between members of the staff and counsel for the company
to delete the 12-week figures from the summary of earnings and to
substitute the 16-week for the 12-week figures in the financial statements.
In another case the prospectus submitted as a part of the registration statement, as originally filed, contained a consolidated summary
of earnings for five fiscal years and for an interim period of 5 months.
It was noted in the process of examination that a company with approximately equal sales and assets was merged into the registrant near
the close of the second fiscal year but was not included in the summary
until the year after the merger, which was the third year included in
the summary.
Under the circumstances, it did not appear to the
staff that the information furnished for the first 2 years was fairly
comparable to that shown for subsequent periods. Consequently,
this registrant, at the staff's request, restated the results of operations
for the first 2 years on a combined basis to reflect the effect of the
merger, and made corresponding changes in the paragraph in the text
which discussed the growth of the company.
As originally filed, it
was asserted that in 5 years sales increased from $29,000,000 to $206,000,000 and total assets from $24,000,000 to $130,000,000. As
amended, it was stated that sales on a combined basis increased from
$63,000,000 to $206,000,000 and combined assets from $40,000,000 to
$130,000,000.
Accounting for a "pooling of interests."-A foreign company filed
with its registration statement a prospectus in which it was stated
that the registrant was formed. for the purpose of amalgamating a
number of existing companies engaged in the oil business. The registrant urged before the Commission that the transaction was a purchase of assets (as distinguished from a business combination and

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

15

pooling of interests) and that therefore the assets of the amalgamation
should be stated on the basis of an amount, agreed upon by the several
constituents, representing the value of the registrant's shares issued
in the transaction.
On this basis, the consolidated balance sheet
would have reported total assets of approximately $14,500,000, and
capital surplus in excess of $10,000,000.
The Commission, giving consideration to the nature and effect of
the transactions resulting in the formation of the registrant and its
absorption of the businesses of its predecessor and subsidiary companies, concluded that the transaction in substance involved a business
combination and pooling of interests and that accounting procedures
applicable to such a transaction should be followed in setting up the
balance sheet of the new company. As a result, the consolidated
balance sheet of the registrant reported total assets of approximately
$8,400,000 and capital surplus of approximately $4,100,000.
In this connection it may be noted that the prospectus stated that
the price at which the shares were offered was in excess of the value
per share attributable solely to the company's already proven oil and
gas reserves and its equity in subsidiary companies less its and their
indebtedness, or solely to earnings of the company and its predecessor
and subsidiary companies as shown in the financial statements included
in the prospectus. Therefore, the prospectus stated, the offering
price already anticipated and reflected the possibility that the company
and its subsidiary companies might in the future discover and develop
oil and gas reserves greatly in excess of those presently owned.
Independence of accountants.-In
connection with the processing
of registration statements during the past year evidence was developed
by the staff in a number of cases indicating that the financial statements included in the registration statements had been certified by
accountants who, under the rules of the Commission, could not be
considered independent of the registrant.
In several of these cases
this situation was revealed early in the examination procedure and new
accountants were appointed by registrants without delay. One of
these registrants was a new investment company, whose accountant
selected to certify the financial statements was shown by the original
prospectus to be its treasurer, director and stockholder. Anyone
of these relationships is sufficient to disqualify an accountant under
the Commission's definition of an independent accountant.
Other
cases involved either director or stockholder relationships on the part
of the proposed accountants.
Two other cases in which the accountants were deemed not to
meet the Commission's standards of independence were similar in
many respects, including the fact that the disqualifying relationships
were not revealed until shortly before it was desired to have the
registration statements become effective. The determination that
the accountants were not independent in these cases resulted in
delays and increased expenses which could have been avoided by the
registrants if they had made full disclosure of the relevant facts prior
to filing. In both cases the accountants had served the client for
many years, and during the period for which they certified financial
statements included in the registration statements they participated
in real estate transactions with officers of the registrants under circumstances which led to the conclusion that the accountants could not be
considered as independent of the registrants. However, in both cases

16

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

new accountants were appointed, and financial statements certified
by them were furnished in amendments to the registration statements.
In one of these instances the new accountants found it necessary to
restate the income for all years included in the prospectus in order to
eliminate the effect of arbitrary reserves used by the management,
with the approval of the first accountants, in stating the value of
inventories-a
practice not considered to be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Effect of insiders' dealings on offering price.-A
mining company
incorporated in a foreign country where its common stock is listed
on a securities exchange filed a registration statement covering an
offering of its shares at a price fixed in relation to the market quotation.
In the course of the examination of the registration statement, a
study was made by the staff of a number of articles appearing in a
widely read mining newspaper over a period of months preceding the
filing of the registration statement, during which time there was
extensive activity with a substantial rise in the quoted price of the
stock. The study showed that the newspaper articles contained
statements that were inaccurate and in sharp variance with the information given in the registration statement and that there had been
extensive trading in the shares by persons active in the affairs or

influence of these circumstances upon the market price, and consequently upon the offering price of the shares, the following disclosure
was added to the prospectus:

* * *

The prices
at which the securities are being offered are essentially
arbitrary and cannot reasonably be related to any development in the Company's
affairs to date. The price of the Company's shares on the
Stock
Exchange has fluctuated widely, ranging during the past year from a low of $0.60
to a high of $1.95 and closing on March 7th, 1952 at $1.07 per share.
These
prices bear no discernible relationship to the progress of the C-ompany in the
exploration of its mining properties and must be viewed in light of market activities which may have been affected by rumors and the appearance from time to
time of inaccurate public press reports.
Large stockholders and other persons
active in the affairs and management of the Company have engaged in extensive
trading in the stock of the Company during the past year.

* * *

Distortion of per-share earnings figures corrected.-Per-share earnings
figures are often used by investors as a preliminary, rule-of-thumb
gauge of the appropriateness of the offering price of new common
stock issues, and the revised Form 8-1 requires that if common stock
is being registered, earnings per share applicable to common stock
must be shown when appropriate in connection with the earnings
summary.
This requirement, however, presupposes that such earnings per share will be calculated on a rational basis.
A manufacturing company was managed and wholly owned by two
individuals, one of whom desired to sell out his entire one-half interest
and retire from the business, and the other was to retain his equity
and his control and management of the company.
As a preliminary
to this transaction, steps were taken to revamp the capital structure
of the company to provide for two classes of stock, called respectively
"Common Shares" and "Class B Shares."
At the effective date of
the registration statement which was then filed to cover the public
offering of securities by the selling stockholder, the recapitalization

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL

17

REPORT

of the company was to have been completed and all of the common
shares (100,000 shares) were to be owned by the selling stockholder
and all of the class B shares (150,000 shares) were to be owned by the
nonselling stockholder. The 150,000 class B shares were to be convertible into 111,000 common shares at the end of 5 years, were to
have voting control of the company, but were not to be entitled to
receive dividends until $2 per share non-cumulative annual dividends
were paid on the common shares. As a preliminary to the offering,
the company entered into a 5-year employment contract with the
nonselling stockholder.
This contract plus the dividend and conversion provisions of the class B shares issued in the recapitalization
accomplished, as a practical matter, simply a temporary waiver by
the nonselling stockholder of his right to receive dividends on his
50% stock equity in the company for 5 years, compensated for in
substantial part by (a) the contract which entitled him to receive
$80,000 per year salary (with other benefits in the event of death or
incapacity), (b) the holding by him of an absolute majority voting
control of the company during the 5-year period, and (c) at the end
of such period his entitlement to 111,000 shares of common stock as
compared to the 100,000 shares being issued for the selling stockholder's 50% equity.
The prospectus as originally filed in this case included a per-share
earnings table which attempted to attribute to the 100,000 common
shares issued for the selling stockholder's 50% share in the business,
in one column the entire earnings of the company, and in a second
column $2 per share plus 50% of the earnings over that amount.
The examining staff took the position that neither of these columns
gave earnings properly "applicable" to the stock being offered, and,
at the request of the staff, there was substituted in the prospectus a
table showing per-share earnings on the basis of the 211,000 shares
of common stock ultimately to be outstanding by virtue of the whole
equity in the business. The radical nature of this change is shown

Speculative hazards disclosed.-A corporation organized under the
laws of Delaware to acquire all of the stock of a foreign corporation,
which had been organized to explore for sulphur under a concession
from a foreign government, filed a registration statement covering
400,000 shares to be offered the public at $1.00 per share. The staff
insisted that full disclosure be made of material facts concerning the
participation of inside promoters. As a result, the registrant incorporated in its amended prospectus an "Introductory Paragraph"
which described the basis of the insiders' participation in sharp contrast to the basis upon which public investors were to be offered a
share in the venture, as indicated in the following quotation therefrom:
[The registrant] has no operating history, and neither owns nor controls any
known sulphur deposits. The offering price of $1.00 per share for the 400,000
shares of Common Stock to be sold was determined arbitrarily and such price
does not necessarily have any relation to the value of the shares offered. There
is presently no established market for the Common Stock.
The purchasers of such 400,000 shares of Common Stock who will provide all
of the cash required for the purposes of this financing as described later in this
Prospectus, will acquire only 31.25% of the total Common Stock then outstanding.
[The foreign corporation] and its controlling stockholders who are identified
later in this Prospectus as promoters acquired a total of 800,000 shares of Common Stock and will receive in addition $100,000 in cash from the proceeds of this
financing and a royalty of $1.00 per short ton of sulphur produced for the assignment of certain rights in concessions of unproven value on which the cost in cash
to these promoters has been $12,882.84. The holdings of Common Stock of such
promoters will therefore constitute 62.5% of the outstanding stock on completion
of this financing.
The directors of [the registrant] who are also later identified in this Prospectus
as promoters have received 80,000 shares of Common Stock for services rendered
and to be rendered, or 6.25% of the outstanding stock on completion of this
financing.
Thus a total of 68.75% of the Common Stock will be held by persons designated
as promoters.

CHANGES IN RULES. REGULATIONS AND FORMS

Particularly important changes have been made and others have
been proposed by the Commission during the period under review in
the rules and forms used in administering the Securities Act. Especially notable are the changes in rules and forms adopted or proposed,
as described below, which reflect the Commission's continual efforts
to improve the effectiveness of the vital prospectus in achieving the
standard of disclosure intended by the statute.
Rule iSS-Definition, for purposes of Section 5, of "sale," "offer to

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

19

sell," and "offer for sale."-During
the year the Commission adopted
a new rule, designated as rule 133, which in effect excludes from the
operation of section 5 of the Act the issuance of securities in connection with certain types of corporate reclassifications, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets.
The new rule codifies the administrative construction, going back
at least to 1935, to the effect that, for purposes of registration, no
"sale" to the stockholders of a corporation is deemed to be involved
where, pursuant to applicable statutory or charter provisions, the
vote of a specified majority of stockholders on a proposed reclassification of securities or merger or consolidation, or on a proposed sale of
assets in exchange for the stock of another corporation, will bind all
stockholders except for the statutory appraisal rights of dissenters.
Substantially this rule was first promulgated by the Commission in
September 1935 as a note to Rule 5 of Form E-1,3 Form E-1 was
the registration form for securities sold or modified in the course of a.
reorganization, as defined in rule 5 of that form. In April 1947 the
Commission rescinded Form E-1 as part of its general form simplification program.'
Since then the Commission has continued to follow
the so-called "no sale theory" administratively in applying section
5 of the Act.
The Commission has never felt, however, that the "no sale theory"
necessarily applies in other contexts either under the Securities Act or
under any of the other Acts administered by the Commission.
As
the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has had
occasion to emphasize, section 2 of the Securities Act provides that
the terms defined therein, which include the term "sale," shall have
the prescribed meanings "unless the context otherwise requires." 6
Thus, under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 the Commission has uniformly treated the issuance and sale of securities in
mergers and analogous transactions as involving sales requiring its
prior approval,"
The new rule is specifically limited by its terms to section 5 of the
Securities Act. Consequently, whether or not a sale is involved for
any other purpose will depend upon the particular statutory context
applicable, and the question should in no sense be influenced by the
rule. As a matter of statutory construction the Commission does
not deem the "no sale theory," which is described in the rule, to be
applicable for purposes of any of the anti-fraud provisions of the
Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939.
Rule 154-Definition of" solicitation of such orders" in Section4 (2)The Commission also adopted during the year a new rule, designated
as rule 154, which defines the term "solicitation" in connection with
the exemption for unsolicited brokerage transactions in section 4 (2)
of the Act.
Section 4 (2) exempts from the registration and prospectus requirements of the Act:
Brokers' transactions, executed upon customers' orders on any exchange or in
the open or counter market, but not the solicitation of such orders.

20

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The interpretation of Section 4 (2) has been the subject of considerable
doubt.
The purpose of the new rule is to settle some interpretative
questions relating to the meaning of the word" solicitation" in that
section.
Paragraph (a) of the rule provides that the term "solicitation of
such orders" shall be deemed to include" the solicitation of an order
to buy a security, but shall not be deemed to include the solitication of an order to sell a security."
For reasons set forth by the
Commission in Brooklyn Manhattan Transit Oorporation, 1 SEC 147,
171-2 (1935), if the broker solicits an order to buy a security,
Section 4 (2) does not provide an exemption either for the solicitation
itself or for the resulting transaction.
On the other hand, the mere
fact that the broker solicits the seller to sell will not destroy any
exemption otherwise available to him under Section 4 (2); this construction is based on the fact that the statute is designed primarily
for the protection of buyers rather than for the protection of sellers.
While paragraph (a) of the rule makes it clear that there is no
exemption for the solicitation of orders to buy, a question remains as
to what constitutes "solicitation" where a broker for a seller approaches a dealer who is bidding for the security or soliciting others to
sell it to him. Paragraph (b) of the rule provides that, where the
dealer's bid or solicitation is in writing, the broker's inquiry about it
is not a "solicitation" within the meaning of section 4 (2), so that it
does not destroy any exemption otherwise available.
Paragraph (b)
recognizes also that, in the over-the-counter market, dealers interested
in buying a particular security may not publish a quotation or indication of interest in it every day or every week. To some extent such
quotations are published in monthly services, and to allow for the
delays incident to such publications the rule provides, in effect, that
the broker can rely on bids or indications of buying interest originating
as much as 60 days previously as indicating that a dealer is soliciting
sell orders, so that the broker, in calling the dealer, would not be
deemed to be soliciting him.
Rule 154 is a definition for purposes of Section 4 (2) and is not
intended to serve, for example, as a definition of the phrase" solicitation of an offer to buy" which appears in Section 2 (3) of the Act.
Nor is it intended to affect the Commission's holding in Ira Haupt
& 00., Securities Exchange Act release No. 3845 (Au~ust 20, 1946),
regarding the applicability of Section 4 (2) to transactions by underwriters.
Amendment of various rules governing preparation and filing of
registration statements and prospectuse8.-The
Commission amended
during the year certain of its rules under the Act with respect to the
preparation and filing of registration statements and prospectuses.
The changes made in the text of these rules are set forth in Securities
Act release No. 3424. As explained therein, the Commission had
found it necessary, because of budgetary limitations, to provide that
in the future all registration statements shall be filed and processed
at its headquarters office in Washington.
Previously, where issuers
or their underwriters had been situated in the Pacific Coast area or
in Hawaii, they had been permitted to file registration statements
in the Commission's San Francisco Regional Office. As previously
noted the registration unit in that office has been abolished.

EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT

21

Some of the other amendments relate to the formal requirements
with respect to the preparation and filing of registration statements.
For example, rule 402 was amended to provide that where the registration statement is typewritten, one of the copies filed with the
Commission shall be the original "ribbon" copy and that such copy
shall be signed.
Rule 403 was amended to permit registration statements to be
printed, lithographed, mimeographed, typewritten or prepared by any
other process which, in the opinion of the Commission, produces copies
of the requisite clarity and permanence. Previously, the only processes
permitted were printing, mimeographing or typing. The rules relating to legibility of the prospectus were also amended to make it clear
that ten-point type is the minimum size of type which may be used
in the body of prospectuses and that such type must be at least two
points leaded. However, in the case of financial statements and other
statistical or tabular data, the use of eight-point type is permitted.
Rule 426 was amended to require a statement in the prospectus
not only with respect to proposed stabilization but also with respect
to proposed over-allotments. The prospectus is also required thereby
to include information with respect to the volume of transactions
where stabilization is begun prior to the effective date of the registration statement.
New Rule 494 governing newspaper prospeetuses for joreign governments.-Qn August 2, 1951, the Commission published notice that it
had under consideration a proposal for the adoption of a rule under
the Act with respect to newspaper prospectuses relating to securities
issued by foreign governments. The Commission considered all comments and suggestions received in connection with the proposed rule
and adopted the rule in the form set forth in Securities Act release
No. 3425 (August 27, 1951).
Revised Form 8-1 adopted and subsequently amended.-The
Commission adopted on November 1, 1951, a revision of Form 8-1, one
of the forms for registration of securities under the Act. As announced
in the Seventeenth Annual Report at page 22, when this revision
was under consideration, the purpose of the revision was mainly to
shorten and improve the prospectus (without sacrificing material
information) and thereby facilitate its distribution and make it more
useful to investors generally.
The revised form permits the omission from the prospectus of
certain information which had theretofore been required to be set
forth therein but requires such information to be furnished elsewhere
in the registration statement so as to be available to investors and
others who desire to make a more detailed study of the registrant
or its securities. Thus, it is no longer necessary to include in the
prospectus a detailed description of the underwriting arrangements.
All that is required in the prospectus in this respect are the names
of the managing underwriters and a statement as to whether such
arrangements constitute what is commonly referred to as a "firm
commitment" or whether they are in the nature of an agency or
"best efforts" arrangement. Further details with respect to the
underwriting and marketing arrangements are required to be otherwise furnished in the registration statement. In other cases, information theretofore required in the prospectus is permitted to be entirely
omitted therefrom and set forth elsewhere in the registration state-

22

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

ment. This treatment, for example, is accorded information with
respect to franchises and concessions and indemnification of directors
and officers.
A study was made of a number of prospectuses filed with the Commission, and the items of the new form rearranged in conformity with
the more carefully prepared prospectuses reviewed. Wherever possible, the items and instructions were streamlined for the purpose of
producing more concise statements in the prospectus without sacrificing essential information. In addition, the instructions as to
financial statements were revised for the purpose of reducing the
number of statements required, particularly in cases involving reorganizations, successions, and other acquisitions of business. In the
draft of the proposed revision of Form 8-1 which had previously been
circulated for public comment, it was proposed that the summary of
earnings would be accepted in lieu of conventional profit and loss
statements and that statements of financial position might be furnished in lieu of conventional balance sheets. While the comments
received were generally favorable to this proposal, it was the carefully
considered opinion of many persons and firms that, in the interest of
investors, the disclosure required should be not less than that which
would be furnished by conventional financial statements certified by
independent accountants.
Accordingly, the revised form as adopted by the Commission provides that if the summary of earnings set forth in the prospectus is
certified for the required period and contains, as is now frequently
the case, the same disclosure as would be contained in conventional
profit and loss statements, the summary of earnings will be accepted
as meeting the requirements for conventional profit and loss statements
and such statements need not otherwise be included in the prospectus
or elsewhere in the registration statement. The revised form makes
no reference to statements of financial position, but it should be noted
that the Commission's rules and regulations now permit the use of
such statements, in appropriate cases, in lieu of conventional balance
sheets. Such statements, however, must measure up to the same
standards of disclosure as those required for conventional balance
sheets. The revised form provides that the financial statements
included in the prospectus must be certified to the same extent as
previously required by Form 8-1.
The Commission believes that the use of the revised form should
result in a more concise selling prospectus which can be widely distributed and more easily understood by the average investor. The
extent to which this goal is achieved will, however, depend in large
measure upon the cooperation of the industry. It will be necessary
for the issuer, the underwriters and their lawyers and accountants in
the preparation of the prospectus to eliminate duplication, unimportant or mechanical details, and statistical or other information not
called for by the form and not material from the standpoint of investors. If the prospectus is to serve its purpose it must not be prepared with a view to making it a detailed book of reference with
respect to the issuer and its securities. The Commission and its staff
will upon request assist to the fullest extent in pointing out in particular cases the extent to which it is deemed possible to accomplish the
desired result and thereby make the prospectus more useful to investors. On January 31, 1952, the Commission amended the revised

EIGHTEENTH ~AL

REPORT

23

Form 8-1 in minor respects designed to remove certain ambiguities
found in the language of the form.
Proposed revision oj Form S-5.-Late
in the 1952 fiscal year the
Commission announced a proposed revision of Form 8-5, and invited
comments thereon from all interested persons. This form is used for
the registration of securities under the Securities Act by open-end
management investment companies which are registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 on Form N-8B-1.
A registration statement on Form 8-5 consists largely of certain of
the information and documents which would be required by Form
N-8B-l, if a registration statement under the 1940Act were currently
being filed on that form. Registrants using this form are thus permitted to base their registration statements under the 1933 Act upon
the information and dockets filed with the Commission in the original
registration statement and in subsequent reports under the 1940 Act.
The revision of Form 8-5 under the Securities Act was proposed for
the purpose of bringing it into line with a currently proposed revision
of Form N-8B-l under the Investment Company Act. It is contemplated that the revision of these forms will simplify registration under
both Acts and will result in shorter and simpler prospectuses for openend management investment companies.
Study oj regulations governing prospectuses.-Proposal
to adopt Rule
132 and amend Rule 431.-For some years the Commission has been
exploring the advisability of recommending appropriate amendment
of the Securities Act in order better to achieve its basic purpose of
affording investors a maximum of timely disclosure in an understandable form. It seems clear that the two basic problems are (1)
devising some means, consistent with the statutory prohibition of
selling efforts before the effective date of the registration statement,
for achieving more widespread dissemination of information during
the waiting period, and (2) obtaining a statutory prospectus which is
reasonably concise and readable.
The Commission has tentatively concluded that it would not be
justified in recommending new legislation to the Congress until it
has done everything possible to achieve these two results under its
existing powers. This approach also has the advantage of permitting
a degree of flexibility and experimentation. If the suggestions,
which the Commission offered for public comment immediately after
the close of the year,? are adopted, actual experience may indicate
modifications from time to time. Moreover, the proposals offered
are not necessarily a substitute for new legislation. In the event
legislative action seems desirable, all parties concerned should be in
a better position to consider statutory amendment in the light of the
experience with the administrative changes thus proposed.
These proposals consist partly of new rules and partly of a new
statement of policy with reference to acceleration of the registration
statement.
In 1950 the Commission announced that it was considering a proposal to amend its rules under the Securities Act to do two things:
(a) Permit the circulation to investors of identifying statements"
containing certain limited information taken from registration statements and prospectuses, and (b) facilitate and encourage advance
distribution of proposed prospectuses (so-called tired herring protI

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

spectuses")." The Commission received comments on the proposal
but no amendment was adopted at that time. The latest proposals
contain certain modifications. These proposals and the factors
prompting their consideration are described in full below making
reference to the earlier release unnecessary.
In the absence of an exemption, the Securities .Act prohibits the
use of the mails or interstate facilities to make any sale or attempt to
dispose of a security prior to the effective date of a registration statement, and requires the inclusion of material information in prospectuses used after that date. However, it does not prohibit the
dissemination of information as such. Indeed, the concept of the
waiting period is based on the premise that information will in fact
be disseminated.
The report of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce
on the bill that became the Securities Act (fl. Rept. No. 85, 73d Cong.,
1st Sess., pp. 12-13) stated that underwriters who wished to inform
dealers of the nature of a security to be offered for sale after the effective date of the registration statement would be free to circulate the
offering circular (prospectus) itself, if clearly marked in such a manner
as to indicate that no offers to buy should be sent or would be accepted
until the effective date of the registration statement.
This practice
is expressly permitted by rule 131 under the Securities Act, relating
to the circulation of the so-called "red herring prospectus" before the
effective date, and it is not proposed to change this rule.
In releases 464 and 802 under the Securities Act the Commission's
General Counsel early expressed the opinion that the definitions of the
terms "sale" and "sell" in section 2 (3), and hence the prohibitions
of section 5, did not extend to certain summaries of salient information
contained in registration statements-provided,
among other conditions, that the material did not attempt to dispose of the security in
process of registration and was not used after the effective date unless
accompanied or preceded by a copy of the statutory prospectus.
The proposed action would not affect the status of such summaries.
The proposed rule 132 is designed to permit, under certain conditions, the use of a brief "identifying statement" which would set
forth generally the nature of the security to be offered. Certain
categories of information would be required and certain additional
categories would be permitted. Among other things, the identifying
statement would set forth" the general type of business of the issuer,"
and it is contemplated that this statement regarding the nature of
the business would not exceed a line or two. The identifying statement would be intended for use as a screening device to locate persons
who might be interested in receiving a "red-herring prospectus" or
final prospectus and not to facilitate solicitations in advance of the
effective date. The proposed rule would be in the form of a definition of the terms" sale" and" offer" for purposes of section 5. The
anti-fraud provisions would not be affected.
The rule would require that the identifying statement include a
form for requesting copies of the prospectus. Persons requesting
prospectuses before the effective date of the registration statement
could be given the "red-herring prospectus" provided for in the
present rule 131.
Rule 132 would condition use of the identifying statement upon
the filing of a form of such statement as a part of the registration
â€¢ See Securities

Act release No. 3396 (November

14. 1950).

EIGHTEENT:B: ANNUAL REPORT

25

statement ten days in advance of such use, unless the Oommission
accelerated the period. The identifying statement could be circulated
or published by the issuer or by underwriters and dealers either before
or after the effective date of the registration statement.
Any person
using the identifying statement would add to this form his name and
(after the effective date) the price of the security. In order to make
certain that a form of identifying statement would always be available for use by dealers, the Oommission would amend its various
registration _forms to require that each registration statement be
accompanied by a form of identifying statement.
In Securities Act release No. 3177, issued on December 5, 1946,
at the time of the adoption of rule 131 on "red herring prospectuses,"
the Oommission referred to its power under section 8 (a) to accelerate
the effectiveness of a registration statement where adequate information respecting the issuer has been available to the public. That
release states:
The Commission, in considering requests for acceleration of the effective date
of registration statements, will consider whether adequate dissemination has been
made of copies of the proposed form of prospectus, as permitted by the Rule.
The determination of what constitutes adequate dissemination must, of course,
remain a question of fact in each case after consideration of ail pertinent factors.
It would, however, involve as a minimum the distribution, a reasonable time in
advance of the anticipated effective date, of copies of such proposed form of
prospectus to all underwriters and dealers who may be invited to participate in
the distribution of the security.

In connection with the present proposals, the Commission, in determining whether to grant acceleration, would consider also (1) whether
the identifying statement had been made available to all underwriters and dealers who might be invited to participate in the distribution and (2) whether copies of the "red herring prospectus" had been
made available in reasonable quantity to such underwriters and
dealers, taking into consideration the number of requests that they
might expect to receive from customers and the amount of securities
that might be available to them for distribution.
In order to facilitate the use of proposed prospectuses in the preeffective period and to avoid the necessity of duplicating the information contained in them at a later date, it is proposed to amend rule
431 to provide generally that a final prospectus meeting the requirements of the Act may consist of the latest proposed prospectus under
rule 131 plus a document containing such additional information
that both together contain all the information required by the Act.
The amendment would remove a provision which now limits the rule
to offerings by an issuer to its existing stockholders.
The proposals outlined" above are designed to assist distributors
in locating persons interested in receiving the prospectus and to
make prospectuses more readily available to prospective investors.
A related problem is that a prospectus may not be useful to an investor if it is unduly long and complex. As a part of the present
proposal, the Oommission is therefore considering the adoption of a
policy of refusing acceleration where it is satisfied that there has
been no bona fide effort to make the prospectus reasonably concise
and readable.
The text of the proposed rule and amendment is set forth in Securities Act release No. 3447 (July 10, 1952) which gave public notice
of these suggestions.

Injunctive actions

It is sometimes necessary to resort to the courts to obtain compliance with the Securities Act. Such action is generally taken when
it appears that continued violations and resultant damage to the
public is threatened.
The necessity for injunction has arisen most
frequently in connection with violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the Act.
A substantial number of cases requiring injunctive action are
those relating to oil and mining promotions.
The "gold brick"
aspect of many of these promotions has by now become quite stereotyped. However, some cases vary from the norm sufficiently to be
worthy of mention.
For instance, injunctions were obtained in the
cases of SEC v, Jack Kelly, Inc. and Leo Jack Kelly,9 and SEC v.
Oil Prospectors, Inc. and Ralph Malone," where selling pressure was
based largely on the stated integrity of Kelly and Malone, the promotors of the ventures.
While the usual claims were made concerning the profit possibilities of the investment, the investor was assured
that his investment was a sure and safe one because the promo tors
were men of honor. The Commission's complaints for injunction
pointed out that the sellers were omitting to disclose that these individuals had criminal records.
The almost perennial "doodlebug" again made its appearance
during the year in the case of SEC v. Ben H. Frank, et alY Defendants used in their operations a device called a "Magnetic Logger"
and the claims made for its efficacy in discovering oil were the usual
ones and were false. The claimed existence of oil reserves in the
company's acrea~e was also without basis. There is reason to
believe that the mjunction obtained by the Commission saved the
investing public a substantial sum.
In SEC v, Keystone Petroleum, Inc. and Clyde G. Kissinger,J2
another oil promotion, the usual misrepresentations concerning fabulous wealth to be obtained from a small investment were being made,
as well as that the properties owned by the company were surrounded
by commercially producing oil wells. Actually, the nearest commercial producer, a poor one, was located miles away from the Keystone properties.
An injunction was granted.
Injunctions involving oil promotions were also obtained by the
Commission in SEC v. C. E. Simmonsv" SEC v. Sierra Nevada Oil
Company and Louis A. Sears " SEC v. E. M. Thomasson,\5 and SEC
v. John G. Perry &1 CO.16 A preliminary injunction was obtained in
SEC v. Valentine Company, Inc. and Chancey M. Valentine, which is
pending.'?
In the field of mining promotions the case of SEC v . Frank Lilly,
et al.,J8 presented a somewhat novel approach. There the promotors

pany, a corporation which had been dormant for over twenty years.
This company was, of course, entirely without assets. The promotors then proceeded to levy an "assessment" on the remaining
outstanding shares, notwithstanding that the stock was, by its terms,
nonassessable. Upon the failure of other stockholders to pay this
assessment, the defendants acquired practically all of the remaining
outstanding stock through delinquent assessment sales for virtually
little or nothing. The defendants then, without amending the charter,
changed the name of the company to Gold Gulch Mining Company,
doubled its capitalization and proceeded to sell its shares. They also
created an artificial market by extensive over-the-counter trading
and by "wash sales" and "matched orders." The Commission obtained an injunction before the distribution had proceeded to any
great extent.
The name U. S. Oil and Development Corp./9 was selected by Walter
A. Falk and Carl H. Peterson for a corporation formed by them, which
they falsely represented as being financed by loans from the Federal
Government and which, despite its title, purported to be in search
of ore rather than oil. An injunction was obtained by the Commission against the promoters.
The Commission also obtained injunctions against Glacier Mining
Company,20 together with a number of individual defendants, from
further violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Act and against
Searchlight Consolidated Mining and Milling Company and Homer C.
Mills,21 from selling securities without registration,. but these cases
are not sufficiently novel to warrant further comment.
Of course, the Commission's injunctive litigation is not entirely in
the oil and mineral promotion field. Frequently it arises in connection with companies engaged in the production of commodities or
other types of business. In the case of SEC v. The Fanner Manufacturing Company et al.,22 the corporate defendant, a foundry, attempted to acquire Grand Industries, Inc., a stove manufacturer, by
offering the shareholders of Grand Industries one share of Fanner for
each share of Grand Industries which they held. Representatives of
Fanner inquired at the Cleveland Regional Office of the Commission
regarding the propriety of such an exchange without registration and
were told that it could be accomplished only if the exchange offer was
limited to residents of the State of Ohio wherein the Fanner Company
was incorporated. The Fanner management determined not to register
and employed the assistance of three Cleveland investment houses who
began a solicitation ostensibly limited to Ohio residents. When it
appeared, however, that solicitations were being made to non-residents, and devious methods and subterfuges were being used to conceal the true situation, a complaint for injunction was filed. Fanner
then agreed that it would immediately discontinue its exchange plan,
would return all securities submitted for exchange subsequent to the
date of the filing of the complaint, and would repurchase from the
underwriters the securities which they had "on the shelf." Upon the
entry of such a stipulation the Commission agreed to withdraw its
complaint.

SECURITIES

COMMISSION

The Commission obtained an injunction in SEC v. United Insurers
Service Company, et al ..23 a case interesting because of the novel character of the misrepresentations made in connection with the offering of
the stock for sale. The false representations were to the effect that
the company was a life insurance company; that investments in its
stock were insured up to $5,000 by the United States Government;
and that dividends to be paid on the stock would be exempted from
Federal income tax.
In February 1952 the Commission filed a complaint against Chinchilla, Inc.24 alleging violations of the registration and anti-fraud
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint alleged that
the defendants had been selling investment contracts relating to the
purchase of mated pairs of chinchillas and were misrepresenting the
profits to be realized, the mortality rate of chinchillas and their susceptibility to disease, the market for the offspring, and similar matters.
The case was pending at the close of the fiscal year.
An injunction was obtained against Tom G. Taylor & Co.2/;for misrepresentations concerning the value, holdings and stability of that
company; and Virgil S. Berry and J. Bridges Lenoir" were enjoined
because of misrepresentations concerning the stock of Research
Manufacturing Corporation, Inc. In the latter case, Berry not only
falsely represented that the company had received large orders from
the Government, but did not disclose that it was his personally held
stock that was being sold and that the proceeds were going into his
own pocket instead of the company's treasury.
In SEC v. Homer J. Cox and U. S. Frigidice, Inc.,27 Cox obtained a
lease to certain property in New Mexico for the purported purpose of
drilling a well for the production of carbon dioxide gas. As part of the
promotion it was represented to potential investors that Cox would
cause a railroad siding to be built to the site and that a dry ice plant,
the cost of which would be in excess of $1,000,000, would also be constructed on the tract. Cox failed to tell investors that the securities
being sold were not the securities of the corporation but were his own,
that for the most part he was using the proceeds obtained from the
sale of the securities for his personal purposes and that neither Cox
nor the company had in their possession anywhere near the amount of
funds necessary to build the proposed dry ice plant. Accordingly,
the Commission obtained a final injunction prohibiting the sale of
these securities. It might be mentioned that in the course of the
investigation it became necessary to obtain a court order to enable
the Commission to examine the books and records of the defendants 28
and the Commission even found it necessary to secure a citation against
Cox for contempt of that order.
The Commission also had to apply to a court for an order requirinji
the production of books and records of Mines and Metals Corporation
and the order was issued in March 1952. An appeal to the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is pending."

_ In SEC v. Ralston Purina Company, the Commission sought an
injunction based on alleged violations of the registration provisions
of the Securities Act. The company had been selling its stock to
more than 500 of its employees, including many in minor positions,
and contended that these transactions were exempt from registration
under the non-public offering exemption contained in Section 4 (1)
of the Act. The district court agreed with this contention and
refused to grant a permanent injunction.s- On appeal to the Court
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, this decision was sustained on
November 21, 1952.30b The Commission has filed a petition for a
writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court which is pending.
Participation as Amicus Curiae

Court rulings involving significant interpretations of the Securities
Act were handed down during the fiscal year in two cases in
which the Commission participated as amicus curiae. In Blackwell
v. Bentsen. 31 the federal district court for the Southern District of
Texas dismissed a complaint seeking relief under sections 12 (a) and
17 (a) of the Act for allegedly fraudulent sales of securities. The court
decided that the complaint did not allege facts showing that a "security" had been sold. According to the complaint, defendants sold
plaintiffs 20-acre tracts of purported citrus land in an 800-acre
development in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, along with management contracts pursuant to which defendants undertook to cultivate
and develop the acreage, and harvest and market the crop. I twas
alleged that defendants represented that plaintiffs would be getting
into an 800-acre unit which would be developed uniformly by defendants' citrus experts for the joint benefit of all investors, that defendants
would take care of everything, and that plaintiffs would "only have
to sit back and reap the dividends." The court rejected the contention that "investment contracts" had been sold because, it concluded,
no "common enterprise" was involved. The following circumstances
in this case, the court stated, distinguished it from SEC v. W. J.
Howey Company, 328 U. S. 293 (1946), where the Supreme Court
found an "investment contract" in the sale of citrus acreage coupled
with a service contract: (1) The failure of the instant promoters to
retain any acreage in the development for their own usage, (2) the
larger size of the average parcel sold to investors, (3) the cancelability
of the management contract, (4) the absence of any provision for
pooling the crop of various investors for purposes of marketing, and
(5) the absence in the management contract of provisions for joint
development comparable to the oral representations made to investors.
In its amicus curiae brief the Commission had taken the position that
these differences did not affect the substance of the transactions as
involving "investment contracts." The court ruled also that jurisdiction was lacking under section 12 (2) for the additional reason that,
even had a "security" been involved, the misrepresentations complained of had not been transmitted by means of the mails or instruments of interstate commerce as, it concluded, the section required.
The Commission had urged in its brief that any use of the mails or
interstate facilities in the sale of the security would be sufficient, and
that it was not necessary that these instrumentalities be employed to
convey the misrepresentations. The Commission took the position

that the use of the mails to deliver the securities and to collect payments thereon, as alleged in the complaint, was sufficient. A number
of other interpretative questions were argued but not decided. An
appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was pending at
the close of the fiscal year.32
Wilko v. Swan,33 in which the Commission also participated as
amicus curiae, likewise involved an action under section 12 (2) of the
Act for alleged misrepresentation in the sale of securities. One of the
defendants, aNew York brokerage house, moved to stay the action
under the Federal Arbitration Act in order that the controversy could
be determined by arbitration pursuant to a form agreement which the
plaintiff customer signed before or contemporaneously with the sale.
The United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York denied the stay, ruling, in accord with the view of the Commission, that the controversy was not "referable to arbitration" under
the Federal Arbitration Act. The purpose of Congress to provide a
defrauded purchaser of securities certain litigation advantages under
section 12 (2) which may not be afforded or safeguarded in an arbitration proceeding, and the anti-waiver provisions of section 14 of the
Act, the court held, precluded giving effect to such an agreement for
arbitration.

PART II
ADMINISTRATION OF TIlE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is designed to insure the
maintenance of fair and honest markets in securities transactions both
on the organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets,
which together constitute the Nation's facilities for trading in securities. Accordingly the Act provides in general for the regulation and
control of such transactions and of practices and matters related
thereto, including solicitations of proxies of stockholders and transactions by officers, directors, and principal stockholders. It requires
specifically that information as to the condition of corporations whose
securities are listed on any national securities exchange shall be made
available to the public; and provides for the registration of such securities, such exchanges, brokers and dealers in securities, and associations
of brokers and dealers. It also regulates the use of the Nation's
credit in securities trading. While the authority to issue rules on
such credit is lodged in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, the administration of these rules and of the other provisions
of the Act is vested in the Commission.
REGULATION OF EXCHANGES AND EXCHANGE TRADING
Registration and Exemption of Exchanges

Section 5 of the Act requires each securities exchange within the
United States or subject to its jurisdiction to register with the Commission as a national securities exchange or to apply for exemption
from such registration. Exemption from registration may be granted
to an exchange which has such a limited volume of transactions
effected thereon that, in the opinion of the Commission, it is not
practicable and not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or
for the protection of investors to require its registration. During the
fiscal year no change occurred in the number of exchanges registered
as national securities exchanges or in the number granted exemption
from such registration.
At the close of the 1952 fiscal year the following 16 exchanges were
registered as national securities exchanges:
Boston Stock Exchange
Chicago Board of Trade
Cincinnati Stock Exchange
Detroit Stock Exchange
Los Angeles Stock Exchange
Midwest Stock Exchange
New Orleans Stock Exchange
New York Curb Exchange
New York Stock Exchange

Phi lad e 1phi a-Baltimore S t 0 c k

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Information pertinent to the organization, rules of procedure, trading practices, membership requirements and related matters of each
exchange is contained in its registration or exemption statement, and
any changes which are effected in such information are required to be
reported promptly by the exchanges.
During the year the most significant change reported by the
exchanges in their rules and trading practices was the extension of
their trading session by one half-hour daily. This innovation was
initiated by the New York Curb Exchange whose Board of Governors
approved a plan which provided for the Curb's session to close at 3 :30
P. M. instead of at 3:00 P.M., effective June 2, 1952. The change in
hours, which was adopted on an experimental basis, was the first
which had been effected in New York in approximately eighty years,
and was almost simultaneously adopted by a number of the principal
regional exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange subsequently
determined to effect a similar change in its trading session commencing
on September 29, 1952. These exchanges also adopted a 5-day week
and will remain closed on Saturdays throughout the year, extending
the practice which has been followed by all exchanges during the
summer months in recent years.
Disciplinary Actions by Exchanges Against Members

Each national securities exchange, pursuant to a request of the
Commission, reports to the Commission any action of a disciplinary
nature taken by it against any of its members, or against any partner
or employee of a member, for violation of the Securities Exchange
Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, or of any exchange rule.
During the year three exchanges reported taking disciplinary action
against 26 members, member firms, and partners and employees of
member firms.
The nature of the actions reported included fines ranging from $1 to
$5,000 in 17 cases with total fines aggregating $16,167; suspension and
subsequent expulsion of an individual from exchange membership;
cancellation of the registration of three members as specialists;
withdrawal of the approval of employment of a registered representative; censure of individuals or firms for infractions of the rules; and
warnings against further violations. The disciplinary actions resulted
from violations of exchange rules, principally those pertaining to
handling of customers' accounts, capital requirements, floor trading,
and specialists.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES
Disclosure Accomplished by Registration

Process

In order to make available currently to investors reliable and comprehensive information regarding the affairs of the issuers of securities
listed and registered on a national securities exchange, sections 12
and 13 of the Securities Exchange Act provide for the filing with the
Commission and the exchange of an application for registration, and
annual, quarterly, and other periodic reports, containing certain
specified information. Such applications and reports must be filed
on the forms prescribed by the Commission as appropriate to the
particular type of issuer or security involved, which forms are designed
to disclose pertinent information concerning the issuer, its capital
structure and that of its affiliates, the full terms of its securities, war-

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

33

rants, rights, and options, the control and management of its affairs,
the remuneration of its officers and directors, and financial data, including schedules breaking down the more significant accounts reflected therein.
In general, the Act provides that an application for registration shall
become effective 30 days after the receipt by the Commission of the
exchange's certification of approval thereof, except where the Commission determines it may become effective within a shorter period
of time. It is unlawful under the statute for any member, broker, or
dealer to effect any transaction in any security on any national securities exchange unless it is so registered (except where it has been admitted to unlisted trading privileges, or is exempt).
Examination of Applications and Reports

All applications and reports filed under sections 12 and 13 of the
Securities Exchange Act are processed in much the same manner by
the staff of lawyers, accountants and financial analysts maintained in
the Division of Corporation Finance, as documents filed pursuant to
the Securities Act and certain other statutes administered by the
Commission. This integration of examination functions arising under
various acts is designed to achieve the maximum possible degree of
uniformity, simplicity and effectiveness in the administration of these
inter-related controls.
Thus these documents are processed to determine whether full and
adequate disclosure has been made of the specific types of information
required by the Securities Exchange Act and the Commission's rules
and regulations thereunder. Where examination shows a need for
correcting amendments, these are obtained and examined in the same
manner as the original documents.
The Act does not provide with respect to annual or other periodic
reports a 30-day period after filing before becoming effective, as it
does in the case of applications, and the practical necessities imposed
upon the Commission's curtailed staff have caused a delay in the
examination of these reports.
The results achieved by the Commission's examination of these
applications and reports may be illustrated by reference to a few actual
cases processed during the 1952 fiscal year.
Properly acquired in exchangefor stock.-In an application for listing
the shares of a foreign oil company on an exchange, it was indicated
that certain no par value shares of the registrant had been issued for
property, which property was reflected in the financial statements on
the basis of an arbitrary value of 50 cents for each of the shares issued.
Concurrently, shares of the same issue were sold to yield the registrant
10 and 15 cents per share. Subsequently, the shares were converted
into one quarter of their number with a par value of ten cents per
share. In order to eliminate the overstatement arising from the use
of the arbitrary value, the capital surplus applicable to the shares
issued for property, which resulted from the conversion, was required
to be applied in part to reduce the property accounts to values comparable to the consideration received for shares sold for cash. This
resulted in reducing the original arbitrary value assigned to properties
in the amount of $792,500 to a value of $190,677.42.
Effect of events subsequent to balance sheet date.-A registrant engaged
in the liquor business included in its annual report to this Commission,
232122-53-4

34

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMiSSION

as a note to the financial statements, a disclosure that, within the
month subsequent to the balance sheet date, settlement in a substantial amount had been made in respect of claims against it relating
to its sale several years ago of investments in certain companies.
The accountants' opinion covering the financial statements was signed
approximately seven weeks after the settlement date.
On the basis that the accountants had knowledge of the final status
of the claims prior to the signing of their opinion, the Division of Corporation Finance requested and obtained the filing of revised financial
statements reflecting the settlement.
Provision for employee pension plans.-Regulation
S-X, which
governs the form and content of financial statements required to be
filed as part of registration statements and periodic or annual reports
under various Acts administered by this Commission, requires in
rule 3-19 (e), as revised, a disclosure of certain information as to pension and retirement plans in the general notes to the balance sheet.
A registrant manufacturing certain electrical equipment, with total
consolidated assets of $62,000,000 and equity capital of $48,000,000,
filed its annual report for the year ended December 31, 1950, with an
indication that the information called for by this rule could not be
furnished because studies were in progress to obtain such information
and that an amendment would be filed when the studies were completed. About eleven months later the annual report for the year
ended December 31, 1950, was accordingly amended to set forth in a
footnote to the financial statements a brief description of the essential
provisions of the plans; a statement that the annual contributions to
the trust funds for the benefit of the persons who had retired and for
those eligible for pensions would require amounts ranging from approximately $1,000,000 to $1,650,000 during the years 1951 to 1959,
inclusive; and that statistical studies made by actuaries to estimate the
amounts required to fund potential pensions for those employees not
eligible for pensions at December 31, 1950, would approximate
$19,100,000 to cover the cost for services rendered prior to December
31, 1950, while the current service cost for 1951 and subsequent years
would approximate $1,100,000 annually. It is largely due to the
revision of Form S-X that the staff is able to obtain disclosure of such
significant information in annual reports filed pursuant to section 13.
Statistics of Securities Registered on Exchanges

At the close of the 1952 fiscal year, 2,192 issuers had 3,588 security
issues listed and registered on national securities exchanges. These
securities comprised 2,624 stock issues totaling 3,670,855,266 shares,
and 964 bond issues totaling $21,410,100,351 in principal amount.
These figures reflect net increases for the year of 43 stock issues,
193,290,621 shares, 22 bond issues, and $513,775,782 in principal
amount of bonds over the amounts at the close of the 1951 fiscal year.
During the fiscal year 51 new issuers registered securities under
section 12 of the Act, while such registration of all securities of 47
issuers was terminated.
The following table shows for the fiscal year the number of applications filed under section 12 and of reports filed under section 13 and,
pursuant to undertakings contained in registration statements filed
under the Securities Act, under section 15 (d) of the Securities
Exchange Act:

Securities

Rule X-12A-5 provides a temporary exemption from the registration requirements of section 12 (a) of the Act for securities issued in
substitution for, or in addition to, securities previously listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on a national securities exchange.
The purpose of this exemption is to enable transactions to be lawfully
effected on an exchange in such substituted or additional securities
pending their registration or admission to unlisted trading privileges
on an exchange.
The exchanges filed notifications of admission to trading under this
rule with respect to 151 issues during the year. In numerous instances, the same issue was admitted to trading on more than one
exchange, so that the total admissions to such trading, including
duplications, numbered 230.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Market Value of Stocks

Aggregate market values of stocks traded on the exchanges have
risen from $82 billion at the close of 1948 to $129.2 billion at the
close of 1951. The increase during 1951 was $18.2 billion, compared
with an increase of $29 billion during the preceding 2 years 1949-50.
The net number of stock issues declined from 3,052 at the close of 1948
to 3,032 at the close of 1951.
Market Value of Bonds

Listed United States Government and subdivision bonds have decreased from 73 issues with $114.6 billion market value at the close
of 1948 to 61 issues with $77.3 billion market value at the close of
1951. All other bond issues on the stock exchanges had market
value of $18.1 billion at the close of 1948 and $19.4 billion at the
close of 1951, despite a moderate decline in number of issues from
998 to 973 during the three years.
New York Stock Exchange

All stocks listed on the N ew York Stock Exchange as of December
31, 1951, numbered 1,495 and were reported to have a market value
of $109.5 billion. An historic record was made when, on March 1,
1951, the market value of the then listed 1,476 stocks was reported
to have passed the $100 billion mark. The 1929 peak had been
around $90 billion for 1,280 stocks and the subsequent lowest point
occurred in 1932, when the 1,253 stocks then listed were reported to
have a market value of less than $16 billion. By June 30, 1952, New
York Stock Exchange stock listings numbered 1,514 and were reported
to have a $114.5 billion market value.
All bonds listed on the N ew York Stock Exchange as of December
31, 1951, numbered 918 and were reported to have a $95.6 billion
market value, or 98.9 percent of the total market value of bonds on
all United States stock exchanges. All of the 61 listed United States
Government and subdivision bonds with a market value of $77.3
billion and 857 other bond issues having $18.3 billion market value
were on this exchange. The latter included 613 domestic company
issues with a market value of $16.6 billion, 231 foreign issues with
$1.3 billion, and 13 International Bank for Reconstruction and Development issues with $0.4 billion. The figures had increased somewhat by June 30, 1952, when all listed bonds numbered 934 with a
reported market value of $96 billion.
The face value of domestic company bonds listed on this exchange
as of June 30, 1952, amounting to $18.3 billion, was practically identical with the peak of $18.4 billion established September 1, 1931, and
represents a recovery from a low of less than $14 billion in 1945.
Face values of foreign government and foreign company bonds on the
N ew York Stock Exchange have declined steadily over the years from
$19.7 billion in 1931 (including about $10 billion British Government
bonds) to $1.8 billion as of June 30, 1952.
New York Curh Exchange

The N ew York Curb Exchange reports the number and aggregate
market values of the securities admitted to trading thereon annually,
commencing December 31, 1936, when it showed 1,050 stocks with
$14.8 billion market value. At the close of 1951, it showed 777 stocks
with $16.5 billion market value. However, if the holdings of Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) of two stocks traded on the Curb-

Creole Petroleum Corporation and Humble Oil & Refining Companywere subtracted, the remaining market values would have been $14.1
billion at the close of 1936 and $12.7 billion at the close of 195J.l
During the three years 1949-1951, inclusive, the New York Stock
Exchange listed 37 stocks with a market value of over $2 billion at
time of listing, which stocks or their predecessors had theretofore been
on the Curb. In the same period, the Curb listed and commenced
trading in 74 stocks with about $1 billion market value, some of which
had theretofore been on its unlisted trading roster.
The number of bond issues on the Curb was reported at 438 on
December 31, 1936, with a $5.4 billion market value. At the close
of 1951, the number was 63, with a $0.9 billion market value, and
20 suspended foreign issues for which no value was reported. During the three years 1949-1951, inclusive, the Curb gained 8 new
listings of bonds with a $0.3 billion market value and lost 9 bond
issues with a $0.2 billion market value to listing on the New York
Stock Exchange.
Other Stock Exchanges

Originally, stock exchanges consisted for the most part of local
members trading in local securities. There have been over 100
exchanges in this country down the years. At least 30 were functioning in 1929. At present 20 remain, consisting of the two New York
and the 18 so-called "regional" exchanges.
The identity of issues on the regional and the N ew York exchanges
has become so extensive that only the smaller regional exchages still
accomplish most of their trading in their own local issues."
I At the close of 1936, Creole and Humhle
were collectively worth $1 billion, of which $0 7 billion was
owned by Standard.
At the close of 1951, their market values aggregated $4.7 billion, of which $3.8 billion
was owned by Standard.
S This subject
was referred to in the 15th Annual Report (fiscal year 1949), p. 37, Where, following a table
of total market value olall securities on exchanges as of December 31,1948, the statement was made that "SIX
of the regional exchanges acconnted for over 00 percent of the dollar volume of stock transactions

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

The relationship between the exchanges dates back to events such
as the establishment of stations on high points across New Jersey,
from which semaphore signals in daytime and light flashes at night
were observed by telescopes and information on stock prices was thus
conveyed in as short a time as ten minutes between New York and
Philadelphia. After 1844, the telegraph succeeded the semaphore.
The telephone appeared after 1878, with first cross-continent conversations around 1915. Stock ticker service from New York was
extended to Pacific Coast points around 1925. Turret boards and
teletype rounded out the communication facilities which have been
instrumental in changing the securities business from local to countrywide aspect.
The regional exchanges originally developed local issues to the
point where they gravitated to the New York exchanges, and at an
early date they also drew issues from the New York exchanges in
which to trade locally. On the Boston Stock Exchange, for example,
the governing committee was authorized by resolutions adopted prior
to 1880 to permit trading in any securities listed on either the New
York or Philadelphia stock exchanges. In 1932 the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange adopted the ruIe that no securities couId be admitted
to unlisted trading which were not listed on the N ew York Stock
Exchange, N ew York Curb Exchange, Boston Stock Exchange, Pittsburgh Stock Exchange, or Chicago Stock Exchange. By 1928 the
Los Angeles and San Francisco stock exchanges (and their curbs) had
turned from the "call" to the "post" system, introduced continuous sessions, and installed odd-lot dealer mechanisms, thereby increasing trading in the New York issues.
The consolidation of industry into units of national importance and
the growing diffusion of their shares available for trading on both the
N ew York and regional exchanges have brought about a heavy concentration of trading volume in a small proportion of the total available
stock issues. At the close of 1951, 158 stocks listed on the New York
Stock Exchange were also available for trading on 4 or more of the
8 leading regional exchanges, and the reported volume during 1951
in these 158 stocks constituted over 40 percent of the reported volume
on the New York Stock Exchange and over 40 percent of that on the
8 leading regional exchanges. These exchanges included Boston,
Cincinnati, Detroit, Los Angeles, Midwest, Philadelphia-Baltimore,
Pittsburgh, and San Francisco, whose aggregate dollar volume of
stock transactions during 1951 was 98.6 percent of the total for all
18 regional exchanges.
The number of stocks admitted to trading on one or more regional
exchanges but not on either New York exchange has dropped from
814 at the close of 1948 to 760 at the close of 1951. During this
period, the market value of all stocks on all the exchanges rose from
$82 billion to $129.2 billion, while those solely on the regional exchanges remained a little above $3 billion. New single listings in
this latter category during 1951 amounted to 12 stocks with an aggregate market value of about $22,000,000. Bond issues only on
regional exchanges have dropped during the 3 years from 50 to 33,
with a remaining aggregate market value of about $160,000,000.
New listings admitted practically simuItaneously on a New York
exchange and one or more regional exchanges during 1951 had over
$0.5 billion market value for stocks and $0.3 billion for bonds. The

EIGHTEENTH

39

ANNUAL REPORT

principal component of the latter was an issue of American Telephone
& Telegraph 3%% convertible debenture bonds due in 1963, which
became listed on the New York Stock Exchange and 5 regional exchanges.
During 1951, various regional exchanges obtained listings of stocks
already listed on some other exchange (principally the New York
Stock Exchange) with an aggregate market value in excess of $4 billion.
The most prolific source of new trading material for the regional
exchange lies in the admission to unlisted trading thereon of Issues
listed on some other exchange (principally the New York Stock
Exchange). During 1951, over $10 billion market value of such listed
stocks was newly admitted to unlisted trading on one or more of the
regional exchanges.
A summary of new issues on the regional exchanges during 1951,
showing outstanding shares and market values as of December 31,
1951, is as follows:

admitted to unlisted trading on some other regional exchange or

six exchanges as of June 30, 1952, are not included in the above table.
Securities Available {or Listing

On January 9, 1950, the Commission transmitted to the Congress
a report recommending an amendment to the Securities Exchange
Act which would extend to investors in unregistered securities the
protections afforded with respect to registered securities by the Act
relating to the availability of public information, the provision of
data necessary for intelligent exercise of the right to vote, and regulation of insiders' short-term trading. A survey at the time disclosed
that there were then about 1,800 domestic issuers with $3 million
assets and 300 stockholders as minima, having stocks quoted over the
counter with an aggregate market value of approximately $19 billion
to which the amendment might apply. The total included unlisted
stocks traded on the stock exchanges, which have been a prolific source
of new listings, and excluded bank and investment company stocks,
which are not usually regarded as listing material. The $19 billion
was equivalent to one-quarter of the $76 billion market value of all
stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange on January 1, 1950.
A more recent study indicates that as of August 15, 1951, quoted
stocks not listed on any exchange of utility and industrial companies
having registrations under the Securities Act and filing reports under
section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act, had a market value in
excess of $6 billion. In other words, a sizeable fraction of the overthe-counter stock values represents securities of companies reporting
the same periodic data as do listed companies. There were close to
500 common stock issues with an aggregate market value of $5 billion,
and over 300 preferred stocks with an aggregate market value of $1
billion. Of the common stocks, 170 issues with $3.1 billion market
value had over 2,000 reported holders per issue. There were 267
quoted utility stocks with $2.7 billion and 528 quoted industrial stocks
with $3.3 billion aggregate market values.
It appears that less than 2 percent of the corporations of this
country (principally the larger ones) have stocks which are adequately quoted, and that the "market value" of stocks of the remaining 98 percent or more can be only a statistical abstraction built
on ratios and synthesis.
Prospective listings, however, are by no means confined to present
actively quoted over-the-counter securities. A prolific source of new
listings lies in issues newly coming on the market. These include new
issues of already listed companies, initial stock offerings by longestablished and theretofore privately owned companies, stocks of
operating companies previously owned by holding companies, and
stocks in new speculative enterprises, such as Canadian oil fields,
among others.
VOLUME OF SECURITIES

TRADED ON EXCHANGES

Stock Volume

Fluctuations in the number of shares sold on the exchanges (including stocks, warrants and rights) have been very great. A peak of 962
million shares was reached in 1936, from which there was a year-by-

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

year decline to 221 million in 1942. There followed a rise to 803
million in 1946, a relapse to an average of 534 million per annum for
1947-49, inclusive, and a rise to 893 million in 1950. In 1951, share
sales declined slightly to 864 million, followed by a further shading off
to around 382 million during the half year ending June 30, 1952.
The dollar volume of share sales showed corresponding fluctuations.
A peak of $23.6 billion in 1936 contrasted with a mere $4.3 billion in
1942. There followed a rise to $18.8 billion in 1946, a decline to an
average of $11.8 billion per annum for 1947-49, inclusive, and a rise to
$21.8 billion in 1950. In 1951, the dollar volume of share sales declined
slightly to $21.3 billion, followed by a further shading off to around
$9.2 billion during the half year ending June 30, 1952.
Notwithstanding these great fluctuations in number and dollar
volume of share sales, the relative trading as between the two New
York exchanges and the remaining regional exchanges has maintained a remarkable constancy:

At times in the past, the New York Curb Exchange and some of
the regional exchanges have experienced substantial amounts of bond
volume. The New York Stock Exchange, however, has remained
the focal point for bond trading on the stock exchanges, showing over
96% of such trading during 1951 in terms of market value.

SPECIAL OFFERINGS ON EXCHANGES

Rule X-10B-2 under the Securities Exchange Act permits special
offerings of comparatively large blocks of securities to be made on
a national securities exchange provided such offerings are effected
pursuant to a plan which has been filed with and approved by the
Commission. A security may be the subject of a special offering
when it has been determined that the auction market on the floor
of the exchange cannot absorb a particular block within a reasonable
period of time without unduly disturbing the current price of the
security. A special offering of a security is made at a fixed price
consistent with the existing auction market price of the security, and
members acting as brokers for public buyers are paid a special commission by the seller which ordinarily exceeds the regular brokerage
commission. Buyers of the security are not charged any commission
on their purchases and obtain the security at the net price of the
offering.
Each of the nine exchanges with a special offering plan in effect has
been requested to report certain information to the Commission on
each offering effected on the exchange under the plan. These reports
show the following data for 1951 and the first six months of 1952:

REPORT

SECONDARY DISTRIBUTIONS APPROVED BY EXCHANGES

A "seoondary distribution," as the term is used in this section, is a.
distribution over the counter of a comparatively large block of a previously issued and outstanding security listed or admitted to trading
on an exchange. Such distributions are resorted to when it has been
determined that it would not be in the best interest of the various
parties involved to sell the shares on an exchange in the regular way or
by special offering. The distributions generally are made after the
close of exchange trading. It is the general practice of exchanges to
require members to obtain their approval before participation in such
secondary distributions. The following table shows the number and
dollar volume of secondary distributions which exchanges have approved for member participation and reported to the Commission
for 1951 and the first six months of 1952:

UNLISTED TRADING PRIVILEGES ON EXCHANGES
Number of Issues Admitted to Unlisted Trading

Securities are said to be traded on an unlisted basis on the stock
exchanges when the admission to trading is approved by an exchange
without any application for listing and registration by the issuer.
Such admissions to unlisted trading are governed by section 12 (f) of
the Securities Exchange Act, whose respective clauses are referred to
below in the text and accompanying tables.

46

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

In the tables, stock issues admitted to unlisted trading on the
exchanges prior to March 1, 1934, are designated as "Clause 1." The
table divides them into two categories: those listed and registered on a
stock exchange other than that where they are admitted to unlisted
trading, and those not listed and registered on any exchange. Stock
issues designated as "Clause 2" are those admitted to unlisted trading
pursuant to grants of applications by stock exchanges, the first of
which was in April 1937; which grants are based on an existing listing
and registration on some other stock exchange. Stock issues designated
as "Clause 3" are those admitted to unlisted trading pursuant to
grants of applications by stock exchanges conditioned upon the
availability of information with respect to the stocks which is substantially equivalent to that filed in the case of listed issues. The
following table, for comparative purposes, also shows the number of
listed stock issues on each stock exchange.

Volume of Unlisted Trading in Stocks

The reported volume of stock traded on the stock exchanges on an
unlisted basis during the calendar year 1951was in excess of 60,000,000
shares, or between 7 and 8 percent of the total 1951 share volume on
the exchanges. Of this volume, about 27,000,000 shares were in
issues listed and registered on some other exchange than that where
the unlisted trading occurred, and 33,000,000 shares were in issues

The amounts shown are as reported annually by the stock exchanges or other reporting agencies, and are in some cases less than

figures, which exclude most odd lots and other items not reported

rights, and are subject to adjustments on account of reporting errors
and omissions.
Applications for Unlisted Trading Privileges

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The number of different issues involved is less than the total shown
in the table because some of the issues were the subject of applications
by more than one exchange.
Changes in Securities Admitted to Unlisted Trading Privileges

In the event some minor change occurs in the rights of a security
previously admitted to unlisted trading privileges on an exchange.
so that the security remains essentially the same security as before,
unlisted privileges may be continued upon compliance with the provisions of the Commission's rule X-12F -2.
Clause (a) of that rule merely requires written notification by
the exchange to the Commission in the case of any change in the
title of a security or in the name of an issuer or in the outstanding
amount of the security or in the par value, dividend or interest rate,
or maturity date. During the fiscal year the usual large number of
notifications of such changes were received by the Commission.
With respect to a change in a security previously admitted to
unlisted trading privileges, other than the changes enumerated in
the preceding paragraph, Clause (b) of rule X-12F-2 provides for
an application to the Commission for a determination whether or
not such security is substantially the same after such change as
the security previously admitted to unlisted trading privileges.
Under this regulation, the New York Curb Exchange filed an application for a determination by the Commission that the new Class A
Common Stock, $2.00 Par Value, and the new Class B Common Stock,
$2.00 Par Value, of The Parker Pen Company constitute substantially
the same security as the single class of $5.00 Par Value Common
Stock previously outstanding and admitted to unlisted trading on
this exchange. In view of the fact that only the new Class A Stock
would have the voting rights previously enjoyed by the single class
of stock, and that there were two separate issues instead of one, the
Commission held that only the new Class A Common Stock was
substantially equivalent to the previously outstanding common stock.
As both of the new issues were registered and listed on the Midwest
Stock Exchange, the N ew York Curb Exchange was able to file a
separate application for unlisted trading privileges in the Class B
Stock under Clause 2 of section 12 (f) of the Act. It is the policy
of the Commission to have applications filed under Clause 2 of section
12 (f) rather than paragraph (b) of rule X-12F-2 whenever an application properly can be filed under the former provision.
In another case, the N ew York Curb Exchange filed an application
under Clause (b) of rule X-12F-2 for a determination that voting
trust certificates representing no par value common stock of Wagner
Baking Corporation, after an amendment extending the voting
trust agreement from 1951 to 1961, were substantially equivalent
to the voting trust certificates representing the same security prior
to the extension of the life of the voting trust agreement. The Commission granted this application, thereby permitting the exchange
to continue unlisted trading in these certificates.
A somewhat similar case was an application of the N ew York Curb
Exchange with respect to bonds issued by Guantanamo & Western
Railroad Company. In this case the changes involved extension of
the maturity date from 1958 to 1970 and reduction of the interest
rate from 6% to 4% as well as a provision for annual retirement of

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

49

1% of tBe amount of bonds outstanding.
This application was
granted by the Commission.
In another case under the same regulation the Commission granted
an application of the Boston Stock Exchange for a determination
that shares of no par value common stock of St. Louis-San Francisco
Railway Company are substantially equivalent to voting trust
certificates representing these shares, which certificates had been
admitted to unlisted trading privileges upon applicant exchange prior
to the termination of the voting trust.
In another case under the same regulation, the N ew York Curb
Exchange made an application for a determination by the Commission
that American depositary receipts issued by the Guaranty Trust
Company of N ew York representing Ordinary Shares, Par Value
3s. 6d., of Burma Mines Limited, and other American depositary
receipts issued by the same bank, representing ordinary shares, par
value Is., of Non Ferrous Metal Products, Limited, were substantially
equivalent to previously outstanding American depositary receipts
issued by the same bank and representing capital stock, par value
9 rupees, of Burma Corporation, Limited, the predecessor of the other
two corporations. The Commission decided that the new depositary
receipts representing the issues of the two new corporations were not
substantially equivalent to the depositary receipts representing the
old stock of the predecessor corporation. The applicant exchange
thereupon made application to withdraw its previous application for
substantial equivalence, and obtained an agreement from the new
issuers to register and list the new securities on that exchange.
DEUSTING OF SECURITIES FROM EXCHANGES
Securities Delisted by Application

During the fiscal year, a number of applications were filed with the
Commission by various national securities exchanges and issuers of
listed securities, pursuant to section 12 (d) of the Securities Exchange
Act and rule X-12D2-1 thereunder, to strike securities from exchange
registration and listing.
The Los Angeles Stock Exchange and the San Francisco Stock Exchange each filed such an application with respect to the capital stock
of Republic Petroleum Company! which had been dissolved and was in
The MIdwest Stock Exchange filed applicaprocess of liquidation,"
tions to strike the common stock of Herder's, Incorporated, and the
common stock of St. Louis Car Company on the ground that the
ownership of each of these securities had become so concentrated
that there was inadequate public distribution and exchange trading
to warrant a public auction market on a national securities exchange .â€¢
The San Francisco Stock Exchange filed an application with respect
to the capital stock of North American Oil Consolidated, asserting
that all but 3,000 shares of the approximately 271,000 shares previously
outstanding in the hands of the public had been purchased by one
shareholder, following which the issuer had sold its properties and
approved a voluntary plan of dissolution," The Los Angeles Stock

condition of this company, as disclosed by its annual report to the
Commission was so questionable as to require that its exchange
trading privileges be terminated for the protection of investors," All
of the foregoing applications were granted by the Commission.
The Boston Stock Exchange filed an application to strike from
registration and listing the preferred stock of Lamson Corporation of
Delaware under the following circumstances.
The issuing corporation
had reclassified this security by adding the word It prior" to the name
of the stock. In the view of the Commission, based on numerous
precedents, this small change in the name of the security did not make
it a new security for the purpose of registration under the Securities
Exchange Act, with the result that the same security under its new
name continued to be fully registered on the Boston Stock Exchange.
However, that exchange, in accordance with the practice of other
national securities exchanges, considered that the change in name of
the security constituted it a new security. Since the issuer declined
to comply with the listing requirements of the exchange, including
payment of a new listing fee, with respect to the changed security,
the unusual situation existed of a security which in the view of the
Commission was fully registered on the exchange but in the view of
the exchange was not. When the issuer declined to initiate proceedings
to terminate the registration of this security, the exchange made application to strike it from registration, and the application was granted
by the Commission. 7
Allied Products Corporation filed an application with the Commission to withdraw its common stock from registration and listing on
the Midwest Stock Exchange on the ground that no transaction in
that stock had been effected on that exchange since 1947. The Commission granted this application with the understanding
that the
security would continue to be fully registered and listed on the New
York Curb Exchange.t
Hunt Foods of Ohio, Inc. also filed application with the Commission to withdraw its common stock from registration and listing on the Midwest Stock Exchange on the ground that
another corporation had acquired 99.47% of the total number of
shares outstanding, leaving only 237 other shares outstanding in the
hands of only seven shareholders, and that this represented an insufficient number of shares and shareholders to warrant the continuance of exchange trading, which had virtually ceased. On the basis of
these facts the Commission ~anted this application."
A number of companies registered with the Commission as diversified
open-end management investment companies under section 8 (a) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 filed applications with the Commission to withdraw securities from exchange registration and listing.
The reasons for withdrawal included the fact that the rules of the N ational Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., as well as provisions of
the Investment Company Act of 1940, restricted exchange trading in
this type of security to such an extent as to make further registration
and listing unwarranted.l"

upon tender to the issuer, substantially all transactions were conducted

All of these applications were granted by the Commission.
Securities DeUsted by Notification

Securities which have been paid at maturity, redeemed or retired
in full, or become exchangeable for other securities, may be removed
from listinlJ)~~d registration on a national securities exchange by the
exchange
.
a notification with the Commission to that effect.
The removal of the security becomes effective automatically after the
interval of time prescribed by rille X-12D2-2 (a). The exchanges
filed notifications under this rille effecting the removal of 115 separate
issues. In some instances the same issue was removed from more than
one exchange, so that the total number of removals, including duplications, was 142. Successor issues to those removed became listed and
registered on exchanges in many cases.
Effective May 26, 1952, amendments were adopted to clarify the
provisions of rille X-12D2-2 (a); to prescribe a new Form 25 for
notification of removal, simplifying its preparation and assuring that
the prescribed information is furnished; and to expand the rule so as
to provide for the removal of securities from listing and registration
when funds for their redemption, retirement or payment have been
deposited with the paying agency, appropriate notice has been given,
and the funds have been made available to security holders.
In accordance with the provisions of rille X-12D2-1 (d), the New
York Curb Exchange removed 5 issues from listing_and registration
when they became listed and registered on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Securities Removed From Listing on Exempted Exchanges

A security may be removed from listing on an exempted exchange
merely upon notification by such an exchange to the Commission
setting forth the reasons for such removal. During the fiscal year
the Richmond Stock Exchange removed two issues which had been
called for redemption, and the Colorado Springs Stock Exchange removed one issue due to the liquidation of the issuer.
MANIPULATION AND STABILIZATION
The Stock Markets

During the fiscal year both the S. E. C. Composite Index of weekly
closing prices of common stocks and the Dow-Jones Composite A.verage advanced from the low of the year during the first week to the
high of the year during the last week. The S. E. C. Composite Index
was 174.3 (the low) for the week ended June 30, 1951, and was 199.3
(the high) for the week ended July 5, 1952. The Dow-Jones Composite Average was 86.92 (the low) on June 29, 1951, and 106.13 (the
high) on June 30, 1952.
The greatest decline in stock prices during the calendar year 1951
occurred in June following the Russian proposal for a cease-fire in
Korea. A recovery in prices started on July 2, 1951, and continued
until October 15, 1951, when the stock market reached a 21-year high.

The market then declined until late November when a year-end rise
began and continued through January 1952. This was followed by
a decline in February, a rise in March, a decline in April, and a rise
beginning in May, which continued to the end of the fiscal year and
brought prices to the highest average reached in 21 years.
During the fiscal year considerable public interest was evidenced
in oil and mining shares generated partly by continuing publicity
given to reports of discoveries of new oil fields and mineral deposits.
Interest in rail stocks also developed in the last few months of the
fiscal year.
The international character of the markets was a notable feature.
Activity in dual listings on Canadian and United States exchanges
increased sharply, and many new securities were so listed. Accordingly, the Commission instituted surveillance over the Canadian as
well as the domestic market for these securities. When a spectacular
price movement occurred in Molybdenum Corporation of America.
listed on the N ew York Curb Exchange, investigation disclosed that
Canadian trading (beyond our jurisdiction) was an important factor
in this market activity. Other investigations disclosed active trading
in other securities originating in European countries.
Manipulation

The manipulation of securities markets by practices which are
deceptive or otherwise improper is one of the evils which the Securities Exchange Act was expressly designed to prevent. Section 9 of
this Act describes and prohibits certain forms of manipulative activity
in securities registered on a national securities exchange, which were
extensively used prior to passage of the Act. These include wash
sales and matched orders, if effected for the purpose of creating a false
or misleading appearance of trading activity or with respect to the
market for any such security; a series of transactions in which the
price of such security is raised or depressed, or in which the appearance
of active trading is created for the purpose of inducing purchases or
sales by others; circulation by a broker, dealer, seller, or buyer, or by
a person who receives a consideration from a broker, dealer, seller, or
buyer, of information concerning market operations conducted for
a rise or a decline; and the making of material false and misleading
statements by brokers, dealers, sellers, and buyers, or the omission
of material information regarding securities, for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales. Sections 10 and 15 of the Act empower the
Commission to adopt rules and regulations to define and prohibit the
use of such new forms of manipulative activity in securities, whether
registered or unregistered, on an exchange, as the Commission might
encounter from time to time.
Pursuant to its statutory authority, the Commission has adopted
rules and regulations to aid it in carrying out the expressed will of
Congress. The three above-mentioned sections, as augmented by
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, are aimed at freeing
our securities markets from artificial influence and maintaining fair
and honest markets where prices are established by supply and demand.
Manipulation of securities prices in the years previous to the enactment of the Securities Exchange Act, resulted in loss to the public of
millions of dollars annually. Pool operations were rampant.
A
pool, generally speaking, consisted of a group of men who, acting

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

53

in concert, bought stock in the market or secured options to buy
for the purpose of later selling the stock at a higher price. To do
this they created fictitious market activity and raised prices in a
stock to deceive the purchaser into believing that its quoted price
represented what investors actually thought the stock was worth.
The Senate Banking and Currency Committee in its investigations
disclosed that in 1929 alone there were 105 pools in securities listed
on the New York Stock Exchange.
In the early days of the Commission's existence, some market
operators attempted to continue their manipulative activities.
The
Commission uncovered these activities and caused the imposition of
various penalties upon them including expulsion from exchanges,
revocation of broker-dealer registrations, fines and jail sentences.
Years of experience have enabled the Commission to improve substantially its techniques of detection and enforcement.
It has become
increasingly evident that if the public is to receive adequate protection
the Commission's enforcement activities, so far as possible, must he
preventive rather than punitive.
The Commission therefore operates
on the premise that manipulation should be, and in most cases can be,
suppressed at its inception.
Losses suffered by the public are seldom
recoverable, even though the perpetrator of the fraud is brought to
justice. Accordingly, it is more important to prevent a possible
violation than to allow unlawful market operations to continue until
it appears that sufficient evidence for a successful prosecution is
available.
To carry out the Commission's policy of preventive action against
manipulation, any unusual market activity (either in price or volume)
of securities traded on the New York Stock Exchange or the New
York Curb Exchange is observed as it appears on the stock tickers of
these exchanges in the Commission's headquarters.
A financial news
ticker also enables the staff to keep abreast of spot news items. This
close market observation is supplemented by a careful study of the
stock exchange quotation sheets and the next day's newspapers.
The
quotation sheets of regional exchanges and, because of many dual
listings, newspaper reports of three Canadian exchanges are similarly
reviewed. Activity in over-the-counter issues is examined as it is
reported "by a national quotation service. Charts are kept on all
securities which have a regularly quoted market.
Information assembled concerning all charted securities includes
not only data reflecting the market action, but also the latest news
items, earnings figures, dividends, options and other facts which
might explain price and volume changes in the individual issues as
well as of too industry group with which the issue is associated.
Trained analysts read the Wall Street Journal, Standard and Poor's,
Moody's, and many other financial publications, and record any items
that might be reflected in the market price of these securities. Reports
required by the acts administered by the Commission from corporations or their officers, directors and 10% stockholders and from
registered broker-dealers are reviewed, and important information
contained therein is recorded on the security's weekly price and
volume record. The dates of public releases of any important news
items regarding a company are carefully recorded, since unusual
activity ill a security prior to the publication of news might indicate

54

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

that insiders were using secret information to their own advantage,
while the same activity after publication might well be a natural public
reaction to the news.
As the 1952 fiscal year began, a weekly review was being made
of more than 7,600 charts which were maintained on practically all
securities listed on exchanges and the most active issues traded over
the counter. Quotations for a varying group of about 3,500 additional
less active over-the-counter securities were being reviewed at longer
intervals. By the end of the fiscal year, however, budgetary restrictions forced a reduction in the Commission's expert force to such an
extent that the number of securities reviewed weekly had to be reduced
to some 3,300 with some 4,500 examined on a monthly basis and the
balance over longer periods.
The Commission is considerably concerned that such delayed and
infrequent review may defeat the Commission's policy of prompt
preventive action and reduce the protection against manipulation
that the public has come to expect.
At the inception of any unusual market activity in a security all
pertinent information is reexamined and a conclusion drawn as to
the necessity for an investigation. Once decided upon, the investigation is quickly begun. It has been found that many would-be
violators of the regulations prohibiting manipulation have been
halted by these prompt inquiries by the Commission. The fact that
trading in a given security is under investigation is kept confidential
by the Commission. This is done to avoid interference with the
legitimate functioning of the markets and to prevent any unfair
reflection upon individuals or securities being investigated. So effectively has this confidential approach been maintained that on occasion
the Commission has received criticism for failure to investigate a
particular case which in fact already was under investigation. However, while the general public is not informed when an investigation
is being made, any persons conducting unusual market activity in a
security will soon become aware of the Commission's inquiry and
discontinue unlawful operations. In its investigations the Commission
has received excellent cooperation from the stock exchanges and from
brokers and dealers.
When questionable market activity is limited to a brief period
during a day's trading, or even an entire day's transactions, a simple
inquiry addressed to an exchange or broker by the Commission's
nearest Regional Office may result in a satisfactory explanation. If
the activity cannot be explained, an investigation is conducted by the
Regional Office located nearest the exchange or market in which the
transactions were effected.
Investigations take two forms. The "quiz" or preliminary investigation is designed to detect and discourage incipient manipulation
by a prompt determination of the reasons for unusual market behavior. When the "quiz" discloses no violations of the anti-manipulative provisions of the securities acts the investigation is closed. If
possible violations of the securities acts or violations of other statutes
are revealed, the information obtained in the "quiz" is made available
to the proper division of the Commission or to the appropriate Federal
or State authorities for any action that they might consider necessary.
When facts are uncovered which require more intensive investigation,
formal orders are issued by the Commission. In a formal investiga-

tion, members of the Commission staff are empowered to subpena
pertinent material and to take testimony under oath. In the course
of such investigations, data on purchases and sales over substantial
periods of time are compiled and trading operations involving large
numbers of securities are often scrutinized. The following table
shows the number of "quizzes" and formal investigations in the fiscal
year 1952, and the number closed or completed during the period:

The markets for securities about to be sold to the public are watched
very closely. In this connection the markets for the 1,494 issues in
the amount of $210,672,956 offered under Letters of Notification
pursuant to Regulation A under the Securities Act were carefully
checked for improper pricing or market grooming. Over 450 other
securities were kept under special daily observation during the 1952
fiscal year for periods of 10 to 90 days, largely because a public offering
under a registration statement was proposed with the right to stabilize
reserved by the underwriter or issuer.
Stabilization

Wbile manipulation of securities prices is prohibited by the Securities Exchange Act, certain other transactions that inject artificial
activity into the market are permitted.
These are permissible only
when used to prevent or retard a price change, usually a decline, when
securities are being offered. Stabilization means the maintenance of
a price independently reached in the market, and any attempt to
raise or lower the market, under the label of stabilizing, is prohibited.
All stabilizing transactions are kept under careful surveillance by the
Commission but here again its enforcement activities are predominantly of a preventive nature. Reports on stabilizing activities are
required in most instances, thus enabling the staff to observe violations
as they occur as well as to assist the registrant or underwriter both
before and during an offering.
The Commission recognizes that the investment industry must
necessarily change its methods with changing conditions in order that
it may achieve its primary function, which is to supply industry with
the capital it needs. Over the years the Commission has considered
any new practices in the light of the public interest and has amended
its policies to permit those changes which seem desirable.
Of 664 registration statements filed with the Commission during the
fiscal year, 438 contained a statement of intention to stabilize in
order to facilitate the offerings covered by such registration state-

56

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

ments. Each of these latter filings was examined critically as to the
propriety of the proposed method of distribution, market support, and
full disclosure thereof, and suggestions were made to the issuers before
the offering as to any contemplated course of action which might lead
to violations of law.
Stabilizing transactions were made in offerings of stock issues
aggregating 33,649,899 shares with an aggregate public offering price
of $743,651,363. Bonds stabilized had a total face amount of
$77,000,000. In connection with these and other offerings, 353
conferences were held by the staff with representatives of issuers and
underwriters to assist them to avoid violations of the acts and rules
relating to manipulation and stabilization as well as disclosure.
The required stabilizing reports are filed daily and show all stabilizing transactions.
During the fiscal year, 11,547 reports of these
transactions were received and filed, The Commission's immediate
review of these filings made it possible to advise several underwriters
that their activities might lead to violation", Thus the underwriters
were saved from costly embarrassment and public losses were prevented.
The following table is a summary of the above figures and shows the
substantial increase in stabilizing operations in fiscal year 1952 as
compared with fiscal year 1951:

It is the Commission's experience that issuers and underwriters
place great value on the immediate service which the Commission is
able to render them by being at all times available to give responsible
advice as to proper stabilizing techniques in the offerings of securities
and to assist in their sincere efforts to avoid violations of the Acts
administered by the Commission.
SECURITY TRANSACTIONS OF CORPORATION INSIDERS
Purpose of Regulation

Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act has two basic objectives:
(1) To make available to public stockholders information as to the
prospects of their company which may be implicit in the security
transactions of insiders; and (2) to prevent insiders from unfairly
using inside information in security trading.
Reports of Transactions and Holdings

For the purpose of affording to the public information as to transactions and holdings of insiders, section 16 (a) provides that every
person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than
10 percent of any class of any equity security which is listed and registered on a national securities exchange, or who is an officer or a director
of the issuer of such security, shall file with the exchange and the
Commission, at the time of the registration of such security or within
10 days after the time he became such beneficial owner, officer or
director, a statement of the amount of all equity securities of such
issuer of which he is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner, and

EIGHTEiENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

57

within 10 days after the close of each month thereafter in which any
change occurs in his beneficial ownership, a statement indicating such
changes and his holdings at the close of the month. Sections 17 (a)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and 30 (f) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, respectively require that similar
ownership and transaction reports be filed by officers and directors
of registered public utility holding companies and officers, directors,
principal security holders, members of advisory boards, investment
advisers and affiliated persons of investment advisers of registered
closed-end investment companies.
Publication

of Information

Reported by Insiders

In order that the information contained in these reports may be
made available to the vast majority of public stockholders who are
not in a position to examine the reports at the Commission's office
in Washington or at the various exchanges, the Commission summarizes and publishes the data contained in the reports in a monthly
Official Summary of Security Transactions and Holdings, which is
widely circulated among individual investors, security dealers, investment advisers, newspaper correspondents and other interested
persons. Beginning in August 1951 free distribution of this Official
Summary was discontinued as a matter of necessary economy. Distribution is now handled by the Superintendent of Documents,
Government Printing Office, at a subscnption price of $2.50 per year.
A substantial number of the persons on the Commission's free list
immediately subscribed for the Summary, and the subscription list
has been steadily growing since that time.
Coincidentally, various changes were made in the Commission's
techniques of copy preparation which greatly improved the appearance
and readability of the publication and substantially reduced its
printing costs.
Volume of Reports Filed and Examined

By the close of fiscal year 1952 more than 372,000 reports had been
filed under the three statutes by over 52,000 persons identified with
the control and management of American industrial, utility and
investment companies. While over the course of the past 18 years
there has been considerable turnover in the identity of these corporation insiders--due to purchases or sales of stock, or death, on the part
of principal security holders, and to election, appointment, promotion,
resignation or death on the part of directors or officers-approximately
25,000 'persons presently have corporate relationships by virtue of
which they are subject to the reporting requirements. During the
1952 fiscal year total filings of reports by these persons substantially
exceeded 20,000.
These reports are examined for compliance with the statutory
standards and the Commission's related rules and interpretative
opinions by a specialized group maintained in the Division of Corporation Finance. Procedures employed in doing so are necessarily
integrated closely with the Commission's examination of related items
of information in documents required to be filed by corporations
registered under various Acts administered by the Commission. The
stock holdings of nominees 'for election as director which are disclosed in proxy statements under Regulation X-14 illustrate such
related data.

in fiscal year 1952 and is discussed below in the section on litigation
under the Securities Exchange Act.
Preventing Unfair Use of Inside Information

For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which
may have been obtained by an insider by reason of his relationship
to his company, section 16 (b) of the Act provides for the recovery
by or in behalf of the issuer of any profit realized by him from any
purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of any equity security
of the company within any period of less than six months. Corresponding provisions are contained in section 17 (b) of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and section 30 (f) of the Investment ~Company Act of 1940. While the Commission is not charged
with the enforcement of the civil remedies created by these provisions,
which are matters for determination by the courts in actions brought
by the proper parties, it is interested in seeing that information with
respect to possible profits by insiders is made available to issuers
and public stockholders; and it has participated as amicus curiae in
many of the suits instituted under these provisions where questions
of statutory interpretation are involved.
SOLICITATION

OF PROXIES,

CONSENTS,

AND AUTHORIZATIONS

Pursuant to sections 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 12 (e)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and 20 (a)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 the Commission has adopted

EIGHTEENTH

59

ANNUAL REPORT

Regulation X-14 which is designed to regulate the solicitation of
proxies, consents and authorizations in connection with securities
of companies subject to those statutes in order to protect investors
by requiring the disclosure of certain information to them at the
time their proxies are solicited. The information prescribed for
such disclosure is calculated to enable the investor to act intelligently
upon each separate matter with respect to which his vote or consent
is sought. The regulation also contains provisions enabling security
holders who are not allied with the company's management to communicate with other security holders when management is soliciting
proxies, either by arranging for the distribution of their own proxy
statements or through the inclusion of their proposals in the proxy
statements of management.
Statistics Relating to Proxy Statements

During the 1952 fiscal year the Commission received and its staff
in the Division of Corporation Finance examined, for its adequacy
in meeting the prescribed standards of disclosure, material relating
to 1,818 solicitations of security holders' proxies as well as "follow-up"
material used in 158 of these cases. In each instance it was necessary
under the regulations to receive and process these proxy statements
both in their preliminary and definitive forms. These figures compare
with 1,788 solicitations and the use of "follow-up" material in 192
instances during the preceding fiscal year.
Much more detailed information about proxy solicitations is
available on a calendar year basis. The total number of solicitations
made in 1951 was 1,791. Nearly 99% of these, or 1,769 were made by
management and the remaining 22 by nonmanagement groups. It
should be added that 40 of the proxy statements filed by management
included, as provided for under the regulation, 63 proposals of 24
different stockholders who were not connected with the management.
The number of management proxy statements including such stockholder proposals shows a drop from the 57 recorded in 1950, while the
number of such stockholder proposals shows a drop from the 97 in
1950.
As usual the business of electing directors is the purpose for which
proxies are most often sought. In 1951, there were 1,578 stockholders' meetings where such election was an item of business, and
180 meetings not involving such election, while the 33 remaining
solicitations sought consents and authorizations which did not
involve any meeting or any election of directors.
The wide range and frequency of items of business other than
election of directors on which stockholders' action was sought in
1951 are shown below.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

The most striking increase over 1950 is reflected above in the
number of proxies seeking stockholder votes on bonus and profitsharing plans including stock options-a total of 143 compared with
62 in 1950. While the number of proxy statements dealing with
employee pension plans, 116, is substantially less than the corresponding 152 proxy statements in 1950, it should be noted that the 1950
total reflected an increase of more than 200 percent over the corresponding total of 49 in 1949.
Examination of Proxy Material

Under the regulation copies of proposed proxy material must be
filed with the Commission in preliminary form at least 10 days prior
to the date of the proposed solicitation, and in definitive form at
the same time definitive copies are furnished to stockholders. The
preliminary material is filed for the information of the Commission
and to enable the staff to determine the adequacy of the prescribed
factual disclosures therein. Thus the examination of this material
must be completed in the comparatively brief interval between the
filing of the preliminary and definitive material. Even this brief
period is frequently shortened, where requested and found practicable,
by Commission action accelerating the date of the proxy solicitation.
Where preliminary material fails to meet the disclosure standards,
the management or nonmanagement group responsible for its preparation is given an opportunity to correct the deficiency before preparing
its definitive proxy material. Since the financial statements included in proxy material seeking stockholder approval of the merger,
acquisition or recapitalization of corporations frequently present
important and complex accounting questions, it is not surprising
that such statements in preliminary material often do not meet the
prescribed standards of disclosure. Two examples may be noted.
. 1. Preliminary proxy solicitation material, which was submitted by
a food manufacturing company with total assets of approximately
$95,000,000, contained a pro forma statement of financial position
giving effect to the acquisition of the net assets of a company with
total assets of approximately $15,000,000.
The registrant issued 115,000 shares of its common stock, $25 par
value, for substantially all of the net assets of the company to be
acquired. This represented the issuance of approximately 20 percent
additional stock. The sum of $2,296,300, representing the excess of
the common stock equity of the company to b3 acquired over the
aggregate par value of registrant's common stock issued therefor, was
reflected in the registrant's account, "Accumulated earnings retained
and used in the business." The accounting staff in the Division of
Corporation Finance took the position that the accumulated earnings
of the company to be acquired in excess of the credit to registrant's
common stock account, $2,875,000, should be credited to capital
surplus instead of to registrant's accumulated earnings account since
the transaction appeared to be, and was represented as, a purchase
of net assets. Consequently, the pro forma statement of financial
position was amended to reduce the aocumulated earnings account
by $2,296,300 and to credit the capital surplus account with the same
amount.
,
.
2. The registrant, a manufacturing company, filed preliminary
proxy soliciting material to be used in connection with a forthcoming
special meeting of stockholders at which it' was proposed to effect a

EIGHTEENTH

61

ANNUAL ,REPORT

plan of recapitalization of the company in order to eliminate accumulated and unpaid dividends of approximately $8,600,000 on the preferred stock of the company. The proposed recapitalization was to
be effectuated through a statutory merger of the company with its
wholly owned subsidiary company. The plan contemplated the issuance by the surviving parent company of 5~ percent sinking fund
debentures and new common stock primarily to the preferred stockholders in exchange for their preferred stock and in satisfaction of
the unpaid dividends on this stock. The preliminary proxy material
included a pro forma balance sheet giving effect to the proposed
recapitalization of the company. In this balance sheet the earned
surplus of the parent company in the amount of $578,740.29 was
brought forward in the merger as earned surplus of the surviving
company rather than as capital surplus.
In the letter of comment issued by the Division of Corporation
Finance it was indicated that because of the substantial accumulated
and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock, which far exceeded the
amount of earned surplus, this latter amount should be brought
forward as capital surplus rather than as earned surplus in the merger
and that subsequently accumulated earned surplus should be dated
from the date of reorganization. As a result, the pro forma balance
sheet in the definitive proxy material as sent to stockholders was
changed to reflect the earned surplus of the company as capital
surplus after the merger.
REGULATION OF BROKERS AND DEALERS IN OVER-THE-COUNTER

EIGHTEIENTH ANNUAL REPORT

63

Since 1947 the Commission, in appropriate instances in revocation
proceedings, has named as party respondents persons who were not
registered as brokers and dealers with the Commission but who were
partners, officers or directors or persons controlling or controlled
by such brokers and dealers. They are so named in order that they
may have a right to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses
with respect to any misconduct charged in which they allegedly
participated, and, pursuant to section 25 (a) of the Act, to appeal
from any order issued by the Commission which aggrieves them.
Proceedings were instituted against Henry P. Rosenfeld, doing
business as Henry P. Rosenfeld Company, and three other registered
brokers and dealers to determine whether their registrations should
be revoked; also named as additional party respondents were 12 nonregistered persons who were employed by the Rosenfeld company as
salesmen. The question with respect to them was whether they, as
persons "controlled" by a registered broker-dealer within the meaning of Section 15 (b) of the Act, had wilfully violated any of the
provisions of the securities acts and whether they individually were
causes of any order of revocation which might be issued. Rosenfeld
admitted the facts alleged as to himself and consented to revocation
of his registration. Hearings, however, were held pursuant to the
Commission's order to determine the culpability of all other respondents including the 12 nonregistered persons. The proceeding
resulted in an order revoking the registrations of Henry P. Rosenfeld
Company and the three other brokers and dealers, and the Commission found that the nonregistered respondents, in the sale of securities,
had wilfully violated the antifraud provisions of the securities acts
in that they, as well as the other parties, had made false and misleading statements regarding the background of the Rosenfeld company, the operation and prospects of three issuers of securities, their
plans to list such securities on a securities exchange, and the necessity
of effecting a prompt purchase to secure stock being issued. The
Commission also found that they were causes of the order of revocation of Henry P. Rosenfeld Company. Samson Wallach, Sr., one of
the nonregistered respondents, appealed to the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, asserting that the Commission
has no jurisdiction under section 15 (b) of the Securities Exchange
Act as to persons not registered. The appeal is pending.
Consolidated proceedings against Adams & Co., Bennett, Spanier
& Co., Inc., and Ray T. Haas, resulted in an order revoking their
registrations and expelling Adams & Co. and Bennett, Spanier & Co.,
Inc. from membership in the NASD. Haas was not a member.
The Commission found that registrants, acting in concert, took down
blocks of shares of Mohawk Liqueur Corporation from a person in
control of that corporation at successively higher prices and that, in
the course of distributing such shares, they maintained and raised the
price of the shares by entering increasingly higher bids in the National
Daily QuotM.tion Sheets and on the Chicago Board of Trade and
effecting purchases at rising prices.
In a proceeding against Frank S. Kelly, against whom the Commission had already obtained an injunetion.P the Commission revoked his broker-dealer registration. The Commission found that he
had solicited customers to buy certain when-issued securities, that as

their agent he had accepted their orders for such securities and had
obtained deposits from them in connection therewith on the representation that the monies obtained would be held and applied to the
settlement of the contracts for the securities. He did not disclose to
these customers that he intended to use and did use these deposits for
his own purposes. In addition he .loaned a substantial sum to a
private corporation Dot connected with the securities business, and as
a result of such loan, he had insufficient liquid assets to meet his
obligations to customers.
IIi proceedings instituted against Van Alstyne, Noel & Co., it was
alleged that the respondent made false and misleading representstions in the sale of stock of Expreso Aereo Inter-Americano, S. A., a
Cuban airliner concerning, among other matters, its op~ratioD8 and
financial condition, its prospects and the probability of higher market
prices. The Commission found that the Van Alstyne, Noel firm
made certain favorable representations about Expreso's operations
and future prospects when it had in its possession information that
Expreso's financial condition was unfavorable and was deteriorating,
that Expreso had borrowed substantial sums of money, that it had
issued stock in Cuba to obtain capital, and that an aviation consultant
who studied the company had reported that Expreso's prospects were
not too bright unless substantial funds could be raised to purchase
new equipment for expansion and acquire control of its only competitor in Cuba. The Commission held that such information was
material, the nondisclosure of which rendered the optimistic representations misleading.
The registrant contended with respect to the
financial statements of Expreso available to it that it was under no
duty to disclose to its customers the information contained therein
of which it had knowledge because (a) the financial statements were
confidential, (b) some of the financial statements were unaudited and
therefore inaccurate and incomplete, and (c) the financial statements
were stale and were accompanied or immediately followed by optimistic statements by Expreso's officers and directors which negatived
or minimized the adverse financial information.
The Commission
rejected this contention, pointing out that full disclosure could have
included any facts affecting the weight to be given to the information,
and stating, with respect to the claimed confidential nature of the
statements, that:
Even if it be assumed that registrant owed a duty to Expreso to treat the
financial information as confidential, in our opinion when registrant disseminated
favorable and optimistic information with respect to Expreso's condition and
prospects, it made itself subject to an overriding duty of disclosure to its customers.
[Footnote omitted.]
Registrant should have appreciated that giving
to a customer favorable or optimistic information and withholding unfavorable
information which it considered confidential would be misleading and unfair to
the customer . â€¢ â€¢

The Commission ordered the suspension of Van Alstyne, Noel & Co.
from membership in the NASD, New York Stock Exchange, and
N ew York Curb Exchange for a period of 20 days. The registrant
appealed from the Commission's suspension order to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The appeal is
pending.
Broker-Dealer Inspections

Section 17 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to make reasonable periodic, special, or other examinations
of the books and records of brokers and dealers. Under this section,

EIGHTEENTH

65

ANNUAL REPORT

the Commission has devised an inspection program to determine
whether brokers and dealers are complying with the requirements of
the securities acts. These examinations are sometimes limited in
nature, but the usual inspection is designed to check on all the various
activities of brokers and dealers. During the fiscal year, the Commission's regional offices, which conduct the inspections, reported on
827 such inspections, 677 of which were inspections of members of
the NASD. .As has been the experience in previous years, a substantial number of violations of the rules and regulations were uncovered.
These violations included noncompliance with the Commission's
capital and hypothecation rules and with Regulation T prescribed
by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In a
limited number of instances, brokers and dealers were taking secret
profits. There were a substantial number of transactions in which
the reasonableness of the price charged to the customer in relation to
the current market price was open to guestion, and there were miscellaneous violations in large number which would be difficult to classify
because of their variety.
The Commission does not necessarily take formal action against
a broker or dealer who appears from these inspections to be violating
the Acts if the violations appear to be inadvertant or the result of
misinformation and are not wilful, the Commission, consistent with
accepted standards of administrative procedure, affords the brokerdealer an opportunity to correct his practices if possible or to assure
the Commission that he will not persist in them.
Investigations

Generally, investigations of brokers and dealers result from the
inspection program, complaints from customers, or information
received from sources such as state securities commissions, securities
exchanges and associations, and better business bureaus.
In connection with such investigations, the Commission mayor may not
authorize the use of subpena powers. After the completion of an
investigation, the staff analyzes the evidence developed and makes
recommendations to the Commission for appropriate action in the
public interest and for the protection of investors.
The recommendation may be for injunctive relief, for administrative
action to
revoke registration or to suspend or expel from membership in a
national securities exchange or association, or, in an appropriate case,
for reference to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.
The following schedule shows the number of such investigations
during the fiscal year.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Financial Reports

Rule X-17A-5 requires brokers and dealers to file annually reports
of their financial condition. During the 1952 fiscal year, 3,797 reports
of financial condition were filed. These reports are examined and
analyzed by the staff of the Commission to determine whether, as of
the date for which the report speaks, the broker-dealer is in compliance
with the capital requirements under rule X-15C3-1.
If a brokerdealer is found not to comply, he is generally afforded a reasonable
time in which to correct his financial condition so that it fully meets
the requirements. If he fails to do so, the Commission takes such
action as may be necessary for the protection of customers.
SUPERVISION OF ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
OF SECURITIES DEALERS, INC.
Association Membership

Membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
(NASD), the only national securities association registered with the
Commission, stood at 2,950 at the close of the 1952 fiscal year. This
represented an increase of 104 members during the period as a result
of 241 admissions to, and 137 terminations of, membership. At the
same date there were registered with the NASD as registered representatives 33,053 individuals, including generally all partners, officers,
salesmen, traders and other persons employed by or associated with
member firms in capacities which in volved their doing business directly
with the public. The number of persons so registered represented an
increase during the fiscal year of 2,131 as a result of 6,168 initial
registrations or reregistrations and 4,037 terminations of registrations.
Disciplinary Actions

In the 1952 fiscal year the Commission received from the NASD
reports of final action in 21 disciplinary cases in which formal complaints had been filed against members. Four of these complaints had
been dismissed by the District Business Conduct Committee of initial
jurisdiction on findings that there had been no violations of the Rules
of Fair Practice of the association as alleged in the complaints.
In the remaining 17 cases the committees found that the members
or the registered representatives of the members cited in the complaints had acted in violation of the Rules of Fair Practice, and the
committees imposed various penalties. Of these 17 decisions the
complaints in 7 cases were aimed solely against member firms. In
these cases one member firm was expelled and 6 other member firms
were fined amounts ranging from $100 to $800, and aggregating $1,950.
The remaining 10 decisions involved not only member firms but
also their registered representatives.
In eight of them the following
penalties were imposed: One firm was censured and a representative
was fined $500; one firm was fined $500 and it and its representative
were each suspended for 30 days; one firm was fined $500 and it and
its representative were censured; one firm and its representative were
each suspended for 60 days and the representative was fined $500;
one firm was censured, as were two of its representatives; one firm was
fined $3,000, two representatives were each fined $1,200, a third was
fined $600 and the registration of a fourth representative was revoked;
and complaints against two member firms were dismissed, although in
one instance a representative was fined $100 and in the other the
registration of a representative was revoked.

ANNUAL

REPORT

The decisions in the two remaining cases, after affirmance by the
Board of Governors, were appealed to the Commission by some of
the aggrieved parties pursuant to the provisions of section 15A (g)
of the Securities Exchange Act, and at the end of the fiscal year were
in process before the Commission. Pending Commission determination such an appeal automatioallv stays the effectiveness of that part
of the NASD decision affecting the appealing person or firm. In the
one case, appeals were filed by Albert B. Tyson, who subsequently
abandoned his appeal, and Gilbert Parker, registered representatives
of Tyson & Co., Inc., from the revocation of their registrations. No
appeal was taken from that part of the NASD decision expelling the
firm from membership and revoking the registration as a registered
representative of Joseph Tyson. In the other case, Standard Bond &
Share Co. and its principal officer, William G. Stien, appealed from a
decision which imposed a fine of $500 on the firm and also suspended
the firm from membership and Stien, as a registered representative,
for 30 days.
As is its custom, the Commission referred to the NASD for appropriate action facts concerning the business practices of members
which tended to indicate possible violations of the NASD Rules of
Fair Practice. This information was obtained in broker-dealer inspections of member firms by the Commission. In the 195:3fiscal
year nine such references were made and a similar number had been
pending before the NASD at the start of that year. At the end of
the period seven cases were under consideration or in process, reports
on 11 having been received from the association during the period.
In two instances formal complaints were filed, resulting in the imposition of penalties. The remaining nine cases were disposed of by
informal means after examination by the association and either the
receipt of assurances by the NASD committees of future compliance
with relevant rules or the discovery of relevant facts or circumstances
such as to persuade the committees that there was no basis for formal
disciplinary action.
Commission Review of Disciplinary Action

Under the provisions of section 15A (g) of the Act, any disciplinary
action by the NASD against a member is subject to review by the
Commission on application by any aggrieved party, or on the Commission's own motion.
As indicated in the Seventeenth Annual Report, there were pending before the Commission at the start of the fiscal year here under
review an appeal by Otis & Co. from a 2-year suspension, and by
R. H. Johnson & Company from expulsion, and shortly after the
start of the year a third appeal was taken by George J. Martin & Co.,
a member firm which had been expelled, and Irving and Alfred Shayne,
whose registration as registered representatives of the Martin firm
had been revoked. In addition, as mentioned above, appeals were
filed during the year by Tyson & Co., Inc., Albert B. and Joseph
Tyson and Gilbert Parker and by Standard Bond & Share Co. and
its president, William G. Stien.
The Commission on April 2, 1952, issued its findings, opinion and
order in the R. H. Johnson & Company case dismissing the review
proeeedings:" and the remaining four appeals were in process before

68

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

the Commission at the end of the fiscal year. The R. H. Johnson &
Company matter is of considerable significance because the Commission's decision, which in effect affirmed the NASD's action, was
subsequently appealed to the courts, the first time such an appeal
has been taken.'! In that case, a complaint was issued by the
District Business Conduct Committee of District 14 of the NASD
charging, violations of Sections 1 and 2 of Article III of the NASD
Rules of Fair Practice by R. H. Johnson & Company ("applicant"},
by two of its partners, Roland H. Boardman and John D. Freeman,
and by a salesman, Caswell Sharpe. The District Committee, after
hearing, found that applicant and the others had violated these rules
in that, for the purpose of obtaining profits for themselves, they had
induced trading activity in a customers' account over a six-year
period, which, in view of the financial resources and character of the
account, was excessive in volume and in frequency. It ordered the
expulsion of applicant from membership in the association and revocation of registration with the association of the others as registered
representatives of applicant. Upon review by the NASD Board of
Governors, applicant's expulsion and the revocation of Sharpe's registration were affirmed, and the disciplinary action with respect to
Boardman and Freeman was reduced to suspension from registration
for one year. In addition, the Board found that Rupert H. Johnson;
applicant's principal partner, and Boardman, Freeman, and Sharpe
were causes of the order expelling applicant from membership in the
NASD. Applicant and Johnson sought review by the Commission.
The overtrading was effected in a joint account of an elderly widow
and her daughter by the salesman, Sharpe, who had gained their trust
and confidence. The customers, neither of whom had any financial
or business background, placed with Sharpe for investment a net of
$57,776 in cash and securities. With these assets Sharpe effected a
total of 648 transactions consisting of 348 purchases and 300 sales,
in a gross amount of $1,011,678. The securities acquired in 208 of
the purchase transactions were sold within 6 months of acquisition;
while those acquired in 68 other purchase transactions' were sold
within a year. Thus, more than 79% of the purchases were reversed
within one year. Only the securities acquired in 35 purchases, of
which 20 were effected as recently as 1948 and 1949, remained unsold
at the end of the 6-year period.
.
Another feature of the trading in the account was that almost onethird of the purchases were made between a dividend declaration
date and the exdividend date. The customers believed they were
receiving extra income, but the dividends were in effect merely a.
return of capital which had been purchased with the attendant
expense of commissions and other costs.
When the customers closed their account, securities worth $31,700
remained of the $57,776 in cash and securities invested, indicating a
loss of $26,076, of which $8,733 had been realized. Had these customers, instead of placing their account with applicant, simply continued holding the securities they originally owned, their account on
the date it was closed would have shown an increased market value
of about $2,663.
Applicant realized commissions and profits on this account totalling
H

Bee p. 76, Infra.

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

69

$23,354. Although almost all of the transactions were in listed securities, only $1,852 represented commissions on agency transactions
while $21,502 were profits derived from sales to the customers by
applicant as principal. Sharpe received 50% of these commissions
and profits realized by applicant. Over the 6-year period, 33% of
Sharpe's income was derived from this one account, and in one year
it provided over 47% of his income.
Applicant conceded that there was substantial overtrading in the
account, that the account suffered substantial losses, and that Boardman and Freeman failed adequately to supervise the transactions
recommended to the customers by Sharpe. However, applicant contended that responsibility for the overtrading could not be attributed
to it, that primary responsibility lay with Sharpe while any derivative
responsibility went only as far as Boardman and Freeman who, as
resident partners in the Boston office, assertedly had complete control
over Sharpe's trading in the account. The NASD, on the other hand,
argued that Boardman and Freeman were not actually partners but
only supervisory employees, and that while it is immaterial, as far
as applicant's responsibility is concerned, whether Boardman and
Freeman were partners or not, their subordinate status in the firm
was significant with respect to Johnson's duty, as the dominant
partner, to supervise the Boston office.
The Commission, in dismissing the review proceedings, found that
Johnson, as the dominant partner, must have known that Boardman
and Freeman would have little time to devote to supervision of the
activities of the salesmen in the Boston office who serviced about two
to four thousand accounts. Boardman and Freeman were permitted
to handle their own accounts, receiving a commission of 50% thereon
like the other salesmen, and they were frequently away from the
office on firm business.
Moreover, the record showed that supervision of the salesmen in
the Boston office was primarily the function of the New York office
where Johnson maintained his headquarters.
The accounting system
of the firm was such that the only permanent records were in the
N ew York office. The daily sales sheets were prepared in New York
showing all transactions for the day in all of the offices, and the
customers' ledger was kept in New York. Whenever accurate and
complete information as to an account was required by the Boston
office, a transcript taken from the customers' ledger in New York
would be supplied. T-o the extent that there was compliance with
Section 27 (a) of Article III of the NASD's rules which requires
supervision of salesmen including review and approval of all sales by
a partner, executive, or branch manager evidenced by written endorsement of sales memoranda, it wag carried out in New York.
However, such endorsement in applicant's case, in the form of initialing
of the sales memoranda, frequently was done by employees rather
than a partner or executive and merely purported to indicate that
the transactions were accurately set down and that the spread was
reasonable. But the endorsement did not purport to signify that
the transactions had been approved as being suitable for the customer.
The Commission accordingly concluded that, although the New York
office was responsible for revising securities transactions, such limited
check as was actually made was not designed and was ineffective to
detect excessive trading.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

CoDlmission Review of Action on MeDlbership

Section 15A (b) (4) of the Act and the bylaws of the NASD provide
that except in cases where the Commission approves or directs admission to or continuance in NASD membership as appropriate in the
public interest, no broker or dealer may hold such membership if
such broker or dealer or any person controlling or controlled by such
broker or dealer has been expelled from membership for violation of
an association rille prohibiting conduct inconsistent with just and
equitable principles of trade or was a "cause" of any such expulsion
order.
Pursuant to this authority, and giving due consideration to the
affirmative recommendation of the Board of Governors of the NASD,
the Commission during the fiscal year approved the admission to
membership of LaForge and CO.15 The firm had previously been
expelled from NASD membership for conduct inconsistent with just
and equitable principles of trade in that it had paid commissions to
the registered representative of another member without the prior
knowledge or consent of that member. The firm represented to the
NASD, in its effort to regain association membership, that the payments had been made on the instructions of the customer; that no
effort had been made to keep secret the fact of these payments; that
if association rilles had been violated that had not been the intent;
and that since its expulsion no similar acts had occurred. The Commission found it appropriate in the public interest to approve the
admission of the firm to NASD membership.
The Commission considered somewhat similar applications in
approving the continuation in NASD membership of three different
member firms employing H. L. Brocksmith;" Roland H. Boardman, 17
and John D. Freeman, respectively."
Brocksmith's disqualification
arose from Commission action in 1942 which resulted in the revocation
of the broker-dealer registration of H. L. Ruppert and Co., Inc., of
which Brocksmith was vice president, and the expulsion of that firm
from the NASD and the St. Louis Stock Exchange. Thereafter, with
Commission approval, the NASD continued in membership a firm
which employed Brocksmith as its registered representative. Brocksmith subsequently changed his employment to another NASD
member firm and this change likewise raised before the Commission
the question of continuation in NASD membership of the new employer. On the representation by the NASD that his record while
employed by the other member firm was satisfactory and that he was
adequately supervised in his new employment, the Commission
approved the application.
The Commission, with due regard to the public interest, also approved the continuance of membership in the association of the firms
employing Roland H. Boardman and John D. Freeman, who had
been co-managers of the Boston branch office of R. H. Johnson and
Company, and had been held by the NASD to be.causes of the order
of expulsion of the Johnson firm and had been suspended from membership in the association as registered representatives for one year.

Action on NASD Rules

Section 15A (j) of the Act provides that any change in or addition
to the rules of a registered securities association shall be disapproved
by the Commission unless such change or addition appears to the
Commission to be consistent with the requirements for such rules in
section 15A (b) of the Act.
The NASD filed with the Commission, on June 4, 1952, after
requisite approval by the Board of Governors and the membership,
a proposed amendment to Article III of the Rules of Fair Practice,
designated Section 28, providing for notice under limited conditions
to a member (the "employer member") before another member (the
"executing member") knowingly executes transactions for the purchase or sale of a security for the account of a partner, officer, registered representative, or employee of the employer member. The
Commission held that it was unable to find the proposed amendment
consistent with section 15A (b), and on June 30, 1952, disapproved the
proposed amendment pending further order. IV At the same time the
Commission gave notice that it had under consideration a proposal to
adopt rule X-I0B-6 under section 10 (b) of the Act. In substance,
this rule would make it unlawful for any broker or dealer to effect any
securities transaction with or for any partner, officer, director, or
employee of another broker or dealer, either on or off an exchange,
unless he gives actual notice of the transaction to the other broker or
dealer in advance and then promptly sends the other broker or dealer
a copy of the confirmation. The Commission pointed out that the
proposed rule of the NASD which it had disapproved pending further
order was more limited than the Commission's rule in that (1) it
would have applied only to members of the association and (2) it
would have required notice only under limited conditions.
CHANGES

IN RULES,

REGULATIONS

AND FORMS

Amendment of proxy rules.-In keeping with its policy of revising
its rules and regulations from time to time as experience gained from
actual administration dictates, the Commission, during the latter
part of the 1952 fiscal year, published tentative proposals for the
amendment of certain of its proxy rules under Regulation X-14.
In announcing these proposals, full details of which are set forth in
Securities Exchange Act release No. 4668 (January 31, 1952), the
Commission invited all interested persons to submit data, views and
comments on the proposals for its consideration. (The Commission,
on December 11, 1952, adopted amended proxy rules growing out of
these proposals as announced in Securities Exchange Act release No.
4775.)
Rule X-15D-14-. Reports by Canadian banks.--0n August 27,
1951, the Commission announced the adoption of a rule dealing with
reports filed pursuant to section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange
Act by Canadian banks. The rule, designated as rule X-15D-l4, permits Canadian banks to file as their annual reports under the Act
the information and documents which they are required by the Bank
Act of Canada to furnish to their stockholders. The rule further

provides that current and quarterly reports need not be filed by such

banks.
Proposed Rule X-l0B-6.-This rule, which is discussed supra, at
page 71, would require a broker-dealer to give notice to another
broker-dealer of any transaction between the former broker-dealer
and the partner, officer, director or employee of the latter brokerdealer, and to give a duplicate copy of the confirmation to such
broker-dealer.
Amendment of certain rules with respect to registration and reporting.Corresponding to similar action taken under the Securities Act of 1933
during the year, the Commission amended the following rules under
the Securities Exchange Act dealing with the preparation and filing
of applications and reports under the Act:
Rule X-12B-ll
was amended to require only three copies of
applications and reports to be filed with the Commission unless
additional copies are required by the instructions contained in the
particular form. Previously the rules required four copies of all such
material to be filed with the Commission.
Rule X-12B-12 previously required applications and reports to
be printed, mimeographed or typewritten.
The amended rule permits them to be lithographed or prepared by any similar process which
produces copies of the requisite clarity and permanence.
Further
amendments clarify the requirements with respect to the size of type
to be used.
Rules X-13A-13 and X-15D-13, which relate to the filing of quarterly reports of gross sales and operating revenues, were amended
so as to make it clear that such reports are required to be filed by title
insurance companies.
They previously provided that such quarterly
reports need not be filed by "any
* * â€¢ insurance company."
This language has been changed to read "any
* â€¢ * insurance
company (other than title insurance companies)."
Amendment oj Form 8-K.-Item
15 of Form 8-K was amended so
as to make it Clear that registrants under the Securities Act which
are required to file current reports on this form need keep up to date
only those exhibits which are required to be kept up to date by a
company having securities listed and registered on a national securities
exchange.
The amended item also provides that where previously filed exhibits
are amended or modified, copies of the entire exhibits as amended or
modified to date shall be filed where it is practicable to do so. Where
that is not practicable, copies of the amendment or modification
only may be filed, but in such case the registrant must identify each
previous filing in which the original exhibit or any amendment or
modification has been filed.
.
Amendment oj specified forms.-During the 1952 fiscal year, the
Commission also adopted various amendments to the Instruction
Book for Forms 12-K and 12A-K, in order to conform to certain
changes made by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its Form
A; and adopted an amendment to Form lo-K which further simplifies
the filing of reports on this form by electric utility and natural gas
companies which file annual reports with the Federal Power. Commission on its Forms 1 or 2. The latter issuers are permitted to file

UTIGATION UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
Injunctive Actions Against Broker-Dealers

During the fiscal year the Commission filed a complaint charging

J. Arthur Warner &; Gompany,20 a registered broker-dealer having
offices in N ew York and throughout New England, with a course
of conduct which included the practice of "churning" accounts of
customers. A.s the name implies, churning consists of grossly overtrading an account for the purpose of making large commissions for
the dealer at the expense of the customer. To accomplish this, it is
generally necessary to find unsophisticated investors who will, for an
extended period, remain unaware of what is happening to their accounts. The complaint, which was filed in the United States District
Court at Boston, Massachusetts, alleged that J. Arthur Warner &
Company dealt largely with the elderly and the uninformed who had
come by their existing portfolios through inheritance; that it encouraged these persons to liquidate portfolios of government bonds
and conservative securities, and to withdraw funds from savings
accounts in order to invest in securities which the Warner Company
and its employees would recommend, and that, presumably in an
effort to make its service most complete, it would also arrange for bank
loans for these customers so that they could buy more of the Warnerrecommended shares.
The complaint asked for a temporary restraining order as well as
for preliminary and final injunctions, and a temporary restraining
order was entered which had the effect of restraining the defendant
company from syphoning off its assets during the pendency of the
litigation. This was deemed to be necessary for the protection of its
customers in event they decided to bring action against it. Later,
at the court's request, the defendant stipulated that during the
pendency of the action its capital would not be impaired, and the
order was vacated.
On November 21, 1951, a preliminary injunction was entered with
the consent of the defendant. A hearing on the final injunction had
not been held as of the close of the fiscal year.
An injunction was obtained against Kenneth B. Hill,21 a registered
broker-dealer, who not only sold, but also printed the securities and
for~ed thereon the names of the proper iss~
officials. The complaint also alleged and the court found that Hill had failed to meet
statutory requirements as to his financial condition, had filed false
and misleading financial statements and had failed to keep required
business records.
In an injunctive action against P. L. lvey &; Go., U a broker-dealer,
it was enjoined from misrepresenting its financial condition to customers and failing to meet statutory financial standards.

COMMISSION

Injunctive Actions Against Others

An action for an injunction was instituted against L. A. McQueen, 23
a vice president and director of the General Tire and Rubber Co., to
restrain him from further violations of section 16 (a) which requires
an officer or a director of a corporation with an equity security registered on a national securities exchange to file with the Commission
and the exchange reports reflecting his acquisition or disposition of
any of the corporation's equity securities. McQueen filed the required reports and consented to entry of the injunction.
An injunction was also obtained against Local 291 of the Utility
Workers of America, Leonard Behr, president of the Local, Henry
Myers, secretary and treasurer of the Local, and Joseph. A. Henry, a
stockholder of Kings County Lighting Company," from further solicitation of proxies without first filing their solicitation material with
the Commission and furnishing a proxy statement to each person
solicited as required by Regulation X-14.
The Commission had filed its complaint for injunction after learning
that a so-called "Kings County Lighting Company Independent
Stockholders' Committee" had sent two communications to the
stockholders of the company urging them not to give their proxies
to the management, or to revoke any proxies they might have given,
in connection with a special stockholders' meeting. The management, which had filed its own proxy soliciting material under the
proxy rules, had called this meeting for the purpose of obtaining
authority from the stockholders for certain additional financing,
as well as a waiver of preemptive rights. The complaint alleged
that the Stockholders' Committee had not filed its material with
the Commission, and that this material omitted to state certain
information required by the proxy rules and appeared to contain
certain false and misleading statements.
The evidence showed that
Behr and Myers, acting on behalf of the union, had organized the
committee, which consisted solely of the defendant Henry, who owns
100 shares of the company's stock and is a brother-in-law of the
defendant Behr, and that the letters of the committee had been typed
and mimeographed at union headquarters and at the union's expense.
The Commission pointed out that, since the Kings County Lighting Company had been separated from the Long Island Lighting
Company system and was thus no longer subject to the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Commission had no jurisdiction with respect to the merits of the proposals on which the
company had solicited proxies. The Commission emphasized also
that it was not concerned with any differences which might exist
between the management of Kings County Lighting Company and
the union, but that its only interest was to enforce the proxy rules
equally against all persons soliciting proxies, whether on behalf of or
in opposition to the management.
Occasionally, violations of more than one statute are involved as
in the case of the injunction obtained against Bernard Kantor and
National Evaluators, Inc.25 The complaint alleged violations of
sections 5 (a) and 17 (a) (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.

-section 15 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, and section 203 (a)
of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 in that the defendants, in
the sale of stock of National Evaluators, Inc., which had not been
registered with the Commission, made false and misleading statements of material facts. Among such statements alleged were that
National Evaluators had been retained to locate missing stockholders of a corporation who were entitled to $30,000 in dividends;
that the proceeds from the sale of the stock would be paid into the
company when, in fact, Kantor appropriated such proceeds to his
own use; that a "satisfactory refund" of monies paid by the public
to National Evaluators for investigating the value of securities would
be made when, in fact, the refund was made in shares of the company,
which were worthless. The complaint further alleged that the
defendants had engaged in the business of being a broker-dealer and
investment adviser without registering with the Commission.
Petitions {or Review of Commission Orders

Commission orders in broker-dealer revocation proceedings or on
appeal from NASD actions are subject to review by an appropriate
Court-of Appeals.
In revocation proceedings pursuant to sections 15 (b) and 15A
(b) (4) of the Act against Henry P. Rosenfeld, Samson Wallach,
Sr., and others, 26 Wallach, one of the nonregistered employee respondents, had been found by the Commission to have violated the antifraud provisions of the securities acts and to have been a cause of the
order revoking Rosenfeld's registration. He filed a petition for
review 27 contending that the Commission had no jurisdiction to name
-as respondents pel sons not registered as broker-dealers. The
petition was pending at the end of the fiscal :rear.
There is also pending an appeal by Van Alstyne, Noel &: 00. from
the order of suspension which is discussed in an earler section. 28
R. H. Johnson &: 00. petitioned for review of the Commission's
order sustaining the NASD's order of expulsion." This litigation
is of special interest because, as previously mentioned, it is the first
NASD disciplinary action to receive judicial attention and review;
and the petitioner has challenged the constitutionality of section 15A
of the Act under which the NASD was organized."
In Peck v. S. E. O. the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, on
April 7, 1952, dismissed for lack of jurisdiction a petition for review of
a so-called "order" of the Commission under the Securities Exchange
Act. The alleged "order" was a letter of the Commission denying
a stockholder's request for an oral hearing on the propriety of the
Commission's refusal to institute court action against the management
of The Greyhound Corporation to compel it, under rule X-I4A-8, to
include in its proxy statement a proposal recommending that the
management consider the advisability of abolishing the segregated
seating system in Greyhound's buses in the South. The Commission
had agreed with the management that the proposal was not a "proper
subject for action by the security holders" within the meaning of the
rule. The Commission contended that it has no power to act by

his position by instituting his own court action against the manage.
ment. At the time of the aforementioned request, the Commission
had already had the benefit of the stockholder's written views. The
Court of Appeals issued no opinion in dismissing the petition, but its
ruling (in view of the issues presented) appears to confirm the Commission's position that the Commission's letter of refusal was not an
"order" subject to court review under section 25 (a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, nor was it agency action made reviewable by
section 10 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act.
Participation as Amicus Curiae

Significant interpretations of rule X-10B-5 under section 10 (b)
of the Securities Exchange Act were involved in a number of court
rulings handed down during the fiscal year in cases in which the Commission participated as amicus curiae. In Speed v. Trcmsamerica
Oorp:" the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,
agreeing with the Commission's view, held that rule X-IOB-5 had
been violated by Transamerica Corporation, the majority stockholder of the Axton-Fisher Tobacco Company, in purchasing the
shares of public minority stockholders of that company without disclosing to them material facts in its possession by virtue of its inside
position which affected the value of the stock. The court found that
Transamerica Corporation bought the minority holdings with the
intent (which it effectuated shortly thereafter) of liquidating the
company and realizing upon the principal asset, a leaf tobacco inventory whose "average cost" valuation in the company's published
financial statements did not reflect an enormous increase in market
value of which Transamerica Corporation was cognizant. The court
rejected defendant's contention that rule X-10B-5 imposed no duty
of disclosure which a corporate insider did not have under state law.
The rule, the court held, must be construed so as to give effect to the
statutory purpose of protecting investors and redressing wrongs which
Congress sought to prevent, and is not limited by the principles of
common law fraud and deceit. The court also ruled, in accord with
views expressed by the Commission (1) that section 10 (b) does not
contain an invalid delegation of rule-making powers, nor does it
contravene the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution, (2) that rule X-IOB-5 is sufficiently clear and definite,
and does not violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment,
(3) that, in adopting an antifraud rule under section 10 (b), the Commission was not limited to proscribing market manipulations of
various types, but could make and properly made unlawful fraudulent
or deceptive securities transactions generally, and (4) that section
10 (b) and rule X-lOB-5 are not limited to transactions effected upon
a national securities exchange or in the organized over-the-counter
markets of brokers and dealers, but apply to all fraudulent or de.
captive securities transactions in which the mails or instruments of
interstate commerce have been used. At the close of the fiscal year
a final judgment in the Speed case awaited determination of the
amount of damages suffered by plaintiffs.

In Northern Trust Oompany v. Eeeaness Theatres Oorp.32 the United
States District Court for the Northern District of lllinois, in denying
defendants' motions for summary judgment, held, in accord with
the ruling in the Speed case, that section 10 (b) and rule X-lOB-5
are applicable to all fraudulent or deceptive securities transactions
involving the use of the mails or instruments of interstate commerce.
The court rejected a contention that section 10 (b), read in light of
the preamble provision of section 2 of the Act, was limited to transactions in securities traded upon exchanges or in the "over-thecounter" markets of brokers or dealers. This holding accords also
with the decision in Robinson v, DiiJord 33 which is discussed in the
17th Annual Report."
A contrary ruling, however, was handed
down during the fiscal year by the United States District Court for
the Western District of Washington in Fratt v. Robineon " where
the complaint was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
The Fratt
ruling was made from the bench following oral argument, and DO
opinion was filed. An appeal in the Fratt case was pending at the
close of the fiscal year.36 In the Northern T1"U8tOompany case the
court also held, in agreement with the Commission, (1) that section
10 (b) and rule X-lOB-5 are applicable whether or not the issuer
conducts an interstate business, and whether or not the mails were
used to transmit the particular misrepresentations complained of, if
the mails or instruments of interstate commerce were used in connection with the fraudulent or deceptive transaction,
(2) that a
private civil action may be maintained by a seller of securities damaged by a violation of rule X-lOB-5, and (3) that the applicable
statute of limitations for such private action is that of the state of the
forum.
The Commission also participated during the fiscal year as amicuÂ«
curiae in a number of cases involving the construction of section 16
(b) of the Act, which accords to a corporation the right to recover
profits realized by officers, directors, and 10 percent stockholders
from purchases and sales or sales and purchases of the corporation's
equity securities during a six months' period. The following cases
raised problems of interpretation of language in that section.
In Oarr Oonsolidated Biscuit 00. v. Moore,37 the defendant, an
officer and director of the plaintiff corporation, realized a profit from
transactions completed more than two years before the action was
instituted.
Since section 16 (b) contains a 2-year statute of limitations he opposed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that
the action was barred.
The plaintiff took the position, which the
Commission supported in its brief as amicus curiae, that the statute
of limitations was tolled by concealment of the transactions, and that
the failure of the defendant to file reports of his transactions as
required by section 16 (a) amounted to such concealment.
The
reports were filed within 2 years preceding commencement of the
action. No decision was rendered by the court before the close of
the fiscal year.

COMMISSION

In Jefferson Lake Sulphur Co. v. Walet 38 five defenses were raised
to an action by a corporation to recover the profits realized by its
president from short-swing transactions in the stock of the corporation. It was contended (1) that the transactions were consummated
without the use of any inside information, (2) that the certificates of
stock purchased by the defendant were Dot used to make delivery
upon any of the shares sold, (3) that some of the shares were not
"equity securities" within the meaning of the section because they
had been treasury stock, (4) that some of the stock acquired was
purchased in accordance with the terms of incentive options issued
by the corporation and that therefore the corporation was estopped
to recover profits made when these shares were sold, and (5) that
any computation of profit must be reduced to the extent that the
wife of the defendant had a community property interest in the
transactions. The court rejected all of these defenses and, in accordance with the position urged by the Commission, granted judgment
in the full amount claimed by the plaintiff. An appeal to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is pending.
In Stella v. Graham-Paige Motors Oorp.39 a stockholder of the
Kaiser-Frazer Corporation instituted an action against GrahamPaige Motors Corporation based upon a purchase of 750,000 shares
of common stock of Kaiser-Frazer Corporation and a sale of 150,000
shares within 6 months thereafter. Prior to the purchase, GrahamPaige Motors Corporation was not a 10 percent stockholder of
Kaiser-Frazer Corporation, nor did it occupy any other position
which might bring it within the scope of section 16 (b). The purchase of 750,000 shares, however, constituted it a holder of over
20 percent of the common stock of Kaiser-Frazer Corporation.
Graham-Paige Motors Corporation moved for summary judgment in
the action on the ground that section 16 (b) did not apply because it
was not a 10 percent owner of the common stock both at the time of
the purchase and at the time of the sale. The Commission contended
that the Act contemplated that purchases which themselves caused a
person to become a 10 percent stockholder should be subject to the
liabilities imposed by section 16. The court, in an opinion handed
down shortly before the close of the fiscal year, sustained the Commission's contention.
In Oonsolidated Engineering Oorporation v. Nesbit 40 the United
States District Court for the Southern District of California ruled,
contrary to the contentions of the Commission, that a corporation
which had issued stock options to its officers and assured them that
the options could be exercised and the stock sold within 6 months
thereafter, was estopped from recovering any profits from these
transactions. Subsequent to the court's decision a security holder
sought to intervene for the purpose of taking an appeal, but the
District Court denied the request for intervention. An appeal was
taken from that denial to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit, and the Commission filed a brief as amicus curiae
urging the Court of Appeals to permit such intervention."
The
appeal is pending.

The
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the

The Kaiser-Frazer Investigation and the Litigation With Otis & Co.

Early in 1948 the Commission instituted an investigation into
the circumstances surrounding the failure of a stock offering by
Kaiser-Frazer Corporation and there ensued a series of administrative and court proceedings which, from the standpoint of sheer
volume, have been among the most extensive in the history of the
Commission. The early history of these proceedings is discussed
in the 15th ~
 and 16th 46 Annual Reports of the Commission. At the
beginning of the present fiscal year there were still pending before
the Commission (1) the Commission's administrative proceeding to
determine whether the registration of Otis & Co. as a broker-dealer
should be revoked and whether it should be suspended or expelled
from the NASD, and (2) the appeal by Otis & Co. from an order of
the NASD suspending it from membership for 2 years.
Meanwhile Kaiser-Frazer had instituted a suit against Otis &
Co. for breach of contract, which was tried before Judge Clancy in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York in 1951. On July 2, 1951, Judge Clancy handed down an
opinion in which he held for the plaintiff, finding: "That defendant
procured and actually, by its agents, instituted the Masterson suit
as a means to stop the sale of plaintiff's stock was proved beyond a
reasonable doubt." 41 On July 10 Judge Clancy entered judgment in
the amount of $3,120,743. Otis & Co. appealed, but since no supersedeas bond was filed, Kaiser-Frazer immediately took steps in various
parts of the country to execute on the judgment.
Shortly after the opinion was rendered, counsel for Otis & Co.
advised the Commission that Otis' "assets available to pay the
judgment obtained by Kaiser-Frazer Corporation, if that judgment
should be affirmed, are less than the amount of the judgment."
The Commission had been informed that, shortly before Judge Clancy
entered judgment, Eaton and Daley and members of their families
had withdrawn substantial amounts of securities which they had loaned
to the firm for use as capital pursuant to agreements whereby the
loans had been subordinated to the claims of all other creditors.
For these reasons, as well as the refusal of Otis & Co. to permit examination of its books pursuant to the Commission's visitatorial power
under section 17 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, the Commission
filed an injunction action in the United States District Court for the

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Northern District of Ohio 411 and obtained a temporary restraining
order from Judge Jones on July 26, 1951, which has been continued in
effect by stipulation.
This order, in substance, (8) restrained the
defendants from effectin~ transactions with customers without disclosing the firm's financial condition; (b) restrained further withdrawals of assets and securities by the individual defendants; and (c)
directed the defendants to permit the Commission to examine the
firm's books and accounts pursuant to section 17 (a) and restrained
further violations of that section.
Before a motion for a preliminary injunction could be heard,
Otis & Co., on August 22, 1951, filed a petition under Chapter X of
the Bankruptcy Act in the same court. On December 12,1951, Judge
Freed approved the petition and continued his order in the usual
form restraining all persons from commencing or continuing any
actions or proceedings against the debtor. The Commission filed a
motion to obtain a clarification of this order, or if necessary its modification, so as to preclude any question of the propriety of the Commission's continued prosecution of three proceedings-the injunction
action just referred to and the two administrative proceedings mentioned above. In making this motion the Commission appeared
specially in its capacity as the agency charged with the administration
of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act. Because
of the lack of any substantial interest on the part of the public as
creditors or stockholders of the debtor, the Commission did not seek
leave to appear generally in the Chapter X proceeding.
On March 21, 1952, Judge Freed handed down an opinion in which
he construed his order of December 12 as being sufficiently broad to
prohibit further prosecution of all three actions (the two administrative proceedings and the action for injunction), but modified his order
of December 12 only to the extent of permitting further prosecution
of the injunction action. Judge Freed's order pursuant to this opinion
was entered on April 7.'9
On the same day the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed Judge Clancy's judgment in Kaiser-Frazer's action for damages
against Otis & CO.60 Without coming to the question whether the
Masterson suit had been inspired by Otis & Co., the court reversed
solely on the ground that certain of the earnings figures in the registration statement filed by Kaiser-Frazer under the Securities Act in
connection with the 1948 offering were misleading. For this reason the
court held that the underwriting contract was unenforceable as
violative of the Securities Act. The court noted, however, that the
reason assigned by Otis & Co. for refusing to go through with the
underwriting contract at the time was the institution of the Masterson
suit.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935
The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was passed by
the 74th Congress following a nine-year study conducted by the
Federal Trade Commission and after extensive hearings and debates
by both houses. These investigations disclosed many serious abuses
in public utility holding company financing and operations, the more
significant of which are enumerated in section 1 (b) of the Act: (1)
inadequate disclosure to investors of the information necessary to
appraise the financial position and earnings power of the companies
whose securities they purchase; (2) the issuance of securities against
fictitious and unsound values; (3) the overloading of operating companies with debt and fixed charges thus tending to prevent voluntary
rate reductions; (4) the imposition of excessive charges upon operating
companies for various services such as management, supervision of
construction and the purchase of supplies and equipment; (5) the
control by holding companies of the accounting practices and rate,
dividend and other policies of their operating subsidiaries so as to
complicate or obstruct state regulation; (6) the control of subsidiary
holding companies and operating companies through disproportionately small investment; (7) the extension of holding company systems
without relation to economy of operations or to the integration and
coordination of related properties.
The Congress expressly stated that it was the policy of the Act, in
accordance with which all other sections of the statute were to be
construed, to meet the problems and eliminate the evils described.
To implement this policy, the 33 sections of the statute provide
for three separate areas of regulation of holding company systems.
The first area embraces those provisions of the Act which require the
physical integration of the public utility and related properties of a
holding company system and the simplification of intercorporate relationships and financial structures of the system. The latter includes
the removal of unnecessary holding company complexities, the correction of inequitable distribution of voting power among security
holders, and the strengthening of the financial position of the system.
The second area of regulation covers financing operations of holding
companies and their subsidiaries, acquisitions and dispositions of
properties and securities by such companies, their accounting practices and intrasystem servicing arrangements and other intercompany
transactions in holding company systems. The third area encompasses
a number of sections of the Act which are designed to insure that
newly created holding company or affiliate relationships shall meet
certain standards prescribed by the statute, and other provisions of
the Act which require a limited degree of surveillance over exempt
holding company systems.

COMMISSION

The Commission has always regarded the enforcement of the physical integration and corporate simplification provisions of section 11
and related sections of the Act as the most important segment of its
responsibilities under the statute, find vigorous administration over
the past 17 years has resulted in the liquidation of a large number
of unnecessary holding companies with the return of their subsidiaries
to independent ownership, and the streamlining of a number of
others into compact regional systems affording consumers and investors the benefits of large scale centralized generation and transmission
of electric power and of integrated long distance transmission and
distribution facilities for natural gas. It is now possible to state that
the task of bringing about compliance with section 11 which had its
real beginning in 1940 is rapidly nearing completion.
Thus, in what is probably the only instance of its kind in the
history of the nation. an entire major industry has been almost completely reorganized in the short space of 12 years and this has been
accomplished with a staff which has declined steadily from 175 in
1940 to the present force of 35 employees engaged in this work in the
fiscal year 1952.1 When the work under section 11 is completed in
another couple of years there will be no further expense to the taxpayer on this score.
In addition to its duties with respect to integration, provided in
section 11, section 30 of the Act directs the Commission to make
studies of public utility operations and service areas so as to be able
to recommend the "type and size of geographically and economically
integrated public utility systems which * * * can best promote
and harmonize the interests of the public, the investor and the consumer." This work is expected to encourage a number of acquisitions
and comhinations of utility properties not otherwise subject to the
Act which are consistent with the integration and simplification
standards of section 11 and related provisions of the Act. This
function will likewise be partially self-liquidating over a period of
years.
The other segments of the Commission's regulatory responsibilities
under the Act are continuing functions not likely to undergo any
significant changes in the future. These embrace: (1) regulation of
the regional integrated holding company systems which will have
achieved complete compliance with the provisions of section 11; (2)
limited surveillance of the holding company systems which enjoy
exemption from most provisions of the Act; (3) surveillance of acquisitions of utility securities by affiliates and by organized groups of
persons or other devices designed to circumvent regulation of holding
company relationships; and (4) surveillance of affiliated service companies and of those servicing organizations which are princ'pally
engaged in the performance of services for public utility or holding
companies.
I The staff of the Drvision
of Public Utihties which assists the Comnnssion In this work declined from
234 In 1940 to 88 In 1952. The figures shown represent estimates of the portions of manpower assigned to
the adminJstratlon
of section II and related sections of the Act.

REPORT

SDIPLIFICATION-QVER-ALL

St:.\HIAHY

The impact of the enforcement of section 11 since enactment of
the Holding Company Act of 1935 is illustrated by the substantial
decline in the relative position of holding company systems in the
electric and gas ut ilitv industries. In the early "thirties," I;) holdingcompanies controlled 80 percent of all electric energv generation; 20
systems controlled 98.5 percent of ull transmission of electric energy
across state lines; and 11 controlled 80 percent of all nat ural gas
pipeline mileage. On June 30, 1952, electric utility plant owned by
registered holding company systems constituted approximately 30
percent of the aggregate dollar amount of plant owned by all private
utility companies. Manufactured and natural gas plant (including
gas transmission properties) owned by registered systems represented
28 percent of the total for the nation. ~Whenthe section 11 reorganization program is completed, these percentages will decline to 23
percent and 18 percent. respectively,
However, in addition to the registered systems there are a large
number of holding company systems which are exempt from most
provisions of the Act with gross utility plant aggregating over $7.8
billion. These exemptions cover situations where the systems are
either predominantly intrastate in character, the holding company
is predominantly an operating utility. or. the system is very small
and has assets of $1 million or less, .:\evertheless, since the Commission is empowered to revoke exemptions whenever the circumstances which led to granting the st atus have changed, or in other
cases where continuance of the exemption is detrimental to the public
interest, the exempt status of all of such systems is subject to periodic
reappraisal; and, in a number of situations, various types of corrective
measures have become necessary.
At one time 01' another, a total of 2,197 companies have been subject to the active regulatory jurisdiction of the Commission as components of registered holding company systems. Of this number,
214 were holding companies, 929 were electric or gas utilities and
1,054 were nonutility companies 01' utilities other than electric 01'
gas. By the close of the past fiscal year, the registered systems included 57 holding companies, 192 electric or gas utilities and 188
other companies. The greatest percentage reduction has occurred
in the nonutility group which originally included a wide variety of
enterprises many of which had little or no relationship to utility
operations and were not ret ainable under statutory standards.
The following tables sumrnarize these developments and set forth
the manner in which subject companies have been released from
jurisdiction.

INTEGRATION

AND SIMPLIFICA TION-SCRVEY
SYSTEMS

OF INDIVIDUA L

Most of the individual system programs undertaken to achieve
compliance with the requirements of section 11 are now well advanced
toward completion.
A number of systems which are expected to
continue as regional integrated organizations subject to the Holding
Company Act are still faced with residual problems under section
11 (b) (1) involving the retainabilitv of certain utility or non-utility
properties.
However, the major problems to be resolved are to be
found within those systems which are expected to be liquidated or in
those which are not expected to continue in the electric or gas utility
business.
Working within the framework of section 11 (e) the Commission
has consistentlv followed the policy during the past 15 years of encouraging holding companies to exercise initiative in formulating,
developing, and presenting their proposals to achieve compliance
with the integration and simplification standards of the Act. Accomplishments reflected in the plans and procedures submitted and
approved by the Commission attest to the measure of ingenuity which
management has brought to bear upon these problems.
As the following reports indicate, a number of holding companies,
including Investment Bond & Share Corporation, American Power &
Light Companv, Mission Oil Company, New England Public Service
Company, Philadelphia Company and Standard Gas and Electric
Company have either accomplished the distribution of their portfolio
holdings during the past year or are expected to take steps toward
this objective as a prelude to final liquidation,
In other systems, the pattern of compliance involves the divestment of all utility properties and the limitation of holding company
functions to other business channels. The Cities Service Company,
for example, has elected to retain its non-utility business, chiefly oil
and gas production and transmission and oil distribution, and to dispose
of all of its utility interests.
Other holding companies, including

EIGHTEEKTH

AXXTAL

REPOltT

87

Electric Bond and Share Company and The United Corporation, are
seeking to convert themselves into investment companies, after being
divested of utility holdings as required by orders of the Commission.
Another alternative is illustrated by the program of the United
Gas Improvement Company which has recently received authorization to merge all of its subsidiaries into itself and continue operating
as an intrastate operating utility company. Upon consummation of
this merger and the disposition of certain portfolio holdings, that
company will apply for an order under section 5 (d) declaring that
it has ceased to be a holding company.
Activities during the past fiscal year and in the early months thereafter have been highlighted by a series of successful compromises
among various classes of security holders which have substantially
reduced the time necessary to conclude a number of pending section 11
proceedings. With the assistance of the staff of the Commission,
representatives of these security holders have undertaken to resolve
existing conflicts in their respective claims to holding company assets
and they have formulated amended plans embodying the results of
these negotiations. These compromises are very difficult to bring
about and in order to approve such a plan the Commission must find
that the plan is fair and equitable to all persons affected thereby.
However, the resolution of intricate problems of valuation by this
method does much to eliminate protracted and expensive litigation
and thereby contributes substantially to the benefits accruing to all
classes of securities. During the past fiscal year, compromises initiated bv or effected with the assistance of the Commission have
effected resolution of some or all of the remaining section 11 problems
of American & Foreign Power Company, Inc., Cities Service Company, Eastern Utilities Associates, Kew England Public Service
Company, North American Utilities Securities Corporation, Standard
Gas and Electric Company and Standard Power and Light Corporation.
American

& Foreign Power Company,

Inc.

American & Foreign Power Company Inc. is a subholding company
in the Electric Bond and Share Company system. Foreign Power,
through direct or indirect ownership of securities, controls a large
number of electric and gas utility companies operating in Cuba,
Mexico and in nine Central and South American countries. Foreign
Power and its subsidiaries were granted exemption from certain provisions of the Act in 1939 by reason of the fact that practically all
of the system's income was derived from foreign subsidiaries. However, the company's unwieldy capital structure with heavy dividend
arrearages, the broad investor interests in the company's securities
and the controlling influence over the company exercised by Bond
and Share were among the circumstances which made it necessary for
the Commission to deny the company the complete exemption which
it sought under section 3 (a) (5).2
With its parent, Bond and Share, Foreign Power filed a plan for
its reorganization pursuant to section 11 (e) in 1944. However, after
obtaining approval of the Commission and an enforcement court
the company was unable to effectuate the financing necessary to
consummate the plan. Subsequently on May 2, 1949, the Commission issued an order pursuant to section 11 (b) (2) requiring Bond
and Share and Foreign Power to reorganize the latter company so

that its capital structure would consist solely of common stock plus
such an amount of debt as would meet the applicable standards of
the Act.!
Foreign Power filed a new reorganization plan in January 1951
and in August of the same year filed an amendment which reflected
the terms of a compromise between Bond and Share and the committees representing various classes of outstanding securities of
Foreign Power. The amended plan provided for a capital structure
of Foreign Power consisting, in addition to then outstanding $10 million of serial bank loans and $50 million of 5 percent Debentures, of
$67,564,600 of new 4.8 percent 35-year Junior Debentures and
6,923,932 shares of new common stock without par value. Pursuant
to the plan, the new securities were distributed as follows: each
share or publicly held $7 Preferred Stock was exchanged for $90
principal amount of 4.8 percent Debentures and 3.75 shares of new
common stock; each publicly held share of $6 Preferred Stock was
exchanged for $80 principal amount of 4.8 percent Debentures and
3 shares of new common stock: for each share of $7 Second Preferred
Stock the holder received 0.85 share or new common stock: and each
share of old common stock was exchanged for 0.02 shares of new
common. The outstanding Option Warrants and Preferred Stock
Allotment Certificates were cancelled. Bond and Share received
3,856,723 shares of new common stock (55.7 percent) for its holdings ot
Foreign Power securities, which included $49,500,000 of notes due in
1955 and substantial amounts of the various classes of outstanding
preferred stock and common stock.' The allocations provided in the
plan reflected a settlement of intercompany claims by Foreign Power
against Bond and Share.
The plan provided for certain changes in the charter and bylaws of Foreign Power designed to give the public stockholders of
Foreign Power an effective vote in connection with corporate matters.
The plan also provided for public representation on the initial board
of directors of Foreign Power and stated that it would be the policy
of the company to maintain public representa'tion on its board in the
future. In approving the plan on November 7, 1951, the Commission
reserved jurisdiction to take such action as may become appropriate
in connection with the carrying out of that policy.'
Foreign Power's plan was approved and ordered enforced on
January 15, 1952, by the United States District Court, District of
Maine," and was consummated on February 29, 1952. Appeal was
taken on January 17, 1952, to the United States Court of Appeals,
First Circuit, and on June 6, 1952, that Court affirmed the order of the
District Court. No further appeal was taken.
American Power & Light Company

On August 22, 1942, American Power & Light Company, then a
holding company subsidiary of Electric Bond and Share Company,
was ordered to dissolve, because its existence constituted an undue
and unnecessary complexity in the Bond and Share system." At
that time American controlled directly or indirectly 35 subsidiaries,

16 of which were public utility companies. American's capital
structure consisted of long term debt, two classes of cumulative
preferred stock with heavy dividend srrearages, and common stock.
At the beginning of the fiscal year 1952, American held only two
utility subsidiaries, The Washington Water Power Company and
Portland Gas & Coke Company, and its capital structure consisted
solely of common stock.
In approving the plan pursuant to which American on February 15,
1950, had distributed most of its previously held assets to its stockholders, the Commission permitted it to retain temporarily the stock
of Washington so as to have some additional time to work out a sale
of this company to public power agencies, which the management of
American believed would be more advantageous to its stockholders
than distribution." After an attempted sale had been blocked by
an order of the Superior Court of the State of Washington on March
28, 1951, prohibiting the public utility districts from acquiring the
common stock of Washington, American on July 31, 1951, filed a
plan under section 11 (e) proposing a cash distribution of $2.00 per
share to each of its common stockholders. In its order setting the
matter down for hearing, the Commission specified that certain
additional issues should be considered. Those issues included, (1)
what further steps should be taken by American in order to comply
with the Commission's order of August 22, 1942, directing its dissolution; (2) whether the Commission should apply to an appropriate
United States district court pursuant to section 11 (d) to enforce
such order; and (3) whether the Commission should approve a plan
which would provide, among other things, for the distribution of
American's holdings of the common stock of Washington to its
stockholders.
In the course of these proceedings Bond and Share and certain
other stockholders, as well as certain officials of the States of Idaho
and Washington, urged that American should be required to distribute the common stock of Washington. At the hearing, American
presented a resolution of its board of directors which stated, in effect,
that unless American had received by January 1, 1952, a proposal
for the sale of the Washington stock which was susceptible of expeditious consummation, American would distribute the stock to its
stockholders. The Commission in its order dated October 15, 1951,
approving the cash distribution directed American to file within 20
days a plan in accordance with the resolution of its board providing
for the distribution of the Washington stock promptly after January
1, 1952, if American had not filed with the Commission by that date
a notification of sale pursuant to rule U-44 (c). The Commission
further stated that if such a plan were not filed within 20 days it
would immediately apply to a United States district court for the
appointment of a trustee, pursuant to section 11 (d)."
Thereafter, American filed a plan for the distribution of the Washington common stock. The plan, however, stated, among other
things, that it would not be effective and would be deemed withdrawn in the event that American had filed with the Commiss'on by
â€¢ Holdlng Company Act release No. 9359.
â€¢ Holdlng Company Act release No. 10820.

January 1, 1952, a notification of a proposed sale of the Washington
common stock pursuant to rule U-44 (c). That plan was set down
for hearing on January 8, 1952,10but the hearing date was postponed
when American notified the Commission on December 26, 1951,
pursuant to rule U-44 (c) of its intention to sell the Washington
common stock to certain public utility districts in the State of
Washington.
On January 18, 1952, the Commission issued a memorandum opinion and order in which it stated that it would treat American's notice
under rule U-44 (c) as a declaration and that a hearing thereon would
be held on January 28, 1952.11 On January 24, 1952, the public
utility districts involved filed with the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, a petition for review of the Commission's order
of January 18, 1952, pursuant to section 24 (a) of the Act and applied
for a stay of the Commission action. On January 25, 19,52,the court
granted petitioners a temporary stay and restrained the Commission
from holding any hearings or taking any other action pursuant to its
order of January 18, 1952, until further order of the court. On
March 14, 1952, the court of appeals dismissed the petition of the
public utility districts and vacated the stay."
A new section 11 (e) plan was filed by American on April 7, 1952.
Among other things, this plan provided that American deliver to
1Yashington as a capital contribution all of its holdings of the securities of its subsidiary, 1Vashington Irrigation & Development Company and $186,000 in cash. The 2,541,800 outstanding shares of no
par value common stock of 1Vashington were to be reclassified into
2,342,411 shares of new common stock without par value and American
proposed to distribute to the holder of each share of its capital stock
one share of Washington's common stock. The Articles of Incorporation of 1Vashington were to be amended prior to this distribution
so as to provide the protective features usually required by the
Commission, including preemptive rights for the common stockholders and cumulative voting provisions. The plan also provided
that on or after the distribution date, no officer, director, or employee
of American or of Bond and Share could serve as an officer or director
of Washington.
On June 5, 1952, the Commission issued its findings, opinion and
order approving the plan.!" The plan was ordered enforced by the
United States District Court for the District of Maine on July 17,
1952,14and was consummated on August 23, 1952.
Portland, the other utility subsidiary of American, amended its
plan of reorganization in the manner required by the Commission's
findings and opinion dated August 29, 1951, so that holders of the
preferred stocks of Portland would be allocated 90 percent of its new
common stock and so that American, which owned all of the old
common stock of Portland, would be allocated 10 percent of the new
shares. The amended plan was approved by the Commission on

to complete its liquidation and dissolution.
Central

Public

Utility Corporat lon

Central Public Utility Corporation is a holding company controlled
by Voting Trustees who are also registered with the Commission in
this capacity as a holding company. The principal assets of Central
Public are its holdings of securities in Consolidated Electric and Gas
Company, which is also a registered holding company. At the time
Central Public and Consolidated registered under the Act, the system
had 47 operating subsidiaries located in 19 states and in the West
Indies, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and the Philippines.
Prior to fiscal year 1952, the system had consummated three section
11 (e) plans. Two of these were concerned with the liquidation of
substantial amounts of system debt and the third provided for retirement of the publicly held preferred stock of Consolidated;"
Since
1941,37 operating subsidiaries have been eliminated from the system.
A fourth plan filed pursuant to section 11 (e) was approved by the
Commission on June 13, 1952.18 In substance, it provides that Central
Public, which had outstanding income bonds, preferred stock, Class A
stock and common stock represented by voting trust ccrtificn.tcs, be
recapitalized into a company having only common stock outstanding.
The new $6 par value common stock is to be distributed to holders of
the income bonds in full settlement of their claims. Because the total
estate on the basis of earnings and assets was found to be insufficient
to satisfy the entire claims of the bondholders, all other security holders
were excluded from participation in the allocation. The plan also
prox ides for termination of the Voting Trust, which had existed since
1932, and for the merger of Consolidated into Central Public. The
plan was ordered enforced by the "United States District Court, District of Delaware, on July 29, 1952.19
It has been indicated that the management contemplates the subsequent elimination of two other subsidiary companies and the distribution of the stock, or proceeds from the sale of the stock, of the
only remaining domestic utility subsidiary, Central Indiana Gas
Company. Thus, ultimately, the Central Public system is expected
to consist of a single holding company over utilities operating outside
the territorial United States and over two nonutilities within the
United States.
Cities

Service Company

Cities Service Company, at the time of its registration in 1941, was
the top holding company in a system containing 125 companies, of
which 49 were electric and gas utility companies. Consolidated assets
totaled approximately one billion dollars. This system owned or
operated properties in each of the 48 states and in several foreign
countries. Utility properties were held by three subholding companies, Cities Service Power & Light Company, Federal Light &

COMMISSION

Traction Co. and Arkansas Natural Gas Corporation, each controlling
one or more utility systems. In proceedings under section 11 (b) of
the Act, the Commission found that Cities should be limited in its
operations to a single integrated gas utility system and required the
disposition of its other interests."
However, Cities expressed a
desire to retain instead its nonutility businesses and, accordingly, the
Commission modified its section 11 (b) (1) order so as to permit
Cities to effectuate compliance by disposing of all of its utility interests."
Two of its former subholding company subsidiaries, Cities Service
Power & Light Company and Federal Light & Traction Company,
have been liquidated. On February 9, 1949, the Commission instituted proceedings under section 11 (b) (2) and other sections of the
Act with respect to Arkansas Natural Gas Corporation. Arkansas
Natural subsequently filed a plan to achieve compliance with the
requirements of section 11 (b) and hearings were held on the plan
in 1950 and 1951.
During the course of the proceedings and after the record of the
case had been substantially completed, Arkansas Natural and Cities,
on December 3, 1951, after discussions with the staff of the Commission, filed an amended plan which, among other things, contained
an offer of settlement of the claims which had been asserted against
Cities and on behalf of Arkansas Natural and its public security
holders. 22 Under the offer of compromise and settlement, Cities
offered to settle all claims against itself by paying approximately
$4,000,000 in cash to the public holders of Arkansas Natural's Class
A and common stocks (with certain exceptions which would exclude
from participation in the settlement those stockholders who, along
with Cities, shared the responsibility for the organization and subsequent management of Arkansas Natural), Under the proposed
offer of settlement, Cities offered to pay $1.50 per share and $0.25
per share, respectively, to the public holders of Arkansas Natural's
Class A stock and common stock not excluded from participation.
Other features of the original plan were essentially unchanged.
Following a segregation of the utility and nonutility properties,
Arkansas Natural proposed to dispose of its holdings in its utility
subsidiary, Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company, as a partial liquidating
dividend and to merge with its other and nonutility subsidiary,
Arkansas Fuel Oil Company, the surviving company to be known as
Arkansas Fuel Oil Corporation. Certain changes in the capital
structure of Arkansas Natural and Arkansas Louisiana were also
provided for. The plan was approved by the Commission on October
1, 1952,23 and proceedings are now pending for its approval and
enforcement by the Unites States District Court for the District of
Delaware. Upon consummation of the plan, Cities will own 51.5%
of the common stock of Arkansas Louisiana and Arkansas Fuel, and
while it intends to retain its interest in the latter company, it is to
dispose expeditiously of its holdings in Arkansas Louisiana.
On December 27, 1951, Cities also consummated the divestment of
Spokane Gas & Fuel Company, a gas utility company operating in
Spokane, Washington. The entire capital stock of the company

Eastern Utilities Associates

Eastern Utilities Associates ("EUA") is a Massachusetts voluntary
association having three direct public-utility subsidiary companies,
Blackstone Valley Gas & Electric Company, Brockton Edison Company and Fall River Electric Light Company, and one indirect
generating public-utility subsidiary company, Montaup Electric
Company.
On April 4, 1950, the Commission issued an order under section
11 (b) of the Act with respect to EUA and its subsidiary companies
which provided in part that EUA within one year terminate its existence and distribute its assets to its shareholders pursuant to a fair
and equitable plan, or within one year acquire a minimum of 90
percent of the outstanding common stock of all of its subsidiary
companies and reclassify its common and convertible stocks into a
single class of stock. This order further provided in effect that in
the event of the adoption of the latter alternative, EUA, within the
one year period, would sever its ownership or control of the gas utility
properties owned by Blackstone. 25
On May 17, 1950, EUA filed a reorganization plan under section
11 (e) of the Act for the purpose of complying with the Commission's
Order of April 4, 1950, and on August 17, 1950, the Commission
approved step 1 of the plan." Under this step, EVA acquired 129,882
additional shares of Fall River's capital stock from New England
Electric System and now owns in excess of 90 percent of the outstanding common stock of each of its direct subsidiary companies.
EVA's reorganization plan has been amended from time to time and
extensive hearings have been held thereon. It is replete with complicated legal and factual problems which involve, among other
things, a substantial amount of permanent financing and the allocation of new common stock to EVA's common and convertible shareholders. Groups and committees representing such shareholders have
vigorously supported their respective conflicting positions.
On May 20, 1952, the Commission in a letter to all of the participants expressed its concern 'with the progress of the case and requested
their cooperation with the time schedule set for the hearings under
which it was expected that the record would be closed as quickly as
possible. During June 1952, all of the groups and committees representing EVA's common and convertible shareholders conferred
among themselves and with the staff of the Commission and, on July
10, 1952, reached a compromise agreement with respect to, among
other things, the allocation ratios governing the distribution of new
common stock between such shareholders. EVA thereafter submitted
its Amended Plan No.4 to incorporate the substance of this agreement
and hearings were reconvened on September 16, 1952. The plan no
longer provides for a merger or consolidation of any of the system
companies into the newly organized Eastern Edison Company as
indicated in the 17th Annual Report, and EVA will continue as top
holdiug company. The plan was approved by the Commission on

Electric Bond and Share Cornparry

The Electrio Bond and Share Company system was the largest to
register under the Act. At the time of its registration in 1938, it
control.ed 121 domestic subsidiaries including five major subholding
companies with combined assets of nearlv $3,500,000,000. These
subholding companies were American & Foreign Power Company,
Inc., American Gas and Electric Company, American Power & Light
Company, Electric Power & Light Corporation and Kational Power
& Light Company. Bond and Share has disposed of its holdings in
Amerir-s n Gas and National.
Electric has been dissolved and the
liquidation of American, as described earlier in the report, is nearing
oo-nplorion.
Bond and Share retains a substantial interest in Foreign
I'owor whose recent reorganization is described above under a senarate
heading. It also owns 27 percent of the common stock of United
GaÂ« Corporation, the entire equity of Ebasco Services, Incorporated,
and other minor holdings.
Bond and Share's holdings in United Gas were acquired in the
course of Electric's dissolution and we approved the acquisition subjeet to a comrnitrnent by Bond and Share to dispose of these holdings
within 1 year of receipt, with the right reserved to Bond and Sharp,
however, to institute appropriate proceedings for relief from this
commitment. On February 6, 1952, the Commission issued its findings, opinion and order which denied Bond an I Sharp's request for
relief from its commitment to dispose of its holdings of United Gas.
That request was made as part of Bond and Share's auplication for
approval of its Amended Plan III and of its request for exernution
from provisions of the Act. The plan had contemplated that Bond
and Sharp would retain its interest in Foreign Power, Ebasco and
United Gas and that it would dispose of its other holdings of securities
using the procec-ls for future risk capital investment, Bond and
Share proposed to continue as an exempt holding company and
register as an invr-strnont company under the Investment Company
Act. The Commission limited hearings with respect to Bond and
Share's application to the question of whether Bond and Share might
retain its holdinzs of United Gas. and, to the extent relevant to this
issue, to a consideration of Bond and Shure's application for exemption. The Commission found that there was no basis under the
standards of th.3 Act applicable either to acquisitions or exernntions
for relieving Bond and Share from its previous comrnitrnent to dispose
of the United Gas stock. However, tho Commission made no findings
with r-spect to tho other issues raised by Bond and Share's nlan,
inclu-ling its proposal to hocoma an investment company."

On June 13, 1952, Bond and Share filed a new plan similar to that
described above as Amended Plan III, except that Bond and Share
would, during the period 1952 to 1955, reduce its holdings of United
Gas stock to less than 5 percent of the total outstanding

This is proposed to be accomplished
through capital distributions,
dividend distributions
and rights offerings to the stockholders
of
Bond and Share of the United Gas stock.
Hearings commenced on
this plan shortly after the close of the fiscal year.
On July 30, 1952, the Commission issued its memorandum
opinion
and order approving a plan filed by Bond and Share proposing the
disposition of its holdings of the common stock of The WasLington
Water Power Company which it received as a result of the distribution of such stock by American Power. 29 This plan was submitted

1951,30 and pursuant to its terms Bond and Share will distribute as a
dividend to its stockholders in December 1952 that number of shares
of Washington

this order was sustained on October 29, 1951, by the enforcement

court."
On January 21, 1952, the Commission entered its findings, opinion
and order authorizing the trustee to make quarterly payments of
87~ cents per share to the preferred stockholders of IHES pending
determination of the issues raised by Part III of the Trustee's Plan
with respect to the allocation of the remaining assets of IRES between its preferred and Class A stockholders and with respect to the
contention made by Class A stockholders that IHES should be
permitted to continue in existence as an investment company;" The
Commission's order was sustained by the enforcement court on
April 8, 1952.3!
On February 14, 1952, the Commission heard oral argument on
Part III of the Trustee's Plan. While this matter was under consideration by the Commission, the trustee obtained offers for the purchase of all the properties of ENYP, consisting of electric properties
(largely hydro) in the State of New York, and water power properties
and undeveloped or partially developed water power sites in the
States of New York and Maine; he also obtained an offer for the
purchase of IHES' interests in its other subsidiaries, Corinth and
Moreau. The highest offers for the several properties totaled
$25,600,000. Hearings on the proposals were held in April 1952
and on June 5, 1952, the Commission issued its findings, opinion and
order approving the execution by the trustee, upon satisfactorily
resolving the tax problems involved, of definitive contracts for the
sale of the properties at the amounts specified in the several offers.36
It is expected that if the sales are consummated as proposed, a
reconsideration of the allocation problems may be required. Accordingly, the Commission has withheld action on Part III of the
Trustee's Plan.
Investment

Bond and Share Corporation

Investment Bond and Share Corporation ("IBS") did not register
with the Commission until July 2, 1951, subsequent to an investigation by the staff of the Commission which disclosed that IBS had been
a holding company as defined by the statu te for a number of years.
At the time of registration, lBS had five direct subsidiaries. These
included a gas utility company, Jacksonville Gas Corporation, an
electric utility company, Eastern Kansas Utilities, Inc. ("EKU")
and three nonutility enterprises, including a telephone holding company with six telephone operating subsidiaries.
On August 8, 1951, lBS submitted a plan under section 11 (e) of
the Act designed to effect its liquidation and dissolution; the Commission instituted proceedings under section 11 (b) and a hearing on

proposed the payment of all of its debts, the retirement of its Class A
stock by the payment of $33 per share plus accrued dividends, and
the distribution of its remaining assets pro rata to holders of the Class
B stock. Since the Class B stock was held almost entirely by three
families which controlled the system, the plan included provisions for
subsequent disposition by such parties of the shares of Jacksonville
and EKU to be received by them in the distribution of assets. A
portion of the common shares of Jacksonville owned by IBS are to
be sold to Jacksonville at a price equal to the cost to IBS.
In approving the plan on July 10, 1952, the Commission noted
that IBS had acquired control of Jacksonville without its approval.
IBS had acquired its holdings of the stock of EKU under the same
conditions. This raised legal questions regarding profits realized
from such illegal acquisitions and the possible rescission rights of
the vendors of such stock. At the suggestion of the Commission's
staff, IBS had inserted provisions in the plan to afford vendors of the
Jacksonville and EKU stocks an opportunity to assert any claims
for rescission they might have under section 26 (c) of the statute
The Commission concluded that the amended plan offered an appropriate resolution of the issues, but withheld its approval pending the
filing of an appropriate amendment proposing to increase the payment to the Class A stockholders to $37 per share and to establish a
restriction on payment of dividends by Jacksonville out of prior
earned surplus." IBS filed such an amendment and the plan was
approved." On September 17, 1952, the Commission found that
the transactions proposed in the plan had been consummated, and
issued its order under section 5 (d) declaring that IBS had ceased to
be a holding company and terminating its registration."
New England Public Service Company

At the time of its registration in 1935, New England Public Service
Company ("NEPSCO") had five operating utility subsidiaries,
of which two operated in Maine, one in New Hampshire and two in
New Hampshire and Vermont. It also owned, through an industrial
subsidiary, five textile mills, a paper company, and a forest products
manufacturing company. The company was heavily overcapitalized
with two outstanding classes of preferred stock, on which substantial
dividend arrearages had accumulated, and common stock. As a
result of simplification proceedings instituted by the Commission
under section 11 (b) (2) of the Act, the company was directed in 1941
to reorganize on a one-stock basis or, in the alternative at its election,
to liquidate and dissolve." The management of NEPSCO elected
to liquidate and subsequent steps have been taken toward this end.
NEPSCO's parent is Northern New England Company, which is
also a registered holding company under order of the Commission to
Iiquidate.!'
In addition to the merger and disposition of several of its smaller
subsidiaries, NEPSCO has sold its interest in the industrial companies. The proceeds from this sale and a $13,500,000 bank loan
provided the funds for the retirement of its prior lien preferred
stocks. On June 30, 1952, the bank loan was completely repaid.

Pennsylvania

Gas & Electric Corpora t lon

Pennsylvania Gas & Electric Corporation ("Penn Corp") registered with the Commission in 1'\ovcmber 1936 and at that time it had
19 subsidiary companies. Its utility operations were conducted in
SEctions of New York, Pennsylvania, ~Iassachusetts, Rhode Island
and Virginia. The system included 15 gas utility companies, three
wholesale gas companies and one service company. Three of the
utility subsidiaries, Xorth Penn Gas Company, Pennsylvania Gas &
Electric Company, name later changed to York County Gas Company,
and Saugerties Gas Light Company were also subholding companies.
As described in thr- 17th Annual Report, Penn Corp has already
completed the major steps in accomplishing compliance with the
requirements of section 11 (b). Penn Corp's system presentlv includes two gas utility companies, North Penn Gas Company which
IS also a registered holding company and Crystal City Gas Company

be approved only if certain modifications, as recited, wore provided
by amendment.
An amended plan embodying tho modifications
was filed on September 19, 1952.
Mission Oil Company
Sou tbwester-n Development

Company

At the beginning of the fiscal year, the stock of Southwestern
Development Company was owned 47.28 percent by Mission Oil
Company, representing virtually the only assets of that company; 51
percent by Sinclair Oil Company, and 1.72 percent by minority
interests.
Sinclair also held about 4 percent of the stock of Mission.
Mission and Southwestern were registered holding companies; Sinclair was primarily engaged in the production and refining of petroleum
products and had been granted exemption from certain provisions of
the Act.45
After numerous conferences with the Commission's staff, Mission
and Southwestern in June 1951 filed with the Commission a section
I 1 (e) plan designed to effectuate compliance with the provisions of
section 11 (b). In brief the plan provided for the liquidation and
dissolution of Mission, the limitation of the operations of the Southwestern system to a single integrated public utility system and
certain nonutility business whose operations are reasonably incidental or appropriate thereto and the divestment by Southwestern
of all its other nonutility interests.
The plan was approved on
December 21, 1951,46 and, in connection therewith, Sinclair registered under the Act, joined in the plan as amended so as to provide
for the divestment of its interests in Mission, Southwestern and
their subsidiaries, and was subsequently granted all exemption from
the provisions of the Act, excepting sections 11 (b), (c) and (e),
and section 9 (a) (2).41
One of the important accomplishments of the plan was t h.. elimination of highly complex intrasyst em operating and financial relationships between two of Southwestern's nonutility subsidiaries, Canadian River Gas Company and Colorado Interstate Cas Company.
Canadian River was engaged in the business of producing, transmitting and selling natural gas at wholesale to system affiliates,
mcluding Colorado, and to nonaffiliat es. It owned natural gas
rights in the Texas Panhandle field subject to the reservation of the
prior right to such gas by certain other of Southwestern's subsidiaries
to the extent of their requirements.
Colorado was a pipeline camp.my selling natural gas at wholesale.
Sout hwcst ern cw r cd 2.11 of
the common stock of Canadian River and 42.5 percent of that of Colorado. Colorado purchased the major portion of its gas requirements from Canadian River at cost, excluding any allowance for
depreciation, depletion and intangible drilling costs, pursuant to a
contract under which it was obligated, as long as it elected to take
gas from Canadian River, to furnish Canadian River with t l,c ft;l:'ts

necessary to meet all expenditures for operat.ions and all capital
requirements. However, while Southwestern was the owner of
Canadian River, all of the latter's profits, computed on a cash basis,
went to Colorado as long as it purchased gas under the contract.
Colorado had supplied substantial sums to Canadian River pursuant to this contract, but because it did not own the company. it
could not use Canadian River's property which had a net book value
of approximatelv $12,500,000 as a basis for financing and thus was
unable to finance economically and advantageously the development
of Canadian River's reserves and needed additional pipeline capacity.
Under the plan, this impediment was removed by transferring Canaian River's assets to Colorado in return for which Southwestern received the rights to revenues derived from the sale of natural gasoline
extracted from Canadian River's present gas reserves, which revenues
under the existing contract had gone to Colorado. The rights to
these revenues were given to Southwestern as consideration for its
reversionary rights in the assets and earnings of Canadian River
which, it was estimated, would mature about 1972 when Colorado
would probably find it no longer advantageous to continue to take gas
from Canadian River. In addition to the advantages of an improved
financing position and of simplified operations, Colorado's acquisition
of Canadian River's assets resulted in tax benefits to it, including
the advantages of being able to avail itself of the deductions for
depreciation, depletion and intangible drilling costs applicable to
the acquired assets.
The transfer of Canadian River to Colorado was accomplished undel' the plan by merging the two companies as of December 31, 1951.
Prior to the merger, Canadian River conveyed to a new company,
Wesf.pan Hydrocarbon Company, t.he rights to the natural gasoline
"in place" in Canadian River's natural gas reserves. Westpan issued
to Canadian River 727,757.05 shares of common stock in exchange for
the gasoline rights. It also assured to Colorado the benefits of the
intangible and depletion tax credits on account of the gasoline "in
place" in the Canadian River natural gas reserves, and entered into
an operating contract under which Colorado extracts, processes, and
delivers the gasoline to Westpan and receives a portion of the proceeds, estimated to cover Colorado's cost in connection therewith.
Canadian River transferred to its parent, Southwestern, as a liquidating dividend, the 727,757.05 shares of Westpan stock on about
January 20, 1952.
As steps to facilitate the dissolution of Mission, pursuant to the
plan Colorado's 1,250,000 shares of no par common stock were reclassified into 1,710,016.60 shares of $5.00 par value common stock and
in connection therewith $6,197,141.83 was transferred from earned
surplus to capital stock account, and Southwestern's outstanding
40,806 shares of no par common stock was reclassified into 727,757.05
shares of $5.00 par value common stock and in connection therewith
$2,867,432.18 was transferred from earned surplus to capital stock
account. Southwestern distributed to its stockholders its holdings of
42% percent of the new Colorado stock on about March 6, 1952.
Thereafter, on April 6, 1952, Sinclair sold to underwriters for public
distribution the 371,172.86 shares of the new Colorado stock which
it received through the distribution thereof by Southwestern. Southwestern also distributed to its stockholders its holdings of 727,757.05

shares of the $0.10 par value common stock of Westpan. This distribution was made about June 15, 1952.
Mission Oil, on July 7, 1952, commenced the distribution to its
stockholders of its holdings of 47.28 percent of the common stock of
Southwestern and the common stocks of Colorado and West pan which
it received through the distributions by Southwestern on the basis of
one share of the stock of each of these companies for each share of
Mission's outstanding stock. Upon completion of this distribution,
Mission Oil is to be liquidated and dissolved. Sinclair has disposed
through market sales of the common stock of Colorado received
through the distribution thereof by Mission Oil and is to dispose of
its holdings of the common stock of Southwestern and the common
stock of Westpan received through the distributions by Southwestern
and Mission Oil under the plan. It is then expected to qualify for an
order under section 5 (d) declaring that it has ceased to be a holding
company.
All interlocking officer and director relationships between Sinclair,
Mission Oil and Southwestern, and those between such companies
and Colorado and Westpan, are to be terminated prior to, or at the
time of, the respective distributions and dispositions. Southwestern
and its remaining wholly owned subsidiaries, consisting of four gas
utility companies, a pipeline company, and a production company,
are to continue in operation as a registered holding company system.
Standard Power and Light Corporation
Standard Gas and Electric Company

In 1936 the Standard holding company system consisted of 105
active companies operating in 20 States and in Mexico, including the
two top holding companies, Standard Power & Light Corporation and
its subsidiary, Standard Gas & Electric Company. By June 30, 1952,
the system had been reduced to 13 companies of which 6 were utility
subsidiaries.
In February 1951, Standard Gas filed a new section 11 (e) plan
with the Commission,"
The plan includes four steps. Step I would
effect the retirement of the company's $7 and $6 prior preference
stock; Step II is intended to accomplish the liquidation and dissolution of Standard Gas including the delivery to the holders of that
company's $4 cumulative preferred stock of shares of Duquesne
Light Company common stock, and the delivery to the holders of
Standard Gas' common stock of the common stock of Philadelphia
Company; Step III would eliminate the minor subsidiaries of Philadelphia, including disposition of Pittsburgh Railways Company; and
Step IV proposes the dissolution of Philadelphia and the distribution
to its common stockholders of its holdings of Duquesne Light Company.
During the fiscal year 1952, hearings were completed on Step I of
the plan and on Step lA, which is a supplement to Step I filed to
settle" intercompany claims between Standard Gas and its parent
Standard Power through the transfer of 31,000 shares of common
stock of Duquesne by Standard Gas to Standard Power and the
cancellation of Standard Gas' note for $983,930 held by Standard
Power.
After the close of hearings on Step I, representatives of Standard
Gas, Standard Power and Standard Gas' security holders in response

to the Commission's request for early settlement of their differences,
agreed to compromise that step.
Pursuant to this compromise
agreement, Step I was amended on July 7, 195249 to provide that the
holders of each share of Standard Gas' $7 Prior Preference Stock would
receive approximately 4.8 shares of common stock of Wisccnsin
Public Service Corp. (instead of 4.3 shares as previously proposed),
2.9 shares of common stock of Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company
and 2.1 shares of common stock of Duquesne.
The holders of each
share of $6 Prior Preference Stock would receive approximately 4.5
shares of common stock of Wisconsin (instead of 4.0 shares as previously proposed), 2.6 shares of common stock of Oklahoma and 1.8
shares of common stock of Duquesne.
A hearing on the amended
plan was held on July 24, 1952, and Steps I and IA were approved
on October 1, 19.52.50 After the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware approved the plan and ordered its enforcement
on November 7, 1952,51 the distributions of securities provided under
the plan were made by Standard on December 1, 1952.
The compromise agreement, which expedited the processing of
Step I, also covers Step II of the plan. It provided for an amendment
to be filed for the retirement of Standard Gas' $4 cumulative preferred
stock by the delivery in exchange for each share thereof of four
shares of common stock of Duquesne.
In April 1952, the Commission rendered its decision on the plan
for the simplification of the corporate structure of the holding company
system of Philadelphia.P
As described in previous annual reports.
that plan proposed the retirement of the noncallable 5 percent and 6
percent preferred stocks of Philadelphia and of the 6 percent preferred
stock of the Consolidated Gas Company of the City of Pittsburgh, an
inactive subsidiary of Philadelphia, on which Philadelphia had guaranteed certain dividends. The Commission indicated that it would
approve the plr n if modified to increase the allocations as follows:
(1) For each shu re of Philadelphia's 6 percent noncallable preferred
stock having a par value of $50 per share, $13 in cash, rather than
$3.50 as proposed, plus one share of 4 percent preferred stock (par
value of $50 per share) of Duquesne, Philadelphia's only remaining
utility subsidiary; (2) for each share of 5 percent preferred stock of
Philadelphia (par value of $10 per share), $12 in cash instead of $11
as proposed; and for each share of preferred stock of the Consolidated
Gas Company of the City of Pittsburgh, having a par value of $50
per share and guaranteed by Philadelphia as to dividends at the rate
of 4 percent per annum, one share of 4 percent preferred stock of
Duquesne instead of 85/100 share as proposed. Standard filed amendments to conform to this decision on July 11, 1952, and on August 22,
1952, the Commission approved the plan as amended. 53 Following
approval by the enforcement court," the plan was consummated OIl
November 1, 1952.
At the same time the amendments were filed to the plan for retirement of Philadelphia's noncallable securities, Standard filed a plan

by the distribution to the holder of each share thereof of 3.6 shares
of common stock of Duquesne. It is anticipated that hearings on
this proposal will be held in December 1952.
In the spring of 1952, Philadelphia filed a plan proposing the sale
of its officebuilding in Pittsburgh occupied by the Philadelphia system
companies. 55 It had been owned by Equitable Real Estate Company,
formerly a direct subsidiary of Philadelphia, which was dissolved ill
1951. Philadelphia has entered into an agreement, subject to approval
of the Commission, to sell this building to the Mellon 1\ ational Bank &
Trust Company, which would lease the building to Duquesne for a
period of 35 years. The Commission ordered a hearing on this plan
to determine whether competitive conditions were maintained in the
proposed sale and lease transaction. The matter is presently pending
before the Commission.
Determination of the treatment to be accorded the holders of its
$5 preference stock and the sale of the central office building will
bring Philadelphia close to its liquidation and dissolution, as required
by the Commission's order of June 1, 1948.
The United Corporation

The United Corporation registered as a holding company in March
1938, at which time its portfolio was comprised principally of the
common stocks of four holding company subsidiaries. These subsidiaries together with the percentages of voting control held by United,
were as follows: The United Gas Improvement Company, 26.2 percent; Public Service Corporation of "t\ew Jersey, 13 9 percent; Niagara
Hudson Power Corporation, 23.4 percent; and Columbia Gas & EIE'Ctric Corporation, 19.6 percent. United also had other substantial
interests, principally in utility holding and operating companies.
These subsidiary holding companies underwent extensive reorganizations under section 11 and the interests of United in their common
stocks, or in the common stocks of their successors, have been substantially reduced. United has effectuated the retirement of all of
its outstanding preference stock largely through the exchange of
securities of reorganized subsidiaries. Substantial blocks of portfolio
securities have also been disposed of through sales in the open market.
In November 1949, United submitted a new proposal, in response
to the conditions contained in a previous order of the Commission,
which provided a comprehensive and detailed program for effectuating
compliance with the provisions of section 11. After successive modifications, the Commission on June 26, 1951, approved the amended
plan which provided, among other things, for (1) a limited offer to
United's common stockholders permitting them to withdraw from
the company and receive cash or shares of Niagara Mohawk Power
Corporation common stock for their holdings in United; (2) cancellation of United's option warrants; (3) sale of United's stock holdings
in the South Jersey Gas Company; (4) amendment of United's
Certificate of Incorporation to provide for cumulative voting and
amendment of its bylaws to increase the quorum requirement at
stockholders' meetings; and (5) the reduction by United of all of its
holdings of voting securities of public utility companies to amounts
not to exceed 4.9 percent of the respective outstanding voting securities of each such company. All of these steps were to be taken
.. Holding

with a view to transforming United into an investment eompany.t"
In July 1951, United undertook the exchange offer provided by
the plan. Holders of 100 or more shares of United's common stock
were offered the opportunity to exchange their stock for shares of
Niagara Mohawk common stock having an average market value
equal to 97 percent of the average net asset value of the United stock
surrendered. Holders of less than 100 shares were offered an opportunity to surrender their shares for cash in an amount equal to the
average net asset value of the United stock surrendered. Pursuant
to this plan, of 14,529,492 shares of United's common stock outstanding, 362,616 shares were exchanged for 69,566.6 shares of Niagara
Mohawk's common stock and 95,051 shares were surrendered for cash.
In August 1951, petitions to review certain aspects of the plan were
filed in the United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia, by
certain common stockholders. By order dated November 15, 1951,
the court directed that the Commission's order approving the plan
be stayed pending review, insofar as the order provided for the disposition by United of its shares of Niagara Mohawk's common stock.
Proceedings in the court are still pending.
At the time of the approval of the plan by the Commission, United
owned 11.9 percent of the voting securities of Niagara Mohawk. As
a result of certain sales by United of its holdings of Class A stock of
Niagara Mohawk and the public offering in January 1952 of one
million additional shares of common stock by Niagara Mohawk, the
holdings by United of voting securities of Niagara Mohawk have been
reduced to 9.57 percent of the total outstanding amount of such
securities as of June 30, 1952. The status of Niagara Mohawk, as
a subsidiary of United, has not been determined.
In January 1952, pursuant to authority given to it when the Commission approved the plan, United endeavored to negotiate the saleofits
holdings of 154,230 shares of the common stock of South Jersey,
representing 28.25 percent of the voting securities of that company.
These efforts were unsuccessful and United subsequently proposed to
make a public offering of its holdings of such common stock in accordance with the competitive bidding requirements of rule U-50. Three
bids were received in response to United's invitation and the stock
was awarded at a price of $15.379 per share in July 1952.07 As a
result, United has ceased to hold as much as 5 percent of the voting
securities of any public utility company, with the exception of Niagara
Mohawk, and its proposed sales of Niagara Mohawk stock to reduce
its holdings to less than 5 percent of the outstanding voting securities
has been stayed as indicated above by the Court of Appeals, District
of Columbia, pending review of the Commission's order approving the
plan.
In November 1951, United requested authority during such time
as may elapse until it ceases to be a holding company and starts functioning as an investment company, to invest funds in an amount
equal in the aggregate to the proceeds derived by it from divestments
required by previous orders of the Commission dated August 14, 1943,
and June 26, 1951. The only limitation proposed was that acquisitions of securities of public utility companies and holding companies
would not exceed 4.9 percent of the total outstanding voting securities

of such companies. On May 2, 1952, the Commission issued its
findings and opinion, stating that in view of the status of the review
proceedings in the court of appeals, United should maintain as to
any new investments, sufficient diversification of its portfolio to permit ready disposition thereof. Accordingly, United was not authorized to invest more than $1 million in anyone company, or to acquire
as much as 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of anyone
company, or to acquire more than 1 percent of the voting securities
of any public utility company or of any holding company exempt as
such from provisions of the Act. Excluded entirely from the scope
of the authorized investments are securities of registered holding
companies or subsidiaries thereof or securities of any public utility
or holding company which is, or has been, a statutory subsidiary of

The United Gas Improvement

Company

The United Gas Improvement Company is a registered holding
company incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania and having
nine subsidiary companies all operating within Pennsylvania. Six of
these are gas utility companies, one is a gas and electric utility company and two are nonutilities. At the time of its registration with
the Commission in March 1938, the UGr system embraced 55 corporate entities.
On December 29, 1951, UGr filed an application for approval of a
comprehensive plan pursuant to section 11 (e) of the Act embodying
the following major steps: (1) The conversion of UGr from a holding
company to a public utility operating company through the merger
into UGr of all of its public utility subsidiaries and the dissolution of
its non-utility subsidiaries, such merger being accompanied by exchanges of securities so that all present security holders of UGr and
its subsidiaries will become owners of securities in the surviving company; (2) the disposition by UGr of its securities in nonsubsidiary
companies, except a note of Delaware Coach Companyj " and (3) the
securing of an order pursuant to section 5 (d) of the Act declaring that
UGr has ceased to be a holding company and that its registration
under the Act shall cease to be in effect.
Hearings on the company's plan were held and the plan was approved by the Commission on September 18, 1952.60 The plan was
approved and ordered enforced by the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on November 12, 1952,61
and its consummation has been set for December 31, 1952. The Commission has reserved jurisdiction to consider entry of an order under
section 5 (d) declaring that UGr has ceased to be a holding company.

COMMISSION"

holding company systems under section 11 of the Act is the determination of the amounts of fees and reimbursements of expenses to
be allowed to attorneys, experts, and other persons who have participated in the proceedings as representatives of the affected companies
or as represents tives of holders of the various classes of securities
involved.
Because the determination of the amounts of fees and expenses is
predicated primarily upon the benefits conferred in the reorganization
proceedings, it is not feasible to process fee applications until the
reorganization plan has been consummated. The usual procedure in
such matters is for the Commission to insert in its order approving
the plan of reorganization a reservation of jurisdiction over fees and
reimbursements of expenses claimed. It is for this reason that the
volume of work on fee cases has followed a rising trend in recent
years, even though the section 11 programs of most systems
are rapidly approaching completion. It is likely that the Commission's work load in connection with fee applications may continue at
a high level for as long as two years following the termination of other
section 11 work.
In considering applications for fees and reimbursements of expenses,
the Commission applies principles which are generally similar to
those employed by the Federal courts in passing upon fees and
expenses claimed in connection with reorganization plans under the
Bankruptcy Act, except, of course, that due weight is given to special
circumstances inherent in reorganizations under section 11 of the
Holding Company Act. It is the basic duty of the Commission to
accomplish the statutory objectives as economically as possible and
at a minimum expense to the estate. Therefore, two major objectives
of the Commission are to protect estates in reorganization from
exorbitant charges and at the same time grant fair compensation to
those participating in the proceedings so as to afford adequate public
representation in the process. In determining the amount of the
compensation to be allowed, the primary factor is the amount of
benefit conferred upon the estate or the security holders by the
services rendered. Among other factors to be considered are the size
of the estate and its ability to pay the compensation requested, the
necessity of the sen ices and expenditures sought to be reimbursed,
avoidance of duplication of efforts, the intricacies and magnitude of
the reorganization problems involved, the conflicts between the
personal interests of the fee claimants and the interests of the persons
whom they represent in the proceedings, the technical ability and
experience of the applicants and the reasonable amount of time
required to render the services in question.P
In the fiscal year 1952 the Commission decided 14 fee cases in
which compensation aggregating $3,495,000 was allowed as against
total fees and expenses requested in the amount of $5,722,000. These
cases arose out of the reorganizations of the following holding company
systems:

These cases presented a wide range of issues and several of the
general principles noted above were applied. The following illustrative cases indicate how these tests were applied, particularly the
primary test of whether the services rendered benefited the estate.
In the Northern. States Power Company (Del.) case,53counsel for both
the Delaware company and its subsidiary, Northern States Power
Company, a Minnesota company, participated actively in the proceedings. However, the efforts of both counsel were devoted in large
part to supporting plans which the Commission found unsatisfactory
and as a result the laboring oar in carrying through the plan as finally
consummated passed to various counsel for the common stockholders
of the Delaware company who performed valuable services for which
they were compensated. The record also indicated a certain amount
of duplication of effort. As a result, the compensation allowed to
eounsel for the companies was less than that requested. A represcutut ive of a preferred ator-kholders' committee was allowed less compensation than requested because the record showed that. while the commit.tee had rendered constructive assistance, it coulc] not claim credit
for any specific feature of the plan which was ultime n-ly adopted. III
the same case the representative of another eomrnit t ee for the same
class of stockholders stressed as a basis for its claim to compensation
the fact that it had secured a high degree of representution.
TIll'
Commission considered this to be of little significance and only modest,
eompcnsat.ion was allowed since the committee's part icipation in the
proceedings had been relatively ineffectuul. The rcprcsr-nt at.ivc of all
unorganized group of security holders, not qualified under the Commission's rule U-62 , was also granted substantial compensation
because he had served as the leading advocate of the position of the
common stock and had contributed important benefits to the rcorganzation proceedings. Other representatives of the common stockholders whose efforts contributed to the defeat of a plan providing a.
lower allocation to those stockholders and to the adoption of an increased allocation were awarded compensation, but the representative
of another individual security holder was denied compensation in the
absence of any showing of demonstrable benefits.

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

In the The Middle West Corporation case, a member of a common
stockholders' committee was allowed reduced compensation. He had
made important contributions to the defeat of an unsuccessful plan
and to the adoption of the plan which was approved by the Commission. However, the record showed that the amount of work and time
expended were in excess of those required and there was evidence of
some duplication of effort."
In the Electric Power and Light Corporation case, the representative
of a preferred stockholders' committee applied for fees totaling
$500,000. The company opposed the application on the grounds that
the efforts of the committee representative were duplicative and some
were not of a constructive nature. In evaluating the services of this
applicant the Commission considered, among other things, his long
experience at the bar and his particular skill in reorganization matters;
the fact that he had opposed a plan which failed; and that the plan
ultimately approved and consummated accorded the class of securities
which he represented a substantially greater participation in the
estate than would have been received pursuant to the abandoned
plan. The application was granted in the reduced amount of
$140,000.65
An application filed by a law firm representin~ an individual
preferred stockholder in the reorganization of the SiouÂ» City Gas &
Electric Company system was denied, the Commission finding that
the position advocated, even though conscientiously presented, did
not affect the final outcome of the plan and that no compensable
benefit had otherwise been conferred upon the estate."
In the Engineers Public Seroice Company case, the representative
of an individual common stockholder, while allowed a modest amount
for his contribution to an aspect of the plan, was denied the substantial compensation which he sought for the reason that he did
not enter the case until the end of the administrative proceeding and
his main participation was in the courts where he was ultimately
unsuccessful in upsetting the decision of the Commission." The fee
claimant has contested the denial of his fee request before the enforcement court, where the matter is pending.
In the Northern States Power Company (Del.) case, applications
for fees and expenses were also submitted by Standard Gas and Electric
Company, the parent of Northern States Power Company (Del.), and
its counsel, and by a representative of an unorganized group of
Standard's preferred stock and his counsel. The Commission denied
these applications pointing out that Standard, as the parent of the
Delaware Company, was responsible for the complexities which were
required to be eliminated under the Act and that equity demanded
that the fees and expenses of its counsel and of persons representing its
stockholders should be borne by it alone, and not by the Delaware
company." Standard is contesting this decision before the enforcement court.
Similarly, in Electric Power and Light Corporation, the Commission
denied the application for fees and expenses submitted by the parent
of a subsidiary holding company for services rendered in connection

with the reorganization of the latter company. As in the Northern
States Power case the Commission refused to allow the counsel and
experts for the parent holding company and representatives of security
holders of the parent holding company compensation from the estate
of its subsidiary for services performed in connection with the latter
company's reorganization."
The problem of duality and conflict of interests of participants
in reorganization proceedings also received attention in two cases
during the year. In the Sioux City Gas and Electric Company case,
the fees and expenses requested by one of the applicants were denied,
the Commission pointing out, as one of the reasons for denying the
claim, that applicant had purchased securities representing an interest
adverse to that of his clients."
. In Electric Power and Light Corporation the Commission emphasized
that it was essential for those who are solving the problems of a company in reorganization under section 11 to concern themselves solely
with the interests of the persons or security holders whom they represent and the estate and not to engage personally in the trading in
securities of the affected companies and that this principle was no less
applicable to management and its counsel then to protective committees and their counsel and expert advisers." The limited trading
by certain of the applicants was examined by the Commission ana
taken into consideration in reaching its determination as to the
amount of compensation allowable.
In the proceedings involving the reorganization of American
Ligkt & Tradion Company and its parent, The United Light and
Railways Company, Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation had expended considerable sums in fees and expenses for counsel and certain experts retained to protect its position as the holder of 43.8
percent of the preferred stock and 4.31 percent of the common stock
of American Light. Allied applied for reimbursement of its expenditures. Allied had made important contributions to the defeat
of the former liquidation plan and in obtaining fair treatment for
the noncallable preferred stock in the integration and simplification
plan finally approved under section 11. Allied also produced valuation evidence which was very helpful in determining the amount to
be paid for retirement of the preferred stock of American Light.
The Commission noted, however, that Allied did not purport to act
in a representative capacity for other preferred stockholders, that
part of its several counsel's services were duplicative among themselves, and that a considerable portion of Allied's activities were
directed solely to protect their own particular situation rather than
on behalf of the entire class. The Commission substantially reduced
the requested compensation."

nonutilitv properties by registered systems, but it has also encouraged
exchanges and acquisitions of properties by systems which are to
continue as integrated regional organizations. .Many of the continuing systems including American Gas and Electric Company, The
Southern Company, The West Penn Electric Company, Ohio Edison
Company and Xliddle South Utilities, Inc., have acquired contiguous
properties and have made them a part of their interconnected systems.
As activity under section 11 nears completion. this phase of integration assumes increasing importance and is no longer an incidental
factor. The emphasis is shifting to the implementation of that portion
of section 30 of the Holding Company Act which states:
The Commission is authorized and directed to make studies and investigatlons
of public-utility companies, the territories served or which can be served by publicutility companies, and the manner in which the same are or can be served, to
determine the sizes, types and locations of public-utility companies which do or
can operate most economically and efficiently in the public interest, in the interest of investors and consumers, and in furtherance of a wider and more economical use of gas and electric energy; upon the basis of such investigations-and
studies the Commission shall make public from time to time its recommendations as to the type and srze of geographically and economically integrated publicutility systems which, having regard for the nature and character of the locality
served, can best promote and harmonize the interests of the pu blic, the investor,
and the consumer. * * *

Many reports prepared in ourlior years by the staff in connection
with section 11 enforcement have embodied the characteristics of the
section 30 studies described in the statute. However, the Commission
recognizes that this authorization given to it b)' the Congress is more
comprehensive. It is not limited to service areas of registered
systems. It rather affords a broad opportunity to assist in achieving
a more efficient, economical and independent power supply for the
entire nation as well as increased, improved and coordinated facilities
for the production, transmission and distribution of natural gas.
During the fiscal year 1952, the Commission initiated its first
specific section 30 study. In a sense. this is a pilot model of limited
size which is being used to determine the scope of future examinations.

REGULATION

OF CONTINUING HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS

Approximately 20 holding company groups with aggregate asset'>
of over $i billion arc expected to emerge. upon completion of the
section 11 enforcement program, as permanent integrated utility systems. The other holding companies presently registered with thr
Commission will either be liquidated or diverted into other fields of
endeavor. The permanent systems comprise three distinct types.
The first and largest category is made up of electric holding company
systems which usually consist of one holding company over a number
of functionally related electric utility companies operating in contiguO~IS areas spread over several states.

from individual urban utilities in that their service areas arc much
larger and their operations are characterized by large scale centralized
generation coupled with economical long distance transmission facilities. Typical of these arc American Gas and Electric Company, The
Southern Company, Middle South Utilities, Inc, and The Central
& Southwest Corporation. The second type is the natural gas holding company system which usually controls both gas transmission and
gas distribution properties. Columbia Gas System, Inc., American
K atural Gas Company and Consolidated Natural Gas Company arc
among the largest in this group. The third type is the operatingholding company system. In these instances, which now occur only
in the electric utility field, the holding company, in addition to C011trolling one or more subsidiary operating companies, derives a substantial proportion of its income from its own utility operations.
Ohio Edison Company and the Northern States Power Companv
(.l\Iinn.) are important examples.
-

Despite the divestment of 240 electric utilities with assets of $8.4
billion, which were found to be not retaiuable by their former holding
company parents, and the exemption of many others, the regional
holding company systems which are emerging as permanent, integrated groups represent a vital segment of the public utility industry
of the Nation. .When all reorganizations under section 11 have been
completed, the continuing systems alone will represent 23 percent of
the assets and revenues of the entire electric utility industry, and the
permanent gas systems will account for 18 percent of that industrv.
These integrated, regional systems serve some of the most important
agricultural and industrial areas of the country. This is graphically
illustrated by the following map of the United States showing the
approximate service areas of the 16 continuing electric utility systems.
In the regulation of the continuing holding company systems (and,
to a lesser extent, other registered systems which have not yet completed their section 11 programs) the Commission and its staff devote a large amount of effort to the processing of financing applications and declarations under sections 6 and i of the statute and to
numerous applications relating to the acquisition of securit.ies or
assets of any other business by system companies, Other important
responsibilities include supervision of loans and capital contributions
to associate companies, reacquisitions of securities by the issuer
thereof, dividend payments out of capital or unearned surplus, solicitations of proxies, and other transactions between associates or
affiliated companies. The statute also charges the Commission with
responsibility for the regulation of service companies which are components of holding company systems. This includes surveillance of
cost allocations among associate companies. and investigations to
insure that operating utilities are charged no more than cost for the
services rendered, that such services are for the benefit of the operating companies and that the charges paid are reasonable.
Unlike the typical proceeding- for reorganization of a holding company system which may require the full time of several technical
personnel many months to complete, the task of supervision of the
permanent holding company system is essentially a policing function
requiring expert attention to a large volume of transactions, comparatively few of which involve lengthy conferences or proceedings.
Most of these cases are disposed of by the Commission without the

112

SECURITIES AND EXCflA.l'l"GE COMMISSION

formality of hearing or argument and the average filing requires less
than 30 days for processing, including the required periods for published notice to interested persons. This simple, streamlined procedure is possible only because the Commission has endeavored to
maintain a corps of tenchical personnel experienced in this field
who are capable of appraising proposed transactions on short notice.
The Commission does not have available separate records showing
the workload arising out of supervision of the continuing systems,
but an approximate measure of this activity may be derived from
the following table showing the numbers of separate questions presented for consideration and passed upon under those sections of the
Act which pertain to financing, acquisitions, intercompany transactions and intrasystem servicing arrangements. While some of
these matters relate to systems not expected to continue in operation
as regional, integrated systems, the amount is believed to be comparatively small in view of the proximity of the section 11 program
to final completion.

SYSTEMS

HOLDING

COMPANY

As indicated in the following reports, the continuing holding
company systems are participating actively in the rapid expansion of
facilities, characteristic of both the electric and natural gas utility
industries. In sharp contrast with the widespread investor pessimism
which blanketed the market for holding company securities in the
1930's, the securities of registered holding companies have since
acquired a degree of quality and marketability enabling them to
compete for funds on a basis comparable with the independent utility
operating companies. New equity financing has been readily available
either through the rights offering procedure or by direct sale of additional shares to underwriters for public distribution.

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

113

The success of the modern holding company in providing an equity
foundation for the financial expansion of its subsidiaries testifies
to the wisdom of the framers of the statute in permitting regional,
integrated holding company systems to continue in operation under
reasonable supervision. However, the financing function is not the
only important responsibility of the parent company. It must
constantly seek to obtain economic and engineering improvements
which derive from the coordinated operation of subsidiaries functionally related to one another. This is not simply physical interconnection; it is unified management and technical development
which produce maximum economy of operation.
The following summaries provide a review of the more important
actions taken by the Commission in respect to the operations of a
number of the continuing systems. As indicated, several of these
systems are faced with residual problems under section 11 (b) (1) or
11 (b) (2) of the Act. Some dispositions of properties not retainable
under statutory standards were made during the fiscal year. However,
pursuant to Commission approval, several systems have also acquired
adjacent properties where it was shown that such acquisitions tended
towards the economical and efficient development of their respective
systems.
American

Gas and Electric

Company

American Gas and Electric Company is the largest of the regional
holding company systems. Its operations extend over a seven-State
area from Kentucky to Michigan, Consolidated assets at December
31, 1951, were $769 million, after deduction of valuation reserves.
The system, almost wholly electric, serves more than 1,200,000
customers and annual operating revenues aggregate approximately
$200 million.
The system operates in a highly industrialized area and is presently engaged in a construction program of unprecedented size. It
is estimated that the operating subsidiaries will make construction
expenditures of almost $320 million in the period from 1952 to 1954,
the largest segment of which will represent the cost of additional
generating plant and facilities. Expansion of the American Gas
system has been spurred by the heavy power demands arising from
defense production activities. Population and industry of its service
area are growing rapidly and system companies now have the added
responsibility of delivering power in substantial quantities to the
Atomic Energy Commission.
Cash requirements for construction have necessitated a heavy
program of financing activity, both at the subsidiary and parent
level. During the fiscal year 1952, the operating subsidiaries, with
Commission approval, sold securities in the following aggregate
amounts: mortgage bonds, $32 million; serial notes, $13 million;
common stock (sold to parent), $16 million. In December 1951,
American Gas received approval to borrow up to $6 million from banks
on a short-term basis." In June 1952, American Gas sold $20 million
of sinking fund debentures and 170,000 shares of additional common
stock." Both offerings were made pursuant to the requirements of
Rule U-50. Shortly after the close of the fiscal year American Gas

invested an additional $18 million in new common shares of two of its
subsidiary companies, Appalachian Electric Power Company and
The Ohio Power Company." The same subsidiaries also obtained
short-term bank loans aggregating $43 million.
On March 25, 1952, the Commission approved the proposal of The
Ohio Power Company, a subsidiary of American, to amend its Articles
of Incorporation so as to modify the provisions limiting the amount
of unsecured debt which may be issued without the consent of stock
holders. The change will allow Ohio Power to issue unsecured debt
in a total amount not exceeding 20% of the sum of secured debt,
capital stock and surplus, of which short-term unsecured debt shall
not exceed 10%. Under this provision, long-term unsecured debt
would include all debt having an initial maturity of 10 years or more,
except that such debt would be regarded as short-term unsecured debt
whenever, and to the extent that, any part of it matured within less
than 5 years. The Articles of Incorporation were also amended to
delete the existing pre-emptive rights of the preferred stockholders in
connection with any additional issuance of preferred stock. This
change was designed to facilitate future issuances of preferred by
eliminating the standby period required to allow for the exercise of
pre-emptive rights."
The Commission also approved several amendments to the charter
of American Gas in order to bring it into conformity with established
standards. The amendments, which were approved April 15, 1952,
provided for (1) the annual election of directors in place of the provision under which one-third of the Board is elected each year; (2)
limited pre-emptive rights to the common stockholders; and (3)
cumulative voting in the election of directors. In addition, American
Gas has amended its charter so as to reclassify its authorized but
unissued shares of preferred stock into shares of unissued common
stock and has deleted from its charter all existing provisions concerning the preferred stock.
On September 14, 1951, the Commission authorized the acquisition
by The Ohio Power Company of the complete facilities of the municipally-owned generating plant and distribution system of the village
of Columbus Grove, Ohio, for $230,000 cash." The properties so
acquired are situated in the general territory served by Ohio Power.
The proceeds derived from the transaction by Columbus Grove were
used to retire the bonded indebtedness applicable to the properties
sold.
Central

and Southwest

Corporation

Central and Southwest Corporation operates an electric utility
system in a four-state area including sections of Arkansas, Louisiana,
Oklahoma and Texas. It has aggregate assets of over $327,000,000,
annual operating revenues exceeding $80,000,000 and approximately
630,000 customers.
The company undertook new construction requiring expenditures
of $35,000,000 in 1951 and has budgeted about $44,000,000 for 1952.
To finance a portion of its cash requirements, the company sold
500,000 additional shares of common stock at competitive bidding in

October 195L78 Net proceeds of the sale, which approximated
$7,000,000, were used to purchase additional shares of common stocks
of operating subsidiaries. In addition, subsidiaries marketed $24,000,000 of First Mortgage Bonds to support the program."
On December 20, 1951, the Commission approved the acquisition
by Central Power and Light Company, a subsidiary of the company,
of certain electric utility properties and ice properties located in Port
Arkansas, Texas, for a consideration of $215,000. The properties
were formerly owned by Mustang Island Utilities Company, all of
whose stock was owned by an individual. The electric properties
are to be interconnected with the electric transmission system of
Central Power and Light Company, but the ice plant is to be closed
and the ice storage facilities will be leased to outsiders for independent
operation."
Subsequent to completion of a field examination and the filing of a
report on original cost of property by the staff of the Commission
pursuant to rule U-27, Central Power and Light submitted proposals
to reclassify certain items of its utility plant accounts to give effect
to recommendations contained in that report. On January 25, 1952,
the Commission, upon finding the proposals to be consistent with
the requirements of rule U-27, ordered Central to dispose of the
amount of $984,779.19 in Account 107 and $1,473.22 in Account
108.47 and to create a reserve in Account 252 for amortization of
$1,045,661.65 established in Account 100.5.81
Columbia

Gas System, Inc.

The Columbia Gas System, Inc. is the parent holding company in
a natural gas utility system providing service in seven states. It is
engaged in the production, purchase, distribution, and sale of natural
gas, obtaining its supplies from the Appalachian and Southwest areas.
Its assets, after deduction of valuation reserves, total approximately
$500 million and annual system revenues exceed $190 million.
During 1951 Columbia Gas was confronted with an increasing demand for industrial and space heating gas. In order to meet these
requirements, $73 million was spent for new construction, representing the largest outlay in any single year. Included in the transmission construction of the system was the 167-mile pipeline built from
Clinton County, Pennsylvania, to a point near Pittsburgh.
This $12
million line takes gas from the newly developed Leidy Field and passes
through other potentially productive territory. The construction
program for the calendar year 1952, although dependent to some
extent on the availability of materials, is expected to involve expenditures of approximately $75 million. In addition, the gas storage
program of the system, both for current inventory and for "cushion"
gas, will require an additional cash outlay of approximately $23
inillion.
In July 1951 Columbia Gas borrowed $12 million from banks on a
short-term basis to finance the purchase of gas by subsidiaries for
storage inventory purposes. These notes were retired early in 1952.82
In October 1951 $20 million of short-term borrowing was undertaken
to finance construction requirements. Because of material shortages

tion, the financing was undertaken initially on a temporary basis to
be replaced by the later issuance of permanent securities. Columbia
also obtained over $21 million in November through an offering of
new common stock (1,501,826 shares) to its stockholders. Compensation to the underwriters was fixed by competitive bidding and the
issue was oversubscribed." In addition, Columbia Gas sold $60
million of 3%% Debentures in April 1952,using a portion of the proceeds to retire the $20 million of bank loans incurred in October
1951.84 All public financing in the Columbia Gas system is undertaken by the parent company. Moneys derived are reinvested,
pursuant to Commission approval, in the debt and equity securities
of the operating subsdiaries.
During the fiscal year, the Commission approved several transfers
of utility properties and assets among the subsidiaries of Columbia
Gas.55 In November 1951 the Commission also approved the purchase by Cumberland and Allegheny Gas Company, one of the gas
utility subsidiaries, of certain gas production property located in
Preston County, West Virginia, from independent gas producers for
a total consideration of $4 million." This property included 8 operating wells, 2 wells in process of drilling, approximately 2,000 feet
of 2-inch pipeline, and certain acreages of leaseholds and oil and gas
rights.
In the Commission's order dated November 1,1944, issued pursuant
to section 11 (b) (1) of the Act, Columbia Gas was required to dispose
of its interests in certain former subsidiaries. However, jurisdiction
was reserved with respect to the retainability of certain other companies, including several of Columbia Gas' production and transmission subsidiaries." To date, no determination as to the retainability or nonretainability of these companies has been made by the
Commission although the matter is presently under active consideration.
General Public Utilities Corporation

This company is the top holding company emerging from reorganization of the former Associated Gas and Electric Company system.
Reference is made to the 15th and 16th Annual Reports which outline briefly the steps taken in earlier years to bring about integration
and simplification of this extraordinarily complex structure. In
1938 this system consisted of 164 companies, including 11 subholding
companies operating in 26 states and in the Philippine Islands. The
present holding company system controlled by General Public Utilties Corporation ("GPU") represents but a segment of the former
Associated system. Nevertheless, after giving effect to consummation of the reorganization plan under section 11 (b) (1) as more fully
described below, the GPU system will have total assets of approximately $361 million, after deducting valuation reserves, and annual
gross revenues of over $100 million.
During the fiscal year 1952, further steps have been taken to
resolve the remaining integration problems of the system and to
bring it into conformity with the standards of section 11. After
hearings on the section 11 (b) (1) problems were concluded, the
Commission on December 28, 1951, entered its findings and opinion

and order." It determined that the electric facilities of GPU's
domestic subsidiaries, except those of Northern Pennsylvania Power
Company, constituted a single integrated public utility system, and
that such facilities, together with coal mining, water and steam heating properties owned or operated by Pennsylvania Electric Company
(other than the minor steam heating properties of Pennsylvania
Electric Company located at Clearfield, Pennsylvania) might be
retained by GPU or by its subsidiaries under the standards of section
11. In its order the Commission directed GPU to dispose of its
interests in: (1) Northern Pennsylvania Power Company and its
subsidiary, The Waverly Electric Light and Power Company;
(2) the gas properties (including production, transmission, and distribution facilities) of Jersey Central Power & Light Company;
(3) the steam heating properties of Pennsylvania Electric Company,
located at Clearfield, Pennsylvania; (4) the life insurance business of
Employees Welfare Association, Incorporated (Delaware) in so far
as it relates to persons other than employees or officials of companies
in the GPU holding company system. The Commission's order of
December 28, 1951, also annulled and cancelled its prior order of
February 9, 1945, which had removed Escudero Electric Service and
Manila Electric Company from the list of companies required to be
divested by the order of August 13, 1942.
In compliance with the above order with respect to the system's
gas properties, Jersey Central Power & Light Company, on June 3,
1952, sold its gas utility properties to New Jersey Natural Gas Company (formerly County Gas Company) for an aggregate amount of
$16,027,583.89
On December 31, 1951, Dover Casualty Insurance Co., a subsidiary
company engaged in casualty reinsurance, was dissolved and its assets
amounting to $438,347 were transferred to GPU.90 Dover had no
securities outstanding in the hands of the public.
No program has yet been submitted with respect to compliance by
GPU with the remaining aspects of the Commission's order. Upon
full compliance therewith, GPU will continue to be a registered holding
company and the utility properties of its remaining subsidiaries will
constitute a single integrated public utility system. Those subsidiaries are: Jersey Central Power & Light Company (N. J.), Metropolitan Edison Company (Pa.) , New Jersey Power & Light Company
(N. J.), and Pennsylvania Electric Company (Pa.). The latter in
turn controls two relatively minor nonutility subsidiaries, the operations of which are reasonably incidental to the utility operations of
the integrated system.
During the past year the requirements of the domestic subsidiaries
of GPU made it necessary for GPU to undertake the issue and sale
of 531,949 shares of its common stock through a rights offering to its
common stockholders. This offering was made on July 1, 1952.
Gross proceeds amounted to approximately $11,000,000.91 These
funds, less fees and expenses, are being employed by GPU for investment in the common stocks of its domestic utility subsidiaries to meet
their expansion requirements.
GPU has also made capital contributions to certain subsidiaries from treasury cash. In addition, its

domestic subsidiaries sold to the public $12,800,000of mortgage bonds
and $7,000,000 of preferred stock. Virtually all of the proceeds
derived from these sales have also been applied to meet construction
requirements.
Middle South Utilities, Inc.

Middle South Utilities, Inc. controls a utility system serving a
three-state area embracing Arkansas, Louisiana and western Mississippi. The company was organized in May 1949 to acquire from
Electric Power & Light Corporation the latter's holdings in Arkansas
Power & Light Company, Louisiana Power & Light Company, Mississippi Power & Light Company, New Orleans Public Service, Inc.
and a small land company.
Middle South is now an integrated regional holding company system
deriving the major portion of its revenues from the sale of electricity.
The area served by the system has an estimated population of 3,900,000. System assets total $410 million, after deducting valuation
reserves, and annual gross revenues aggregate $112 million. The
system's generating capacity has been more than doubled in the last
six years and is being further increased to meet new peak load requirements. Aggregate construction expenditures programmed for
1952 and 1953 total $137 million.
In May 1952, Middle South sold 600,000 shares of new common
stock at competitive bidding and realized approximately $12,800,000
from the offering.92 Shortly thereafter, the Commission approved a
credit agreement under which Middle South may borrow up to $15
million from banks. The approval covers two successive periods
extending to December 31, 1957. However, no loan renewal may be
made during the second period without further application to the
Commission." Proceeds from these financing operations are being
used by Middle South to provide subsidiaries with new capital requirements in such manner as to minimize financing costs during the
period of the new construction.
On September 25, 1951, the Commission approved the sale by
Arkansas of $8 million, 3%percent First Mortgage Bonds at competitive bidding." Another operating subsidiary, Louisiana, received
authorization in November 1951 to borrow up to $13 million from
banks to meet immediate cash needs for construction. These loans
are to be subsequently replaced with permanent financing."
The Middle South system has taken several steps to limit its operations to electric power generation, transmission and distribution.
In the fiscal year 1951 Arkansas disposed of its entire gas utility
assets with the approval of the Commission." On February 29, 1952,
another subsidiary, Mississippi, divested itself of all of its gas properties with the exception of relatively minor facilities used in connection with the fuel supply for Mississippi's electric operations. With
the approval of the Commission, the property was sold for a cash
consideration of $11,128,151, plus or minus certain closing adjustments. The purchaser was Mississippi Valley Gas Company, a new
corporation created for this purpose by Equitable Securities Corporait Holding

respect to the retain ability of certain gas and transportation properties
of New Orleans Public Service Inc.
National

Fuel Gas Company

National Fuel Gas Company, through nine subsidiary companies,
operates a natural gas and mixed gas system doing business principally
in western Pennsylvania and western New York. Its purchases of
natural and manufactured gas aggregate over 80 percent of its total
gas supply, with the greatest proportion coming from fields in southwestern United States. System assets aggregate over $100 million,
net of reserves for depletion, depreciation and amortization.
The system's construction expenditures for 1952 are estimated
at $10,200,000. A sizeable proportion of these expenditures reflect
the developmental work going on in the Driftwood area, Cameron
County, Pennsylvania. The 1953 estimate of cash requirements for
construction is set at $5,500,000.
On May 21, 1952, the Commission issued its order authorizing the
issuance and sale by National, pursuant to competitive bidding requirements, of $18 million principal amount of 3X percent Sinking
Fund Debentures, due 1977.98 Of the proceeds derived from this
offering $ll million was used to repay outstanding bank loans previously incurred to purchase long-term notes of four subsidiary companies. The balance of $7 million derived from the debenture financing is to be used, together with retained earnings, depreciation accruals
and funds from other internal sources, to complete the 1952 construction program. All public financing in the National system is undertaken by the parent company which, in turn, provides both debt and
equity capital to the subsidiaries.
New England

Electric

System

New England Electric System ("NEES") and its subsidiary companies constitute the largest utility organization in New England.
The system serves a total population of about 2,135,000 at retail and
also sells large amounts of energy at wholesale. The system's total
revenues from operations for the year 1951 amounted to approximately
$105 million, 89 percent of which was derived from the sale of electricity and 11 percent from the sale of gas. Aggregate assets of the
system are $438 million, after deducting valuation reserves. The
system has 35 active subsidiary companies of which 17 furnish electricity at retail in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Two generating
and transmission companies operating in Massachusetts, New
Hampshire and Vermont supply electricity on a wholesale basis.
On July 14, 1951, NEES invited proposals for the purchase of all
or part of the system's gas properties located in Massachusetts,
As
a result, NEES received six proposals for the purchase of these properties, the highest of which bid a base price of $22,780,000. Subsequently, due to a change in money markets, the highest bidder
was unable to finance the purchase and efforts to sell the properties
were postponed. During the past year, most of the properties have
been converted from the usc of manufactured gas to natural gas.
During the fiscal year, the Commission approved 39 applications

by subsidiary companies to borrow an aggregate of $81,285,000 from
commercial banks and 37 applications to borrow $12,060,000 from
NEES upon the issuance of short-term notes, some of which was used
to repay other short-term notes which were becoming due. Three
subsidiaries sold common stock to NEES for $8,100,000 and three
subsidiaries sold $16,500,000 principal amount of bonds to the public.
In addition to retained earnings, NEES financed its purchases of subsidiary securities by the sale of 920,573 shares of its common stock
by means of an underwritten rights offering to its stockholders on
the basis of one new share for each eight shares held." The proceeds
from this sale exceeded $11 million and the size of the offering reflects
recommendations by the staff of the Commission of a 25 percent increase in the number of shares to be issued.
It is estimated that construction expenditures of the NEES system
for the years 1952 and 1953 will aggregate approximately $90 million
as compared with the $151 million expended during the previous five
years. To finance this expansion and to reduce outstanding shortterm bank debt, NEES estimates that system companies will sell
about $90 million of securities during 1952 and 1953.
NEES has indicated that it contemplates the merger of several
electric and gas operating properties into larger units and the merger
of its two wholesale generating and transmission companies.
New England Gas and Electric Association

New England Gas and Electric Association ("NEGEA") is a
Massachusetts trust holding, directly or indirectly, the common stocks
of seven electric and gas utility companies located in Massachusetts,
one electric utility company in New Hampshire and one electric utility
company in Maine. In addition, it owns the common stock of a
steam heating company located in Massachusetts. NEGEA has also
acquired 35.82 percent of the common stock of Algonquin Gas Transmission Company, a natural gas pipeline company to be engaged upon
completion of its construction in transporting natural gas from New
Jersey for sale to distributing companies in New England. Participating with NEGEA as common stock holders of Algonquin are Eastern
Gas and Fuel Associates, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation
and Providence Gas Company.
Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the Commission approved
the issuance and sale by Algonquin of $9,734,000 of First Mortgage
Pipeline Bonds to a group of three insurance companies which,
together with a fourth institutional investor, had previously purchased
$27,600,000 of Algonquin's bonds.' The sale was exempted from the
requirements of rule U-50. Algonquin also sold 48,660 additional
shares of common stock, of which 15,610 shares were acquired by
NEGEA.
Algonquin will use the $14,600,000 proceeds from the sale of its
mortgage bonds and common stock to meet the balance of the cost
of its new pipeline estimated at $51,500,000. Since NEGEA will
purchase somewhat less than its proportionate share of the new common shares to be issued, its relative stock ownership will be reduced
slightly to 34.52 percent.
The operating subsidiaries of NEGEA are continuing the construction program commenced prior to the past fiscal year. Estimated

gross plant additions for the calendar years 1952 and 1953 are expected to aggregate $12,400,000. To finance this construction program the subsidiaries propose to use funds generated from internal
sources in the amount of $6,600,000, with the balance to be obtained
through bank loans in the amount of $5,800,000, of which $3,700,000
was approved by the Commission in 1952.
In October 1951 the Commission approved the issue and sale by
NEGEA, pursuant to competitive bidding, of $6,115,000 principal
amount of 20-year sinking fund collateral trust bonds. The proceeds
of the issue were utilized to purchase additional common stocks of
subsidiary companies. The latter, in turn, used the proceeds to repay
bank loans and for other corporate purposes. 2
In November 1951 the Commission approved the merger of Dedham
and Hyde Park Gas Company and Milford Gas Light Company with
Worcester Gas Light Company thereby reducing the number of
Massachusetts utility subsidiaries from 9 to 7. Virtually all of
the gas requirements of the two smaller companies had been supplied
by the Worcester company for many years."
Although NEGEA does not presently have any section 11 plan before the Commission, jurisdiction has been reserved with respect to
section 11 (b) (1) proceedings originally instituted in September 1942.
In approving NEGEA's previous plan of reorganization in 1946 the
Commission stated that such approval should not be construed as a
determination as to the retainability of properties in the holding
company system and its order approving the plan separated for
further hearing the proceedings under section 11 (b) (1).4
Northern States Power Company

Northern States Power Company (Minnesota) is an operatingholding company engaged, either directly or through subsidiaries,
in the electric and gas utility business in the states of Minnesota,
'Wisconsin, North Dakota and South Dakota. Aggregate system
assets, after deduction of depreciation reserves, total over $327 million and annual revenues exceed $90 million, of which 88 percent are
derived from sales of electricity.
During the past fiscal year, Northern States and three of its subsidiaries received authorization of the Commission to reclassify
certain of their plant accounts on the basis of original cost." In
connection therewith, two of the subsidiaries were permitted to
recapitalize their security structures in order to remove deficits in
their surplus accounts and to simplify and improve the capital
structure of the system."
During 1951 the system expended $32,256,000 for construction
purposes and it is estimated that expenditures during 1952 will
approximate $34,800,000. These amounts are part of an over-all
program under which the system expects to expend $143 million during
the 5-year period 1952-56. To finance this expansion, Northern
States issued with approval of the Commission," $15 million of shortterm notes which were subsequently repaid from the proceeds of the
issuance of $21,500,000 principal amount of bonds and an underâ€¢ Holding

The North American Company
Union Electric Company of Missouri

Union Electric Company of Missouri is an operating-holding
company serving either directly or through its subsidiaries, a large
area in the State of Missouri and smaller sections in Illinois and
Iowa. It has two utility subsidiaries, Union Electric Power Company
and Missouri Power & Light Company, and three non-utility subsidiaries. System assets, after deduction of valuation reserves, total
over $369 million, and annual revenues are over $84 million. Union
Electric is the sole remaining utility subsidiary of The North American
Company which at one time controlled 36 utility and 46 non-utility
subsidiaries operating in ten states and in the District of Columbia.
During 1951 Union Electric and its subsidiaries spent $33,388,000
for construction and have embarked upon a program calling for expenditures in excess of $168 million between 1952 and 1955. The only
major financing undertaken during the past fiscal year was the sale
by Union Electric of $30 million of First Mortgage Bonds at
competitive bidding in May 1952.10
As reported in the 17th Annual Report, Union Electric is participating with four other utilities in the formation and development
of a new corporate enterprise, Electric Energy, Inc., which was
organized to supply one half of the power requirements of the Paducah,
Kentucky, plant of the Atomic Energy Commission. Union Electric,
with a 40 percent interest in the common stock of the company, has
the largest single stock interest of all of the five participants.
On April 28, 1952, North American filed a plan with the Commission under section 11 (e) proposing its liquidation and dissolution. 11
Under the plan, immediately upon its approval by the Commission
and by a United States district court, North American will distribute
to its stockholders as an initial liquidating dividend one share of
Union's new $10 par value common for each 10 shares of North
American common held. A similar distribution will be made approximately one year after the first distribution and a final distribution made two years after the first distribution on a share-for-share
basis. Fractional shares will not be distributed, but will be paid
for in cash. The Union Electric common stock to be distributed as
liquidating dividends will be a newly created issue of 10,300,000
shares of S10 par value per share. Union Electric's presently outstanding 11,450,000 shares of no par value common stock, all of which
is owned by North American, will be reclassified into 10,300,000
shares of no par value common stock. Prior to the distribution of
each liquidating dividend by North American, it will exchange the
requisite number of shares of new no par common stock of Union for a
like number of shares of new $10 par value common stock of Union,
which will be distributed. While Union expects to pay cash dividends
on the shares of $10 par value stock distributed under the plan, no

dividends will be paid on the reclassified common stock of no par
value held by North American except pursuant to permission of the
Commission. Commencing with the initial liquidating dividend,
North American will cease paying cash dividends. During the twoyear distribution period, to the extent feasible, North American will
liquidate all of its assets other than its holdings of Union Electric
common stock. At the end of the period, the small number of Union
Electric's shares remaining undistributed will be delivered to Union
Electric for cancellation and any other remaining assets of North
American will be transferred to Union Electric for final disposition.
Union Electric will assume all of North American's remaining liabilities and the latter company will be dissolved. The plan was approved
by the Commission on October 31, 1952.12
In addition, North American, as the owner of all of the preferred
stock and 376,151 shares of the 466,548 shares of outstanding common stock of North American Utility Securities Corporation, filed an
amended plan for the liquidation and dissolution of this subsidiary.
The amended plan reflected an agreement reached with the assistance
of the staff of the Commission by North American and a committee
representing the public holders of Securities Corporation's common
stock as to an appropriate settlement of claims raised on behalf of
the public security holders that North American's interest in Securities
Corporation should be subordinated because of its asserted mismanagement of the company. The plan provides that the public owners of
the 90,397 shares of Securities Corporation common will be paid in
cash at the rate of $9 per share. North American will receive all of
Securities Corporation's remaining assets and assume all of its liabilities. The Commission issued its findings, opinion and order approving this plan on July 23, 1952.13 It has since been ordered enforced
by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland 14
and was consummated on October 1, 1952.
The Southern Company

The Southern Company is the parent holding company of a system
which survives the former Commonwealth & Southern Corporation.
The integrated system which it controls furnishes service through
four electric utility subsidiaries in Georgia, Alabama, Florida and
Mississippi. It is the second largest of the continuing systems with
$635 million of assets, after deduction of depreciation reserves, and
gross annual revenues of $151 million.
Economic development in the territory of The Southern Company
has required an impressive expansion of its physical properties. Its
program for 1952-53 calls for expenditures aggregating $214 million.
Current cash requirements are being financed through the sale of
bonds and common stock. In the spring and summer of 1952 approximately $39 million was obtained through the sale of bonds by
subsidiaries; $12 million by Alabama Power Company; $20 million
by Georgia Power Company and $7 million by Gulf Power Company. 15
An additional $13 million was obtained in July from a rights offering

The West Penn Electric Company

The West Penn Electric Company is the parent holding company in
a utility system deriving about 95 percent of its revenues from sales
of electric power and servicing a territory located principally in
Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Maryland. Small adjacent sections of Ohio and Virginia are also served. Its principal operating
subsidiaries are the Potomac Edison Company and West Penn Power
Company, both of which are also registered holding companies. The
system covers a territory of 29,000 square miles and serves over 650,000
customers. Total system assets, after deduction of valuation reserves, aggregate over $380 million and the system's gross annual
revenues total approximately $100 million. West Penn was formerly
a subsidiary of American Water Works & Electric Company, Inc.

ANNUAL REPORT

PUBLIC UTILITY FINANCING-REVIEW OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Construction expenditures made during the fiscal year by privately
owned electric and gas utilities (exclusive of gas transmission companies) amounted to about $2.8 billion, of which the electric utility
companies accounted for about $2.45 billion and gas utilities for
about $350 million. This marks a new high in construction expenditures for anyone year, and an increase of about $400 million over
the previous year. Funds necessary to finance this program were
raised principally by the issuance of $2.3 billion of securities, the
balance being derived from the retention of earnings and other
internal sources. Data from industry sources indicate that construction expenditures by private electric utilities in the fiscal year
1953 will reach $2.8 billion.
The following tabulation, covering the fiscal years 1949 to 1952,
includes all security sales for cash, plus refunding exchanges, by
electric and gas utility operating companies which have been approved
under sections 6 and 7 of the Act or which have been registered
with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. The table
also sets forth data, representing at best rough estimates, with
respect to private placements of securities not subject to either
the Holding Company Act or the Securities Act. Security sales by
gas utilities included in the table cover only those by companies
which are engaged in the retail distribution of natural or manufactured
gas.

The substantial increase in volume of financing during the fiscal
year reflects the increase in cash requirements for construction and a
marked improvement in the market for utility debt securities. In
the first half of the fiscal year, bond prices generally continued at the
depressed levels which prevailed after the Federal Reserve Board
withdrew its support from the Government bond market in March
1951. However, in January 1952, investors began paying premiums
in the open market for seasoned high grade issues in the absence of

new offerings. The uptrend was confirmed in March when institutional investors, responding to a series of new offerings, absorbed in
one day an $80 million inventory of mortgage bonds held by underwriters. Thereafter, until the close of the fiscal year, the market
remained relatively stable with yields averaging about 10 to 15 basis
points lower than the previous year, in spite of an exceptionally heavy
volume of new issues. Corporate financing during this quarter was
at one of the highest levels of any quarter on record.
During the 12 months ended June 30, 1952, 352 matters were
presented for determination pursuant to sections 6 and 7 of the .Act,
under which the Commission is required to pass upon the issuance of
securities and assumptions of liability and alterations of rights of
securities by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries .
.A total of 374 matters were disposed of during the year, including a
few carried over from the latter part of the preceding year. .All but
32 of these matters related to issues of securities. In the fiscal year
1951, 326 matters were disposed of under sections 6 and 7. The
increase in matters disposed of during the year was mainly accounted
for by approximately 75 short term note authorizations granted the
several electric and gas utilities in the New England Electric System.
The following tables covering the fiscal years 1951 and 1952 analyze
in detail the volume of securities sold for cash, or issued in exchange
for refunding purposes by registered holding companies and their
subsidiaries pursuant to authorizations of the Commission under
sections 6 and 7 of the Act, Portfolio sales and issues in connection

Virtually all financing during the fiscal year 1952 by electric and
gas utilities subject to active regulatory jurisdiction of the Commission under the Act was for the purpose of raising new money. 23 Refunding issues were not in evidence, because the relatively high
interest rates which prevailed during the year provided no incentive.
The sharp increase in the total number of issues sold under sections
6 and 7 of the Act from 174 in 1951 to 266 in 1952 is primarily due to
the large number of long term serial notes sold to holding companies
by subsidiaries. These electric and gas utilities issued $481 million
of debt securities during fiscal 1952, representing 71 percent of their
total security sales. In 1951, $348 million principal amount of debt
was issued, amounting to 59 percent of total security sales. This
increase of long term debt financing was accompanied by a substantial
decrease in preferred stock offerings from 13 percent to 4 percent and,
to a lesser extent, a decrease in common equity issues from 29 percent to 25 percent. Market receptivity for both preferred and common stocks continued comparatively strong throughout most of the
fiscal year.
Registered holding companies, including several operating-holding
companies, in carrying out one of their most important functions of
furnishing capital to their subsidiaries, purchased $300 million of
subsidiary securities during 1952, in addition to making a substantial

number of capital contributions, short term loans and open account
advances. Of the securities purchased, $196 million represented
debt issues and $104 million common stocks. To raise the capital
necessary to provide this assistance, holding companies sold approximately $217 million of securities to the public as shown in the preceding tables and in addition an estimated $150 million was sold for
reinvestment in subsidiaries by operating-holding companies. In
1951, holding companies purchased $202 million of subsidiary securities. Cash for these purchases was obtained from the sale of $145
million of holding company securities, and sales by operating-holding
companies for this purpose amounting to $42 million." With respect
to both years, the sales of debt securities by registered holding companies represent for the most part parent company financing in
systems where the subsidiaries have little or no senior securities in
the hands of the public, thereby enabling the holding companies to
issue senior securities without impairing the consolidated equity
position of the system.
Nonutility subsidiaries of registered holding companies, consisting
mainly of gas transmission companies, issued almost $200 million of
securities during the year, an increase of $105 million over the previous fiscal year. All but 12 percent of these amounts were purchased by parent holding companies, the remainder being sold
privately. Long term debt issues comprised 97 percent of the total,
common stock the balance.
The rights offering procedure has continued to dominate utility
common stock financing under the Act in the fiscal year 1952. Commission policy regarding this method of obtaining equity capital
was reiterated in a memorandum opinion issued in March 1950:
"* * * It is, and has long been, our opinion that when holding
companies and public utility companies subject to our jurisdiction
sell additional shares of common stock, their own interests, as well as
the interests of their common stockholders are, absent special circumstances, best served by allowing common stockholders the right to
purchase their proportionate shares of the new issue * * *" .25
During fiscal 1952, companies subject to active regulatory jurisdiction under the Act publicly sold a total of $182 million of common
stocks, of which 64 percent or $116 million was raised by means of
rights offerings and the balance of $66 million was sold directly to
the public. In 1951, $117 million of common stock was sold by
means of rights and $27 million directly to the public. 26 The amoun t
raised through rights offerings which were not underwritten declined,
however, from 64 percent of the total rights offerings in 1951 to 27
percent in 1952. During fiscal 1951, of a total of 14 subscription
offerings, nine were made without underwriting, including four issues
which received the benefit of dealer solicitation. In fiscal 1952,
however, of a total of 10 rights offerings, only two issues were sold
without underwriting or dealer solicitation assistance, and the balance were underwritten. Of these 10 issues, six were sold with
oversubscription privileges and were well oversubscribed. The other
four issues were offered to stockholders without oversubscription
privilegps, and subscriptions ranged from 4 percent to 94 percent .
.. There are several reasons accounting for the apparent differences between bolding company sales and
'.lbsldmry Investments, chief among wbich IS the lapse In time from one fiscal year to anotber while the
'Leges or Intrasystem financing are being completed.
" Holding Company Act release No. 9730.
.. Tbesc figures are exolusive of sales by subsidiarIes to parent companies.

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

129

All of these four latter rights offerings were underwritten and, in
those cases where the subscription price was set below the then
prevailing market price of the shares, the offerings were more than
90 percent subscribed.
Common stock issues registered by electric and gas utilities under
the Securities Act of 1933, but not required to be passed upon under
sections 6 and 7 of the Holding Company Act, followed virtually the
same pattern as common stock financing carrisd out under our jurisdiction under the 1935 Act. A total of $325 million was raised
through common stock issues subject only to the 1933 Act, of which
$210 million or 65 percent of the total was raised through 26 issues
representing rights offerings. Seventeen issues with a gross sales
value of $115 million were sold directly to the public. Similarly,
15 of the rights offerings totalling $150 million were made without
the benefit of oversubscription privileges and nearly all of these were
underwritten. Furthermore, such of these offerings as were made
with subscription prices at a discount below the prevailing market
were subscribed more than 80 percent. It is interesting to note that,
since 1948, the amount of capital raised by all electric and gas utilities
of the United States" by means of rights offerings to stockholders
has never dropped below 60 percent of total common stock sales by
such companies.
Another important development in public utility financing during
the fiscal year has been the sharp increase in interest rates on short
term loans. Interest rates on prime utility loans maturing up to one
year have risen one-half of one percent. In October 1951, the rate
was raised from 2~ percent to 2% percent and advanced again in
December to 3 percent. The rise has been attributed to the tremendous expansion of short term loans by banks and to the tightening money market supply situation traceable to reduced purchases of
U. S. Government securities by the Federal Reserve System.
COMPETITIVE

BIDDING

Offerings of securities by issuing companies under sections 6 (b)
and 7 of the Act and portfolio sales by registered holding companies
under section 12 (d) are required to be made at competitive bidding
in accordance with the provisions of rule U-50. Certain special
types of sales, including issues of less than $1 million, short term
bank loans, issues the acquisition of which have been authorized under
section 10 and pro rata issues to existing security holders, are automatically exempt under clauses (1) through (4) of paragraph (a) of
the rule. In paragraph (a) (5) the Commission retains the right to
grant exemptions by order where it appears that competitive bidding
is not necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the Act.

As previously indicated, a total of $1,092,050,413 of securities were
sold for cash in the fiscal year 1952 by registered holding companies
and their subsidiaries, of which amount $670,775,965 were sold at
competitive bidding pursuant to rule U-50. The difference of $421
million is largely accounted for by approximately $360 million of
securities automatically exempt under the terms of the rule, of which
$300 million were sold by subsidiaries to their parents. Also included
in that difference were private placements of about $60 million which
had been exempted from the competitive bidding requirements of
rule U-50 by orders entered in earlier years but which were not sold
until this year.
The experience gained in the 11 years of administration of rule
U-50 has adequately demonstrated its workability and effectiveness in
maintaining competitive conditions in the marketing of securities and
in achieving minimum costs in the procurement of capital. However,
the Commission has always recognized that flexibility of application
was essential and in a number of cases, where unusual circumstances
were present, it has granted exemptions by order from the competitive
bidding requirements of the rule. During the period of existence of
the rule, 201 issues of securities of registered holding companies and
their subsidiaries with aggregate proceeds of $1.5 billion have been
exempted in this manner. Such sales, of course, do not include the
automatic exemptions afforded by the rule.
In the fiscal year 1952 only one issue with proceeds of $2 million
was exempted from competitive bidding by order as compared with
eight issues with dollar volume of $158.5 million in 1951. Almost
all of the securities exempted in the fiscal year 1951 were private
placements of standby commitments to finance construction projects
extending over comparatively long periods of time.
It is important to note that only 25 percent of the issues representing 28.5 percent of the total dollar volume of exempted issues
were sold by means of underwritten transactions. The following table
summarizes the exempt security sales and shows the volume and
types of securities exempted together with the amounts of securities
sold with and without underwriting arrangements.

WITH STATE PUBLIC UTILITY

COMMISSIONS

The underlying objective of the Holding Company Act is to free
operating electric and gas utility companies from the control of absentee and uneconomic holding companies and to provide effective
supervision over regional integrated holding company systems, thereby
permitting more effective regulation of the operating companies by
the States and municipalities in which they operate. Viewed in the
over-all the purpose of the Act is to supplement and strengthen local
-regulation; a fundamental concept which is inherent in the basic
policies set out in the preamble and which also finds direct expression
in many other sections of the statute.
In the administration of this
statute problems are constantly arising which are of special concern
to the state commissions, and notices of all proceedings of possible
interest to them are automatically sent to state and local regulatory
authorities. Aside from the numerous informal discussions between
representatives of this Commission and local authorities, there were
several instances of cooperation during the past year which may be
specifically noted.
An investigation conducted by the staff of the Commission in the
spring of 1951 revealed that Investment Bond & Share Corporation
had been operating for a number of years as a holding company within
the meaning of section 2 (a) (7) (A) of the Act and that the company
had taken no steps to effect its registration as a holding company or
to apply for such exemption as might have been available to it. As
a result, IBS registered with the Commission on July 2, 1951, and in
August of that year submitted a plan pursuant to section 11 (e) of
the Act for the purpose of effecting its ultimate liquidation in compliance with the physical integration and corporate simplification
provisions of section 11 (b) of the Act. In connection with these
proceedings members of the Commission's staff conferred at length
with the general counsel of the Florida Railroad & Public Utilities
Commission regarding certain proposed transactions between IBS and
its subsidiary, Jacksonville Gas Corporation. The questions of mutual
interest involved such matters as restrictions of surplus against payment of dividends, the right of Jacksonville to recover certain fees

132

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

believed to have been illegally paid, the assurance of an independent
board of directors for Jacksonville following its divestment of control
by IBS, and the reacquisition by Jacksonville of certain shares of its
stock which IBS had acquired without proper authorization of the
Commission. Arrangements were worked out to the satisfaction of
the Florida representatives and members of this Commission's staff
agreed to keep the Florida Commission fully informed of all subsequent
developments.
In August 1952, representatives of this Commission conferred at
length with representatives of the Connecticut Public Utilities Commission and representatives of Derby Gas & Electric Corporation
regarding certain of that company's remaining problems under section
11 (b) (1) of the Act. The Connecticut Commission was very helpful
in the devising of a program for the ultimate resolution of such
problems.
Early in the past year, the Mississippi River Fuel Corporation made
application to the Public Service Commission of Missouri for permission to acquire shares of common stock of Laclede Gas Company which
serves the city of St. Louis. Subsequently, Mississippi River acquired approximately eight percent of the voting stock of Laclede and
thereby became an affiliate of Laclede within the meaning of section
2 (a) (11) of the Act. The Missouri commission was very cooperative
in keeping the staff of this Commission advised of important developments in this situation.
The specific instances of cooperation enumerated above are descriptive of only a portion of the cooperative effort of this Commission.
Of even greater over-all advantage to the state and local regulatory
authorities is the accomplishment of the basic objectives of the
Holding Company Act. The operation of section 11, for instance,
has had a two-fold effect. Through the divestment of properties not
meeting the physical integration standards of section 11 (b) (1), a
total of 381 electric and gas utility companies with aggregate assets
of $9 billion have been severed from burdensome holding company
control and are now operating as independent units or, in a few instances, as intrastate holding company systems. Approximately 20
other holding company systems with assets totaling $7 billion will
remain in operation following complete compliance with the physical
integration and corporate simplification requirements of section 11 (b)
of the Act and the effectiveness of state and local regulation of the
operating subsidiaries of these companies will be protected and
strengthened by the continuing supplementary jurisdiction of this
Commission under the various other sections of the Act.
Of particular interest in this regard are the provisions of section
13 which limit the services to be rendered to operating subsidiaries
by service companies controlled by the holding company to only
such services as are for the benefit of the operating companies. These
services, moreover, must be rendered at cost fairly and equitably
allocated among the client companies. Sections 6 and 7 of the Act
are designed to assure the maintenance of sound capital structures and
adequate protective provisions for security holders. In this connection, an important consequence of the administration of the Act
has been the tremendous increase in the participation of investors in
the market for public utility securities. Last, but not least, the

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

133

provisions of sections 2 (a) (7),3,9 (a) (2), and paragraphs (e) and (f)
of section 13 afford protection against re-creation of the holding
company device through channels more subtle and devious than that
of direct ownership of securities.
AFFILIATES,

NEW HOLDING COMPANIES AND EXEMPT HOLDING
COMPANY SYSTEMS

As previously indicated, the statute embraces more than the
integration and simplification of holding company systems and the
day-to-day regulation of the continuing holding company systems.
It also contains a number of provisions regulating the creation of new
holding company and affiliate relationships and requiring a limited
degree of surveillance of exempt holding company systems.
The first group of these provisions serve to prevent the circumvention of holding company responsibilities through the employment
of unusual types of business organizations or through obscure devices
for the control of public utility companies. These are embodied in
sections 2 (a) (2), 2 (a) (7) (A), 2 (a) (7) (B), 2 (a) (8) (A) and 2 (a) (8)
(B). Twelve informal inquiries concerning the applicability of these
provisions to specific proposals for the acquisition of voting securities
of public utility companies were received during the year and interpretative opinions were supplied in each instance. It is seldom
necessary to engage in formal proceedings in such matters since the
transactions proposed are either withdrawn or modified following
conferences with interested parties in order to avoid conflicts with
statutory requirements. The Commission's functions in administering these provisions are essentially of a policing nature. Most of the
cases considered involved natural gas utilities and pipeline companies.
The statute also provides for regulation of certain transactions
between affiliates and public-utility or holding companies and for
regulation of the creation or extension of affiliate relationships.
Probably the most important provision in this category is section
9 (a) (2) of the Act which provides in substance that the acquisition
by any person of five percent or more of the voting securities of two
or more public-utility or holding companies must be approved by
the Commission. Since these provisions have the effect of imposing
certain standards upon those acquisitions of voting securities of
public-utility or holding companies which fall short of establishing
a prima facie holding company relationship (5 percent or more but
less than 10 percent), they operate to restrict any tendencies toward
the creation of new and unsound holding company relationships.
During the fiscal year 15 applications were filed by persons or
companies seeking approval of proposed acquisitions of public-utility
securities pursuant to section 9 (a) (2), and approval was granted in
all cases. In addition, six other situations have come to the attention of the Commission in which it appears that public-utility
securities were acquired in violation of section 9 (a) (2). An application was filed in one of these cases subsequent to the close of the
fiscal year to correct the delinquency and preliminary steps have been
taken with respect to the others with a view to securing their
compliance.
Sections 12 (g) and 13 (e) provide for limited regulation of transactions between affiliates, although, as used in these sections, the

134

SECURITIES AKD EXCHANGE COMMISSION

definition of an affiliate of a specified company is not restricted to
persons owning 5 percent or more of the outstanding voting securities
of two or more public-utility or holding companies as is the case with
section 9 (a) (2), but may also include officers or directors of the
specified company, or any person whom the Commission determines
to stand in such relation to the specified company that there is liable
to be an absence of arm's-length bargaining in transactions between
them. The provisions of these two sections relate principally to
disclosure and maintenance of competitive conditions.
Section 12 (g) was employed during the year in the case of a small
gas utility system which had failed to register with the Commission
under section 5 of the Act or to seek such exemption as might have
been available under the circumstances. Because of the inadequacy
of information concerning the system, the imminence of an approaching bond maturity, and to determine the nature and extent of any
violations of the provisions of the Act and the action necessary to
correct such violations, the Commission entered a confidential order
directing a complete investigation of the affaiis of the system. The
order also directed, pursuant to section 12 (g), that all parties named
therein give the Commission advance notice of any proposal to effect
certain transactions specified in the order.
Section 13 (e) contains safeguards respecting transactions with
affiliated servicing organizations which are similar to those found in
section 12 (g). Since the Congress also recognized that service companies which were not affiliated with public-utility companies, but
which specialized in doing business with them, could attain positions
which would result in an absence of arm's-length bargaining, similar
requirements for disclosure and maintenance of competitive conditions
were embodied in section 13 (f).
Two complaints alleging violations of the provisions of sections 13
(e) and (f) respectively have been received in recent months and
these matters are still pending. In reviewing the exemption status
of a holding company system claiming exemption pursuant to rule
U-9, another problem has arisen during the fiscal year as to the apparent control of an independent public-utility company by a service
company closely affiliated with the claimant holding company system.
This case raises complex issues under sections 13 (e) and (f) and
section 2 (a) (7) (B) of the Act.
Section 3 (a) of the Act provides that the Commission shall exempt
certain specified types of holding company systems from the provisions
of the Act, subject to the limitation that the exemption must not be
detrimental to the public interest and the interest of investors or
consumers. This limitation is commonly known as the "unless and
except" clause. The types of holding companies which qualify for
this exemption comprise: (1) The predominantly intrastate holding
company system; (2) the system whose holding company is predominantly a public-utility operating company; (3) the company which
is only incidentally a holding company, being primarily engaged in
some other business; (4) the temporary holding company and (5) the
holding company with no domestic public-utility subsidiaries.
Exemptions may be granted by rule or order of the Commission
to the first two mentioned types of holding companies and by order
only to the last three types. Exemptions claimed pursuant to rule
U-2, by intrastate holding company systems or by systems where

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

135

the holding company is predominantly a public-utility operating
company, may be revoked by the Commission on 30 days notice as
provided by rule U-6 where it appears that a substantial question of
law or fact exists as to whether the claimant is within the exemption
afforded by rule U-2, or whether the exemption is detrimental to the
public interest or the interest of investors or consumers. Section 3
(c) provides that the Commission shall revoke its order granting
exemption under section 3 (a) whenever it finds that the circumstances
which led to the granting of the exemption no longer exist.
In section 3 (d) the Commission is empowered by rule or regulation,
but not by order, to exempt conditionally or unconditionally any
specified class or classes of holding company systems from the provisions of the Act, if and to the extent that it deems such exemptions
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection
of investors or consumers and not contrary to the purposes of the
Act. Small holding company systems, whose net utility assets did
not exceed $1 million on December 1, 1946, or whose annual gross
utility revenues do not at the time of filing exceed $350,000, may
claim exemption pursuant to rule U-9 which was promulgated under
section 3 (d). At the present time no machinery exists for revocation
of the exemption claimed by an individual system under rule U-9,
although in one case considered during the past year the Commission
ruled that exemption would no longer be available pursuant to rule
U-2 or rule U-9 to a holding company system previously claiming
exemption under rule U-9 which had failed to meet one or more of
the conditions prescribed in rule U-9 and where it appeared that the
continued availability of such exemption would be detrimental to the
public interest and the interest of investors or consumers or would
otherwise be contrary to the policies of the statute. This company,
Wisconsin Southern Gas and Appliance Corporation, registered with
the Commission on May 28, 1952, as a holding company.
For the purpose of administering the revocation provisions of section 3 (c) and rule U-6 and to determine whether there have been
any failures of compliance with the conditions contained in rule U-9,
it is necessary for the staff of the Commission to review each year the
statements filed by holding company systems claiming exemption
pursuant to rules U-2 and U-9. Fifty-six of these statements were
filed during the fiscal year. It is also essential to follow developments
in the public utility industry, and to review the exemption status
periodically in order to determine whether any exemptions granted
by order pursuant to section 3 (a) need be revoked. There are presently outstanding 29 orders granting exemptions pursuant to sections
3 (a) (1) and 3 (a) (2) which require periodic review. In addition,
there are outstanding 62 orders granting exemptions pursuant to
section 3 (a) (3), 12 orders granting exemption under section 3 (a) (4)
and 27 orders granting exemption under section 3 (a) (5). Because
of budgetary limitations it has been possible to review the exemption
status of only three holding company systems during the fiscal year.
As indicated above, the exemption claimed by Wisconsin Southern
Gas and Appliance Corporation was terminated.
During the fiscal year, investigations also revealed 28 other holding
company systems which had been operating in violation of the statute.
Twenty-five of these systems have taken appropriate steps to comply
with the provisions of the Act, three by filing acceptable statements

136

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

claiming exemption pursuant to rule U-9, five by filing statements
claiming exemption pursuant to rule U-2 and 17 by requesting and
receiving orders of the Commission granting exemption pursuant to
applications filed under section 3 (a) of the Act. The remaining
three systems have not completed the action necessary to effectuate
compliance with the statute. Four other applications for exemption
pursuant to section 3 (a), which had been filed in the preceding fiscal
year, were granted.
Like the administration of sections 2 (a), 9 (a) (2), 12 (g), 13 (e)
and 13 (f), the periodic review of the exemption status of exempt
holding company systems is also a policing function, and in this work
many of the problems presented are settled informally by conferences
with industry representatives.
The magnitude of the over-all task,
however, is of very substantial proportions as indicated by the following summary table:

LITIGATION

UNDER ACT

In the 17-year period beginning with the effective date of the Act
and closing with the past fiscal year, the Commission has participated
in 293 judicial proceedings 28 involving issues arising in connection
with the administration of the Act. Litigation has been completed _
in respect to 280 of these cases and the balance of 13 proceedings
were pending on June 30, 1952. Of the cases which have been closed,
two were terminated adversely to the position of the Commission
and in two other matters, in which United States courts of appeals
had handed down decisions adverse to the Commission, the decisions
were vacated by the United States Supreme Court as moot. In all
of the other completed proceedings the position of the Commission
was upheld.
During the past fiscal year the Commission has participated in 22
civil and criminal proceedings in which the validity of action in enforcement of the Act was an issue. Eleven of these cases concerned
the enforcement of voluntary plans for reorganization filed under
section 11 (e) of the Act; two were appeals from orders of United
"ExclUSIve

States district courts entered prior to the fiscal year directing the
enforcement of voluntary plans under section 11 (e); five were initiated by petitions to review orders of the Commission pursuant to
section 24 (a) of the Act; in one case, the Commission participated as
amicus curiae and three cases involved proceedings under section 11
(d) of the Act. Nine of the 22 cases were finally adjudicated and in
each such instance the position of the Commission was upheld. The
remaining 13 cases were pending at the close of the fiscal year.
The Commission's activities in the courts during the past fiscal
year are discussed in greater detail below.

The application for enforcement pending at the beginning of the
fiscal year was a supplemental application disapproved in part and
approved in part by the district court. In this application the Commission petitioned the court to enforce its orders 29 approving and
denying certain fees and expenses claimed in connection with the
liquidation and dissolution of North American Light & Power Company. One of the fee claimants contested that part of the Commission's order which denied his request for additional compensation.
The Commission's order was approved in part and reversed in part
and in its opinion the district court indicated that the Commission
had failed to give adequate weight to the lawyer-client relationship,
and the court awarded the additional compensation requested by the
claimant." The district court affirmed its original determination
at a rehearing after the close of the fiscal year,"! and the matter is
now pending on appeal by the Commission in the United States
Court of Appeals, Third Circuit.
Of the 10 applications for enforcement of voluntary plans which
were filed in United States district courts during the fiscal year,
three were approved and the plans were ordered enforced without
any appeal being taken from such orders. The first of these involved
a plan for the liquidation and dissolution of Federal Water and Gas
Corporation and provided, among other things, for the distribution
to stockholders of assets consisting of cash and 305,796 shares of
common stock of Scranton-Spring Brook Water Service Company."

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The second plan involved the recapitalization of Portland Gas and
Coke Company, a subsidiary of American Power & Light Company.
In this proceeding two plans under section 11 (e) were filed with the
Commission, one by Portland Gas & Coke Company and the other
by American Power & Light Company. Electric Bond and Share
Company, the parent of American prior to February 1950, was made
a party to the proceedings for the purpose of determining any claims
Portland might have against Bond and Share or any of its subsidiaries. Portland's plan provided for the issuance of new common
stock to be exchanged for the company's presently outstanding preferred and common stocks on the basis of 85 percent of the new
common stock for the holders of the preferred stocks and 15 percent
for the holders of the common stock. American filed an identical
plan except that it provided for the allocation of 75 percent of the
new common stock to the preferred stockholders and 25 percent to
the common stockholders. The Commission refused to approve
either plan unless amended so as to provide for an allocation of 90
percent of the new common stock to the preferred stockholders and
10 percent to the common stockholders." An amended plan conforming to this recommendation was subsequently approved by the
Commission 34 and was also approved and ordered enforced by a
United States district court. 35
The third application which was approved by a United States
district court and not appealed during the fiscal year was a supplemental application in connection with the plan for reorganization of
New England Power Association. In furtherance of its policy to
give security holders maximum protection for their investments by
affording ample opportunity to exchange their old securities for new
securities pursuant to reorganizations under section 11 (e) of the Act,
the Commission petitioned the district court for a modification of its
original order directing enforcement of the plan of NEP A so as to
provide security holders with an additional year in which to exchange
their securities under the plan. The court approved the supplemental application and granted the requested extension."
Another of the 10 applications filed during the fiscal year was a
petition by the Commission to a district court for an order directing
the enforcement of a plan for recapitalization of American & Foreign
Power Company pursuant to section 11 (e) of the Act. The district
court approved the plan and, upon three separate appeals to a
United States court of appeals, which were consolidated for argument, the district court order was affirmed and one of the appeals was
dismissed." Among other things, the plan provided for the retirement of the outstanding publicly held first preferred stock, second
preferred stock, and common stock of Foreign Power through the
issuance to the holders of those securities of new debentures and new
common stock; the cancellation of Foreign Power's outstanding option
warrants and preferred stock allotment certificates; and the settlement and discharge of various claims asserted on behalf of Foreign
Power against Bond and Share and certain of its wholly owned and
former wholly owned subsidiary companies. 38 Parties opposing the

plan during proceedings before the Commission, and in hearings in the
district court, questioned virtually all aspects of the plan. The
district court approved the plan and directed its enforcement. 39 One
of the three appellants urged that the $6 preferred stock was entitled to greater participation as compared to the $7 series; that
more weight should have been accorded liquidation values expressed
in the company's charter than to the current claims to earnings of
the two classes of preferred stocks. Another appellant urged that
the common stock was entitled to greater participation and objected
to cancellation of the option warrants. The third appellant's appeal,
based on the claims settlement, was dismissed for the reason that
appellant had exchanged his stock for new stock pursuant to the
plan.
The remaining 6 of the 10 applications for enforcement orders
which were filed during the fiscal year were still pending in United
States district courts at the close of the year. Three of these applications related to the allowance and denial of fees and disbursements in connection with the formulation and consummation of
plans for the dissolution of Northern States Power Company (Delaware)," Engineers Public Service Company 41 and Electric Power &
Light Corporation."
The other three pending applications pertain to plans for the dissolution of American Water Works and Electric Company, Inc.,
Consolidated Electric & Gas Company, and American Power and
Light Company. Shortly after the close of the fiscal year the district court approved Amercian Power & Light Company's plan which
provided for the distribution of its holdings of the common stock of
The Washington Water Power Company, thus bringing to a close a
vigorously contested phase of that company's liquidation and dissolution.:" .The application with respect to the American Water
Works plan was also approved."
In addition to the above described proceedings, at the beginning
of the fiscal year there were pending in United States courts of
appeals two appeals from orders previously entered by United States
district courts in connection with applications by the Commission
for enforcement of two of its orders approving plans for reorganization
under section 11 (e).
.
One of these two pending appeals arose out of two orders of a
United States district court in connection with a section 11 (e) plan
of liquidation of Market Street Railway Company. The Commission
approved the plan finding, among other things, that a settlement
embodied in the plan between Market Street and its former parents
was fair and equitable, and that the attorney for a stockholders
committee, who was instrumental in affecting the settlement, should
be denied a fee because he had lost his independence in representing
his clients. In the enforcement proceedings on the plan the district
court approved the action of the Commission in respect of the sub.

rant a denial in toto of the attorney's fee and remanded the matter
to the Commission, inter alia, to determine the appropriate amount
of such a fee. The Cororoission appealed from this order. In
supplemental proceedings on the plan the district court ordered the
substantive provisions enforced. The attorney, on his own behalf
and on behalf of an individual stockholder, appealed from this later
order. The court of appeals affirmed the action of the district court
in ordering the substantive provisions of the plan enforced and reversed that court's findings that the attorney was entitled to some
fee.4D Rehearing was subsequently granted by the court of appeals
on the fee question. Reargument has been had but, at the close
of the fiscal year, no decision had been rendered.
The other appeal involved a plan for reorganization of Long Island
Lighting Company. Appellants had asserted on appeal that the
Commission in passing upon the plan of Long Island had not given
adequate consideration to earnings which would accrue as a result of
the reorganization and that therefore in determining the fairness of
the allocation of new securities the Commission had erred. The
Commission, following the court's decision sustaining appellant's
view, petitioned for a modification of the decision and for approval
of the plan on the basis of its supplemental opinion showing that full
consideration had been given to such benefits. In a per curiam
opinion the Commission was upheld and the court modified its earlier
decision and affirmed the order of the district court." Subsequently,
however, during the fiscal year, the Common Stockholders' Committee for Long Island Lighting Company and others filed a petition
with the court of appeals to reopen the case. They alleged, among
other things, that conduct on the part of Long Island, its officers and
counsel was "tantamount to fraud" upon the Commission, the district court and court of appeals in that such persons had misrepresented certain accounting figures with respect to depreciation
reserves. The court of appeals denied the petition on the ground
that no fraud or other basis for relief under rule 60 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure had been shown. 47
Petitions to Review Orders of the Commission
thc Act

Pursuant

to Section 24 (a) of

Five petitions to review orders of the Commission under section
24 (a) of the Act were filed in United States courts of appeals during
the fiscal year. One was dismissed and the other four cases were
still pending at the close of the year.
The petition which was dismissed arose out of a proposal by American Power & Light Company to sell its holdings of the common stock
of Washington Water Power Company to four Public Utility Districts in the State of Washington. The Commission treated the notice of
this proposal as a declaration pursuant to section 11 (e) and on January 18, 1952, ordered a hearing on the matter.:" Upon petitions by
the utility districts to review this order, the United States court of
appeals held that, even though the sale was to be made to public
bodies, the provisions of section 2 (c) of the Act did not prevent the
Commission from exercising jurisdiction over the proposed sale. A

stay order previously entered was vacated and the appeal was
dismissed. {9
Another petition challenged an order of the Commission approving
a comprehensive plan for the simplification of the United Corporation system pursuant to section 11 (e).50 Petitioners had objected
to several provisions of the plan and offered numerous amendments
all of which were rejected by the Commission. Application for an
order enforcing certain provisions of the plan was deferred so as to
enable petitioners to appeal directly to a United States court of
appeals under section 24 (a) of the Act for a review of their objections
to other aspects of the plan. The matter was pending at the close
of the year.
In 1944 the Commission had approved a plan for disposition by
Central Maine Power Company of the transportation properties of
one of its subsidiaries. 51 The company did not request the Commission to apply to a United States district court for enforcement of
the order. Petitioners, who were non-assenting stockholders of the
transportation subsidiary, applied to the Commission for a rehearing,
following an unsuccessful attempt to upset the plan in the Supreme
Judicial Court of Maine. 52 The Commission denied rehearing and a
petitition to review that order and the 1944 order was then filed.
Petitioners contended that the allocations to nonassenting stockholders which were provided by the plan were not fair, and that cancellation of the 66-year lease of the transportation properties by the
subsidiary to Central Maine was not necessary to comply with the
requirements of section 11 (b). The case was pending in the court
of appeals at the close of the fiscal year.
The remaining two petitions for review in which the Commission
participated during the fiscal year were filed by Electric Bond and
Share Company and by a fee claimant in the dissolution proceeding
affecting Northern States Power Company (Delaware). Bond and
Share sought review of an order of the Commission denying the company relief from its previous commitment to dispose of its holdings
of 2,870,653 shares of the common stock of United Gas Corporation. 53
The case was pending in the United States court of appeals at the
close of the fiscal year. Since then Bond and Share has been permitted
to withdraw its petition for review.
In the Northern States case, a fee claimant filed a petition in a
United States court of appeals on May 21, 1952, for review of an
order of the Commission denying his application for compensation
for services rendered as representative of preferred stockholders of
Northern States in the proceedings relative to the dissolution of that
company pursuant to section 11 (e) of the Act." On June 2, 1952,
the Commission filed a supplemental application in a United States
district court for approval and enforcement of its order denying the
petitioner's request for compensation. The court of appeals dismissed
the petition for review pursuant to stipulation of the parties dated
July 10, 1952.

Participation

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
as Amicus Curiae

The Commission participated as amicus curiae in only one case under
the Act during the year. A suit was filed in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts by one Frank Sullivan against
John J. Burns to recover on a claim for serves alleged to have been
rendered to Burns partly in connection with the latter's participation
in the proceedings for the reorganization of Eastern Gas & Fuel
Associates pursuant to section 11 (e) of the Act. Burns filed a
motion for a stay on the ground that the Commission had primary
jurisdiction over the fees in question. The Commission filed a memorandum as amicus curiae, in which no position was taken with
respect to the question of whether the stay should be granted. The
matter was pending in the district court at the close of the fiscal year.
Proceedings

Undr r Section 11 (d)

During the fiscal year the Commission participated in three proceedings in a United States district court pertaining to three separate
steps in the reorganization of the International Hydro-Electric System
pursuant to section 11 (d) of the Act.
Shortly before the close of the preceding fiscal year the Commission
had entered an order permitting a distribution to IHES debenture
holders of certain funds representing interest at the rate of 6 percent
per annum upon deferred partial installments of interest. 55 Opponents
of the plan contested the allowance of interest on the deferred interest
payments. The Commission found that the covenant in the indenture
to pay interest on any defaulted installment of interest would be
enforceable under Massachusetts law, and that Federal equitable
principles did not preclude the payment of interest on interest by a
solvent company in a Holding Company Act reorganization. The
district court sustained the position of the Commission on all points."
No appeal was taken.
The two other proceedings involved petitions by the Trustee of
IHES appointed by the United States district court upon request of
the Commission pursuant to section 11 (d) of the Act. One involved
an application by the Trustee for authorization to make quarterly
payments to preferred stockholders, approved by the Commission 57
and by the district court. 58 The second arose out of an application
by the Trustee for authorization to renew for one year the unpaid
principal of a $9,500,000 bank loan which was approved by the
Commission and by the district court. 59 No appeal was taken from
either of these decisions.

PART IV
PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE
REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations (other than railroads) in the Federal courts.
The Commission's duties under Chapter X are to participate, at the
request or with the approval of the court, in proceedings to provide
the court and investors with independent expert assistance on the
various legal and financial questions that arise in the proceeding and
to prepare for the benefit of the courts and investors advisory reports
on plans of reorganization. The Commission has no statutory right
of appeal in a Chapter X proceeding, but it may participate in appeals
taken by others.
COMMISSION'S

FUNCTIONS

UNDER CHAPTER X

The role of the Commission under Chapter X is different from that
under the statutes which it administers. It acts in a purely advisory
capacity, and it has no authority either to veto or to require the
adoption of a plan of reorganization or to render a decision on any
other issue in the proceeding. Its technical staff and its recommendations are available to the judge and the security holders, affording
them the views of experts in a highly complex area of corporate law
and finance.
Generally, the Commission has sought to participate only in proceedings in which there is a public investor interest; $250,000 of
publicly held securities is the rough guide used in deciding whether
there i3 enough public interest to make it desirable for the Commission
to participate. Sometimes the Commission has entered smaller cases,
particularly when requested by the court, where public security
holders are not adequately represented, where it appears that the
proceedings are being conducted in violation of important provisions
of the Act, or where the Commission may otherwise be useful.
Even where the public interest is too small to warrant active intervention by the Commission, the staff may follow a case and make
suggestions or comments on an informal basis when requested or
when it is deemed desirable. Because of its nation-wide activity
and its experience in the field of reorganization, the Commission and
its staff are often called upon by trustees or their counsel, other
parties, referees, special masters, and judges for advice or comments
on general reorganization problems and the interpretation and
application of the provisions of Chapter X.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

The Commission participated during the fiscal year in 59 proceedings
involving the reorganization of 83 companies with aggregate stated
assets of $574,362,000 and aggregate stated indebtedness of
$351,736,000. During the year the Commission, with court approval,
filed notices of appearance in six new proceedings under Chapter X.
These proceedings involved eight companies with aggregate stated
assets of $8,834,000 and indebtedness of $5,625,000. Proceedings
involving eight principal debtor corporations and two subsidiary
debtors were closed during the year. At the close of the year, the
Commission was participating in 51 reorganization proceedings involving 73 companies with aggregate stated assets of $558,258,000
and indebtedness of $331,297,000.1
Some of the more important matters and issues with which the
Commission was concerned during the fiscal year in connection with
its Chapter X functions are discussed below.
Activities Relating to the Trusteeship

Chapter X requires that in every case involving a corporation of
substantial size an independent trustee be appointed primarily
responsible for the operation of the corporation's business during the
proceeding, to examine and evaluate the reasons for the debtor's
financial difficulties, to appraise the ability and fidelity of its management, and to formulate and file a plan of reorganization. This requirement is one of the fundamental changes brought about by the Chandler
Act. The success of the reorganization depends largely on the thoroughness, skill, and loyalty with which the independent trustee, who
is the focal point of the proceedings, and his counsel perform their
tasks.
The Commission customarily examines the qualifications of trustees
in the light of the standards of disinterestedness prescribed by the
statute for trustees and their counsel. Where it appears that the
trustee or his counsel is not disinterested, the Commission calls the
facts to the attention of the court and takes other appropriate steps
looking toward the resignation or removal of these fiduciaries. In
one case during the fiscal year, where it appeared to the Commission
that attorneys for the parent company of the debtor had recommended
the appointment of trustees and their counsel, the Commission considered that the standards of disinterestedness of the statute had not
been followed. In the course of hearings in which the facts concerning their appointment were developed by Commission counsel, the
trustees and their counsel resigned.
The statute permits the appointment of an "additional trustee,"
who may be a director, officer or employee of the debtor, for the
limited purpose of participating with the disinterested trustee in the
operation of the business and the management of the debtor's property.
It has been the Commission's position that the provision was not
intended to detract in any degree from the fundamental purpose of
eliminating management control of reorganization proceedings, but
rather was intended only for the exceptional case where the services
and experience of such a person are essential to the business operations
of the trusteeship.
J The reorganization
proceedings in which the Commission participated
during the fiscal year are classitled
by type of industry in Appendix Table 15, and a list of such debtors is set forth in Appendix Table 16.

The Commission has also taken the view that, while an additional
trustee may be an officer, director, or employee of the debtor, he may
not have any other material adverse interest or conflicting position.
Thus, in one case during the fiscal year, where it appeared that the
additional trustee was to be sued by the estate as one of those involved
in certain corporate activities giving rise to a cause of action against
the former management of the debtor, the position was taken that the
additional trustee had a conflict of interest which required his resignation or removal. After discussions the additional trustee resigned
.voluntarily. 2
Where multiple trustees have been appointed in a Chapter X
proceeding, the Commission has on occasion recommended to the
court that the number of trustees be reduced, in the interests of
economy, because of the cessation of the normal operations of the
debtor or because the affairs of the debtor did not appear to warrant
a multiple trusteeship. In one case during the fiscal year, the court
accepted the Commission's suggestion in this regard and reduced the
number of trustees from three to one."
The proceedings involving Texas Gas Utilities Company 4 are
illustrative of the manner in which the Commission aids the court
and trustee in carrying out the statutory objectives. In this case,
as soon as the voluntary petition for reorganization was filed, the
Commission began to study the record and the company's affairs.
The petition for reorganization provided for the appointment of the
president of the debtor as additional trustee with power to operate
the business of the company and with other powers and duties which
would have given him virtual control of the enterprise. It appeared
that the additional trustee was disqualified to act because of his
stock interests, and there was no showing of the necessity for the
appointment. Through the interposition of objections, the Commission was able to prevent the retention of the additional trustee,
thus placing the sole responsibility for the administration of the
debtor's estate in the hands of the independent trustee.
At the inception of these reorganization proceedings, the attorneys
for the debtor had provided for a quick reorganization without
the customary direction for a prior investigation of the debtor's
affairs by the independent trustee. A plan of reorganization had
been agreed upon with a few holders of a large block of bonds which,
in effect, merely contemplated a simple extension of the bond issue
and a continuation of the old management. The plan was incorporated in the petition for reorganization and early approval of it was
scheduled. Upon the recommendation of the Commission,. the
court directed the independent trustee to make a thorough investigation.
The Commission, in cooperation with the trustee, made a careful
study of the debtor's affairs. As a result of this inquiry, the reason
for the efforts to avoid a complete investigation became apparent.
Numerous transactions indicating mismanagement, diversion of
assets, and other abuses of fiduciary duties by the president of the
debtor and others were brought to light. As a result of the Commission's activities, the president of the debtor voluntarily turned

over to the trustee cash in the amount of $22,850 which he admitted
belonged to the debtor. The debtor was given the benefit of a
favorable contract for the purchase of gas which the debtor's- president had purportedly obtained for another corporation wholly owned
by him. The debtor is paying less than half as much for gas under
this contract as it had previously paid to the president's wholly
owned company. This has resulted in substantial savings to the
debtor.
At the suggestion of the Commission, hearings were held before
a special master at which the president of the debtor and other
witnesses were examined. Based on the facts disclosed by the Commission's investigation and developed at the hearing, the trustee
filed a suit for damages and for an accounting against the president
of the debtor and other individuals and corporations in the total
amount of approximately $370,000.
Procedural Aspects of Reorganization

Chapter X contains procedural safeguards designed to protect
the interest of public security holders and to assure the proper
functioning of the reorganization process. Provisions such as those
pertaining to appearances, notices, hearings, investigations, and
reports are calculated to afford substantive safety to public investors
in the achievement of a fair, equitable and feasible plan of reorganization. The Commission has been constantly alert to urge that
these carefully conceived procedural provisions- are observed. The
importance of a thorough investigation of the debtor's affairs prior
to the formulation of a plan by the trustee was demonstrated in the
Texas Gas Utilities proceedings discussed above. During the fiscal
year several other cases have shown the importance of the procedural
aspects of the reorganization process to security holders.
In the American Bantam Car Company proceedings and the Chicago Rapid Transit Company proceedings the Commission ultimately
was successful in obtaining adherence to Chapter X requirements
designed to safeguard the interests of security holders. In the
American Bantam case, a pending investigation instituted by the
trustees had indicated the possibility of substantial causes of action
against the parent company of the debtor. A. plan of reorganization
had been filed but no hearings had been held thereon. As a step in a
program looking toward dismissal of the proceedings and in disregard
of the proposed plan or other plans and the statutory safeguards
which plan procedures would entail, the parent company submitted
a proposal to compromise the causes of action against it by payments
and loans which, with cash on hand, would be enough to discharge
all other indebtedness. The district court referred the compromise
proposal to a special master for formal hearing as to whether it
should be approved, and deferred action on any plan procedures.
The Commission objected to this procedure, contending that it erroneously gave priority consideration to the parent stockholder's program for dismissal of the proceedings without a thorough investigation
of any causes of action against the parent company as envisaged by
the statute, the kind of examination not feasible or possible in an
adversary hearing limited by the issues raised by the compromise
proposal.

EIGHTEENTH

147

On appeal from the order of reference," the court of appeals reversed, holding that the inquiry needed before the merits of the
compromise proposal could be determined could more appropriately
be made during the course of section 21a examinations then pending
before a referee. The court noted that the compromise hearing
tended to bypass the reorganization process and its investor safeguards. The court also cited the failure to give adequate notice of
the procedures to security holders, and the failure of the trustees to
state their recommendations on the proposed compromise. As to
the pending reorganization plan, which involved a sale to which the
court below seemed to be opposed, the court stated "that a plan of
reorganization which does not return a debtor to its original stockholders is not per se objectionable, and that a reorganization may
permissibly take the form of liquidation. * * *" It reiterated
a statement made in an earlier case that "it is not the purpose of a.
Chapter X proceeding to furnish immunity to wrongdoing, and
* * * a reorganization which leaves former officers in possession
of a debtor, which may have been subjected to improvident management or worse, could not be countenanced without investigation of
all substantial allegations of mismanagement and fraud."
In the Ohicago Rapid Transit Oompany case the trustee had disaffirmed a lease of certain lines belonging to Chicago Junction Railroad Company. Following this disaffirmance, the trustee of Chicago
Rapid Transit Company continued to operate over the lines belonging
to the former lessor for a period of several years. A claim was filed
by the former lessor in the reorganization proceedings and protracted
hearings were held in an accounting litigation between the debtor and
the former lessor.
Before the conclusion of the accounting litigation, a group of bondholders owning approximately 40 percent of the bonds of the debtor
negotiated a settlement with Chicago Junction Railroad Company.
The proposed settlement called for the payment by the debtor to
Chicago Junction of the sum of $1,125,000 to compromise all claims
between the two companies. Admittedly, the proponents of the
settlement had given no consideration to the merits of the litigation
between the debtor and the former lessor. The trustee originally
took no position with respect to the proposed settlement.
Over the objections of the Commission and certain bondholders,
the special master recommended that the compromise be approved.
Later, on the motion of the Commission, the district court directed
the trustee to file a statement of his position. Subsequently, the
trustee recommended approval of the compromise primarily because
continuation of the litigation would be lengthy and expensive and
the outcome so much in doubt that it was advisable to pay the
amount agreed upon and bring an end to the litigation. The Commission argued that, where the rights of public security holders are
involved, there can be no compromise unless the record contains
sufficient evidence to serve as the basis for an informed judgment on
the fairness of the compromise. The Commission pointed to one of
the basic aims of Chapter X to prevent dominant security holders
from using the reorganization machinery for their selfish interests
without regard for minority security holders, and referred to the
â€¢ In re Amerk4n Bantam Car Co., 193 F. 2d 616 (0. A. 3, 1952),

148

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

provisions for participation by security holders in the proceedings
and for notice to them of important steps, as well as for participation
by an independent trustee and by the Commission in an advisory
capacity. The Commission also pointed out that the trustee in this
case had not negotiated or sponsored. the compromise and had not
given his views or taken a position regarding the merits of the matter. In answer to an argument that the compromise had been submitted to bondholders for their opinion the Commission pointed out
that there had been no inquiry into the substantive merits of the
controversy and hence the security holders could not have made an
informed decision.
The district court, nevertheless, approved the compromise. On
appeal the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit 6 held that the
1"ecordwas far from complete, and that there had been no attempt to
asoertain the basic legal contentions or amounts involved in the
mutual claims on any theory of accounting. The court stated that
the trustee, in recommending the compromise, should, of course, take
into account the uncertainty and cost of litigation but that, if the
'Court is to exercise an informed and independent judgement, tho
merits of the conflicting claims should be inquired into; the trustee
should explain his lack of confidence in the analyses of his expert
accountant; and there should be some statement and consideration
of the legal or accounting basis for the vast discrepancy between the
conflicting claims.
.
. Remanding the case for further proceedings, the court of appeals
indicated, however, that it would be appropriate for the parties and
the district court to examine "the legal and accounting theories which
give rise to the conflict in claims, without necessarily going into the
actual evidence" and thus furnish the basis for consideration of the
fairness of the proposed settlement or the basis for new negotiations
for settlement in order to avoid lengthy and expensive hearings.
Accessibility and Use of Lists of Security Holders

Among the important protective provisions adopted in the interest
of public security holders as part of the revision of bankruptcy reorganization legislation are those which facilitate free communication
among the security holders who desire to organize in order to take
action in their own interest and to exchange ideas. It was recognized,
as had been demonstrated in the Commission's Protective Committee Study, that control over lists of security holders by management and by investment bankers gave them the advantage of information which enabled them to put through plans of reorganization in
their own interest and to forestall any successful organization in
opposition to their plan. To prevent the abuse resulting from this
favored position, Chapter X requires that the trustee file lists of
security holders with the court and make them available to bona fide
creditors and stockholders. In addition, others who have lists in
their possession may be required to make them available to the trustee.
While the court was given the power to impound such lists, the
Commission has urged, in various cases, that the fundamental objective
of the statute is to furnish facilities for unfettered communication
among security holders and that the impounding powers of the court

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

149

should be used only in the exceptional case and with appropriate
conditions to permit adequate use of the lists. It is clear, however,
that it was not intended that the lists be supplied for the purpose of
aiding the solicitation of purchases or sales of securities. In a recent
case,' where it appeared that there had been trading in the securities
of the debtor through the use of lists of the debtor's security holders,
the Commission conducted an investigation pursuant to order of the
court. The Commission made a complete survey of the facts, examining various data and taking the testimony of a number of witnesses.
Upon the basis of this investigation a report was prepared for the
court which not only contained conclusions and recommendations
with respect to the particular proceeding but also general recommendations for the adoption of court rules controlling the accessibility
of lists of security holders.
The investigation resulted from an inquiry into the source of certain
communications received by stockholders soliciting them to sell their
stock. It was found that various security dealers had been in possession of lists of security holders during the pendency of the Chapter
X proceeding although such lists were supposedly available only to
the trustee. The market price of the preferred stock rose phenomenally and suspicion of insider trading was voiced in some quarters.
At the inception of the case, the price was about $7 per share. The
price rose steadily throughout the proceeding in which stockholders
ultimately received $215.90 per share, equal to par and accrued
dividends. The estate received sufficient funds through condemnation of its properties to pay its debt obligations and preferred stock
in full.
The investigation authorized by the court was undertaken to
discover whether the purposes of the statute were abused by those
who were in possession of the lists, whether any lists were obtained
improperly and whether any violations of law were committed through
the use of the lists. The Commission's investigation showed that
certain dealers and their customers, believing that the debtor's
properties would be condemned at a favorable price, sought to purchase the preferred stock. The stock was not listed on any exchange
and the holders could only be reached through a list of security
holders. The only lists existing were those which were filed with the
clerk of the court, but which were not properly available to persons
seeking to use the list for trading in securities.
The investigation ascertained that there were several persons in
the business of acquiring and selling lists of security holders of various
corporations. It appeared from the investigation that those persons
were the source of some of the lists which came into the possession of
some of the security dealers. At the same time it was found that
certain lists of security holders were missing from court files. It was
also ascertained that one of the persons trafficking in lists had previously requisitioned the court files from the clerk of the court.
It was also ascertained that another list of security holders, which
was in the possession of counsel for the trustee, had been released
by an employee without the knowledge or consent of the trustee
or the partners of the law firm acting as counsel for the trustee.
As a result of the Commission's investigation, all the profits amounting to approximately $15,000 made by the persons who had

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

sold this list were turned back to the estate subject to the court's
disposition.
The Commission's general conclusion was that a reexamination of
the general problem was necessary in order to minimize the possibility that the practices uncovered in the investigation would be
repeated in other cases. Stressing the importance of having lists of
security holders available for the use of bona fide creditors and
stockholders in freely communicating among themselves, unrestricted
by impounding and censorship, the Commission believed it desirable
that official rules be adopted governing the accessibility of lists
in Chapter X proceedings. The Commission therefore made the
following suggestions for the consideration of the Federal courts:
(1) Persons who have custody of lists should be barred from using
or permitting the use of them for purposes not germane to the
reorganization;
(2) The clerks of the courts should segregate lists from other
filed papers;
(3) Persons requesting access to lists filed with the clerks should
supply pertinent information and undertake that the lists will not be
sold or used by them in trading in securities or for other purposes not
germane to the reorganization;
(4) Access to lists should be restricted to proper persons such
as the trustee, creditors and stockholders, and their counsel, and
those authorized specifically by order of the court;
(5) Such proper persons should be permitted to obtain lists, or
access to lists, from trustees or their counsel provided the same kind
of undertaking mentioned in item (3) above is provided.
In view of the broad significance of the Commission's report and
its conclusions and recommendation, the report was distributed to
the Chief Justice of the United States, the Chief Judges of the United
States Courts of Appeals and of the District Courts and other interested parties, with a letter from the Chairman indicating the Com.
mission's belief that it would be desirable to consider the promulgation of judicial rules controlling the accessibility of the lists and
stating that the Commission, in accordance with its advisory role
under Chapter X, was prepared to discuss the matter with interested
groups and to render such other assistance as its facilities permit.
Problems in the Administration

of the Estate

A fundamental aim of Chapter X is to make available to the court,
the parties and the security holders full and accurate information
regarding the debtor's affairs.
Thus, the independent trustee customarily transmits to security
holders, pursuant to section 167 (5), a report on the history and
financial condition of the debtor, the operation of its business, and
the desirability of its continuance. Such reports enable security
holders to make suggestions for a plan of reorganization, aid the
court in considering problems in the administration of the estate
as well as the fairness and feasibility of a plan of reorganization,
and give security holders the necessary information to determine the
desirability of accepting a proposed plan. The Commission has
continued its policy of consultation through its staff with trustees
in connection with their investigations and the preparation of their
reports. On the basis of its own investigations and its' wide ex.

perienee the Commission has been able to supply data and suggestions
useful to the trustee.
In the Chapter X proceedings involving the Third Avenue Transit
Oorporaiion,8 the Commission was instrumental in securing the filing
by the trustees of the report required by section 167 (5) of the Act.
In this instance more than a year had elapsed without the filing of
the report and, after informal steps failed to induce action on the
part of the trustees, the Commission filed a petition to compel the
filing of the section 167 (5) report. The court fixed an early date
for the filing of the report which expedited the dissemination of
information concerning the administration of the estate to stockholders, creditors and other interested parties, and cleared the way
for the commencement of plan procedure.
Another important problem in that case involved the validity of
the district court's action in directing that the indenture trustee turn
over cash in its possession for use by the debtor as working capital,
over the objections of holders of first mortgage bonds and of the
Commission. This order was issued upon a petition filed by the
reorganization trustees requesting the court to order the indenture
trustee to turn over, out of trust funds in its hands, $500,000 in cash
as a loan to be used as additional working capital in connection with
the debtor's operations. On appeal by certain holders of first mortgage bonds, the Commission joined in urging reversal. The Commission did not take any position on the question of the Chapter X
court's power to dispose of cash in the hands of the indenture trustee
in view of its contention that the record did not demonstrate sufficient
grounds for the exercise of such power. The Commission argued
that there was no showing that the funds would probably be returned
to the bondholders, that other sources of supply had been exhausted,
that notice to all bondholders had been given, that the loan was in
the best interests of bondholders as well as junior security holders,
and that reorganization was feasible. The Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit reversed the order of the district court and in
substance upheld the position urged by the Commission. 9 The court
decided that a reorganization court, under proper circumstances,
would have the power to direct that cash in the hands of an indenture
trustee be turned over for use by the debtor as working capital,
but held that "that power should never be exercised absent findings,
based upon the clearest evidence, not only that it is imperative to
obtain the funds and that they cannot be obtained, on reasonable
terms, first by bank loans or second by the disposal of certificates
under section 116 (2), through ordinary market channels to voluntary
lenders, but also that there is a high degree of likelihood (a) that the
debtor can be reorganized in accordance with the Act, within a reasonable time, and (b) that the secured creditors whose security is
being compulsorily loaned will not be injured." The Court further
held that the reorganization trustees had the burden of proving these
matters, which burden they had failed to sustain in the district court.
The collection of assets belonging to the debtor is a prime function
of the trustee in administering the estate under the bankruptcy

statute.
Under Chapter X, the mandatory requirement for the
appointment of an independent trustee has, as one of its objectives,
the discovery and prosecution of causes of action involving corporate
misconduct or mismanagement which might not otherwise be brought,
to light. Apart from assisting the trustee in his investigation, the
Commission does not ordinarily participate in plenary litigation
brought by the trustee to recover assets for the estate. However,
where problems arise in such cases, of a broad legal nature having a
widespread effect upon the administration of estates in bankruptcy
reorganization, the Commission may, by leave of the court, submit
its views as amicus curiae. Thus, the Commission has filed briefs
in various cases on jurisdictional questions and on questions pertaining to statutes of limitation. During the past fiscal year, an important
question involving the application of statutes of limitation to suits
by a trustee was presented to the Federal courts in litigation arising
out of the proceedings involving Central States Electric Oorporation.
In this case where the trustees sought recovery of substantial sums
based upon allegations of corporate misconduct and the diversion of
corporate funds, the defendants contended that the state statute of
limitations, which under state law continued to run despite concealment of the facts and domination of the corporation by the defendants, was a complete bar to the suit. The Commission supported
the trustees' view that the Federal doctrine, under which the period
of limitations does not start to run until discovery. of the fraud or
misconduct, was applicable to suits by Chapter X trustees. The
Commission as amicus curiae filed a brief in the district court pointing
out that the court exercises a jurisdiction derived from the bankruptcy statute and, accordingly, those considerations were inapplicable which require Federal courts in diversity cases to follow state
statutes of limitation as held in Erie R. Go. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S.
64 (1938), and Guaraniy Trust cÂ«, York, 326 U. S. 99 (1945). It
was the Commission's view that Congress had invested Chapter X
actions with a paramount Federal interest, distinguishing them from
suits based upon diversity alone; and that, consequently, in applying
a statute of limitations, the Federal court will also apply the equitable
principle, founded upon simple justice, that where there has been
concealment or domination, the period of limitations is measured
from the date of discovery or when the domination ceased. This
mitigating doctrine is read into every Federal statute to prevent
fraud and therefore should be considered part of Chapter X.
The district court held that the claims were not barred by the
New York statute of limitations because, under Federal rule, the
period did not commence to run until the domination of the debtor by
the defendants ceased. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit reversed, one Judge dissenting." The court held that
section lIe of the Bankruptcy Act, which gives the trustee a two-year
period within which to bring suit, expressly precludes him from bringing suit upon any claim against which the period of limitation fixed
by state law has expired at the time of the filing of the petition. The
court held that this was a clear mandate to apply the same statute of
limitations as a state court would and that, hence, the Federal discovery doctrine was inapplicable. The court mentioned the possibility of

alleged wrongdoers concealing their tortious conduct beyond the
period of limitations to escape liability but suggested that "it may
well be that Congress felt the likelihood of abuse too small to make any
distinction in respect to the very few states which are in accord with
the N ew York rule. * * * We think that the desirability of the
repose policy of the state limitations periods was intended to be
recognized by Congress and given effect in the manner in which the
various states saw fit to make this policy effective."
Responsibilities of Fiduciaries

One of the Commission's principal activities in Chapter X proceedings has continued to be its endeavor to assure adherence to the
high standards of conduct required of fiduciaries. The Commission
has concerned itself with the qualifications of trustees and others in
order that those undertaking to serve the creditors and stockholders
be free from any conflicts of interest.
As reported in the Seventeenth Annual Report, the Supreme Court,
in the case of Mosser v. Darrow, 341 U. S. 267 (1951), held that the
trustee should be surcharged for certain profits made by the trustee's
employees. Subsequently, the present trustees collected the amount
of the surcharge. A related question still pending is whether or not
claims of the two employees whose conduct resulted in the surcharge
of the trustee can be allowed in the reorganization proceedings. Such
claims are based on securities held by the employees which would
ordinarily be entitled to participation in the reorganization.
Objections have been filed by the Commission and others to the allowance
of such claims on the ground, among others, that the securities were
acquired in violation of the fiduciary duty of the employees. Lengthy
hearings have been held before a special master to whom the matter
has been referred, and his report is in preparation.
Where a fiduciary has traded in the securities of a debtor in reorganization, section 249 of Chapter X prohibits the allowance to him
of any fees or reimbursement of expenses. In addition, in such
situations, section 212 empowers the Chapter X courts to prevent
fiduciaries from profiting by such trading through the limitation of
their claims to cost or through an accounting for any profits. The
application of the sanction of limitation to cost has been advocated
by the Commission in several cases in which the fiduciary purchased
claims against the corporation at a discount prior to the institution
of the Chapter X proceedings but during a period when the corporation
was insolvent.
The Commission has adhered to the view that the
fundamental basis of the rule, the clash of adverse interests created by
the trading in claims against the debtor, is applicable if the corporation
is insolvent and in need of rehabilitation with respect to its liabilities
even if it is not yet actually undergoing judicial reorganization.
Accordingly, the Commission has urged the application of section 212
of Chapter X which provides that the judge may limit claims acquired
by fiduciaries "in contemplation or in the course of the proceeding"
in appropriate cases.
.
In an effort to avoid the possible hardships involved when a fiduciary
is compelled to forego securities profits or compensation for services
rendered by reason of a breach of fiduciary duty unknowingly committed, the Commission through its staff has adopted the practice
when feasible of discussing the equitable principles involved in reor-

154

ganizations at the outset of the proceeding with the parties or their
counsel. Since trading in securities is the most frequent cause of
difficulty, this subject receives special attention. Persons affiliated
with securities firms are especially advised of the need to comply
with standards which do not permit fiduciaries to deal in reorganization securities or render investment advice because of the conflict with
their obligations to the investors they undertake to represent.
Activities

with Respect

to Allowances

of Fees and EXpenses

The Commission in ita advisory capacity makes specific recommendations to the courts respecting allowances for fees and expenses.
Ordinarily the Commission is the only party in the proceeding in a
position to present impartial views to the judge on this subject.
Even the independent trustee has an interest in the outcome of the
fee hearing. The Commission itself receives no fees or expenses from
estates in reorganization and is primarily concerned with the fairness
of the result to the parties and the public investors. Recommendations are made with the object of protecting the estate from exorbitant
and inequitable charges and, on the other hand, with the belief that
adequate compensation to applicants is not only just and proper but
necessary to encourage legitimate and responsible creditor and stockholder participation in the reorganization process.
The Commission customarily attempts to obtain a limitation of
the aggregate fees to an amount which the estate can feasibly or
should fairly pay. In each case, the applications are carefully studied
and recommendations are made in the light of applicable legal standards and, in general, on the basis of benefits conferred in the administration of the estate and the adoption of a plan of reorganization.
Specific recommendations are made to the courts in cases in which
the Commission has been a party and in which it is familiar with
the services of the various parties and the significant developments
in the case.
Illustrating the Commission's contribution in this field of fixing
allowances, which has been termed "the most thankless and delicate
task in all of the problems of judicial reorganization" and "one of the
most disagreeable and perplexing tasks which falls to the lot of a
district judge," 11 the Chapter X proceeding involving Pittsburgh,
Railways Oompany may be cited." In that case, 44 applicants filed
requests for allowances aggregating $2,369,897, not including certain
amounts paid to a former trustee and his counselor the fees and
expenses of the parent company, Philadelphia Company. The Commission presented to the court through its counsel a complete and
detailed analysis of the proceedings, the services rendered by each
applicant, their accomplishments or their lack of contribution, if such
were the case, and specific recommendations as to the amounts considered by the Commission to be reasonable and appropriate. No fee
was recommended in several instances where a conflict of interest was
involved or where trading in securities required the application of
the provisions of section 249 prohibiting compensation in such
instances. In one case, where applicants had been associated as
counsel for a group of security holders and had agreed upon a division
of any allowance made to them, apparently subject to the court's
approval, the Commission made separate recommendations because

it did not believe the division agreed upon was reasonable. IS The
aggregate amount recommended by the Commission was $795,465.
After argument and submission of briefs, the district court rendered
its decision granting allowances which totaled $815,965. Since
interim fees paid to certain of the applicants amounted to $346,000,
the estate was required to pay approximately $470,000, enabling it to
turn over to the reorganized company about $350,000. This money
will go principally to public security holders through retirement of
bonds under the company's sinking fund. The court's order granting
allowances expressed "keen appreciation of the incalculable services"
rendered in the proceeding by the Commission.
In the proceedings involving Central States Electric Corporation,
requests for fees and expenses by 50 applicants exceeded $3,500,000.
The Commission filed a comprehensive memorandum discussing the
entire course of the proceeding and its ramifications and the services
and contribution of each applicant, and recommending an aggregate
amount of $1,130,450. In making this recommendation, the Commission took into consideration among other things the length and
complexity of the litigation, the size of the estate, its ability to pay,
and the success of the reorganization. In several instances, the
Commission recommended no allowance because of special circumstances. In three cases these recommendations were documented in
detailed appendices to the memorandum. In one situation the Commission urged that a group of applicants were subject to a conflict of
interest because the sponsors of their committees were interested in
junior preferred stock and common stock as well as in underwritings.
It was also pointed out that there had been a failure to disclose the
true sponsorship of the committees as required by the statute.
In
another instance, the Commission took the position that purchases
or sales of the stock of subsidiaries of the debtor by counsel for a
committee, and purchases or sales of such stock or stock of the debtor
by the wife of a committee member, or committee counsel, resulted
in the prohibition of any allowance under section 249 or under equitable principles applicable to fiduciaries. In another situation, the
Commission recommended no further allowance for the former trustees
of the debtor and their counsel, primarily because of the inadequate
investigation which had been conducted by them and the consequent
expense and delay. After the filing of the memorandum, answering
briefs were filed and lengthy arguments heard by the district court.
The matter has been taken under advisement.
In our last annual report, interim fees were discussed and several
eases arising during that fiscal period were considered. It was pointed
out that, generally, interim allowances to parties other than trustees
and their counsel should not be granted except under extraordinary
circumstances. It was then indicated that a pending case where
unusual circumstances might warrant interim allowances to counsel
for a committee was the American Fuel &: Power Oompany case. 14
Since our last annual report, however, the district court has denied
that application .
â€¢1 The dIstr1ct court agreed In principle with the Comml8slon's views although It modltled the reeommended amounts to some extent. Leave to appeal was denied by the Court of Appeals for the Third

Circuit.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Applicability and Scope of Chapter X Proceedings

The Commission generally strives for a liberal interpretation of
Chapter X in order to make Its benefits and safeguards fully available
to security holders in accordance with the Congressional intent. The
Commission's policy has therefore continued to be to prevent resort
to proceedings under Chapter XI where the case properly belongs
under Chapter X with its public investor safeguards. Proceedings
commenced under Chapter XI are examined with this policy in mind.
Similarly the Commission has advocated full exercise of the jurisdiction of Chapter X courts to insure that problems affecting the reorganization are handled expeditiously and in the best interests of the
public.
PmnsofReorgannatlon

The formulation and consummation of a fair and feasible plan of
reorganization is, of course, the primary purpose of the proceeding
under Chapter X. Accordingly, the most important function of the
Commission under Chapter X is to aid the courts in achieving this
objective.
The fundamental legal principles involving the fairness of reorganization plans have been firmly established by the Supreme Court in
what is generally known as the absolute priority rule. Under this
rule, full recognition must be accorded to claims in the order of their
legal and contractual priority either in cash or in the equitable equivalent of new securities, and junior claimants may participate only to
the extent that the debtor's properties have value after the satisfaction
of prior claims or to the extent that they make a fresh contribution
necessary to the reorganization of the debtor. Concomitant with
this rule, it is clear that a sound valuation of the debtor is essential
to provide a basis for judging the fairness as well as the feasibilitv
of proposed plans of reorganization. The Commission has continued
to urge that the proper method of valuation for reorganization purposes is primarily an appropriate capitalization of reasonably prospective earnings.
In connection with the fairness of plans and the treatment of
claims against the estate, the Commission has given careful consideration to situations where, because of mismanagement or other misconduct on the part of a parent comP:ffif;or a controlling or affiliated
person, the claims of the parent or
iate should be subordinated
to the claims of the public investors or limited to cost. All the facts
and circumstances in these instances are investigated since they form
an integral part of the concept of the "fair and equitable" plan.
Another prerequisite to the court's approval of a plan of reorganization is its feasibility. In order to assure a reorganization which
will not result in the debtor's return to Chapter X because of financial
difficulties, the Commission gives a great deal of attention to the
varioua factors affecting feasibility. Generally speaking, these factors
involve the adequacy of working capital, the relationship of funded
debt and the capital structure as a whole to property values, the type
and characteristics of the securities to be issued, the adequacy "of
.corporate earning power to meet interest and dividend requirements,
the possible need for capital expenditures, and the effect of the new
capitalization upon the company's prospective credit. The Commission's views on feasibility, as related to various types of enterprise,

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

.:

157

have been announced in some detail in its advisory reports. The
Commission's views on the subject of feasibility were expressed in
various cases along the same lines set forth in its published reports,
Consummation of Plan

The Commission gives detailed scrutiny to the corporate charters,
bylaws, trust indentures, and other instruments which are to govern
the internal structure of the reorganized debtor. In general the
Commission strives to assure to investors the inclusion of protective
features and safeguards which its experience has shown to be desirable.
Another matter with which the Commission has been concerned in
connection with the consummation of plans of reorganization, is theproblem of unexchanged securities. The Commission has been.
anxious to assure that all security holders obtain the new securities
or cash distributable to them under the plan of reorganization and
has sought to accomplish this through various means. Chapter X
provides that a period of not less than five years following the final
decree may be fixed by the judge within which security holders may
make the exchange called for by the plan, after which they are barred
from any participation.
After some experience with the operation
of this provision the Commission concluded that in the larger cases,
depending upon the facts, five years may be too short a period and
that a period of ten years would be more appropriate.
The Commission has thus urged a longer period of time to locate missing security
holders in the more substantial reorganizations.
Merely prolonging the period within which exchanges may be made
is not the sole answer to the problem. The varied reasons for the
failure of security holders to make timely tender of their old securities for cash or new securities indicated this. As a result the Commission has urged the intensification of efforts to locate security
holders in order to reach as many investors as possible and avoid
the needless loss of investments by them. It has requested the
courts to make provision in the final decree for diligent efforts by
trustees to locate missing security holders. Among such efforts,
the Commission has suggested that the usual methods of communication with security holders be supplemented by the mailing of registered letters with return receipts requested, the publication of notices
in leading newspapers, and the employment of professional tracers
experienced in locating missing security holders. The Commission
has also recommended that, before the bar date is permitted to
become effective, reports should be filed of efforts made to locate
such security holders, and if adequate efforts have not been made, the
time be extended.
The Commission has also published a pamphlet containing a list
of securities required to be exchanged for cash or new securities
pursuant to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act. This pamphlet contains over 300
securities of about 190 companies which should have been exchanged
as a result of corporate reorganization under Chapter X in which the
Commission has participated and under section 11 of the Holding
Company Act. While the list does not include cases in which the
Commission has not participated and, therefore, does not contain
the names of every company the redemption or exchange of whose
securities may be required, it undoubtedly covers the important cases

158

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

with widespread public interest. The Commission's publication
lists the name of the corporation subject to reorganization, the name
of the security, the bar date, if any has been fixed, and the name and
address of the exchange agent. It is contemplated that the list will
be supplemented from time to time as required. The Commission
has distributed copies of the reports to banks, trust companies,
brokers, dealers and investment advisers, who have been urged to
advise their customers and clients who might own any of the securities listed to take immediate action to guard against their securities
becoming worthless.
Publication of the list was accompanied by an announcement
alerting investors to "the danger that their inaction may deprive
them of substantial sums of money to which they are entitled," and
referring to the successful efforts of the Commission, the reorganization court and the reorganized company in the recent Associated Gas
and Electric case in bringing about exchanges for an additional
$4,500,000 of the new securities.

PART V
ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939
NATURE OF TRUST INDENTURE

REGULATION

The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes,
debentures, and similar securities publicly offered for sale, sold,
or delivered after sale through the mails or in interstate commerce,
except as specifically exempted by the Act, be issued under an indenture which meets the requirements of the Act and has been duly
qualified with the Commission.
The Act was designed to correct certain defects which, prior to
its enactment, often existed in trust indentures and to provide means
by which security holders under such indentures may protect their
interests. It provides standards of eligibility for trustees with a
view to assuring the choice of trustees who are disinterested and
responsive to the needs of the security holders; establishes a procedure
by which investors may obtain, prior to purchase of the indenture
security, an analysis of the effect of the more important indenture
provisions; and provides a further means whereby security holders
will be furnished with material information through the life of
securities issued under an indenture.
INTEGRATION

WITH SECURITIES

ACT OF 1933

Provisions of the Trust Indenture Act were drafted so as to integrate this regulation closely with the requirements of the Securities
Act. Registration pursuant to the Securities Act of securities to be
issued under a trust indenture and not exempt from the Trust Indenture Act, is not permitted to become effective unless the indenture
conforms to the requirements of the latter Act. The Trust Indenture
Act, with certain exceptions, prohibits the public offering of notes,
bonds, debentures, and similar debt securities by use of the mails or
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, where such securities are
required to be registered under the Securities Act, or, in certain other
instances, where they are not subject to such registration requirements, unless they are to be issued under an indenture which conforms to specific statutory standards. An indenture, to be qualified
under the Act, must incorporate certain specific provisions, including
those governing the eligibility and qualification of the trustee, and
must provide for periodic reports by both the obligor and the trustee
to the security holders with respect to compliance by the obligor with
conditions and covenants contained in the indenture and the trustee's
continued eligibility. The Commission is required to issue an order
refusing to permit qualification of an indenture if it does not conform
to the statutory requirements or if the trustee has any conflicting
interest as defined in the statute.
159

160

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Where the indenture securities are to be registered under the
Securities Act, the necessary information as to the trustee and the
indenture must be contained in the registration statement.
In the
case of the two classes of securities which, although exempted from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act, are not exempted
from the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act, namely, securities
issued in exchange for other securities of the same issuer and securities
issued under a plan approved by a court or other proper authority,
the obligor must file an application for the qualification of the indenture, including a statement of the required information concerning the eligibility and qualification of the trustee. The application
becomes effective upon termination of the period prescribed for
registration statements under the Securities Act and is likewise subject to refusal-order or stop-order proceedings.
. In addition, the Trust Indenture Act, like the Securities Act,
makes it unlawful for any person in issuing or selling any security
to represent or imply that any action or failure to act by the Commission in the administration of this Act means that the Commission
has in any way passed upon the merits of, or given approval to, any
trustee, indenture or security, or any transaction or transactions
therein, or that any such action or failure to act with regard to any
statement or report filed with or examined by the Commission pursuant to the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, has the
effect of a finding by the Commission that such statement or report
is true and accurate on its face or that it is not false or misleading.
STATISTICS

OF INDENTURES

QUAUFIED

A phenomenal increase occurred in the face amount of debt securities filed for qualification under the Trust Indenture Act during
the 1952 fiscal yEjar, when the total substantially exceeded three
billion dollars. This growth measures 63 % over the corresponding
total for fiscal year 1951 and 90% over that for fiscal year 1950, as

adopted under the Trust Indenture Act-the same as corresponding
rules under the Securities Act-to

because of budgetary limitations, no longer has available the personnel or examination facilities necessary for processing such material
in any regional office.

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT
OF 1940

COMPANY ACT

The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides for the registration and regulation of investment companies, that is, companies
engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, and trading
in securities. The comprehensive nature of the regulation is indicated
by the fact that the Act requires, among other things, disclosure of
the finances and investment policies of these companies in order to
afford investors full and complete information with respect to their
activities; prohibits such companies from changing the nature of their
business or their investment policies without the approval of their
stockholders; bars persons guilty of security frauds from serving as
officers and directors of such companies; regulates the means of custody of the assets of investment companies and requires the bonding
of officers and directors having access to such assets; prevents underwriters, investment bankers, and brokers from constituting more
than a minority of the directors of such companies; requires management contracts in the first instance to be submitted to security holders
for their approval; prohibits transactions between such companies
and their officers and directors except with the approval of the Commission; forbids the issuance of senior securities of such companies
except in specified instances; and prohibits pyramiding of such companies and cross-ownership of their securities. The Commission is
authorized to prepare advisory reports upon plans of reorganizations
of registered investment companies upon the request of such companies or 25 percent of their stockholders and to institute proceedings
to enjoin such plans if they are grossly unfair. The Act requires face
amount certificate companies to maintain reserves adequate to meet
maturity payments upon their certificates.
REGISTRATION

UNDER THE ACT

During the 1952 fiscal year, 13 new investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act, of which 12 were openend management companies (companies which redeem their shares
on presentation by the stockholders) and one was a closed-end
management company (in which the shareholder can realize on his
security only by selling it in the open market). During the nearest
comparable period for which data are available, the 12 months ended
March 31, 1952, about 211 registered open-end management and
closed-end management investment companies reported to the Commission sales to the public of approximately $718,000,000 of their
securities and redemptions and retirements of approximately
$293,000,000 leaving a net investment by the public in such companies of approximately $425,000,00o-compared with a corresponding net investment for the preceding 12-month period of $258,000,000.
163

164

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

As of June 30, 1952,367 investment companies were registered under
the Act, and it is estimated that on that date the aggregate value of
their assets was approximately $6,800,000,000. This represents an
increase of approximately $1,200,000,000 in such valuation over the
corresponding total at the beginning of the fiscal year.
The investment companies registered at June 30, 1952, are classified
as follows:

TYPES

AND POLICIES

OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES
DURING FISCAL YEAR

15

367
REGISTERED

As previously indicated, twelve of the new investment companies
registered under the Act during the 1952 fiscal year were open-end
investment companies, commonly called "mutual funds." Of these,
three were formed by investment advisory or brokerage firms which
charged sales commissions substantially lower than those commonly
charged by the typical open-end investment company. One other
company was formed to take advantage of investor interest in atomic
energy by specializing in the investment in securities of companies
which may profit by their research or experimentation in atomic
energy. Three of these so-called "mutual funds" were formed to take
advantage of expanding American investment interest in the industrial development and natural resources of the Dominion of Canada.
Thus, they intend to specialize entirely in securities of companies
organized or doing business solely in Canada and place particular
emphasis on companies or enterprises exploiting natural resources in
that country. In connection with these latter companies the Commission felt it important to point out to prospective American investors that certain tax benefits, which would accrue from direct
purchase by such investors of Canadian securities, would be lost if
the investments were made through the medium of an American
open-end investment company. For example, the prospectus intended to be used by one of these companies in the sale of its securities
pursuant to the Securities Act was required to include a notice to
prospective American investors that the Canadian withholding tax at
the rate of 15 percent upon that part of the fund's income derived
from Canadian issues in its portfolio-which under American law
would be available to an individual investor directly in Canadian
issues as a credit against his American income tax-is not expected to
have any beneficial offsetting effect for the fund; cannot be passed
along by the fund to its stockholders; and will in effect constitute an
additional expense borne by the fund's stockholders.
The single closed-end company organized and registered with the
Commission during the fiscal year was formed for the sole purpose of
operating as a vehicle by which employees of a pipe fabricating
company could acquire a large block of shares of the latter company
on an installment plan basis.

SELLING LITERATURE

The Act requires literature (other than the statutory prospectus)
used by issuers or underwriters in selliug o~en-endinvestment company shares to be fled &h the Commission within 10 days after such
literature is &st employed as selling material. *Duringthe fiscal year
the Commission continued to study such selling literature in order to
solve the problem of misleading statements made therein to attract
investors. The Statement of Policy of the Commission, promulgated
in 1950, with respect to the disclosure standards to be required of
literature used in conjunction with the Securities Act prospectus, was
implemented during the fiscal year by systematic examination of such
literature not only by the staff of the Commission but also by the
staff of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. I n
addition, the Commission's staff has held several conferences with
representatives of the National Asmciation of Securities Dealers and
the National Association of Investment Companies with respect to
the legal status under the Securities Act of the so-called "institutional"
literature of open-end investment companies, that is, advertisements,
circulars and other written material which describe open-end investment companies generally without naming any particular company.
I n many cases this literature, although not in terms offering any
particular security for sale, in fact is intended to promote the sale of
secwities of a particular company or companies. I t is believed that
as a result of these discussions, which are continuing, a satisfactory
solution of this problem will be reached shortly.

APPLICATIONS

FILED

One of the functions of the Commission in its regulation of investment companies is to determine whether applications for exemption
filed under various provisions of the Act meet the statutory standards,
Indeed, under section 6 of the Act, the Commission is empowered,
either upon its own motion or by order upon application, to exempt
any person, security or transaction from any provision of the Act
if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate in thepublic interest and consistent with the protection of investors and
the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
During the fiscal year a total of 72 applications were :filedunder thevarious provisions of the Act, 59 of these for orders of the Commission
relating to exemption from requirements of the Act, and the remaining 13 for a determination that the applicant has ceased to be an
investment company within the meaning of the Act. At the beginning of the fiscal year 41 applications were pending. These pending
applications, together with the 72 filed during the year, totaled 113
applications which required appropriate examination and consideration of the Commission during the year. As a result of the Commission's action 72 of these applications were disposed of during the
year and 41 were pending on June 3D, 1952. The various sections
of the Act under which these applications were filed, and the disposition of the applications during the fiscal year, are shown in the

approximately $11,000,000 and a net capital loss carry-over for tax
purposes of approximately $7,400,000 but which had arrearages on its
preference stock which it was estimated would take approximately
200 years to clear, proposed to issue new voting preferred stock and
common stock, together representing a controlling interest in Superpower, to William Zeckendorf, the sole stockholder in Webb & Knapp,
Inc., a nation-wide real estate company having appraised net assets
in excess of $42,000,000, in exchange for all of the outstanding stock
of that company. Zeckendorf considered that the receipt of Superpower shares, together with other benefits anticipated by him as a
result of the transaction, constituted an appropriate consideration for
the transfer of his Webb & Knapp stock.
Superpower filed an application requesting the Commission to
issue an order pursuant to section 6 (c) of the Act exempting the
proposed transaction from the provisions of sections 18 and 23,
relating to capital structure and security distributions, to the extent
that they were applicable.
Hearings were held on the application, and the Commission,
finding that the proposed transaction was fair and feasible and that
the requested exemption met the standards of section 6 (c), granted
the application (see Investment Company Act release No. 1758).
Thereafter the management of Superpower filed with the Commission the proxy soliciting material to be used in connection with the
special meeting of the company's stockholders called for the purpose
of voting on the proposed transaction.
Pursuant to section 20 (a) of
the Act, members of the staff who were familiar with the record of the
hearing examined the material and made certain comments thereon in
the interest of achieving full and fair disclosure of all material facts.
At the special meeting, the stockholders approved the changes in
capitalization necessary to effect the plan.
Subsequently the real estate holdings of Webb & Knapp, Inc.
became the principal assets of Superpower, and Zeckendorf assumed
control of the company. In view of these circumstances, Superpower,
under its new name of Webb & Knapp, Inc., filed an application with
the Commission under section 8 (f) of the Act for an order that the
company had ceased to be an investment company. After giving
notice of and opportunity for hearing, the Commission found, shortly
after the close of the fiscal year, that the company had ceased to be an
investment company as defined in the Act and issued an order to that
effect.
CHANGES IN RULES, REGULATIONS, AND FORMS

During the fiscal year the Commission, after preliminary study and
conferences with the National Association of Investment Companies
and other interested persons, submitted for public consideration and
comment a proposed new form for registration of management investment companies under the Investment Company Act, and certain
proposed amendments to the General Rules and Regulations thereunder.
Proposed revision of Form N-BB-l.-The
Commission announced
a proposal to revise Form N-8B-l, prescribed for registration statements filed under the Act by all management investment companies
except those which issue periodic payment plan certificates.

168

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The proposed revision is the first general revision of this form since
it was adopted in 1941. As a result of the experience gained over the
intervening veers, and in view of the fact that the form is now chiefly
applicablcru, thc newly or ani~edmanagemcut invrstmcnt compunici,
tho Commission believes t a t [he form can be ~irnplifiedand the \rrorli
involved in the preparation of a registration statepent on, the form
thereby reduced. Much of the historical information relatlng to the
operation of companies which were in existence at the time of passage
of the Act is no longer of importance and hence the requ~remenkfor
the furnishing of such information have been omitted.
Registration statements on this form also serve as a basis for the
furnishing of information required for registration statements under
the Securities Act of 1933. Accordingly, the proposed revision has
been drafted with registration under the Securities Act particularly
in mind. Thus, the simplification and conciseness of the new form
would facilitate the preparation of a short readable prospectus which
will adequately inform lnvestom of the material facts in relation to
the company for purposes of the Securities Act.
Proposed amendments to general rules and regulations.-Along with
the proposed revision of Form N-8B-1, the Commission announced
that i t also has under consideration certain proposed amendments to
its General Rules and Regulations under the Investment Company
Act, relating to the preparation and f i l ' i of registration statements
and reports pursuant to sections 8 and 30 (a) of the Act. They contemplate the incorporation into the General Rules and Regulations
of certain definitions and other general requirements whch have
heretofore Jwen contained in the various forms for registration statements and reports. These proposed rules with appropriate changes
are patterned in a large part after the corresponding rules heretofore
promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 and
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

PART VII
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT
OF 1940

ADVISERS ACT

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration as
investment advisers of persons engaged for compensation in the
business of advising others with respect to securities. The Commission is empowered to deny registration to or revoke registration of
any adviser who, after notice and opportunity for hearing, is found by
the Commission to have been convicted or enjoined because of misconduct in connection with security transactions or to have made false
statements in his application for registration.
The Act makes it unlawful for investment advisers to engage in practices which constitute
fraud or deceit; requires investment advisers to disclose the nature of
their interest in transactions executed for their clients; prohibits
profit-sharing arrangements; and, in effect, prevents assignment of
investment advisory contracts without the client's consent.

Approximately 243 registered investment advisers represent in their
applications that they engage exclusively in supervising their clients'
investments on the basis of the individual needs of each client. The
services of about 351 others are chiefly through publications of various
types. 236 investment advisers are registered also as brokers and
dealers in securities. Most of the remainder offer various combinations of investment services.
During fiscal year 1952, there was one administrative proceeding
under the Investment Advisers Act and also the Securities Exchange
Act against Edwiin Hawley, doing business as Edwiin Hawley ComPaIlY' That proceeding resulted in an order revoking the registrations
of Hawley as an investment adviser and broker and dealer, the Commission finding, among other things, a willful violation of section 207
of the Investment Advisers Act in that the last business and residence
addresses stated in his registration application as amended were now
false, he having failed to continue the filing of reports to keep that

information current.

PART VIII
OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION
COURT PROCEEDINGS
Civil Proceedings

At the beginning of the 1952 fiscal year there were pending in the
courts 20 injunctive and related enforcement proceedings instituted
by the Commission to prevent fraudulent and other illegal practices
in the sale of securities. During the year, 27 additional proceedings
were instituted and 28 cases were disposed of, so that 19 of such
proceedings were pending at the end of the year. In addition the
Commission participated in a large number of reorganization cases
under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act; in 14 proceedings in the
district courts under section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act; and in 16 miscellaneous actions, usually as amicus
curiae, to advise the court of its views regarding the construction
of provisions of statutes administered by the Commission which were
involved in private lawsuits. The Commission also participated in
37 appeals. Of these, 10 came before the courts on petition for
review of an administrative order; 11 arose out of corporate reorganizations in which the Commission had taken an active part; 4 were
appeals in actions brought by or against the Commission; 5 were
appeals from orders entered pursuant to section 11 (e) of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act; and 7 were appeals in cases in which
the Commission appeared as amicus curiae.
Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared
before a Federal or State court, either as a party or as amicus curiae,
during the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the
year, are contained in the appendix tables.
Certain significant aspects of the Commission's litigation during the
year are discussed in the sections of this report devoted to the statutes
under which the litigation arose.
Criminal Proceedings

The statutes administered by the Commission provide for the
transmission of evidence of violations to the Attorney General, who
may institute criminal proceedings. The Commission, largely through
its regional offices, investigates suspected violations and, in cases
where the facts appear to warrant criminal prosecution, prepares
detailed reports which are forwarded to the Attorney General. Commission employees familiar with the case often assist the United States
attorneys in its presentation to the grand jury, the conduct of the
trial, and the preparation of briefs on appeal. The Commission also
submits parole reports prepared by its investigators relating to
convicted offenders. Where an investigation discloses violations of
171

172

statutes other than those administered by the Commission, the
Commission advises the appropriate Federal or State agency.
Indictments were returned against 2,161 defendants in 491 casesdeveloped by the Commission from fiscal year 1934 to June 30, 1952.1
These figures include 28 defendants in 14 cases in which indictments
were returned during the 1952 fiscal year. At the close of the fiscal
year, of 454 cases disposed of since 1934as to one or more defendants,
convictions had been obtained in 397 eases," or over 87 percent,
against a total of 1,160 defendants. Convictions were obtained
against 25 defendants in 17 cases during the fiscal year," Judgments
of conviction were affirmed on appeal in two cases as to three defendants during the year, and five cases, four involving a single defendant
and one involving seven defendants, were pending on appeal at the
close of the fiscal year.
The criminal cases developed and prosecuted during the fiscal year
continued as in previous years to cover a wide variety of fraudulent
conduct. They included frauds relating to the operation of purported investment plans and the promotion of inventions, new
businesses, mining and oil and gas ventures, as well as fraudulent
practices on the part of securities brokers and dealers and their
representatives and an investment adviser. In a number of fraud
cases, the defendants also were charged with willfully violating the
registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, which are designed
to provide investors with a full and fair disclosure of material facts
concerning the securities being sold. In addition, convictions were
obtained in two cases in which violations of only the registration
provisions were charged. An appeal is pending in one of these cases.
Among the convictions obtained during the fiscal year involving
the fraudulent sale of securities was U. S. v. Mercedes Buschman et 01.
(W. D. Wash.). In that case the principal defendant pleaded guilty
and was sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years. The indictment
charged that she fraudulently obtained accommodation notes from
various persons on the pretext that these notes would be used to
finance certain profitable stock transactions in which she was engaged;
that, thereafter, she sold such notes to investors by falsely stating
that the notes had been issued by financially responsible persons and
represented payments due on stock sold to these persons; and that
she furnished them with spurious stock certificates, false financial
statements, worthless checks and other false and fictitious documents.
Spurious documents also played a part in the fraudulent scheme
employed in U. S. v. Theodore E. Lobman (N. D. Ill.), where the
defendant induced investors to advance funds to him by falsely representing, among other things, that he had been granted option agreements, as reflected in certain fictitious letters shown to investors, for
the purchase and resale of shares of stock of certain well established
business corporations in Detroit, Michigan, and San Francisco, California, which guaranteed substantial profits to him, and that investors
who assisted him in financing these option transactions would share
in those profits.

REPORT

173

In the case of U. S. v. Russell O. Hanson (N. Di Ill.), the defendant
was convicted of fraudulently obtaining funds from investors under
the pretense that such funds would be used to finance certain profitable securities trades which were available to him, whereas in fact,
.Hanson converted and used for gambling purposes a large part of the
investors' funds. The conversion of investors' funds, obtained from
the sale of notes in the promotion of an insurance business financing
scheme, also is charged in the pending indictment in U. S. v. Peter E.
Picotte (E. D. Mo.). The indictment also charges the defendant with
employing the fraudulent "Ponzi" technique, in that, in order to
induce investors to make additional investments, he returned to them
as "profits" a portion of the funds invested by them. This device also
was used by the defendants in a number of the other fraudulent
securities promotions prosecuted during the fiscal year.
The fraudulent sale of notes was involved also in U. S. v. Oharlee
W. Collom (E. D. Pa.), and U. S. v. Alejandro D. Llanos et al. (D.
Hawaii) in which defendants were convicted during the fiscal year.
The defendant in the Collom case received a 5-year prison sentence
for inducing some 23 banks, located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Missouri,
New Jersey, Connecticut, North Carolina, and California, to purchase
forged promissory notes of certain whiskey distilleries secured by
forged whiskey warehouse receipts. The Llomoe case involved a widespread scheme to defraud residents of the Territory of Hawaii,
principally plantation laborers, in the sale of securities which according
to the defendants would entitle investors, among other things, to share
in a fund of over $6,000,000, which in fact did not exist.'
The fraudulent sale of securities and conversion of investors' funds
in connection with the promotion of a purportedly patented revolutionary type of energy-producing engine, which would run indefinitely
on a small amount of fuel, resulted in the conviction of and a 4-year
prison term for the defendant in U. S. v. Francis A. Moulton (D.
Mass.). Convictions also were obtained for fraudulent sales of securities in the promotion of allegedly new inventions or mechanical
devices in U. S. v. Doak Norwood (N. D. Ill.) (desk pad device), U. S.
v. James P. Anderson et al. (D. Ariz.) ("Road-A-Scope" device), and
U. S. v. James D. Bobbroff et al. (D. Nev.) (lawnmower)," The indictment now pending in U. S. v, Pierre P. Pattyn (E. D. Mich.)
charges fraud in the sale of securities of a company allegedly producing a number of electronic devices, including, among others, a
cigarette lighter represented to require no fuel, flint or wick, and a
Christmas tree lighting system allegedly requiring no wires. Also,
the indictment pending in U. S. v . Richard Thomas et al. (D. Ariz.)
alleges that in the sale of stock of Thomascolor, Incorporated, in connection with the promotion of an allegedly new color photography
process, the defendants made false representations with respect to the
status of production, the financial condition of the company, and
other matters,"

fraudulently sold stock of a small drug company by falsely representing, among other things, that a sale of a controlling interest in
the company to a large national drug concern was about to be closed,
and that investors would reap substantial profits as a result of such
sale. In U. S. v. Floyd W. Beck et al. (W. D. Mo.), the defendants
were charged with fraudulently selling stock of the United Insurers
Service Company of Missouri by means of misrepresentations concerning the nature of the company's business, its financial condition
and related matters. .After the close of the fiscal year the defendants
entered pleas of guilty or nolo contendere. Similar misrepresentations
in connection with the sale of stock of the Si-En-Tif-Ik Motor
Products Company and the &-M-P Company, and the conversion of
funds received from investors, are charged in the pending indictment in U. S. v. GeorgeL. White (N. D. Ill.).
Convictions for the illegal sale of securities in connection with the
promotion of mining ventures were obtained during the fiscal year
in U. S. v. William B. LaVey et al. (D. Mont.), U. S. v. Ernest Rolland
Hennejer et al. (D. Utah), and U. S. v. Donald Neil McTavish et al.
(E. D. Wash.). In the LaVey case, two defendants were convicted
on pleas of nolo contendere of violating and conspiring to violate the
registration and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933
in the sale of gold mining stock of Victory Divide Mining Company,
and a third defendant was convicted on a plea of nolo contendere to
the charges relating to the registration provisions. Similarly, in
the Henmefer case, which involved the sale of stock of Utah Phosphate
Company, a mining promotion, one defendant pleaded guilty to fraud
charges, while the three remaining defendants pleaded guilty to the
charge of registration violations." In the McTavish case, the defendant pleaded guilty to the charge of violating the registration
provisions in the sale of securities relating to certain mining claims in
the Bald Mountain Mine, located near Sumpter, Oregon.
Indictments in connection with gold mining promotions were returned during the year and are pending in U. S. v. Troy E. Becker et
al. (D. Idaho), U. S. v. Wilder Frank Wickham et al. (D. Nev.), and
U. S. v. Oharles A. Howe et al. (S. D. Ohio). Stock of Yankee Mines,
Inc. was sold in the Becker case, while stock and notes of EI Dorado
Gold Mines, Ltd. were involved in the Wickham case. In both these
cases, the defendants are charged with making misrepresentations
with respect to the availability of ore deposits on the properties controlled by the companies, the use to be made of the proceeds received
from the sale of the securities, and other matters. In the Howe case,
which involved the sale of investment contracts issued by Howe, the
Maryland-N evada Mining Company, and the Maryland-Nevada
Operating Company, the defendants are charged, among other things,
with falsely representing that a lifetime license would be assigned to
investors for the use of a purported special process which would
permit the recovery of the vast fine gold deposits located in the State
of California, near the Oregon line.
Oil and gas promotions were involved in convictions obtained
during the fiscal year in U. S. v. Lawrence L. KeUing et at. (D. Kan.)
and U. S. v. S. E. J. OOX et at. (N. D. Okla.)," In the former case

were found guilty of selling the securities of Sunflower Oil Producers
and other securities, relating to oil and gas leases on lands located in
Kansas, by means of fraudulent representations concerning the
amount of oil being produced, the value and ownership of the leases,
and numerous other matters. The Oox case, in which a 10 year
sentence was imposed upon Cox, involved among other things the
fraudulent sale of stock of Penner Oil & Gas, Inc. by means of a largescalemail campaign, and misrepresentations with respect to the
amount of oil and value of the oil leases controlled by the company.'?
Fraudulent conduct on the part of broker-dealers or their representatives resulted in convictions during the fiscal year in U. S. v,
Paul R. Warwick, Jr. (N. D. Tex.), U. S. v. Sidney W. Tuttle (E. D.
Pa.), and U. S. v. Richard E. Slaugenhaupt CW. D. Pa.). The defendants were charged, among other things, with the conversion of
customers' funds and securities. The indictment now pending in
U. S. v. Adams &: 00. et al. (N. D. Ill.) charges that Adams & Co., a
registered broker-dealer, its president, Jefferson K. Hoshor, and its
cashier, Edwin A. Schmitt, caused the filing with the Commission of
false and misleading financial statements of Adams & Co.
Violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 are included
among the charges in the indictment returned in the fiscal year in
U. S. v. Howard G. Hageman et al. (S. D. N. Y.), where the defendants
are alleged to have employed a scheme to defraud. According to the.
indictment, the defendants, on the pretext of rendering impartial
investment advice to their clients, advised and induced them to purchase the stock of Hageman Properties, Inc. on the basis of false
representations concerning the value of the assets owned by the corporation, the profitableness of its operations, its financial condition, and
other matters.
During the fiscal year, convictions were obtained in U. S. v. Eldridge
S. Price (N. D. Ohio) 11 and U. S. v. G. L. Lloyd (N. D. nu, where the
indictments alleged violations solely of the registration provisions of
the Securities Act. The former case was concerned with the sale of
investment contracts involving oil and gas lease assignments on lands
located in Runnels County, Texas, while the latter case involved the
sale of personally owned stock of Nu Enamel Corporation.P
Convictions were affirmed in the only criminal appeals decided
during the fiscal year involving violations of statutes administered

176

SECURITIES -AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The enforcement policy of the Commission during its 18 years of
existence has been designed to achieve the Congressional purposes
reflected in this legislation. Consistent with this policy, the Commission's staff, to the extent possible with the available personnel,
carefully considers all indicated violations of the Acts to determine
whether an investigation should be made.
Reductions in personnel have made it necessary to select for fullscale investigation only those cases in which the indicated violation
appears to be of a flagrant type or where there has been substantial
damage to the investing public.
The principal source of "leads" to possible violations of the securities acts are communications from members of the public who generally
are average small investors located throughout the country. Every
year the Commission receives thousands of letters from such people
seeking information or relating facts which indicate a possible violation
of the Acts administered by the Commission. During fiscal year 1952,
the headquarters office of the Commission received 12,818 letters
relating to possible violations of the Acts. This figure is exclusive of
letters of the same type received by the 10 regional offices. In addition, many complamts and requests for information and aid were
received by telephone and personal interview in the principal and
regional offices. A substantial amount of information leading to
investigations is also gathered by the Commission's staff as a result of
its examination of documents required to be filed with the Commission,
including registration statements, annual and quarterly reports, and
ownership reports. Other Federal agencies, state authorities and
official and unofficial bodies, such as better business bureaus and
chambers of commerce, cooperate very closely with the Commission
by informing it of suspected violations. The Commission maintains
close liaison with these agencies. In turn the Commission advises such
agencies of matters coming to its attention which are of peculiar
interest to them, and during the year has furnished information in 40
cases to other law-enforcing agencies, both Federal and state.
Immediately upon receipt of a complaint involving a possible violation of an Act administered by the Commission, a preliminary investigation is conducted informally by telephone, correspondence, office
research, or interview. Often such an investigation reveals that there
has been no violation or that violations are of such a nature as not to
warrant further investigation or the imposition of any sanction. In
the event of inadvertent infractions of the Acts, usually because of a
lack of knowledge or misinterpretation of their provisions, the individual concerned is advised with respect to the requirements of the
Acts, encouraged to consult with the staff before continuing his
securities activities and cautioned against future violations. In most
cases inadvertent violators are willing to take corrective steps, thereby
eliminating the necessity for instituting proceedings. This procedure
serves the dual purpose of effectively disposing of minor violations and
at the same time educating the public with respect to the requirements
of the securities acts. In some cases the mere threat of an investigation results in restitution being voluntarily made, thereby preventing
loss to the investing public.
If the preliminary investigation shows the need of further inquiry,
the case is docketed and a full and detailed investigation is made.
Often it is determined, as a result of preliminary investigation, that

EIGHTIDENTH ANNUAL REPORT

witnesses may be unwilling to testify or produce necessary documen-,
tary evidence. Under such circumstances, since the investigation.
could not otherwise proceed, the facts are fully presented to the Com-.
mission with a request for a formal order empowering designated
members of the staff to issue subpenas requiring the appearance of
witnesses and the production of documentary evidence. The designated employees are authorized to administer oaths and to take sworn
testimony. Such powers are granted by the Commission only after
careful consideration and upon its determination that necessary evi-:
dence to complete the investigation cannot be obtained in any other
way. The authority so delegated is strictly limited to the special
subject matter of the particular investigation and cannot be used in
any other matter. During the fiscal year the Commission delegated
subpena power to staff members by issuance of formal orders of
investigation in 41 cases.
Investigations are generally conducted by the regional offices of the
Commission under the general supervision of the headquarters office.
On occasion the headquarters office may, at the direction of the Commission, conduct investigations directly or may temporarily assign
personnel to assist the regional offices in developing cases. Recently,
however, budgetary considerations have been an inhibiting influence
on the assignment of headquarters office personnel for such purposes.
After the completion of an investigation by a regional office, a
report is submitted by the regional administrator with his recommendation. The recommendation may take anyone of several forms,
e. g., for a reference to the Department of Justice for criminal action,
the institution of injunctive proceedings in civil courts, administrative
action by the Commission, reference to another agency or department
of the Federal government or to state authority for appropriate action,
or closing the investigation. In each instance the matter is reviewed
by the staff of the Commission's headquarters office and recommendations for action are presented to the Commission itself. All formal
investigations or matters wherein the Commission has officially taken
some other action, such as reference to the Department of Justice, are
again presented to the Commission for closing of the file.
The Commission's investigations are confidential and no information with respect to them is divulged unless the Commission expressly
authorizes such action.
Some of the problems encountered in investigating violations are
demonstrated by cases now under investigation. A member of the
public called to seek information concerning a company in which he
had been offered an opportunity to invest. A check of the records
determined that no registration statement had been filed with the
Commission and that no exemption from registration was available
for the securities being offered. A preliminary investigation disclosed
that the securities had been sold in a number of states by personal
solicitation to more than 100 purchasers who invested over $500,000.
In the sale of these securities, representations were made that the
company owned fabulously valuable mining properties, that a dividend of $25 per share would soon be paid upon stock being offered
at $10 to $15 per share, and that the promoter was selling only a few
shares of his personally owned stock to his friends. A thorough investigation -was then undertaken. Since the company and its promoters
232122--53----13

178

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

were uncooperative and refused to make the corporate books and records
available for examination, the Oommission authorized the serving
of a subpena duces tecum, requiring the production of the pertinent
records. A motion to quash the subpena was filed in the United
States District Oourt by the respondents.
The Oommission
opposed the motion, and at the same time, to facilitate the investigation, filed a motion asking the court to enforce compliance with
the subpena.
Afber a hearing, the court entered an order enforcing
the subpena. From this order the respondents appealed to the court
of appeals.
In another case being investigated by the Oommission the available
facts indicate a fraudulent scheme involving hundreds of thousands
of dollars. The promoter of this scheme posed as a business specialist
and tax consultant and assured his prospective victims that lie would
be able to increase greatly the worth of and return from their investments. He gained the trust and confidence of his victims by posing
also as a devout member of the church organization to which the
victims belonged. He carefully selected victims who could most easily
be misled. For example, one of his victims was a middle-aged woman
who had been released from a mental institution, and another was a
woman over 80 years of age. After gaining the confidence of his
victims he obtained powers of attorney giving him complete control
over their assets and then diverted the assets to his own use. One of
the facets of his fraudulent scheme was the organization of dummy
corporations and the issuance of securities of such corporations to his
victims. In order accurately to develop all the facts it was necessary
for the Oommission to use its subpena power to trace the source and
disposition of funds through bank records.
Frequently, in the course of investigating matters indicating violations of the Securities Acts, insurmountable obstacles are met by the
Oommission's staff. For example, the Oommission was informed
that shares of stock of a Mexican corporation were being offered in
the United States by an American national who promoted the company. The information received by the Oommission indicated these
securities were being offered and sold in several states in violation of
the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities acts.
Following the usual pattern for conducting investigations, inquiries
were made of, and interviews had with, investors to determine what
representations had been made to induce them to purchase the securities being offered. An attempt was then made to examine the books
and records of the issuing company and to obtain from its bank its
financial record of deposits and disbursements in order to ascertain
whether the company's funds were being used for legitimate corporate
affairs or were being diverted to the personal use of the promoter.
The Oommission in this case authorized the use of the subpena power.
However, it developed that the promoter and the books and records
of the company were outside the continental United States and a
subpena could not be served. The bank records, however, were
maintained by the Mexican branch of a United States bank, Accordingly, a subpena was directed to the main office of the bank calling for
the production for examination in the United States of the records
relating to the company's account.
The subpena was resisted on the
ground that Mexican law prohibited banking institutions from disclosing information concerning their customers' accounts without the

EIGHTEENTH

179

ANNUAL REPORT

consent of such customers. Further research hy the Commission's
staff indicated this position was correct, and no method appears
available at this time to secure the evidence needed to complete the
in vestigation.
While only a comparati vely small percentage of the investigations
have resulted in the imposition of coercive sanctions or reference for
criminal prosecution, the effectiveness of the Commission's enforcement policy cannot be measured by this standard alone. One of the
principal results of the Commission's investigative activities, and one
which has well served the public interest, has been the prevention of
violations of the Federal securities laws and the continuing education
of the public and the investment industry in the applicability of those
laws.

Commission during the fiscal year:

Sales of Canadian Securities Within the United States

Previous annual reports of the Commission have described the
important enforcement problem growing from the illegal sale of
securities to residents of the United States by promoters operating
out of Toronto, Canada. During the fiscal year, however, there has
been a notable lessening of stock solicitations from Canada by means
of the mass-mailing and telephone campaigns which have been the
basic source of the violations of our securities laws.
This result is due not only to the cumulative effect of the various
measures adopted by the Commission and other Federal and state
agencies and Canadian securities regulators in an effort to meet the
problem, but also reflects the deterrent effect of a Supplementary
Extradition Con vention between Canada and the United States which
was designed to cover securities frauds. This agreement was signed
by both governments on October 26, 1951, and became effective on
July 11, 1952. Since then, violations of the securities laws in connection with offerings in this country of securities of Canadian issuers
have been minimal and the widespread frauds attending such offerings
in the past appear to be at a virtual halt at the present time.
This Convention marks the culmination of some fifteen years of
concentrated effort by the Commission. In order to guard against
recurrence of "border securities frauds," the Commission, of course,
will continue to pay close attention to this problem, and to utilize
all of its facilities toward the end of providing effective investor

180

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

protection to those members of the American public who participate
in Canadian development.
SECTION OF SECURITIES VIOLATIONS

In the first year of its existence the Commission established a Section of Securities Violations for assistance in the enforcement of the
various statutes which it administers and to provide a further means
of preventing fraud in the purchase and sale of securities. This Section has developed files which provide the basis for maintaining a
clearing house of information concerning persons who have been
charged with violations of various Federal and state securities statutes.
The specialized information in these files has been kept current
through the cooperation of the United States Post Office Department,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, parole and probation officials,
state securities commissions, Federal and state prosecuting attorneys,
police officers, Better Business Bureaus, and members of the United
States Chamber of Commerce. By the end of the 1952 fiscal yeea
these records contained data concerning 56,519 persons against whom
Federal or state action had been taken in connection with securities
violations:
During the 1952 fiscal year alone additional items of information
relating to 4,854 persons were added to the records of this Section,
including information concerning 1,632 persons not previously
identified therein.
Extensive use is made of this clearing house of information. During
the fiscal year, in connection with the maintenance and preventive
application of these records, the Commission received 3,629 "securities
violations" letters or reports (apart from those which are classified
as "complaint enforcement") and dispatched 2,784 communications
in turn to cooperating agencies.
ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

Dependable, informative financial statements, i. e., statements
which disclose the financial status and earnings history and potentialities of a corporation or other commercial entity, are indispensable to
the investor as a basis for investment decisions. Recognizing the
importance of these statements and aware that they lend themselves
readily to misleading inferences or even deception, whether or not
intended, the Congress, in the various statutes administered by the
Commission, dealt extensively with financial statement presentation
and the accounting concepts and principles on which they are based.
Consequently the actrvities of the Commission in the field of accounting are highly significant.
Thus, for example, the Securities Act requires the inclusion in
prospectuses of balance sheets and profit and loss data" in such form
as the Commission shall prescribe," U and authorizes the Commission
to prescribe" the items or details to be shown in the balance sheet and
earnings statement, and the methods to be followed in the preparation
of accounts * '" *." 15 Similar authority is contained in the
Securities Exchange Act/6 and more comprehensive power is embodied

II Sec. 19 (a).
II Sec. 13 (b).
It

EIGHTEENTH

181

ANNUAL REPORT

in the Investment Company Act 17 and the Holding Company Act.18
The Securities Act provides that financial statements required to be
made available to the public through filing with the Commission
shall be certified by" an independent public or certified accountant." 19
The other three statutes referred to above permit the Commission to
require that such statements be accompanied by a certificate of an
independent public aceountent," and the Commission's rules do
require, with minor exceptions, that they be so certified. The value
of certification by qualified accountants has been conceded for many
years but the requirement as to independence, long recognized and
adhered to by some individual accountants, was for the first time
authoritatively and explicitly introduced into statutes. Out of this
initial provision in the Securities Act and the resulting rules promulgated by the Commission," together with stringent action taken
by the Commission in certain cases," there have grown concepts of
accountant-client relationships that have strengthened the protection
afforded investors.
As shown above, the statutes administered by the Commission give
it broad rule-making power with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements.
Pursuant to this authority the Commission has prescribed uniform systems of accounts for companies
subject to the provisions of the Holding Company Act; 23 has adopted
rules under the Securities Exchange Act governing accounting and
auditing of securities brokers and dealers; and has promulgated rules
contained in a single, comprehensive regulation identified as Regulation
S-X,24 which govern the form and content of financial statements
filed in compliance with the various Acts. This regulation is implemented by the Accounting Series releases, of which seventy-three
have been issued at this writing, inaugurated in 1937 and designed as a
program for making public, from time to time, opinions on accounting
principles for the purpose of contributing to the development of uniform standards and practice in major accounting questions. The
rules and regulations thus established, except for the uniform systems
of accounts, prescribe the accounting to be followed only in certain
basic respects. In the large area not covered by such rules the Commission's principal reliance for the protection of investors is on the
determination and application of accounting principles and standards
which are recognized as sound and which have attained general acceptance. This policy of the Commission is expressed in Accounting
Series release No.4 (1938).
It is essential that the Commission keep abreast of changes and
new developments in financial and economic conditions in order to
make certain that the effects thereof on the operations and financial
status of the several thousand commercial and industrial companies
required to file financial statements with the Commission are properly

reported to investors. To accomplish this the Commission's accounting staff engages in study and research projects designed to establish
and maintain appropriate accounting procedures and practices. The
primary responsibility for this program rests with the Chief Accountant of the Commission who has general supervision with respect to
accounting and auditing policies and their application.
These activities require constant contact and cooperation between
the staff and accountants both individually and through such representative groups as, among others, the American Accounting Association, the American Institute of Accountants, the Controllers Institute
of America, and the National Association of Railroad and Utilities
Commissioners, as well as with other governmental agencies. Recognizing the importance of continued close cooperation in the formulation
of accounting principles and practices which will best serve the
interests of investors, both the American Institute of Accountants and
the Controllers Institute of America regularly appoint committees "on
cooperation with the S. E. C." which keep in touch with the Commission's staff. The Chief Accountant of the Commission acts as a
"consultant" to the American Accounting Association Committee on
Concepts and Standards and as a "conferee" of the Committee on
Accounts and Statistics of the National Association of Railroad and
Utilities Commissioners. Each of these latter two committees holds
periodic meetings for the purpose of discussing accounting and
financial matters of mutual interest.
While examination and reexamination of sound and generally
accepted accounting practices consume a large part of the time of
the chief accountant's staff, the many daily decisions of the Commission require the almost constant attention of some of the staff.
These include questions raised by each of the operating divisions
of the Commission and the regional offices, as well as the Commission
itself. From time to time members of this staff are called upon to
assist in involved field investigations, to participate in hearings, and
to review opinions in so far as they pertain to accounting matters. On
several occasions the staff has furnished one or more persons to assist
Congressional committees.
Considerable time is also spent in prefiling and other conferences, in
person or by phone, with the officials of corporations, practicing
accountants, and others. This procedure, which has proved to be one
of the most important functions of the office of the chief accountant,
saves registrants and their representatives both time and expense.
Developments in Accounting Principles and Procedures

During the fiscal year the continued high level of business activity,
and the threat of a reversal to a wartime economy, accompanied b~
increasing price levels and income taxes, stimulated an unusual
amount of discussion in financial, industrial and accountin~ circles of
certain basic problems in corporate accounting and financial reporting. Many problems which developed and were first dealt with during the period of World War II required reconsideration in the light
of existing conditions. For example, there was a renewed advocation-not concurred in to any large extent by accountants and corporate officials generally-for the application of the theory that depreciation of fixed assets is related directly to replacement and that pro-visions from income for depreciation are inadequate unless they will

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

183

provide for the replacement of the applicable assets at the time they
are retired from service. Some holders of this view would, in effect,
abandon historical costs completely by adjusting such costs, in financial statements, to reflect changes in purchasing power of the dollar.
In reports for previous years 25 the Commission made it clear that
it would continue to require adherence to historical costs in statements filed with it. The Commission has found no justification for
changing its requirements in this respect.
OFFICE OF OPINION WRITING

The Office of Opinion Writing aids the Commission in the preparation of findings, opinions, and orders promulgated by the Commission
in contested and other cases arising under the Securities Act of 1933,
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Holding Company Act of
1935, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the Investment Company
Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. These
statutes provide for a wide variety of administrative proceedings
which require quasi-judicial determination by the Commission.
Formal opinions are issued in all cases where the nature of the matter
to be decided, whether substantive or procedural, is of sufficient
importance to warrant a formal expression of views.
The Office of Opinion Writing is an independent staff officewhich is
directly responsible to the Commission. It receives all assignments
and instructions from and makes recommendations and submits its
'work to the Commission directly.
While engaged in the preparation of opinions assigned to the
Office of Opinion Writing, the members of this office are completely
isolated from members of the operating division actively participating
in the proceedings and it is an invariable rule that those assigned to
prepare such an opinion must not have had any prior participation
in any phase of the proceedings with respect to which the opinion
is to be prepared. Commission experts are from time to time consulted on technical problems arising in the course of the preparation
of opinions and findings, but these experts are never individuals who
have participated in the preparation of the case or testified at the
hearing.
Members of the staff of the office who are assigned to work on a
particular case attend the oral argument of the case before the Commission and frequently keep abreast of current hearings. Prior to the
oral argument, the office makes a preliminary review of the record and
prepares and submits to the Commission a summary of the facts and
issues raised in the hearings before the hearing officer, as well as in any
proposed findings and supporting briefs, the hearing officer's recommended decision and exceptions thereto taken by the parties. Following oral argument or, if no oral argument has been held, then at
such time as the case is ready for decision, the Officeof Opinion Writing
is instructed by the Commission respecting the nature and content
of the opinion and order to be prepared.
In preparing the draft of the Commission's formal opinion, the
entire record in the proceedings is carefully read and in some cases
a narrative abstract of the record is prepared. Upon completion of
a draft opinion and abstract of the record, and after review and reâ€¢ Fourteenth Annual RepOrt, p. 111; Fifteenth Annual Report, p. 179.

:184

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

vision of the opinion within the Office of Opinion Writing, they are
submitted to the Commission. If the study of the record in the case
by the Office of Opinion Writing has revealed evidence of violations
warranting a reference to the Attorney General for criminal prosecution, or has disclosed the desirability or the need for any changes
in administrative procedures or techniques, appropriate recommendations are made to the Commission at the time the draft opinion in
the case is submitted.
The draft opinion as submitted may be modified, amended, or
completely rewritten in accordance with the Commission's final
instructions. When the opinion accurately expresses the views and
conclusions of the Commission, it is adopted and promulgated as the
official decision of the Commission. In some cases concurring or
dissenting opinions are issued by individual Commissioners who wish
to express their separate views on matters covered by the opinion
adopted by the majority of the Commission. In such cases the Office
of Opinion Writing is occasionally instructed to prepare drafts of
such concurring or dissenting opinions and confers respectingl,them
with the individual Commissioners involved, submits drafts directly
to them, and makes such modifications and revisions as are directed.
The findings of fact, opinions, and orders adopted and promulgated by the Commission serve as an aid and guide to the bench and
bar. With minor exceptions (e. g., certain opinions dealing with
requests for confidential treatment) all are publicly released and
distributed to representatives of the press and persons on the Commission's mailing list. In addition, the findings and opinions are
printed and published by the Government Printing Office in bound
volumes under the title" Securities and Exchange Commission Decisions and Reports."
The creation of the Office of Opinion Writing as an independent
staff unit in 1942 was based on the view that the fair exercise of the
Commission's adjudicatory functions in many types of cases made it
appropriate that it be assisted in that function by members of its
staff who were independent of units engaged in investigation or prosecution of cases. Originally initiated as a matter of Commission policy,
the desirability of this arrangement was subsequently given express
recognition in specific provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act,
which in certain types of cases requires that there be a complete
separation between quasi-prosecutory functions and quasi-judicial
functions. The existence of the Office of Opinion Writing thus made
it possible for the Commission, even before the passage of the Administrative Procedure Act, to meet fully the separation of function
requirements contained in sections 5 (0),7, and 8 of the Act.
The Commission, through its revised rules of practice, has sought
to provide a flexible procedure which will be suited to the needs and
desires of the participants in the proceeding before it, as well as
guarantee to them the procedural safeguards required by the general
principles of due process and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act. Thus, at the request of some participants, the Commission has in many cases availed itself of the assistance of the Office
of Opinion Writing in the preparation of its findings even though
separation of functions was not required by law in those cases.
In addition to its primary function,' the Office of Opinion Writing
is given assignments of a general nature which are not inconsistent

EIGHTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

185

with the objective of the separation between the investigatory and
quasi-judicial functions. Thus, the office is in over-all charge of the
preparation of the Commission's annual report to the Congress.
Material relating to the Commission's activities during the fiscal
year is submitted to the office by the various operating divisions for
incorporation in the report. Members of the office edit and organize
this material and draft such additional material as is necessary, so as
to produce a clear and thorough exposition of the Commission's work,
giving appropriate prominence to matters having particular significance from a financial, legal or economic viewpoint. In addition, the
office has continuing joint responsibility with the Office of the General
Counsel in dealing with problems arising under the Administrative
Procedure Act and also has the responsibility of preparing a compilation of administrative decisions and other authorities under the
various statutes administered by the Commission.
The Office of Opinion Writing assists the operating divisions of the
Commission in the preparation of opinions in certain uncontested
cases where participation by the operating division in the decisional
process is proper under the Administrative Procedure Act. 'in some
instances members of the Office of Opinion Writing are assigned to
assist the Office of the General Counsel in connection with court
appeals taken from Commission decisions initially drafted in the
Office of Opinion Writing.
Some of the more significant opinions issued by the Commission
during the year are commented upon in this report under the discussions of the various statutes.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC MATTERS

During the fiscal year registration statements covering $444,229,424
of securities issued by foreign issuers, government and private, were
filed under the Securities Act of 1933. Practically all of this total
represented offerings of bonds of Provinces of Canada and of private
Canadian companies. Apart from the Canadian offerings, only
about $5,000,000 of securities were registered, representing the offerings of only two private issuers. This was the smallest amount of
such private foreign financing registered with the Commission since
the war.
During the fiscal_year the Commission continued to participate
through its Foreign Economic Adviser in conferences and discussions
relative to the settlement of the pre-war and post-war external debts
of the West German government and of private German debtors. It
has also continued its work toward the restoration of markets for
German dollar securities in the United States upon the establishment
of validation procedures which are necessary to assure that only
bonds which constitute "good delivery" will be afforded market
facilities. In addition to its representation on the Interdepartmental
Committee on German Debts, Commission representatives attended
the Conference on German External Debts in London. The Commission has acted in an advisory capacity to the Department of State
in the appointment and supervision of committees to represent the
United States holders of German dollar bonds in the settlement
negotiations.
Following extended discussions with representatives of the Federal

186

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Republic of Germany, a law for the validation of German foreign
currency bonds was enacted by the German government prior to Its
summer adjournment. Upon enactment of this law, representatives
of this Commission and the State Department discussed with representatives of the financial community the methods whereby the implementation of the validation law could be adapted to the United
States securities markets with the least amount of burden to holders
of these German bonds. The adoption of validation procedures for
German dollar bonds is made necessary by information which has
been given to this government as to the disappearance of substantial
quantities of these bonds upon the occupation of East Berlin in January 1945. In order to prevent the sale of these looted securities in
United States markets, the Commission has continued its request
that brokers and dealers refrain from effecting transactions in German
securities until the establishment of validation procedures and the
filing of appropriate reports with the Commission. As the financial
community has cooperated in the Commission's request, the sale of
these looted bonds in the United States has been extremely difficult,
if not practically impossible.
Upon the request of securities dealers, the Commission investigated
the operation of German laws for the registration of German Reichsmark securities. It appeared to the Commission that insufficient
time and notice has been given to the holders of these securities in the
United States, and upon the Commission's request the Department
of State transmitted a note to the German government asking for an
extension of the "bar dates" for such registration. The Commission
has offered its facilities to publicize the registration requirements of
the German government when agreement has been reached as to the
extension of the "bar dates."
In November 1950, following the filing of a report with the Commission by the Japanese Government pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act, bonds of Japanese origin were restored to trading on
national securities exchanges. Representatives of the Commission
consulted with representatives of the Office of Alien Property and of
the Japanese Government with respect to an amendment to Japanese
law so as to validate bonds held by the Office of Alien Property and
formerly converted into yen obligations by the Japanese Government.
This law has now been amended and the bonds held by the Office of
Alien Property have been declared valid by an amendment to the
report filed with the Commission by the Japanese Government.
The Commission has continued its representation on the Staff
Committee of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems and has continued to cooperate with
other agencies of the government concerned with the development and
administration of the foreign economic program. Upon the invitation
of the Director for Mutual Security, the Commission appointed its
Foreign Economic Adviser as its representative on the Interagency
Advisory Committee on Private Participation in Foreign Economic
Development established pursuant to the Mutual Security Act of 1952.
During the year the staff of the Commission has had discussions with
representatives of foreign governments and of corporate officers who
were seeking information upon the regulations, procedures, and
practices of the United States capital markets applicable to the raising
of private capital by foreign companies through the issuance of

EIGHTE.~

~AL

REPORT

181

securities. The Commission has taken particular cognizance of developments in certain foreign countries which appear to it to be inconsistent with the interests of private United States investors in foreign
ventures, and has brought these developments to the attention of
appropriate authorities. Representatives of the Commission, upon
the invitation of the United States Governor to the International
Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, acted as advisers to the United States delegation at the
Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the International Bank
and Monetary Fund held in Washington in September 1951.
By amendment to the Bretton Woods Agreements Act securities
issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development are deemed to be exempted
securities under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act.
The Commission, in consultation with the National Advisory Council
on International Monetary and Financial Problems, is authorized
to suspend the provisions of this amendment at any time. The
amendment requires the Commission to include in its annual reports
to the Congress such information as it shall deem advisable with regard
to the operation and effect of the amendment, and in connection therewith to include any views submitted for such purpose by any association of dealers registered with the Commission. The Commission
has received no views from such association.
During the fiscal year the International Bank made two offerings
of its securities in the United States. The first offering was made in
September 1951 in the amount of $100,000,000 of 3X% 30-year bonds
due October 1, 1981. This offering was made by a sponsoring group
of 32 investment bankers, and was distributed by 400 securities dealers
and banks. The second offering, in May 1952, was an issue of
$50,000,000 of 3%% 23-year bonds due May 15, 1975. This offering
was handled by an underwriting group of 119 investment bankers.
Both of these offerings were negotiated offerings. In the distribution
of the bonds the Bank made available a prospectus giving information
about the Bank's structure and operation. It also filed with the Commission, pursuant to Regulation BW adopted by the Commission
under the amendment to the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, information comparable to that which would be required if its securities
had been registered under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act.
ADVISORY

AND INTERPRETATIVE

ASSISTANCE

The staff of the Commission continued during the year to render
interpretative and advisory assistance to lawyers, accountants, persons
engaged in the securities business and members of the general public.
This assistance is requested in order to determine the applicability of
the provisions of the various Acts administered by the Commission and
the regulations thereunder to all phases of corporate financing. This
service is made available to the public by personal or telephone conferences and correspondence. During the fiscal year, several thousand
letters of an advisory nature were furnished by the headquarters
office and in addition thousands of inquiries were answered by the
ten regional offices. This service frequently prevents violations of

188

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

certain provisions of the Acts or the pursuit of improper procedures,
thus saving the Commission as well as the public much time and
expense.
Uniformity of interpretations is maintained through a procedure
whereby (a) each regional officeis advised concerning inquiries received
in the headquarters office from persons located in the region served
by that office; (b) the headquarters office reviews interpretations given
by the regional offices; and (c) all regional offices are advised by the
headquarters office of unprecedented interpretations which have
general applicability or relate to a novel situation.
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT OF APPLICATIONS, REPORTS, OR
DOCUMENTS

The Commission is empowered to grant confidential trea.tment, upon
application by registrants, to information which they must otherwise
disclose in registration statements, applications, reports, or other
documents filed by them under the various Acts administered by the
Commission. The following rules have been adopted under these
Acts:
Securities Act of 1933
Rule 171. Disclosure detrimental to the national security.
Rule 485. Contracts in general.
Rule 486. Contracts affecting the national defense.
Securities Exchange Act of 1934Rule X-6. Disclosure detrimental to the national security.
Rule X-24B-2. Nondisclosure of information filed with the Commission and with an exchange.
Public Utility Holding Oompany Act of 1935
Rule U-I04. Public disclosure of information and objections
thereto.
Rule U-105. Disclosure detrimental to the national security.
Investment Oompany Act of 194-0
Rule N-45A-1. Confidential treatment of names and addresses of
dealers of registered investment company securities.
While any registrant aggrieved by the Commission's determination
of his application may seek judicial review thereof, no such appeals
have been taken during the past several years.
During the fiscal year, as shown below, 145 applications for confidential treatment were received and acted upon by the Commission.
It may be noted that the number of applications filed under the
Securities Act reflects a sharp increase over the number filed in the
preceding fiscal year-46 applications compared with 15. Of these,
34 Were processed under Rule 485, and 12 under Rule 171.

STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES

In connection with the various Acts which it administers, the
Commission has become the repository of a wealth of financial and
economic data. To the extent that manpower allows, statistical data
are assembled for the following purposes: first, to provide the Commission with material to aid in the administration of the securities
acts; second, to make readily available to the financial community
and general investing public, computations and analyses of financial
data on file with the Commission, consistent with the disclosure
provisions of the securities acts; and third, to provide other organizations, particularly government agencies and the Congress, with
data. for use, either in combination with material collected by them
or separately, as a basis for recommendations or decisions in their work.
The statistical series and reports which have been prepared during
the fiscal year are described below, together with a discussion of
significant developments in certain of the series.
CAPITAL MARKETS
All New Securities Offerings

The Commission has continued its monthly series on new securities
offerings which is published in the Statistical Bulletin, and a quarterly
series which is published in release form and contains brief analyses
of the data. These statistics show the volume and character of all
new securities offered for cash sale in the United States, including
both registered and unregistered securities, and public and private
offerings. Collateral studies based on these data have been undertaken from time to time, pursuant to the Commission's needs and to
requests from other branches of the government and the public.
According to these data, corporations offered for cash sale during
the fiscal year securities having a value of $8.6 billion, the largest
amount of new issues in any year since 1929. This amount is exclusive of sales by investment companies 26 and other issues sold continuously such as special offerings to employees. Thus the figures
differ from statistics of issues effectively registered under the Securities
Act shown in other sections of this report.
There are other important
differences as well. For example, the series on offerin~ includes
issues offered for cash sale for the account of issuers, publicly offered
issues, privately placed issues and other issues exempt from registration under the Securities Act, such as intrastate offerings and railroad
securities. Figures on noncorporate securities are also presented,
covering cash issues of Federal, state and local bodies, and new issues
of foreign governments offered in this country.
The statistics on
new cash offerings are given in Appendix Tables 3 through 5, and
more details on the coverage of the series appear in footnotes to the
tables. The chart on page 190, infra, classifies, for each calendar
year from 1934 to 1952, all new offerings according to type of issuer,
and further classifies corporate securities by type of security, public
or private offerings, and use of net proceeds.
The $8.6 billion of corporate securities offered during the fiscal
year compares with $6.7 billion in the 1951 and $6.0 billion in the
1950 fiscal years. The large amount of securities offerings in the
1952 fiscal year reflects the increased need for outside funds by

corporations to finance their record outlays for fixed capital. Proceeds from securities offerings provided approximately one-quarter of
the amounts estimated to have been spent by corporations during
the period, the remainder being obtained from retained earnings and
depreciation accruals. The amount of net proceeds from securities
offerings designated for plant and equipment expenditures totalled
$5.9 billion while the amount used to supplement working capital
was $1.6 billion. In addition, $960 million was to be used for refunding
outstanding securities, repaying bank loans and other purposes.
Of the total corporate securities issued during the fiscal year, $5.0
billion were publicly offered, the highest amount of public offerings
since 1946. The large volume of public offerings reflected the favorable securities market conditions during the fiscal year, as well as the
substantial need for outside funds by corporations. Privately placed
securities were lower in amount than public offerings but reached
a record total for such transactions of $3.6 billion, accounting for 42
percent of all offerings. Comparisons of the volume of public and
private offerings are shown by calendar years from 1934 through
1952 in Appendix Table 5. The data on private transactions include
only issues actually sold, and exclude issues which institutions had
contracted to purchase but had not taken down by the end of the
fiscal year.
During the fiscal year, debt financing by corporations, including
both public and private offerings, amounted to $6.3 billion, preferred
stock issues, $900 million, and common stock, $1.3 billion. The distribution of offerings among the various industry groups was as follows: manufacturing, 44 percent; electric, gas and water, 33 percent;
railroads, 9 percent; other transportation, 5 percent; and real estate,
financial;" communication, commercial and miscellaneous, 9 percent.
In the noncorporate field, a total of $14.1 billion of securities was
offered which, added to the corporate offerings, brought total issues
sold for cash proceeds during the fiscal year to $22.7 billion. The
noncorporate securities included $9.3 billion of U. S. Government
securities, $4.1 billion of state and local securities, $350 million of
foreign government issues, and $340 million of Federal agency
securities.
Issues Registered Under Securities Act

Statistics of all securities registered under the Securities Act are
published at quarterly intervals in the Statistical Bulletin, and a
discussion of the data for the fiscal year appears in the section of this
report devoted to that Act. In addition, Appendix Table 1 presents
information on the number and volume of registrations by months
and also classifies the issues registered according to method of distribution, industry of issuer, purpose of registration, and use of proceeds.
Appendix Table 2 contains a classification of bond issues according to
size and quality of issue, and compensation paid to distributors.
Underwriting Statistics

Underwriting statistics cover participations of investment bankers
in effectively registered issues, and include a listing of the leading
underwriters and of firms managing the groups. The data carry on
a series begun in 1938, and are reported quarterly in the Statistical
Bulletin.

InvestD1ent Companles

Data are published quarterly in the Statistical Bulletin for over
200 management investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The statistics include purchases and
sales of their own securities, portfolio changes, and aggregates of
securities and assets, segregated by open and closed-end types. Sales,
net after repurchases, of the issues of these companies reached almost
half a billion dollars in the fiscal year, an increase of approximately
$200 million over net sales in the preceding fiscal year.
COST OF FLOTATION
I88UesPlaced Privately

A report covering the cost of flotation incident to the sale of privately placed securities was prepared during the fiscal year, and was
published in September 1952. The study covered the initial costs
of selling securities privately, including fees paid to investment
bankers and others for arranging private sales, payments to attorneys
and accountants, and other expenses usually incurred in marketing.
securities. The figures presented in the report covered costs for over
1,800 issues sold privately in the years 1947, 1949 and 1950. To the
extent possible, the costs involved in private placements were compared with similar costs involved in public offerings.
Tabulations were presented showing fees paid to agents or finders
and other expenses of issuance, classified by type of security and size
of issue. In addition, tables were included covering comparative
expenses of publicly offered and privately placed issues.
The report indicated that investment bankers served as agents
or finders in approximately 50 percent of all private sales, and for
this service were paid average fees ranging from 20~ per $100 of proceeds for the largest issues to $1.70 per $100 of proceeds for the smallest
issues. Other expenses of issuance, on the average, ranged from 15~
per $100 of proceeds for the largest issues to $1.15 per $100 for the
smallest issues.
Copies of the report, entitled "Privately Placed Securities-Cost of
Flotation," may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents,
Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C.
Issues Registered Under Securities Act

Since the first quarter of 1950 a report has been published at quarterly intervals on costs of flotation for each issue effectively registered.
The report contains a description of the securities offered, offering
price, gross proceeds, underwriting compensation, and other expenses
of flotation. Each offering is classified as to type of security and
offering as well as industry and asset size of the issuer.
STOCK MARKETS
Stock Market Indexes

The indexes of stock market prices were continued during the fiscal
period. These indexes are based upon the weekly closing market
prices of 265 common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
and are composed of seven major industry groups, 29 subordinate
groups, and a composite group. These data are published in the
Statistical Bulletin and are also released weekly to the press.
Other Data on Stock Exchanges

Statistics are regularly compiled and published in the Statistical
Bulletin on the market value and volume of sales on registered and

exempt securities exchanges, short interest in New York Stock Exchange stocks, round-lot stock transactions on the New York Exchanges for accounts of members and nonmembers, odd-lot stock
transactions on the New York exchanges, special offerings and secondary distributions.
Figures on round-lot and odd-lot stock transactions are also published weekly with the release on stock market
indexes.
SAVING STUDY

The Commission compiles and releases at quarterly intervals estimates of the volume and composition of individuals' saving in the
United States. The study shows aggregate value of saving in each
quarter and also the form in which the saving was made, such as investment in securities, expansion of currency holdings, and bank deposits.
Data on the amount and distribution of saving provide information
on the funds available for investment and are valuable in the determination of monetary and fiscal policy.
The estimates show that during the fiscal year liquid saving by
individuals was at the highest rate since the end of World War II,
reaching almost $15 billion. Individuals added $8.3 billion to their
equity in life insurance and government pension reserves, such as
Social Security funds, increased their currency and bank deposits by
$6.7 billion, made net purchases of securities totalling $3.7 billion, the
bulk of which were corporate issues, and, in addition, increased their
shares in savings and loan associations by $2.6 billion. During the
same period individuals added substantially to their debt, increasing
mortgage debt by $5.3 billion and other debt by $1.6 billion.
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT EXPENDITURS OF U. S. BUSINESS

The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce, continued the joint series of quarterly releases on the plant and equipment expenditures of United States business other than agricultural.
Shortly after the close of each quarter these releases present industry
totals on the actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated expenditures for the next two quarters. In addition, a survey
is made at the beginning of each year of the plans of business as regards expansion during that year.
During the fiscal year the data on expenditures of manufacturing
companies were revised and progress was made in connection with
improving the coverage for noncorporate businesses. In addition,
both corporate and noncorporate segments were related to basic
figures in Statistics of Income. These data have provided a useful
index of present and future activity in the capital markets and of
business in general.
The survey indicates that during the fiscal year, American business,
exclusive of agriculture, spent a record amount of $27.3 billion for
expansion of plant and new equipment. According to their plans
at mid-1952, manufacturing companies expected to make plant and
equipment expenditures of $12.8 billion in the calendar year 1952, a
new high and 15 percent above the 1951 amount. Increases of over
30 percent were expected in the expenditures of such defense-related
industries as nonferrous metals, rubber, petroleum refining, and iron
and steel, while decreases were anticipated in most nondefense industries.

FINANCIAL POSITION OF CORPORATIONS
Work Capital Position

The series of quarterly releases on the working capital position of all
United States corporations, exclusive of banks and insurance companies, was continued in the fiscal year. These releases show the
principal components of current assets and current liabilities and an
abbreviated analysis of the sources and uses of corporate funds. These
data are important in measuring the liquid position of the corporate
segment of the economy taken as a whole.
At the end of the fiscal year the net working capital of United States
corporations reached a record of $85.7 billion. At that date corporations held $29.7 billion of cash and $20.0 billion of U. S. Government
securities, these together amounting to 59 percent of their current
liabilities.
Balance Sheet and Income Statements

The Commission, together with the Federal Trade Commission,
continued the joint series of quarterly industrial financial reports,
which were developed as an extension of the working capital series.
Complete balance sheet data and abbreviated income data have been
published for manufacturing companies since the first quarter of 194'7.
During the fiscal year the report was expanded to cover wholesale and
retail trade corporations, data being published for the year 1950 and
the four quarters of 1951. For both manufacturing and trade companies, data are shown for various size groups of companies and for
minor industry groups. The financial report program includes data
on profits, which are extremely important in the formulation of a tax
program and renegotiation policy. The data are basic to any appraisalof corporate financial position and any analysis of corporation
finance and the capital markets.
During the fiscal year the report on manufacturing companies,
as well as wholesale and retail trade companies, was again supplied
to the Officeof Price Stabilization in connection with the determination
of price policy.

In order to stay within its appropriation for the 1952 fiscal year, the
Commission reduced its staff from 1027 as of June 30, 1951, to 926
employees by September 30, 1951, and effected further reductions
through not filling vacancies until the staff had been reduced to the
866 figure on June 30. The graph on page 195 illustrates the extent
to which this and similar appropriation cuts over the past twelve
years have reduced the Commission's staff.
The Commission has arrived at its budget estimates for past years
on the basis of careful consideration of both the need for economy and
essential personnel requirements.

EXCHANGE COMMISSION

since the end of World War II, except 1951, its appropriation has been
reduced. From an average employment of 1723 in 1941, the staff
dropped to approximately 1200 persons in 1947. The appropriation
for the 1952 fiscal year permitted an average employment of 929, and
the 1953 fiscal year appropriation will permit an average employment
of only 807 persons. In contrast to these sharp reductions in personnel, the Commission's duties under the six statutes administered by it
and under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act have not decreased since
1941, except for some types of work under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act. To the contrary, the work load has increased in
many respects.
Notwithstanding the staff's exceptional competency and devotion
to duty, and the Commission's utilization of every possible procedural and organizational device to increase the efficiency and
economy of operations, the net effect of these personnel cuts inevitably
has been the severe curtailment of its operations. The staff's devotion to duty is illustrated by the fact that on December 31, 1951,
the end of the accounting period under the Federal leave statute then
in effect, employees of the Commission forfeited 922 days of annual
leave, worth approximately-$21,250.00 .. In addition, throughout the
fiscal year, the staff worked many hours of voluntary overtime for
which they received no compensation.
In addition to the simplification of reporting requirements and
other procedural changes described elsewhere in this report, which
were designed to conserve manpower and further the maximum utilization of available resources, the following organizational changes
were effected during the fiscal year to serve that purpose:
As a result of the appropriation cut, the Commission in August
1951 discontinued the small Registration Unit in its San Francisco
Regional Office, which had been maintained for many years as a
con venience to issuers of securities in the Far West, and two small
branch offices, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and St. Louis, Missouri.
In September 1951, a substantial portion of the Commission's
offset reproduction work was transferred to the Government Printing
Office,resulting in a reduction in the Commission's staff in the duplicating shop from 30 to 12. Although a cost accounting survey had indicated that this would involve a relatively small monetary saving to
the Commission, other considerations made this action desirable.
For example, certain publications, which had been distributed free
of charge to individuals, firms and corporations, now are sold on a
subscription basis by the Superintendent of Documents.
In May 1952, the Commission's Divisions of Administrative Services, Budget and Finance, and Personnel were consolidated into a
new Division of Administrative Management.
The new division
operates under and is responsible to the Chairman of the Commission.
The Executive Assistant to the Chairman also serves as the Director
of the new division and Chairman of the Management Improvement
Committee. The consolidation of these administrative management
functions in one division has given more formal recognition to the
transfer of executive functions to the Chairman under Reorganization
Plan 10. In addition, it is designed to provide for even greater coordination, efficiency and effectiveness in the performance of these
related activities.
The organization of the Commission's staff, as of June 30, 1952, is
shown below:

Fees and other receipts must be turned over to the General Fund of
the Treasury and are not available for expenditure by the Commission.
Proposed Fees and Charges

On August 31, 1951, the Congress, in Public Law 137, authorized
Federal agencies to prescribe fair and equitable fees for "any work,
service, publication, report, document, benefit, privilege, authority,
use, franchise, license, permit, certificate, registration, or similar
thing of value or utility" provided by any such agency in order that
its functions should be "self-sustaining to the full extent possible."
Any fee regulation adopted by a Federal agency was to be subject to
such policies as the President may prescribe, and, as in the case of
fees presently collected, all fees would be turned over to the Treasury.
Pursuant to this Act and the ad vice of the Bureau of the Budget
that the above provision should be implemented, the Commission
published in the Federal Register and sent out for comment proposed
rules which provided for certain fees and charges for various of its
services for which no charge is now made. It was estimated that total
annual receipts from the adoption of these rules would be about
$1,225,000.
The Commission received numerous protests against the proposed
fees, briefs were filed, and the Commission heard oral argument in
March 1952. The principal objections advanced were that the proposed fees were unfair and that the Commission did not have the
power to impose them. The proposals and the objections raised
thereto are under consideration by the Commission's staff which will
submit its recommendations to the Commission.
In the meantime a bill to amend this Act was introduced in the
Congress providing that the Commission should have no authority
to prescribe fees with respect to brokers or dealers subject to the
Securities Exchange Act. On April 30 and May 1, 1952, the SEC
Subcommittee of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce, to which the bill was referred, held hearings on the bill
and the Commission's fee proposals. No action had been reported
by the subcommittee at the close of the fiscal year.

Public Releases

Releases of the Commission consist primarily of official announcements of filings under and actions taken pursuant to the several Acts
which it administers. These include notices of filings, hearings,
orders, decisions, regulations, and related Commission matters. The
Commission is continuing to improve its service and to effect economies in connection with its mailing lists through the continuation of
procedures which avoid the full-scale distribution of the complete
releases except to those persons who are sufficiently interested to
make a special request therefor.
The announcements issued during the fiscal year included 28 releases under the Securities Act of 1933; 111 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934; 710 under the Public Utility Holding Company

seeunties such as obligations of the United States, states, counties, cities, and United States-owned corporations, are exempted under see. 3 (a) (12) of the Act, are not included iLl this table.) Each issuer Is
counted once under each basis for admission of securities to dealing. Thus, an issuer having securities
registered on two or more exchanges and unllstea on two or more exchanges I. counted once under "reg.
istered" and once under "unlisted." Because of thl'$ duplleatlons, column 1 is not totaled .
