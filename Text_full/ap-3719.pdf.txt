ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17116

In the Matter of
CHINA RONGXIN CHEMICAL HOLDING GROUP,
INC., and
VES VENTURES & HOLDINGS, INC. (A/K/A
HELIOS ENERGIA, INC., A/K/A ACCELERATED
ACQUISITIONS XXI, INC.)

ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AS TO
SECOND RESPONDENT

On February 12, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in
their periodic filings. A telephonic prehearing conference is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. EDT on
March 28, 2016.
I previously issued a show cause order to Ves Ventures & Holdings, Inc. (a/k/a Helios
Energia, Inc., a/k/a Accelerated Acquisitions XXI, Inc.) and its response is due March 21. See
China Rongxin Chem. Holding Grp., Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3688, 2016 SEC
LEXIS 908 (Mar. 9, 2016). Also, I found that China Rongxin Chemical Holding Group, Inc.,
was served with the OIP on March 3, and its answer was due March 16. Id. To date, China
Rongxin has not filed an answer.
Accordingly, I ORDER China Rongxin to SHOW CAUSE by March 28, 2016, why the
registration of its securities should not be revoked by default due to its failure to file an answer or
otherwise defend this proceeding. If China Rongxin fails to respond to this order or attend the
March 28 prehearing conference, it will be deemed in default and the registration of its securities
will be revoked. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f).
