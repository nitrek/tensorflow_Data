PART I
CURRENT PROBLEMS BEFORE THE COMMISSION
Foreword

Fiscal year 1962 witnessed extraordinary activity in all aspects of
the Commission's responsibilities. The peaks reached during fiscal
1961 in the flotation of new issues of securities, in broker-dealers and
investment advisers registered with the Commission, and in the number of customers men employed and branch offices maintained by
securities firms were equalled or exceeded. The sustained high level
of activity and the wide public participation in the securities markets
continued to attract untrained salesmen as well as those who seek to
take advantage of greater interest in investment by new and inexperienced investors. These factors compelled increased vigilance in regulatory matters and more vigorous enforcement effort by the Commission and by the self-regulatory agencies of the securities industry.
During the year the Commission adopted a number of significant
statements of policy and rules. At the end of the fiscal year other
rules which had been published for public consideration were under
study in the light of the comments received. The number of enforcement actions taken---eivil, criminal and administrative---eontinued
to rise.
Apart from the problems arising in the course of the regular activities of the Commission, fiscal 1962saw the commencement of the Commission's Special Study of Securities Markets, the first comprehensive
study of the securities markets in more than 25 years. A sharp break
in securities prices toward the end of the fiscal year has also required
an examination in depth of the events which preceded and accompanied this dramatic price decline as well as the performance of important market mechanisms and those professionally responsible for
their operation.
During the fiscal year, the Commission also received a report of a
study of certain facets of open-end (mutual) investment company
operations conducted for the Commission by the Wharton School of
Finance and Commerce, University of Pennsylvania. This is the first
detailed study made of an increasingly important investment medium
since the Commission's studies which preceded passage of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In the paragraphs and chapters which follow we refer in somewhat
greater detail to these and other matters which received the attention
of the Commission and its staff in fiscal 1962.
Special Study of Securities Markets

The Study was authorized by Public Law 87-196, enacted early in
September 1961, which directed the Commission to make a study and
investigation of the adequacy, for the protection of investors, of the
rules of stock exchanges and national securities associations and to
report to the Congress, on or before January 3, 1963, the results of its
study together with its recommendations. Following organization of
the Study unit and preliminary analysis of the topics to be investigated, it became apparent that the thorough examination and reassessment of the securities markets which were contemplated by the
Congress could be completed only if the reporting date were extended.
Public La w 87-561 extended the Study to April 3, 1963.
The Study, as the Congress intended, is extremely broad in scope.
The effectiveness of industry self-regulation through the stock
exchan ges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. is
undergoing thorough examination. Intensive inquiries are being conducted into the rules and practices of the stock exchanges, including
those relating to the role of specialists, floor traders and odd-lot
dealers.
The structure of the over-the-counter market and the adequacy of
its regulation, such as controls over quotations systems, are the subject
of a detailed review. Information is also being gathered regarding
the character of issuers whose securities are traded in that market.
Under existing law, a large number of these issuers in whose securities
there is a substantial public interest are not subject to any of the
reporting or other regulatory requirements imposed on companies
whose securities are listed on an exchange. On the basis of the information gathered, the Commission expects to determine the appropriateness of existing distinctions in the regul ation of these two
categories of issuers.
The Study is also conducting an investigation into the process by
which corporations distribute their securities to the public, and into
the over-the-counter trading in these securities after distribution,
including the problem of so-called "hot issues." Other major subjects
of scrutiny include the adequacy of the existing pattern of securities
credit regulation and any gaps and inconsistencies with respect to the
types of lenders and securities covered; the techniques and uses of
financial publicity; standards of entrance into the securities business;
and sales practices, including those relating to mutual funds. Substantial progress has been made in gathering information in all these

areas, through questionnaires, interviews and public hearings, and in
analyzing such information.
.
It is anticipated that upon completion of the Study, the present
regular staff of the Commission, and additional personnel from the
Study, will be assigned the task of implementing the findings and
recommendations made.
The Commission believes that the Study has already had a beneficial
effect by stimulating significant developments in the form of rule
changes, the establishment of internal control procedures and new or
improved testing and training programs by broker-dealers, and
vigorous disciplinary actions by the self-regulatory agencies of the
industry. These steps reflect an increased awareness by the financial
community of its responsibilities and have assisted in establishing a
more salutary climate in the securities markets. The most dramatic
illustration of this new climate is the reorganization of the American
Stock Exchange. An investigation of that Exchange, which had commenced prior to the authorization of the Study, was completed with
the participation of personnel from the Study, and a report was issued
on January 6, 1962. The report concluded, on the basis of detailed
findings, that in the case of that Exchange the statutory scheme of
self-regulation had not worked in the manner envisioned by Congress.
Since that time, substantial changes have occurred in the staff, organization and constitutional structure of the Exchange. This reorganization was effected by the Exchange itself, consistent with the
Commission's belief that self-regulation could be revitalized on a
realistic basis. The Commission maintained close coordination with
the Exchange throughout the process of reorganization.
The Wharton School Study of Investment Companies

As reported previously, the Commission engaged the Wharton
School of the University of Pennsylvania to conduct a fact-finding
study of the problems created by the growth in size of investment
companies. Shortly after the close of fiscal year 1962, the study was
completed and was transmitted to the Commission which in turn submitted it to the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce,
House of Representatives. The study constitutes the most comprehensive analysis of the mutual fund industry since the Commission's
study made more than 20 years ago, prior to the adoption of the
Investment Company Act of 1940. It analyzes the growth, organization and control, investment policy, and performance of open-end
investment companies or mutual funds, their impact on securities
markets, the extent of control of portfolio companies, and the financial
and other relationships of mutual funds with their investment
advisers and principal underwriters,

SECURITIES

AND

EXCHA-1'\'GE COMMISSION

The staff of the Commission is now engaged in an evaluation of the
conclusions and comments contained in the Wharton School Study, in
a study of the structure of the investment company industry generally,
and in a reassessment of the provisions of the Investment Company
Act and the Commission's rules and regulations thereunder.
This
detailed analysis, together with related Commission studies now in
progress, will aid the Commission in determining whether specific
legislative recommendations should be made to the Congress with
respect to the Act and what action, if any, should be taken to
strengthen the rules and regulations under the Act.
Registration of New Security Offerings

Although the number of registration statements filed under the
Securities Act of 1933 with respect to securities issues proposed to be
publicly offered dropped off as a result of the market decline toward
the end of the fiscal year, the total number of statements filed during
the year, 2,307, far exceeded that for any previous year in the Commission's history. This figure represents an increase of 26 per cent
over the record number of statements filed in the preceding year. The
dollar amount represented by these statements aggregated $21.6 billion, or 4.4 per cent more than the corresponding figure for the previous year. During fiscal year 1962, 1,815 statements relating to
offerings of $19.5 billion of securities became effective, also a record
both in number and dollar amount,
as graphically shown in the
chart on page 5.
The unprecedented number of registration statements filed placed
a heavy burden upon the Commission's staff. Aside from the sheer
volume of statements, a record number of 1,377 statements representing 60 percent of all those filed, related to companies that had not
previously been subject to the registration process. The examination
of such statements tends of necessity to be more time-consuming than
that of filings by issuers which have previously gone through the registration process.
In an effort to reduce the record backlog of registration statements
on file, the staff of the Commission was forced to work :frequently on
an over-time basis and the Commission effected a number of changes
in processing procedures during the fiscal year. Among other things,
it was decided to reduce the amount and layers of review, particularly
with respect to statements relating to high grade debt securities and
those filed by public utility companies, by established companies which
have filed financial information with the Commission within recent
periods, and by other established companies where the registration
statement is meticulously prepared and the financial statements are
unexceptionable.
The Commission also took steps to dispose of a

large group of statements which had been unsatisfactorily prepared,
and had been on the docket for a long time without any corrective
amendments having been filed.
Enforcement

Activity

During the fiscal year, fraudulent sales of securities and other illegal
practices in connection with securities transactions presented, as in
past years, a major problem for the Commission and occupied the time
of a large portion of its staff. As described in more detail in subsequent portions of this report, the Commission continued to pursue a
vigorous enforcement program. Thus, it referred 64 cases to the
Department of Justice for criminal prosecution during the year, constituting the largest number of referrals in a single year in the Commission's history, and brought 89 injunction actions. In addition,
a total of 503 investigations of securities transactions involving pos-

6

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

sible violations of the antifraud or other provisions of the securities
acts were instituted, and 51 orders suspending the exemption from
registration provided for small security issues were issued.
Delegation of Functions

The enactment in August 1962 of Public Law 87-592, authorizing
the Commission to delegate to staff members certain of its functions,
should have the effect of strengthening the Commission's administration of the various acts administered by it. When implemented, the
proposed delegation will relieve the Commissioners from certain routine matters with which they now deal and free them to devote more
attention to major matters of policy and planning.
In December 1962, following extensive work by the Commission
and at the staff level with a view to implementation of the law, the
Commission published notice that it had under consideration the adoption of rules which would accomplish delegation of various routine
functions to certain of its staff officials, including Division and Office
heads and regional administrators, to be performed by them or under
their direction by such persons as might be designated from time to
time by the Chairman.

PART II
LEGISLATIVE ACfIVITIES
Early in the fiscal year, the Congress passed and the President
signed Public Law 87-196, which directed the Commission to make a
study and investigation of the adequacy of the rules of national
securities exchanges and national securities associations." Subsequently, Public Law 87-561 extended, from January 3, 1963 to
April 3, 1963, the date by which the Commission is required to report
to the Congress the results of its study and investigation, together
with its recommendations.
Because of the extensive study of the securities markets which is
still in progress under these laws, the Commission did not recommend any legislative program of its own during the Second Session
of the 87th Congress. Several items of legislation suggested by the
Commission in recent years which have not as yet been enacted may
now be merged in broader legislative recommendations growing out
of the Market Study, and it was thought best not to make any piecemeal recommendations during the pendency of the Study. It is
unlikely that the Commission will make substantial legislative proposals prior to the completion of the Study in April 1963, unless the
results of portions of the Study should suggest certain legislative
changes or additions which might lend themselves to separate treatment in advance of completion of the entire Study.
Apart from the authorization of the Special Study and the extension of time for its completion, the legislation enacted during this
past year which has the most direct effect upon the work of the Commission is S. 2135 which became Public Law 87-592 subsequent to
the close of the fiscal year. This law is the legislative version of
Reorganization Plan No.1 which was disapproved at the First Session of the 87th Congress.
Prior to the adoption of S. 2135 by the Senate on September 1,
1961,the Commission submitted comments on the bill, recommending
its adoption subject to certain suggested amendments. After its
adoption by the Senate with amendments suggested by the Commission, a memorandum of comment was submitted by the Commission
to the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce and

Chairman Cary appeared before that Committee in support of the

bill.
In essence, Public Law 87-592 expressly permits the Commission
to delegate to one or more members of the Commission or to its staff
certain functions which were previously performed by the full Commission. The statute requires the Commission to retain a discretionary right to review delegated action within a time and in a manner
to be prescribed by rule, although in certain situations a person or
party adversely affected by delegated action is entitled to review bJ
the Commission as a matter of right. In addition, it provides that
the vote of one Commissioner shall be sufficient to bring any delegated action before the Commission for review, and that delegated
action shall become the action of the Conunission for all-purposes.
including review by the appellate courts if no Commission review of
the delegated action is sought within the time specified by rule, or if
the Commission declines review.
A substantial amount of time was devoted during the fiscal year to
matters pertaining to legislative proposals referred to the Commission
for comment and to Congressional inquiries. A total of 47 legislative proposals was analyzed, and numerous Congressional inquiries
relating to matters other than specific legislative proposals were
reviewed and answered.

PART
REVISION

m

OF RULES, REGULATIONS

AND FORMS

The Commission maintains a continuing program of reviewing its
rules, regulations, and forms under the various statutes administered
by it in order to determine whether any changes are appropriate in
the light of changing conditions, methods and procedures in business
and in the financial practices of business. Certain members of the
staff are specifically assigned to this task, but changes are also suggested, from time to time, by other members of the staff who are
engaged in the examination of material filed with the Commission,
and by persons outside of the Commission who are subject to the
Commission's requirements or who have occasion to work with those
requirements such as underwriters, attorneys, accountants, and other
representatives. With a few exceptions provided for by the Administrative Procedure Act, proposed new rules, regulations, and forms
and proposed changes in existing rules, regulations, and forms are
published in preliminary form for the purpose of obtaining the views
and comments of interested persons, including issuers and various
industry groups.'
During the 1962 fiscal year, the Commission adopted a number of
changes in its rules, regulations, and forms. Other changes which
the Commission published in preliminary form for the purpose of
obtaining public comments thereon were pending at the end of the
fiscal year. The changes made during the fiscal year and those pending at the end of the year are described below.

from a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, conversion,
merger or similar transaction is deemed to be a transaction by a person other than an issuer, underwriter or dealer within the meaning
of the first clause of Section 4(1) of the Act, and therefore exempt
from registration under the Act. The rule applies only to offers
and sales involved in the matching and combination of fractional
interests among security holders and the sale of whole shares representing the remaining fractional interests not so combined. The
rule applies whether the transactions are effected on behalf of the
security holders by the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer or by a
bank or other independent agent,"
Adoption of Rule 155

During the fiscal year the Commission adopted a new Rule 155.3
The new rule relates to the interpretation of the exemptions afforded
by Section 4 (1) in the context of public offerings of convertible
securities by or on behalf of any person who purchased such securities
directly or indirectly from the issuer in a non-public transaction, or to
a public offering of the securities received. upon conversion of the
securities so placed. Of course, where there is an initial public
offering of convertible securities, immediate registration is required
in the absence of some exemption, and the rule has no application to
such a situation.
The new rule defines the phrase "transactions by an issuer not
involving any public offering" in Section 4(1) of the Act, as not
including certain public offerings of convertible securities or of securities received upon such a conversion. The rule excludes from the
quoted exemption two types of public offerings. The first is a public
offering of a security, which is immediately convertible into another
security of the same issuer, by or on behalf of any person or persons
who purchased the convertible security directly or indirectly from the
issuer in a non-public transaction. The other type of offering excluded
from the quoted exemption is one by or on behalf of any such person
or persons of the security acquired upon conversion, unless the person
or persons making the public offering are not underwriters within the
meaning of that term as defined in Section 2(11) of the Act. In
determining whether any such person is an underwriter, the usual
statutory tests are to be applied, as in other situations.
In order that intermediate persons who are not connected with any
public offering of such securities may not be treated as underwriters,
the rule provides that any such intermediate holder of the convertible
secur-ity or of the underlying security who has not acquired it with a

view to its distribution and is not instrumental in making or arranging
a public offering is not to be deemed an underwriter for the purpose of
the rule. Of course, even though a person is instrumental in making
or arranging a public offering of the underlying security, the rule does
not apply if the acquisition, retention and disposition of such security
are such that the person is not an underwriter within the meaning of
the term as defined in Section 2 (11) of the Act.
The rule applies only with respect to convertible securities issued
after the effective date of the rule.
Adoption of Rule 236

The Commission adopted Rule 236 which exempts from registration
under the Securities Act, under certain conditions, shares of stock or
similar security which are publicly offered to provide funds to be
distributed to security holders in lieu of issuing fractional shares,
scrip certificates, order forms, or other evidences of such fractional
interest, in connection with a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split, conversion, merger or similar transaction.
The conditions of
the exemption are that the issuer is required to file and has filed
reports with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15 (d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that the aggregate gross proceeds
from the sale of the shares do not exceed $100,000 and that the issuer
furnish certain information to the Commission at least 10 days prior
to the offering of the shares.'
From the date of adoption of the rule to the end of the 1962 fiscal
year, 11 companies furnished notices to the Commission pursuant to
the rule.
Amendment of Rule 458

Rule 458, which deals with the payment of fees in connection with
the registration of securities under the Securities Act, and prescribes
the manner in which the required fees shall be paid, was amended
during the fiscal year." The amendment to the rule provides that
payments of fees may be rounded to the nearest dollar and that the
Commission will waive any deficiency in the fee amounting to less
than $1. However, in no case may the amount of the registration fee
be less than $25. The amendment also provides that refunds to issuers
of excess payments amounting to less than $1 will be made only upon
the request of the issuer and that refunds of $1 or more may be waived
by the issuer. The purpose of the amendment is to reduce the time
and clerical work involved in collecting or refunding insignificant
amounts. However, as indicated above, the rule preserves the right
of an issuer to receive a refund of any amount due it, if it so desires.

Adoption of Rules 462 and 263

The Commission adopted Rule 462 which requires that if a bona fide
effort is not made to proceed with the offering and sale of registered
securities to the public within 3 business days after the registration
statement becomes effective, or if the offering or sale is suspended
within 15 days after the effective date, telegraphic or air mail notice
of the delay or suspension must be filed with the Commission. A
similar rule, designated as Rule 263, has been added to Regulation A
with respect to offerings under that regulation. The new rules are
intended to apply to situations where an offering is delayed or suspended by the issuer or principal underwriters and information with
respect to such delay or suspension and the reasons therefor are not
contained in the prospectus or offering circular."
Adoption of Revised Form S-8

During the fiscal year, the Commission published notice that it had
under consideration certain proposed amendments to Form S-8 which
is the form authorized for use in registering securities under the
Securities Act to be offered pursuant to certain stock purchases,
savings or similar plans, and for registering the interests in such plans
where such registration is required," A number of comments were
received in regard to the proposed amendments and shortly after the
close of the fiscal year the Commission adopted a revised Form S-8.8
The rule as to the use of the form has been simplified and clarified
in certain respects and has been amplified to permit use of the form for
securities other than "equity" securities and for securities to be offered
pursuant to restricted stock options. The transmittal of annual reports and other material to employees is now required by undertakings
set forth at the end of the form and the provisions making such transmittal a condition to the use of the form have been deleted. General
Instruction E which defined the term "transactions within 1 year" as
previously used in the third clause of Section 4 (1) of the Securities
Act, has been amended to define the term "transactions prior to the
expiration of 40 days," which is the present language of the statute.
Additional items calling for information with respect to securities to
be offered pursuant to restricted stock options have been added to the
form.
Adoption of Form 8-11

During the fiscal year the Commission adopted a new form, designated Form S-11, for registration under the Securities Act of securities of certain real estate companies." The form is to be used for

Adoption of Rules 13a-15 and lSd-IS and Form 7-K

During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted two new rules with
regard to the periodic reporting requirements and a new quarterly
report form. The new rules, designated Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, require certain real estate companies to file with the Commission, pursuant to Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Act, quarterly reports with respect
to distributions made to shareholders. Such reports are required to
be filed on the new Form 7-K 'within 45 days after the end of the fiscal
quarter for which they are filed. However, investment companies
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and partnerships all of whose properties are under long term lease to other
persons, are not required to file such reports."?
Adoption of Rule ISd-21 and Form Il-K;

Amendment to Form IO-K

Shortly after the end of the fiscal year, the Commission adopted
regulations governing the filing of annual reports pursuant to Section

filing of such reports were published for comment on June 13, 1961.11
As a result of further consideration of these proposals and the COIDments and suggestions received in regard thereto, certain changes have
been made in the proposed regulations. A new Form ll-K has been
adopted for use in filing annual reports with respect to such plans. A
new Rule 15d-21 has been adopted which provides that separate annual and other reports need not be filed with respect to any plan if the
issuer of the stock or other securities offered to employees through
their participation in the plan files annual reports on Form 10-K or

Proposed Rule 19a2-1

During the 1960 fiscal year the Commission invited public comments
on a proposed Rule 19&2-1 under the Act, which would provide that
the failure or refusal of an issuer or its officers, directors, employees, or
controlling persons to cooperate with the Commission in proceedings
under Section 19(a) (2) or investigations under Section 21 of the Act
with respect to compliance with Section 12 or 13 of the Act shall be
deemed a failure to comply with the provisions of the Act or the rules
and regulations thereunder for the purpose of Section 19(a) (2),13
The proposed rule would provide a basis for the issuance of an order
under Section 19(a) (2) denying, suspending, or withdrawing the
registration of a security in such cases. This matter was pending at
the end of the fiscal year.
Proposed Amendments to Form 8-K

Form 8-K is the form prescribed for current reports filed pursuant
to Section 13 or 15(d)' of the Securities Exchange Act. During the
fiscal year, the Commission announced that it has under consideration
certain proposed amendments to Form 8-K and invited public comments.> The amendments are intended to supersede proposed amendments previously published for comment." They are designed to
bring promptly to the attention of investors information regarding
material changes affecting the company or its affairs when it appears
that the changes are of such importance that they should be reported
promptly rather than at the end of the fiscal year. The amendments relate to matters such as the pledging of securities of the issuer
or its affiliates under circumstances that a default will result in a
change in control of the issuer, changes in the board of directors
otherwise than by stockholder action, the acquistion or disposition of
significant amounts of assets otherwise than in the ordinary course of
business, interests of management and others in certain transactions,
and the issuance of debt securities by subsidiaries.
The proposed amendments were still under consideration at the
close of the year.

Adoption of Rule 15c2-4

There have been instances where, as a result of financial reverses or
for other reasons, underwriters and other broker-dealers participating
in distributions have failed to remit amounts collected to the issuer, or
to return payments made by customers to them where such return
was required unless the distribution was completed within a specified
period of time. Rule 15c2-4 was adopted to deal with this type of situation. The rule makes it a "fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act
or practice" for any broker or dealer participating in any distribution other than a firm-commitment underwriting, to accept any part
of the sale price of any security being distributed unless (1) it is
promptly transmitted to the persons entitled thereto, or (2) if the
distribution is being made on an "all-or-none" basis, or on any other
contingent basis, the money is put into a trust or agency account, or
delivered to an escrow bank, until the event or contingency has
occurred, and it is then promptly transmitted or returned to the
persons entitled thereto."
Adoption of Rule 15c2-5

Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the Commission adopted
Rule 15c2-5 to prevent fraudulent practices by brokers or dealers
in connection with the offer or sale of securities under a program
which contemplates that the securities sold to the customer will
be used as collateral for a loan, whose proceeds will be used to pay the
premium on a life insurance policy sold to the customer at or about
the same time (an activity which in various forms has come to be
known as "equity funding," "secured funding," or "life funding")."
The Commission had previously expressed the view that such a plan
generally involves the offer and sale of an additional security, i.e., an
investment contract, which is required to be registered under the
Securities Act of 1933.18 Some dealers were offering this type of
program without adequate consideration of whether it was suitable
for particular customers, and they failed to furnish customers with
adequate information concerning the nature and extent of the obligations and risks involved and the commissions and other remuneration
which the dealer and his associates would receive in connection with
the transactions.
The rule makes it unlawful for any broker or dealer to offer, sell
or attempt to induce the purchase of any security by any person if
the broker or dealer, in connection therewith, offers to extend any
credit to or to arrange any loan for such person, or participates in

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

arranging any such loan or credit, unless, before any part of the
transaction is entered into, the broker or dealer delivers to him a
written statement setting forth certain material information concerning the arrangement being offered. In addition, the broker or dealer
is required to obtain from each customer information concerning the
latter's financial situation and needs, to reasonably determine that
the entire transaction, including the loan arrangement, is suitable for
the customer, and to deliver to him a written statement setting forth
the basis upon which this determination was made. If, in connection
with the transaction, it is contemplated that the prospect will cancel
existing life insurance, the written statement delivered to the prospect
before the transaction is entered into will have to disclose the disadvantages, if any, which the prospect will incur because of this.
Among other things, this may require disclosure that the premium
on the new life insurance is higher than the premium on the old
insurance; that the purchaser may be incurring additional expense
because he is paying the "acquisition costs" twice; that it may take
a specified additional period of time for the dividends or the cash
value of the new policy to equal those under the old policy; and that
the prospect may lose the benefits of the "incontestability provision"
because the period during which the insurer may contest the policy
for specified reasons may have expired under the old policy and the
prospect may be required to "wait through" this period again under
the new policy.
Amendment of Rule 15c3-1

Rule 15c3-1, which provides that no broker or dealer shall permit
his aggregate indebtedness to exceed 2,000% of his net capital,
exempts from its requirements the members of specified exchanges
whose "rules and settled practices" were deemed by the Commission
to impose requirements more comprehensive than the requirements
of the rule. However, a condition precedent to the continuation of
any such exemption is that the exchange conduct such inspections and
maintain such other procedures as are necessary to be reasonably sure
that members are complying with its capital requirements. The Salt
Lake Stock Exchange requested termination of the exemption for
its members because it was burdensome for it to conduct the inspections and other procedures necessary to a continuation of the exemption. Accordingly, the Commission amended Rule 15c3-1 to delete
the exemption previously available to members of that exchange."
Amendment of Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4

Rule 17a-3 specifies the books and records which must be maintained
by certain members of national securities exchanges and other brokerIt

17

dealers, and Rule 17a-4 requires the preservation of such books and
records for specified periods.
The amendment of Rule 17a-3 requires each exchange member,
broker or dealer subject to the rule to maintain a questionnaire or
application for employment executed by each "associated person,"
as defined in the rule. This questionnaire or application must contain certain specified information and be approved in writing by an
authorized representative of the member, broker or dealer. Under
the amendment of Rule 17a--4, this information is required to he
maintained until at least 3 years after such associated person terminates his employment and any other connection with the member,
broker or dealer."
There were two principal reasons for the adoption of the amendments. First, good business practice makes it appropriate for members, brokers and dealers to maintain fairly detailed data concerning
the experience and past record of partners, officers,salesmen, traders,
and other employees handling funds, securities or transactions for
the firm. Secondly, the availability of such information in the firm's
records will be of value to the Commission in its broker-dealer inspections and enforcement activities.
Since the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and
various national securities exchanges require all personnel engaged
in managing, supervising or handling securities transactions for their
members to be registered with or approved by the Association or the
exchange, and also require the execution of applications for registration or for approval by such persons which contain information
similar to the information required under Rule 17a-3, as amended,
the amendment provides that the retention of copies of such applications made to the Association or to the specified exchanges shall constitute compliance with Rule 17a-3 so far as those persons are
concerned.
Amendment of Rule 15ag-1

Rule 15ag-l sets out the procedures to be followed in connection
with Commission review of disciplinary action, or of denial of membership, by a national securities association, 011 the application of a
person aggrieved by such action or denial. Amendments to the rule
adopted during the fiscal year 21 are designed to facilitate and
expedite the handling of review proceedings.
The amendments make it mandatory for the applicant to file a
brief or statement in support of his application, specifying the basis
of the appeal and the relief sought, within a specified period, and

authorize summary dismissal of an application where a timely brief
is not filed. The filing of an answering brief by the association or
of a reply by the applicant to an answering brief is optional. The
amendments also provide that oral argument will be heard only with
special Commission permission. The former provision which specified that oral argument would take place in all cases except where
waived by the parties resulted in uncertainty and undue delay where
an applicant failed to appear or where it was not possible to obtain a
waiver.
THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939
Amendment

of Form T-3

Form T-3 is used for applications for the qualification of indentures in cases where the indenture securities are not required to be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933. An amendment to this
form, adopted during the fiscal year, requires that there be filed as
an exhibit to such applications a cross reference sheet showing the
location in the indenture of the provisions which the Trust Indenture
Act requires to be included in all qualified indentures."
The purpose
of the amendment is to facilitate the examination of indentures to
determine whether they meet the requirements of the Act.
THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940
Amendments

to Rules 31a-l

and 31a-2;

Adoption of Rule 31a-3

During the fiscal year, the Commission issued a notice of proposal
to amend its existing Rules 31a-1 and 31a-2 under the Investment
Company Act, and to adopt a new Rule 31a-3 under the Act.23 The
existing rules relate to records required to be maintained and preserved by registered investment companies, certain majority-owned
subsidiaries thereof, and other persons having transactions with
registered investment companies. As a result of the experience
gained by the Commission in its administration and enforcement of
the Act, including the experience derived from staff inspections of
registered investment companies and certain affiliated persons, it appeared to the Commission that the public interest and the interest of
investors required that Rules 31a-l and 31a-2 should be amended to
prescribe with greater specificity and detail the records of securities
transactions required to be kept, and to prescribe the keeping of certain memoranda and documents not previously required. It also
appeared that a new Rule 31a-3 should be adopted setting forth certain requirements in circumstances where the records called for in
Rules 31a-l and 31a-2 are prepared or maintained by others on
behalf of the person required to maintain them .

Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the Commission adopted
the amendments and the new rule.u
Adoption of Exemptive Rules Applicable to Licensed Small Business Investment
Companies

In the fiscal year, the Commission adopted rules and a related form
applicable to small business investment companies licensed by the
Small Business Administration, to provide exemptions from certain
requirements of Sections 11(a), 17(d), and 18(c) of the Investment
Company Act.25 Rule 11a-6 exempts from the prohibitions of Sections 11(a) (1) and 11(a) (3) of the Act, subject to certain conditions, loans and other securities transactions which would be prohibited by those Sections solely because an SBIC owns, holds, or controls
with power to vote the voting securities of a small business concern.
At the same time the Commission adopted, pursuant to Section 17(d)
of the Act, an amendment to Rule 17d-1 which exempts from that
rule's requirements certain transactions where banks and an affiliated
SBIC make investments in the same small business concern, and a
new Rule 17d-2 which prescribes a related reporting Form N-17D-1.
The Commission has adopted a new Rule 18c-1 which exempts a
small business investment company from the requirements of Section
18(c) so as to permit it to issue more than one class of senior security
representing indebtedness so long as all such indebtedness is privately
held and the company does not have outstanding any publicly held
indebtedness.
THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940
Adoption of Rules 206(4)-1

and 206(4)-2

Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act, which was enacted
in September 1960, prohibits an investment adviser from engaging in
any act, practice, or course of business which is fraudulent, deceptive,
or manipulative, and gives the Commission the power by rules and
regulations to define and prescribe means reasonably designed to prpvent such acts, practices, and courses of business.
The Commission during the fiscal year adopted Rule 206(4) -1,
effective January 1, 1962, defining certain advertisements by investment advisers to be fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative within the
meaning of Section 206(4) of the Act.26 The rule is intended to implement the statutory mandate by foreclosing the use of advertisements
which have a tendency to mislead or deceive clients or prospective
clients.

The rule prohibits advertisements which contain testimonials or
which call attention to specific past recommendations made by the investment advisers which would have been profitable. Other provisions
of the rule specify the circumstances under which advertisements
offering graphs, charts, formulas, or other devices may be used, and
prohibit advertisements which represent that any report, analysis, or
other service can be obtained free or without charge unless it is entirely free and subject to no conditions or obligations. The rule also
includes a general prohibition against the use of advertisements containing untrue or misleading statements.
The Commission also adopted Rule 206(4)-2, effective April 2,
1962.21 The new rule is designed to implement the provisions of
Section 206(4) of the Act, by requiring an investment adviser who
has custody of funds or securities of any client to maintain them in
such a way that they will not be jeopardized by financial reverses of
the investment adviser.
The rule makes it a fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative act,
practice or course of business for any investment adviser who has
custody or possession of funds or securities of clients to take any
action with respect to any such funds or securities unless (1) the
securities of each client are segregated, and held in safekeeping in a
reasonably safe place; (2) clients' funds are deposited in bank accounts which contain only such funds, maintained in the name of the
investment adviser as agent or trustee, and the latter maintains a
separate record for each such account containing specified information; (3) the adviser, immediately after accepting custody or possession, notifies the client in writing of the place and manner in which
the funds and securities will be maintained; and (4) the adviser sends
each client, at least once every 3 months, an itemized statement of the
funds and securities in his custody or possession and of all transactions in the client's account; and (5) at least once each calendar year
the funds and securities are verified by an independent public accountant in a surprise examination and his certificate is sent to the Commission promptly thereafter.
Since certain members of national securities exchanges and registered broker-dealers must maintain specified standards of financial
responsibility under the Commission's Ru1e 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act, or applicable rules of the exchanges of which they
are members, Rule 206(4) -2 exempts from its requirements registered
broker-dealers subject to and in compliance with Ru1e 15c3-1, and
members of exchanges whose members are exempt from Rule 15c3-1,
and who are in compliance with exchange requirements with respect

Proposed Amendment to Rule 204-2

During the fiscal year the Commission invited public comment 011
a proposed amendment to Rule 204-2, which would require investment advisers to maintain records containing specified information
concerning securities transactions in which they or their key personnel have any beneficial interest." The proposed amendment, which is
designed to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative acts and
practices, was pending at the end of the fiscal year.

PART IV
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Securities Act of 1933 is designed to provide disclosure to investors of material facts concerning securities publicly offered for
sale by the use of the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and to prevent misrepresentation, deceit, or other fraudulent
practices in the sale of securities. Disclosure is obtained by requiring
the issuer of such securities to file with the Commission a registration
statement which includes a prospectus containing significant financial
and other information about the issuer and the offering. The registration statement is available for public inspection as soon as it is filed.
Although the securities may be offered after the registration statement is filed, sales may not be made until the registration statement
has become "effective." A copy of the prospectus must be furnished
to each purchaser at or before the sale or delivery of the security. The
registrant and the underwriter are responsible for the contents of the
registration statement. The Commission has no authority to control
the nature or quality of a security to be offered for public sale or to
pass upon its merits or the terms of its distribution. Its action in
permitting a registration statement to become effective does not constitute approval of the securities, and any representation to a prospective purchaser of securities to the contrary is made unlawful by
Section 23 of the Act.
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRATION PROCESS
Registration

Statement

and Prospectus

Registration of securities under the Act is effected by filing with
the Commission a registration statement on the applicable form containing the prescribed disclosure. When a registration statement
relates, generally speaking, to a security issued by a corporation or
other private issuer, it must contain the information, and be accompanied by the documents, specified in Schedule A of the Act; when it
relates to a security issued by a foreign government, the material
specified in Schedule B must be supplied. Both schedules specify in
considerable detail the information which should be made available
to an investor in order that he may make an informed decision whether

TWENTY-EIGHTH

A.."i'NUAL REPOR'l'

to buy the security. In addition, the Act provides flexibility in its
administration by empowering the Commission to classify issues,
issuers, and prospectuses, to prescribe appropriate forms, and to
increase, or in certain instances vary or diminish, the particular items
of information required to be disclosed in the registration statement,
as the Commission deems appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors.
In general, the registration statement of an issuer other than a
foreign government must describe such matters as the names of persons who participate in the direction, management, or control of the
issuer's business; their security holdings and remuneration and the
options or bonus and profitsharing privileges allotted to them; the
character and size of the business enterprise, its capital structure, past
history and earnings, and its financial statements, -certified by independent accountants; underwriters' commissions; payments to promoters made within 2 years or intended to be made; the interest of
directors, officers,and principal stockholders in material transactions;
pending or threatened legal proceedings; and the purpose to which
the proceeds of the offering are to be applied. The prospectus constitutes a part of the registration statement and presents the more important of the required disclosures.
Examination Procedure

The staff of the Division of Corporation Finance examines registration statements for compliance with the standards of accurate and
full disclosure and usually notifies the registrant by an informal
letter of comment of any material respects in which the statement
appears to fail to conform to those requirements. The registrant is
thus ordinarily afforded an opportunity to file a curative amendment.
In addition, the Commission has power, after notice and opportunity
for hearing, to issue an order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement. In certain cases, for example where a registration
statement is so deficient as to indicate a willful or negligent failure
to make adequate disclosure, no letter of comment is sent and the Commission either institutes an investigation to determine whether stop
order proceedings should be instituted or immediately institutes stop
order proceedings. Information about the use of this stop-order power during 1962 appears below under "Stop Order Proceedings."
Time Required to Complete Registration

Because prompt examination of a registration statement is important to industry, the Commission endeavors to complete its analysis
in as short a time as possible. The Act provides that a registration
statement shall become effective on the 20th day after it is filed. How-

24

SECURITIES AXD EXCHAJ.,GE COMMISSION

ever, the filing of any amendment thereto establishes a new filing
date. This waiting period affords investors an opportunity to become familiar with the proposed offering. Information disclosed in
the registration statement is disseminated during the waiting period
by means of the preliminary form of prospectus. The Commission
is empowered to accelerate the effective date so as to shorten the 20
day waiting period where the facts justify such action. In exercising this power, the Commission is required to take into account the
adequacy of the information respecting the issuer theretofore available to the public, the facility with which investors can understand
the nature of and the rights conferred by the securities to be registered, and their relationship to the capital structure of the issuer,
and the public interest and the protection of investors. The note
to Rule 460 under the Act indicates, for the information of interested persons, some of the more common situations in which the Commission considers that the statute generally requires it to deny acceleration of the effective date of a registration statement.
The number of calendar days which elapsed from the date of the
original filing to the effective date of registration for the median
(average) registration statement with respect to the 1,6461 registration statements that became effective during the 1962 fiscal year was
78, compared with 55 days for 1,389 registration statements in fiscal
year 1961 and 43 days for 1,275 registration statements in fiscal year
1960. The increase in the elapsed time has been due primarily to the
cumulative effect of the unprecedented volume of registration statements filed, particularly those filed by issuers that had never before
filed under the Act, and the lack of sufficient personnel to process
such a volume. The number of registration statements filed during
fiscal year 1962 was 2,109, as compared with 1,667 and 1,469 in fiscal
years 1961and 1960,respectively,"
The following table shows by months during the 1962 fiscal year
the number of calendar days elapsed in each of the three principal
stages of the registration process for the median registration statement, the total elapsed time and the number of registration statements effective.
1 This figure does not Include the 198 registration
statements of mutual fund companies
that became effective during fiscal year 1962 that were filed pursuant to the provisions of
Section 24(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The total elapsed time on these
198 statements was 21 calendar days for the average registration statement.

VOLUME OF SECURITIES

REGISTERED

During the fiscal year 1962, 1,815statements in the amount of $19.5
billion became fully effective under the Securities Act of 1933, a
record both in number and dollar amount. The number of statements
increased 20 percent over the preceding year while dollar amount increased only 3 percent or $477 million, reflecting a further increase
in the volume of smaller issues. The chart on Page 5 shows the
number and dollar amounts of fully effective registrations from 1935
to 1962.
These figures cover all registrations which became fully effective
including secondary distributions and securities registered for other
than cash sale, such as exchange transactions and issues reserved for
conversion. Of the dollar amount of securities registered in 1962,83.3
percent was for account of issuer for cash sale, 7.8 percent for the
account of issuers for other than cash sale and 8.9 percent was for the
account of others, as shown below.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Securities to be offered for cash sale for account of issuer amounted
to $16.3 billion, unchanged from the previous year. However, common stock increased by $1.7 billion and debt securities decreased by
almost that amount. Debt securities made up $4.5 billion of the 1962
volume, preferred stock $250 million and common stock $11.5 billion.
More than 80 percent of the common stock was to be offered for sale
over an extended period, including stock of investment companies,
stock for employee plans and stock called for by warrants and options.
Appendix Table 1 shows the number of statements which became
effective and total amounts registered for each of the fiscal years 1935
through 1962, and contains a classification, by type of security, of
issues to be offered for cash on behalf of the issuer during those years.
More detailed information for 1962 is given in Appendix Table 2.
Of the issues scheduled for immediate offering following effective
registration, two industry groups, communication and financial and
real estate, showed marked decreases in amounts as compared with
fiscal year 1961. Communication companies, which had registered $2.4
billion for public sale in the fiscal year 1961, registered only $840
million in the fiscal 1962 but in the latter period also registered a
major-sized issue to he sold to employees over an extended period.
Financial and real estate companies registered $770 million compared
with $1.3 billion in fiscal 1961. Manufacturing companies registered
$1.8 billion in fiscal 1962 and electric and gas companies $2.3 billion,
almost the same as in the previous fiscal year.

for offerings of securities aggregating $21.6 billion, as compared with
1,830 registration statements £led during the' n)6i'~fiscal year for
offerings amounting to $20.7 billion. This represents' an increase of
26 percent in the number of statements filed and 4.4 percent in the
dollar amount involved.
Of the 2,307 registration statements filed in the 1962 fiscal year,
1,377, or 60 percent, were filed by companies that had not previously
filed registration statements under the Securities -A<ft of '1933. Comparable figures for the 1961 and 1960 fiscal years- ;~~ 9~8,or 52 percent, and 774, or 47 percent, respectively.
A cumulative total of 21,695 registration statements has been filed

STOP ORDER PROCEEDINGS

Section 8 (d) provides that, if it appears to the Commission at any
time that a registration statement contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
the Commission may institute proceedings looking to the issuance of
a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement.
'Where such an order is issued, the offering cannot lawfully be made,
or continued if it has already begun, until the registration statement

Several of the proceedings which were terminated during the fiscal
year are described below.
American Finance Company, Inc.-The
registrant, a Delaware
corporation organized in 1955, engages in the automobile sales finance
business primarily with overseas members of United States Armed
Forces. It filed a registration statement covering a proposed offering
of 2,500 units, each consisting of 1 $200 debenture, 30 shares of common stock, and 10 warrants, with the price of $500 per unit, for which
Myron A. Lomasney (Lomasney) was named as the managing underwriter. The registration statement also covered 60,000 shares of
common stock held by Lomasney and 17 persons associated with it,
proposed to be offered from time to time at such prices as may prevail
on the market following the completion of the offering of the Units.
In the course of the proceeding the registrant stipulated to certain
facts and consented to the entry of a stop order. Some of the more
important deficiencies found in the registration statement are
described below."
The Commission held than an accountant's relationship as attorney
for the registrant during the same period covered by his accounting
firm's certification disqualified him and the accounting firm of which
he was a partner from certifying registrant's financial statements as
independent accountants. The Commission stated that "though
owing a public responsibility, an attorney, in acting as the client's
advisor, defender, advocate, and confidant enters into a personal relationship in which his principal concern is with the interest and rights
of his client. The requirement of the Act of certification by an independent accountant, on the other hand, is intended to secure for the
benefit of public investors the detached objectivity of a disinterested
person. The certifying accountant must be one who is in no way

COMMISSION

connected with the business or its management, and who does not have
any relationship that might affect the independence which at times
may require him to voice public criticisms of his client's accounting
practices."
Prior to the filing of the registration statement, Lomasney had
purchased the 60,000 shares of registrant's common stock for its own
account at an advantageous price, and passed some of these shares on
to certain favored customers so that they too might benefit from the
planned public offering of shares at a higher price. In offering these
60,000 shares to the public, Lomasney and his favored customers, a
group of 17 persons, would be statutory underwriters participating
in the distribution of a large block of the registrant's stock. The
Commission found that in view of the large number of shares proposed to be offered in relation to the limited floating supply of shares,
the apparent lack of cohesiveness in the selling group, and the absence
of a prior market, the registration statement should have identified
the sellers and their relationship to each other, the registrant, and
Lomasney; and it should have disclosed that such distribution would
not be coordinated or controlled by a managing underwriter and that
the selling group had not provided the contractual safeguards for the
protection of buyers and sellers usually provided in a conventional
distribution.
Accordingly, the Commission required undertakings
similar to those required in Hazel Bishop, Inc»
Standard Savings and Loan Association, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the registrant, was described in the registration statement as an
operating savings and loan association. The Commission found that
Standard was organized and operated merely as a collection agency
for the registrant, in that it received allotment payments from military persons in connection with registrant's automobile sales financing
business and forwarded such allotments to registrant for application
on the unpaid balances of the automobile loans. The Commission
held that the opening of shareholders' savings accounts, evidenced by
pass books, involved the sale of unregistered securities in violation of
Section 5 of the Act; that based on the facts there was not available
for such securities the exemption provided by Section 3(a) (5) of the
Act for securities issued by a savings and loan association "substantially all the business of which is confined to the making of loans
to members."
Faradyne Electronics Corp.-Faradyne
Electronics Corp., a New
Jersey corporation formed in 1959, offered and sold to public investors in December 1959, while in a promotional stage, 200,000shares
of its common stock at $5 per share pursuant to a registration state• Seeurlttes Act R..!t'UM' Xo 4:{71 (June 7, 1961) ; See 27th Annual Report, p, 81,

mont filed under the Securities Act of 1933. The four promoters
together received 300,000 Class A common shares for a cash investment of $20,000. A second registration statement filed in January
1961, as amended, covered a $2 million offering of convertible
debentures.
The prospectus included in the 1959 registration statement was
found by the Commission to be materially false and misleading in
several respects. One was in conveying the false impression that
Faradyne intended to proceed promptly with plans to develop and
produce capacitors whereas its officialsin fact contemplated that they
might develop an entirely different type of business through the
acquisition of the assets or stock of other companies and might use a
substantial part of the proceeds from the public offering for that
purpose. Faradyne in fact used a substantial portion of the proceeds
to acquire the assets or stock of six other companies within a period
of several months after the effective date of the registration statement,
including the assets and business of Mansel Ceramics Company, of
which two of Faradyne's promoters were the principal partners.
The prospectus filed as part of the 1961 registration statement was
also found materially misleading. It stated that Faradyne, through
a subsidiary, Mansel Corporation, had paid $150,000 cash in March
1960, for the assets and business of Mansel Ceramics Company and
that it had agreed to make further fixed payments of $1,200,000and
$200,000 plus an additional maximum contingent payment of
$2,500,000, payable in annual installments comprised of 50% of
Mansel Corporation's annual net profit after taxes beginning with
the fiscal year ending January 31, 1961. The prospectus further
stated that the obligation to make contingent payments "will terminate on February 1, 1980," and that if such payments are not completed by that date "any balance contingently due will be forgiven."
These statements were found misleading in failing to disclose material provisions of the sale agreement. First, under the sale agreement Mansel Corporation could have at any time after January 31,
1962, anticipated all or any part of the obligation to pay the
$2,500,000,in which event the two promoters from whom the ceramics
company was acquired might receive more than would have been payable on the basis of annual payments of 50% of Mansol Corporation's
net profits. Second, the agreement also provided that in the event
Mansol Corporation should incur losses for any fiscal year ended
January 31, 1966, or thereafter, the period ending in 1980 would be
extended 1 year £01' each such loss year.
Moreover, the prospectus set forth a summary of consolidated
earnings of Faradyne and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended
January 31, 1961, which showed net income, after provision for

32

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

income taxes, of $387,000 in the aggregate or 74 cents per share.
Based upon the Commission's findings, the earnings figure on a pro
forma basis should have been only $108,000 or 21 cents per share for
the same period.
The assets acquired, consisting of machinery, inventories, and written technical information, and carried on the books of the seller at
$364,000,were recorded initially on the books of the subsidiary at the
contract price of $1,550,000. However, there was no evidence to support the allocation of 100% of this amount to fixed assets and no
part thereof to good will. Further, Faradyne proposed to increase
the carrying value of plant assets as the amounts of the contingent
payments were accrued, which would result in a continuing increase
in book value of fixed assets without any actual change in assets.
The Commission found the transaction to be "actually a profit-sharing
or division-of-earnings arrangement-or
to put it another way-it
provided for the receipt of net earnings after 50% reserved to the
sellers. Indeed, no contingent payments can ever be said in any
realistic sense to become the property of the registrant."
The Commission held that the contingent payments should have been shown
as a deduction before arriving at net income, and concluded that
Faradyne's failure to deduct the $134,696 of contingent payments
from earnings resulted in a misleading overstatement of earnings by
that amount.
The Commission further held that the summary of earnings was
rendered materially misleading by the failure to present a pro forma
earnings statement to reflect debenture interest chargeable to the
replacement of a $1,200,000 interest-free obligation with an interestbearing obligation, to provide adequately for income taxes, and to
explain that net earnings for the fiscal year 1961 were higher because
of the utilization of nonrecurring tax loss benefits.
The Commission concluded that the issuance of a stop order with
respect to both registration statements was required in the public
interest," Faradyne subsequently filed amendments to the 1961 registration statement changing the offering to one of stock, and correcting the deficiencies, and on October 30, 1962, the Commission lifted
the stop order,"
Miami Window Corporation.- The registrant, a Florida corporation organized in 1947, engages in the manufacture of various types
of windows and other products. It filed a registration statement
with the Commission on February 24, 1959, covering $3,500,000 6%
percent sinking fund debentures with detachable common stock purchase warrants, 150,000 shares of convertible preferred stock, and a

total of 1,075,000shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the
warrants and the conversion of the preferred stock. The registration statement became effective on March 24, 1959, and the offering
of the debentures and the preferred stock was completed shortly
thereafter. The Commission subsequently instituted stop order
proceedings.
The Commission found that registrant's consolidated inventory,
as shown in the balance sheet included in the registration statement.
was materially overstated and included material amounts which had
no adequate basis in fact.
It further found that the certifying accountants failed to comply
with generally accepted auditing standards in auditing the inventory,
thereby rendering false and misleading the representations in their
certificate that their examination was made in accordance with such
standards and that the financial statements fairly presented registrant's financial position and results of operations.
The Commission noted that subsequent to the filing of the registration statement, registrant had submitted periodic reports to the
Commission and to its stockholders, including certified financial
statements for the 9 months ended February 29, 1960, and the fiscal
year ending February 28, 1961.
It concluded that in view of the distribution of the recent financial
statements, investors would be adequately informed of the facts upon
distribution of the Commission's opinion to all security holders of
the registrant, and that, under all the circumstances, issuance of a
stop order was not necessary, provided such distribution were made.
Accordingly, the Commission dismissed the proceedings, subject to
the condition noted."
EXAMINATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission is authorized by Section 8(e) of the Act to make
an examination in order to determine whether a stop order proceeding should be instituted under Section 8 (d) . For this purpose the
Commission is empowered to subpoena witnesses and require the production of pertinent documents. The Commission is also authorized
by Section 20(a) of the Act to make an investigation to determine
whether any provision of the Act or of any rule or regulation prescribed thereunder has been or is about to be violated. In appropriate cases, investigations are instituted under this section as an expeditious means of determining whether a registration statement is false
or misleading or omits to state any material fact. The following

EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION OF SMALL ISSUES

Under Section 3 (b) of the Securities Act, the Commission is
empowered to exempt, by its rules and regulations and subject to
such terms and conditions as it may prescribe therein, any class of
securities from registration under the Act, if it finds that the enforcement of the registration provisions of the Act with respect to such
securities is not necessary in the public interest and for the protection
of investors by reason of the small amount involved or the limited
character of the public offering. The statute imposes a maximum
limitation of $300,000 upon the size of the issues which may be
exempted by the Commission in the exercise of this power.
Acting under this authority the Commission has adopted the following exemptive rules and regulations:
Rule 234: Exemption of first lien notes.
Rule 235: Exemption of securities of cooperative housing corporations.
Rule 236: Exemption of shares offered in connection with certain transactions.
Regulation A: General exemption for United States and Canadian issues
up to $300,000.
Regulation B: Exemption for fractional
undivided interests in oil or
gas rights up to $100,000.
Regulation F: Exemption for assessments on assessable stock and for
assessable stock offered or sold to realize the amount of assessment thereon.

Under Section 3(c) of the Securities Act, which was added by Section 307(a) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, the Commission is authorized to adopt rules and regulations exempting
securities issued hy a company which is operating or proposes to

TWENTY-EIGHTH

ANNUAL REPORT

35

operate as a small business investment company under the Small Business Investment Act. Acting pursuant to this authority, the Commission has adopted a Regulation E which exempts upon certain terms
and conditions limited amounts of securities issued by any small
business investment company which is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. This regulation is substantially similar to
the one provided by Regulation A adopted under Section 3 (b) of
the Act.
Exemption from registration under Section 3(b) or 3(c) of the Act
does not carry any exemption from the civil liabilities for false and
misleading statements imposed upon any person by Section 12(2) or
from the criminal liabilities for fraud imposed upon any person by
Section 17 of the Act.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A

The Commission's Regulation A implements Section 3(b) of the
Securities Act of 1933 and permits a company to obtain needed capital
not in excess of $300,000 (including underwriting commissions) in
anyone year from a public offering of its securities without registration, if the company complies with the regulation. Regulation A
requires that the issuer file a notification supplying basic information
about the company, certain exhibits, and an offering circular which
must be used in offering the securities. However, in the case of a company with an earnings history which is making an offering not in
excess of $50,000 an offering circular need not be used. A notification
is filed with the Regional Office of the Commission in the region in
which the company has its principal place of business.
During the 1962 fiscal year, 1,065 notifications were filed under
Regulation A, covering proposed offerings of $237,238,600compared
with 1,057 notifications covering proposed offerings of $239,920,549
in the 1961 fiscal year. Included in the 1962 total were 17 notifications
covering stock offerings of $4,406,907 with respect to companies
engaged in the exploratory oil and gas business, 28 notifications covering offerings of $5,891,302by mining companies and 23 notifications
covering offerings of $5,226,927 by companies featuring new inventions, products or processes.

Most of the offerings which were underwritten were made by commercial underwriters, who participated in 528 offerings in 1962, 511
offerings in 1961, and 398 offerings in 1960. The remaining offerings
in which commissions were paid were handled by officers, directors,
or other persons not regularly engaged in the securities business.
Suspension of Exemption

Regulation A provides for the suspension of an exemption thereunder where, in general, no exemption IS available for the securities
purported to be offered thereunder, or where the offering is not made
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the regulation or
with prescribed disclosure standards. Following the issuance of a
temporary suspension order by the Commission, the respondents may
request a hearing to determine whether the temporary suspension
should be vacated or made permanent. If no hearing is requested
within 30 days after the entry of the temporary suspension order and
none is ordered by the Commission on its own motion, the temporary
suspension order becomes permanent.
During the 1!)()2 fiscal year, temporary suspension orders were
issued in 51 eases. These cases together with 28 cases pending at the
beginning of the Iiscn] year resulted in a total of 79 cases for disposition. Of these 79 eases, the temporary suspension order became permanent in 48: ill 27 by lapse of time, in 9 by withdrawal of the
request for heuring, and in 12 after hearing. Thus, there were 31
cases pending at the end of the fiscal ;year.

'l'WEXTY-EIGHTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

37

Two of the above cases are summarized below to illustrate the type
of misrepresentations and other noncompliance with the regulation
which led to the issuance of suspension orders.
Chrislin Photo Industries Corp.-The
Commission, in ordering
the exemption permanently suspended, found that the issuer's offering
circular was misleading in not disclosing all the material circumstances under which the offering was made, including the following
facts: that no shares were to be sold at the $6 per share offering price
until after a market was established at a level well above that price;
that immediately prior to any sales at $6 per share there were transactions in the over-the-counter market at prices ranging from $17 to
$22.50 per share; that a substantial number of shares were reserved
for sale at $6 per share to persons related to or associated with the
issuer and the underwriter; that a number of persons who acquired
shares at $6 per share almost immediately resold them at substantially
higher prices; and that there were persons who acted as underwriters
although not named as such in the offering circular.
In addition, statements in the offering circular that a camera developed by the company was ready for marketing, that it would be in
production within a reasonable time after the completion of the offering, and that the company was of the opinion that the camera with
accessories could profitably be retailed for $20 were found to be false
and misleading because in fact the camera was not expected to be
ready for marketing until March 1962,at which time additional funds
would be required.
The Commission further found that the terms and conditions of
Regulation A were not complied with in that the issuer sold securities
without furnishing an offering circular as required by Rule 256(a)
and the aggregate offering price exceeded the $300,000 limitation
prescribed by Rule 254.8
Mainco Electronics and Marine Development Corporation.-According to the Commission's temporary suspension order in this case,
the issuer's offering circular failed to disclose, among other things,

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation E

Regulation E provides a conditional exemption from registration
under the Securities Act of 1933,for securities of small business investment companies which are licensed under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 or which have received the preliminary approval of
the Small Business Administration and have been notified by the
Administration that they may submit an application for such a license.
The regulation, which is similar in many respects to the general
exemption provided by Regulation A, requires the filing of a notification with the Commission and, except in the case of offerings not in
excess of $50,000, the filing and use of an offering circular containing
certain specified information.
Regulation E provides for the suspension of exemption in particular
cases if the Commission finds that any of the terms and conditions of
the regulation have not been met or complied with.
There were no filings under Regulation E during the 1962 fiscal
year.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation F

Regulation F provides an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act for assessments levied upon assessable stock and for
delinquent assessment sales in amounts not exceeding $300,000 in any
one year. It requires the filing of a simple notification giving brief
information with respect to the issuer, its management, principal
security holders, recent and proposed assessments and other security
issues. The regulation requires a company to send to its stockholders,
or otherwise publish, a statement of the purposes for which the proceeds from the assessment are proposed to be used. If the issuer
should employ any other sales literature in connection with the assessment, copies of such literature must be filed with the Commission.
During the 1962 fiscal year, 36 notifications were filed under Regulation F, covering assessments of $1,300,246. Regulation F notifications were filed in three of the nine regional officesof the Commission:
Denver, San Francisco, and Seattle. Underwriters were not employed
in any of the Regulation F assessments.
Regulation F provides for the suspension of an exemption thereunder, as in Regulation A, where the regulation provides no exemption
or where the offering is not made in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the regulation or in accordance with prescribed disclosure
standards.
One Regulation F filing was temporarily suspended in the fiscal year
1962. A request for hearing was made but was later withdrawn and
the issuer consented to the issuance of a permanent suspension order.

PART V
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE SECURITIES
OF 1934

EXCHANGE ACT

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is designed to ensure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in securities transactions on the
organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets. Accordingly, the Act provides for the registration and regulation of securities exchanges and the registration of securities listed on such exchanges, and it establishes for issuers of securities so registered, financial and other reporting requirements, regulation of proxy solicitations
and requirements with respect to trading by directors, officers and
principal security holders. The Act also provides for the registration
and regulation of brokers and dealers doing business in the over-thecounter market, contains provisions designed to prevent fraudulent,
deceptive and manipulative acts and practices on the exchanges and in
the over-the-counter markets and authorizes the Federal Reserve
Board to regulate the use of credit in securities transactions.

Disciplinary Action

Each national securities exchange reports to the Commission disciplinary actions taken against its members and member firms for violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or of exchange rules.
During the year 9 exchanges reported 96 cases of such disciplinary
actions, including imposition of fines aggregating $48,575in 57 cases;
the suspension from membership of 13 individuals and 5 member
firms; the expulsion of 1 individual from associate membership and
another from allied membership; and the censure of a number of
individuals and firms.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES

It is unlawful for a member of a national securities exchange or a
broker or dealer to effect any transaction in a security on such
exchange unless the security is registered on that exchange under the
Securities Exchange Act or is exempt from such registration. In
general, the Act exempts from registration obligations issued or guaranteed by a State or the Federal Government or by certain subdivisions
or agencies thereof and authorizes the Commission to adopt rules and
regulations exempting such other securities as the Commission may
find necessary or appropriate to exempt in the public interest or for
the protection of investors. Under this authority the Commission has
exempted securities of certain banks, certain securities secured by
property or leasehold interests, certain warrants and, on a temporary
basis, certain securities issued in substitution for or in addition to
listed securities.
Section 12 of the Exchange Act provides that an issuer may register a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission
and the exchange an application which discloses pertinent information
concerning the issuer and its affairs. This must include information
in regard to the issuer's business, capital structure, the terms of its
securities, the persons who manage or control its affairs, the remuneration paid to its officersand directors, the allotment of options, bonuses
and profit-sharing plans, and financial statements certified by independent accountants.
Form 10 is the form used for registration by most commercial and
industrial companies. There are specialized forms for certain types
of securities, such as voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit
and securities of foreign governments.
Section 13 requires issuers having securities registered on an
exchange to file periodic reports keeping current the information furnished in the application for registration. These periodic reports
include annual reports, semiannual reports, and current reports. The
principal annual report form is Form 10-K which is designed to keep

42

:-;ECL:HITIE:-;

AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSIOX

up-to-date the information furnished in Form 10. Semiannual reports
required to be furnished on Form 9-K are devoted chiefly to furnishing mid-year financial data. Current reports on Form 8-K are
required to be filed for each month in which any of certain specified
events have occurred. A report on this Form deals with matters
such as changes in control of the registrant, important acquisitions
or dispositions of assets, the institution or termination of important
legal proceedings and important changes in the issuer's capital securities or in the amount thereof outstanding.
Statistics Relating to Registration of Securities on Exchanges

As of June 30, 1962, a total of 2,390 issuers had 4,013 classes of
securities listed on registered national securities exchanges, of which
2,821 were classified as stocks and 1,192 as bonds. Of these totals,
1,286 issuers had 1,564 stock issues and 1,142 bond issues listed on the
New York Stock Exchange. Thus, 54 percent of the issuers, 55 percent of the stock issues and 96 percent of the bond issues were on the
New York Stock Exchange.
During the 1962 fiscal year, 185 issuers listed securities on a registered national securities exchange for the first time, while the registration of all securities of 130 issuers was terminated. The total
number of applications for registration of classes of securities on
exchanges filed during the 1962fiscal year was 319.
The following table shows the number of annual, semiannual, and
current reports filed during the fiscal year by issuers having securities listed on registered national securities exchanges, and the number of such reports filed by issuers obligated to file reports under
Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, by virtue of
having registered securities under the Securities Act of 1933. The
securities of issuers filing reports under Section 15(d) are generally
traded in the over-the-counter market. As of June 30, 1962, there
were 2,726 such issuers, including 350 that were also registered as
investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The table also includes the number of annual reports, quarterly
reports and reports to stockholders filed by issuers subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 30 of the Investment Company Act.

The June 30 values were as reported by the New York Stock Exchange and as estimated for all other exchanges. Volumes include
shares, warrants and rights. Comprehensive statistics of volumes on
exchanges are included among the appendix tables in this Annual
Report.
Aggregate market values over the years are not strictly comparable,
since they do not indicate to what extent they reflect new listings,
mergers into listed companies, and removals from listing. The net
increment from these sources during the year ending June 30, 1962,
may be estimated at 4 to 5 billion dollars.
Foreign Stock on Exchanges

The market value on December 31, 1961, of all shares and certificates representing foreign stocks on the stock exchanges was reported
at about $13.8 billion, of which $12.7 billion represented Canadian and
$1.1 billion represented other foreign stocks. These figures include
the total market value of the Canadian stock issues traded on the
exchanges; most of the other foreign stocks were represented by
American Depositary Receipts or American shares, only the outstanding amounts of which were used in determining market value.

The number of foreign stocks on the exchanges has declined somewhat in recent years, owing principally to a reduction in issues traded
on the American Stock Exchange from 152 in 1956 to 142 in 1961.
Trading in foreign stocks has fallen from 42.4 percent of the reported
share volume on this Exchange in 1956 to 17.8 percent in 1961.

46

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Trading in foreign stocks on the New York Stock Exchange was
about 3.4 percent of the reported share volume thereon in 1956 and
about 2.8 percent in 1961.
Reported volumes in foreign shares during 1961 included about
74,200,000Canadian and 12,800,000other foreign shares on the American Stock Exchange and about 10,200,000 Canadian and 18,100,000
other foreign shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The 87
million share volume on the American was over 3 times the 28,300,000
share volume on the New York Stock Exchange. However, in view
of the higher average share prices on the latter Exchange, its dollar
volume in the foreign shares would appear to have exceeded that on
the American Stock Exchange.

Statistics

So far as can be ascertained from the standard securities manuals
and from reports to the Commission, there are about 4,165 stocks
with 300 holders or more, of about 3,840 domestic companies, quoted
only in the over-the-counter market. The aggregate market value of
these stocks on December 31, 1961, was about $105.8 billion. TIns
number ineludes a few instances where it was assumed, because of
active dealer interest, that there were 300 holders or more.
The $105.8 billion market value included $26.2 billion for bank
stocks, $22.1 billion for insurance stocks, and $57.5 billion for industrial, utility, and other miscellaneous stocks. Stock issued by
registered investment companies was not included in this compilation.
Substantial percentages of over-the-counter stocks are ordinarily
held by officers, directors, and other controlling persons, and in some
instances the percentages are extreme. For example, Western Electric
Company stock, which has recently come to have over 300 holders, has
added about $8.7 billion market value to the group of stocks issued by
companies not reporting to the Commission. However, 99.82 percent of such stock was held by American Telephone and Telegraph
Company and only about $15.7 million was in public circulation.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In addition to the stocks mentioned above, there is a large number
of actively quoted stocks of companies so small as not to require continuous reporting to the Commission, and whose coverage by the
standard securities manuals is generally limited to brief announcements of the circumstances of the offerings. Their number was in
excess of 1,000 on December 31, 1961, at which time they constituted
about 25 percent of the actively quoted stocks in the National Quotation Bureau services.
A comprehensive view of the number of securities quoted over-thecounter at anyone time is afforded by data supplied by the National
Quotation Bureau, which is the principal purveyor of over-the-conntel' quotations in the United States. The following table shows the
number of stocks quoted in the daily service and the corresponding
aggregate number of dealer listings, as reported for a day at approximately January 15th annually.

About half of the stocks show substantial concentration of dealer
listings, including both bids and offers. Many of the remainder are
quoted only on the bid side, indicating sporadic dealings, and some
are listed on domestic or Canadian stock exchanges.
Reporting Under Section 15(d)

Issuers reporting pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act
continue to increase in number despite the numerous reductions occasioned by listing on the exchanges or absorption into other companies by purchase of assets or mergers. They increased from 2,017 on
December 31, 1960,to 2,435on December 31, 1961. The 2,435reporting
issuers included 1,720 having $42.5 billion aggregate market value of
stocks. The remaining 715 issuers included partnerships, voting
trusts duplicative of listed shares, stock purchase and employees savings plans, companies with only bonds in public hands, registered
investment companies, and numerous issuers for whose shares no quotation was available, including a considerable number registering in
1961but not offering their shares until 1962.

DEUSTING OF SECURITIES FROM .E¥CHANGES

Applications may be made to the Commission by exchanges to
strike any securities or by issuers to withdraw their securities from
listing and registration on exchanges pursuant to Rule 12<12-1(b)
under Section 12(d) of the Exchange Act. During the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1962, the Commission granted applications by
exchanges and issuers to remove 60 stock issues and 45 bond issues
from listing and registration. There were 64 total stock removals,
since 4 stocks were each delisted by 2 exchanges. The number of
issuers of stock involved was 54. The removals were as follows:

In accordance with the practice in recent years, nearly all of the
delisting applications were filed by exchanges. Only four of the
applications were filed by issuers, in each instance for the purpose of
reducing multiple expenses by delisting from one exchange stocks
which remained listed on other exchanges.
The applications by exchanges were based on factors such as
limited distribution, sale of assets, or precarious financial condition.
The 45 bond issues were all of foreign origin, including 17 issues of

"iron-curtain" countries suspended from trading in 1941, and 28
small residues of offers in exchange and settlement. The 23 stock
deli stings by the New York Stock Exchange were in accordance with
its delisting criteria established in 1914, and expanded from time to
time thereafter.
During the year, it obtained complete observance
of its policy requiring solicitation of proxies for meetings of stockholders. The eight delistings by the Salt Lake Stock Exchange
resulted from its adoption on February 16, 1962, of new requirements for retention of listed status. The American Stock Exchange
on April 5, 1962, adopted new deli sting rules and criteria with
respect to lack of earnings, limited distribution of securities and disposal of principal operating assets.
DeIisting Proceedings Under Section 19(a)

Section 19(a) (2) authorizes the Commission to suspend for a period
not exceeding 12 months, or to withdraw, the registration of a security
on a national securities exchange if, in its opinion, such action is necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors and, after notice
and opportunity for hearing, the Commission .finds that the issuer of
the security has failed to comply with any provision of the Act or the
rules and regulations thereunder. The following table indicates the
number of such proceedings with which the Commission was concerned during the 1962 fiscal year.

Section 19(a) (4) authorizes the Commission summarily to suspend
trading in any registered security on a national securities exchange
for a period not exceeding ten days if, in its opinion, such action is
necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors and the
public interest so requires. During the 1962 fiscal year the Commission found it necessary and appropriate in four instances to use its
authority to suspend summarily trading in securities registered on a
national securities exchange. All of these suspensions remained in
effect at the end of the fiscal year. In addition, two of the three suspensions which were in effect at the beginning of the fiscal year
remained in effect at the end of the fiscal year.
One of the two cases in which an order was issued under Section
19(a) (2) during the fiscal year withdrawing securities from registration on a national securities exchange is described below.

TWENTY-EIGHTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

51

Consolidated Development Corporation.- Registrant, a Delaware
corporation organized in 1956 under the name of Consolidated Cuban
Petroleum Corporation to engage in the operation, development and
production of oil and gas in Cuba, registered its common stock on
the American Stock Exchange in 195-6. It adopted its present name
in 1959, after the petroleum ventures had sustained severe financial
losses. It then decided to engage in the acquisition and development
of real estate in the State of Florida.
Registrant admitted that it had violated Section 13 of the Exchange
Act and rules thereunder, in that its application for registration of
its common stock on the exchange, its annual reports for the years
1956 through 1959, inclusive, and a number of current reports filed or
required to be filed were inaccurate or inadequate. Among other
things, the reports failed to set forth that registrant exchanged stock
with three corporations in which officers and directors of registrant
were promoters, officers, directors, and major stockholders; that it
issued stock to certain persons in Cuba for oil leases and services;
and that in the years 1956 through 1959, several controlling shareholders and officers disposed of a large amount of stock of registrant,
which was not registered under the Securities Act, to residents of
and broker-dealer firms in the United States.
Further, registrant admitted that its reports were materially
inaccurate in representing that all sales and exchanges of 2,147,457
shares of outstanding stock were made in Cuba and did not require
registration under the Securities Act as not involving public offerings in the United States, and in representing that it had 1,086 stockholders when in fact it had only about 766. Registrant also omitted
to disclose that in November 1959, a new Cuban law was published
cancelling all applications for petroleum exploration and exploitation
concessions, permitting continuation of explorations in progress where
certain minimum drilling requirements were met and providing for
payment to Cuba of a 60 percent royalty on petroleum produced, and
the effect of such law on registrant's operations.
On the basis of these and other deficiencies the Commission issued
an order withdrawing the registrant's common stock from registration on the exchange, which had suspended trading in the stock in
December 1959.1
UNUSTED TRADING PRIVILEGES ON EXCHANGES

Stocks with only unlisted trading privileges on exchanges continued to decline in number, falling from 212 on June 30,1961, to 187
on June 30, 1962. The American Stock Exchange accounted for 12
1

52

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of the 25 removals. This Exchange now applies to its unlisted issues
the same requirements for retention as it applies to listed issues, pursuant to rules and criteria established April 5, 1962. The Pacific
Coast Stock Exchange also accounted for 12 removals, leaving only
5 stocks remaining in the unlisted category on that exchange. The
distribution of unlisted stocks and share volumes among the exchanges
is shown in Appendix Table 8 of this report.
The reported volume of trading on the exchanges in stocks with
only unlisted trading privileges, for the calendar year 1961, was about
45,427,000 shares or about 2.1 percent of the total share volume of all
the exchanges. About 83.2 percent of this volume was on the American Stock Exchange, 15.3 percent was on the Pacific Coast Stock
Exchange, and three other exchanges contributed the remaining
1.5 percent. The share volume in these stocks was about 6.9 percent
of the total share volume on the American Stock Exchange and about
10.8 percent of that on the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange in the
calendar year 1961.
Unlisted trading privileges on some exchanges in stocks listed and
registered on other exchanges numbered 1,532 on June 30, 1962. The
volume of unlisted trading in these stocks, for the calendar year 1961,
was reported at about 57,900,000 shares. About one-fifth of this volume was on the American Stock Exchange in stocks listed on regional
exchanges, and about four-fifths was on regional exchanges in stocks
listed on the New York or American Stock Exchanges. While the
57,900,000 shares amounted to only about 2.7 percent of the total
share volume on all the exchanges, they constituted substantial portions of the shares traded on the leading regional exchanges, reaching
about 78 percent on Boston, 12 percent on Philadelphia-Baltimore, 68
percent on Cincinnati, 53 percent on Detroit, 44 percent on Pittsburgh,
::10percent on Midwest, and 17 percent on Pacific Coast Stock
Exchange.
Applications for Unlisted Thading Privileges

Applications by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges in stocks
listed on other exchanges, made pursuant to Rule 12f-1 under Section

During the fiscal year, the Commission granted applications by the
American Stock Exchange pursuant to Rule 12f-2 under Section
12(f) of the Exchange Act for continuance of unlisted trading, on
the ground of substantial equivalence, in the stock of Dominion Tar
& Chemical Co., Ltd., after the number of its shares was more than
doubled through offers of exchange for other common stocks, and in
the stock of Wagner Baking Corporation in substitution for voting
trust certificates upon expiration of the voting trust.
BWCK DISTRIBUTIONS REPORTED BY EXCHANGES

The usual method of distributing blocks of listed securities considered too large for the auction market on the floor of an exchange
is to resort to "secondary distributions" over the counter after the
close of exchange trading.
In an effort to keep as much as possible of this business on their
floors, Special Offering Plans were adopted by leading exchanges
commencing in 1942, and the somewhat more flexible Exchange Distribution Plans commencing in 1953. The plans, declared effective
by this Commission, include an exemption from the anti-manipulative
Rule 10b-2, as set forth in paragraph (d) thereof, with respect to
payment of compensation in connection with the distribution of
securities.
The largest number of Special Offerings was 87 in 1944, with $32,454,000aggregate value. The number has declined through the years,
there being only two in 1961,aggregating $1,503,750.

MANIPULATION AND STABILIZATION

Manipulation

The Exchange Act describes and prohibits certain forms of manipulative activity in any security registered on a national securities
exchange. The prohibited activities include wash sales and matched
orders effected for the purpose of creating a false or misleading
appearance of trading activity in or with respect to the market for
any such security; a series of transactions intended to raise or depress
the price of such security or to create actual or apparent active trading for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales of such security by
others; circulation by a broker, dealer, seller, or buyer, or by a person
who receives consideration from a broker, dealer, seller or buyer, of
information concerning market operations conducted for a rise or a
decline in the price of such security; and the making of any false
and misleading statement of material information by a broker, dealer,
seller, or buyer regarding such security for the purpose of inducing
purchases or sales. The Act also empowers the Commission to adopt
rules and regulations to define and prohibit the use of these and other
forms of manipulative activity in any security registered on an
exchange or traded over the counter.
The Commission's market surveillance staff in its Division of Trading and Exchanges in Washington and in its New York Regional
Office and other field offices observes the tickertape quotations of
securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange and on the American Stock Exchange, the sales and quotation sheets of the various
regional exchanges, and the bid and asked prices published by the
National Quotation Bureau for about 6,000 unlisted securities to
observe any unusual and unexplained price variations or market
activity. The financial news ticker, leading newspapers, and various
financial publications and statistical services are also closely followed.
When unusual and unexplained market activity in a security is
observed, all known information regarding the security is examined
and a decision made as to the necessity for an investigation. Most
investigations are not made public so that no unfair reflection will be
cast on any persons or securities and the trading markets will not be
upset. These investigations, which are conducted by the Commission's regional offices, take two forms. A preliminary investigation
or "quiz" is conducted to rapidly discover evidence of unlawful

TWENTY-EIGHTH

55

ANNUAL REPORT

activity. If it appears that more intensive investigation is necessary,
a formal order of investigation, which carries with it the right to
issue subpoenas, is issued by the Commission. If violations by a
broker-dealer are discovered, the Commission may institute administrative proceedings to determine whether or not to revoke his registration or suspend or expel him from membership in the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or from a national securities
exchange. The Commission may also seek an injunction against any
person violating the Exchange Act and it may refer information
obtained in its investigation to the Department of Justice recommending that persons violating the Act be criminally prosecuted. In some
cases, where state action seems likely to bring quick results in preventing fraud or where Federal jurisdiction may be doubtful, the
information obtained may be referred to state agencies for state
injunctive action or criminal prosecution.
The following table shows the number of quizzes and formal investigations pending at the beginning of fiscal 1962, the number initiated
in fiscal 1962, the number closed or completed during the same period,
and the number pending at the end of the fiscal year:

When securities are to be distributed to the public, their markets
are watched very closely to make sure that the price is not unlawfully
raised prior to or during the offering period. Registered offerings
numbering 1,815,having a value of over $19 billion, and 1,065 offerings
exempt under Section 3 (b) of the Securities Act, having a value of
about $237 million, were so observed during the fiscal year. Other
offerings numbering 141, such as secondary distributions and distributions of securities under special plans filed by the exchanges, having
a total value of $382 million, were also kept under surveillance.
Stabilization

Stabilization involves open-market purchases of securities to prevent or retard a decline in the market price in order to facilitate a
distribution.
It is permitted by the Exchange .Act subject to the

56

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

restrictions provided by the Commission's Rules 10b-6, 7, and 8.
These rules are designed to confine stabilizing activity to that necessary for the above purpose, to require proper disclosure and to prevent
unlawful manipulation.
During 1962 stabilizing was effected in connection with stock offerings totaling 65,028,432 shares having an aggregate public offering
price of $1,536,800,426 and bond offerings having a total offering
price of $153,991,500. In these offerings, stabilizing transactions resulted in the purchase of 1,803,713 shares of stock at a cost of
$46,092,610and bonds at a cost of $2,069,243. In connection with the
stabilizing transactions, 10,241 stabilizing reports showing purchases
and sales of securities effected by persons conducting the distribution
were received and examined during the fiscal year.
INSIDERS' SECURITY HOLDINGS AND TRANSACTIONS

Section 16 of the Act is designed to prevent the unfair use of information by directors, officers and principal stockholders by giving
publicity to their security holdings and transactions and by removing
the profit incentive in short-term trading by them in securities of their
company. Such persons by virtue of their position may have
knowledge of the company's condition and prospects which is unavailable to the general public and may be able to use such information to
their personal advantage in transactions in the company's securities.
Provisions similar to those contained in Section 16 of the Act are also
contained in Section 17 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935and Section 30 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Ownership Reports

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires every person
who is a direct or indirect beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of
any class of equity securities (other than exempted securities) which
is registered on a national securities exchange, or who is a director or
officer of the issuer of such securities, to file reports with the Commission and the exchange disclosing his ownership of the issuer's
equity securities. TIllS information must be kept current by the filing
of subsequent reports for any month in which a change in his ownership occurs. Similar reports are required by Section 17(a) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of officers, and directors, of
public utility holding companies and by Section 30(f) of the Investment Company Act of officers, directors, principal security holders,
members of advisory boards and investment advisers or affiliated
persons of investment advisers of registered closed-end investment
companies.

TWENTY-EIGHTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

57

Ownership reports are available for public inspection at the Commission's officein Washington and those filed under Section 16(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act may also be inspected at the appropriate
exchange. In addition, for the purpose of making the reported information available to interested persons who may not be able to inspect
the reports in person, the Commission summarizes and publishes such
information in a monthly "Official Summary of Security Transactions and Holdings," which is distributed by the Government Printing
Office on a subscription basis. Subscriptions to this publication
exceed 16,000.
During the fiscal year, 42,983 ownership reports were filed, as compared with 40,869 reports filed during the 1961 fiscal year. The
number of reports filed has more than doubled during the past 10

In order to prevent insiders from making unfair use of information which may have been obtained by reason of their relationship
with a company, Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, Section 17(b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and Section
30(f) of the Investment Company Act provide for the recovery by
or on behalf of the issuer of any profit realized by insiders from
certain purchases and sales, or sales and purchases, of securities of
the company within any period of less than 6 months. The Commission has certain exemptive powers with respect to transactions not
comprehended within the purpose of these provisions, but is not
charged with the enforcement of the civil remedies created thereby.
REGULATION

OF PROXIES

Scope of Proxy Regulation

Under Sections 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 12(e) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and 20(a) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940,the Commission has adopted Regulation 14 requiring the disclosure in a proxy statement of pertinent
information in connection with the solicitation of proxies, consents
and authorizations in respect of securities of companies subject to
those statutes. The regulation provides, among other things, that
when the management is soliciting proxies, any security holder desiring to communicate with other security holders for a proper purpose
may require the management to furnish him with a list of all security
holders or to mail his communication to security holders for him.
A security holder may also, subject to reasonable prescribed Iimita-

58

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

tions, require the management to include in its proxy material any
appropriate proposal which such security holder desires to submit
to a vote of security holders. Any security holder or group of security holders may at any time make an independent proxy solicitation
upon compliance with the proxy rules, whether or not the management is making a solicitation.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminary form prior to the date of the proposed solicitation. Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed disclosure standards, the management or other group responsible for
its preparation is notified informally and given an opportunity to
avoid such defects in the preparation of the proxy material in the
definitive form in which it is furnished to stockholders.
Statistics Relating to Proxy Statements

During the 1962 fiscal year, 2,259 proxy statements in definitive
form were filed under the Commission's Regulation 14: for the solicitation of proxies of security holders; 2,253 of these were filed by
management and 6 by nonmanagement groups or individual stockholders. These 2,259 solicitations related to 2,135 companies, some
124 of which had more than 1 solicitation during the year, generally
for a special meeting not involving the election of directors.
There were 2,063 solicitations of proxies for the election of directors, 183 for special meetings not involving the election of directors,
and 13 for assents and authorizations for action not involving a
meeting of security holders or the election of directors.
In addition to the election of directors, the decisions of security
holders were sought through the solicitation in the 1962 fiscal year
of their proxies, consents and authorizations with respect to the
following types of matters:
Mergers, consolidations,
acquisitions of businesses, purchases and sales of
property, and dissolutions

ANNUAL

REPORT

Proposals

During the 1962 fiscal year, 44 stockholders submitted a total of 242
proposals which were included in the 122 proxy statements of 122
companies under Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14.
Typical of such stockholder proposals submitted to a vote of security holders were resolutions relating to amendments to charters or
bylaws to provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors,
limitations on granting stock options and their exercise by key
employees and management groups, sending a postmeeting report
to all stockholders, changing the place of the annual meeting of
stockholders, and the approval by stockholders of management's selection of independent auditors.
The managements of 25 companies omitted from their proxy statements under the Commission's Rule 14a-8 a total of 62 additional
proposals submitted by 25 individual stockholders. The principal
reasons for such omissions and the numbers of times each such reason
was involved (counting only one reason for omission for each proposal
even though it may have been omitted under more than one provision
of Rule 14a-8) were as follows:
(a) 22 proposals were withdrawn by the stockholders;
(b) 14 proposals were not a proper subject matter under state
law;
(c) 11 proposals related to the ordinary conduct of the company's business;
(d) 6 proposals involved the election of directors;
(e) 3 proposals concerned a personal grievance against the
company;
(f) 3 proposals involved substantially the same matters as had
previously been submitted to security holders;
(g) 2 proposals were not timely submitted;
(h) 1 proposal and reasons therefore was deemed misleading.
Ratio of Soliciting to Nonsoliciting Companies

Of the 2,388 issuers that had securities listed and registered on
national securities exchanges as of June 30, 1962, 2,221 had voting
securities so listed and registered. Of these 2,221 issuers, 6 listed and
registered voting securities for the first time after their annual stockholders' meeting in fiscal 1962; of the remaining 2,215 issuers with
voting securities, 1,807, or 82 percent, solicited proxies under the Commission's proxy rules during the 1962 fiscal year for the election of
directors.

Proxy Contests

During the 1962 fiscal year, 17 companies were involved in proxy
contests for the election of directors. A total of 253 persons, both
management and nonmanagement, filed detailed statements as participants under the requirements of Rule 14a-11. Proxy statements in
10 cases involved contests for control of the- board of directors and
those in 7 cases involved contests for representation on the board.
Management retained control of the board of directors in 4 of the
10 contests for control, 1 was settled by negotiation, nonmanagement
persons won 3 and 2 were pending as of June 30, 1962. Of the 7 cases
where representation on the board of directors was involved, management retained all places on the board in 5 cases.
INVESTIGATIONS

Section 21 (a) of the Act authorizes the Commission to make such
investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether any person
has violated or is about to violate any provision of the Act or any
rule or regulation thereunder. The Commission is authorized, for this
purpose, to administer oaths, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence and require the production of records. In addition
to the investigations undertaken in enforcing the anti-fraud, brokerdealer registration, and other regulatory provisions of the Act, which
are discussed in Part XI of this report under "Complaints and Investigations," the following investigations were undertaken in enforcing
the reporting provisions of Sections 12, 13, 14 and 15(d) of the Act
and the rules thereunder, particularly those provisions relating to the
filing of annual and other periodic reports and proxy material:

Administrative Proceedings

The Commission is given the power to deny or revoke the registration of a broker-dealer by Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act. An order of denial or revocation will be issued, after notice and
opportunity for hearing, if the Commission finds that such sanction
is in the public interest and the applicant or registrant, or any partner, officer, director, or other person directly or indirectly controlling
or controlled by the applicant or registrant is subject to a statutory
disqualification. The statutory disqualifications are:
(1) willful false or misleading statements in the application for
registration or document supplemental thereto;
(2) conviction within the previous 10 years of a felony or misdemeanor involving the purchase or sale of securities or arising out of
the conduct of business as a broker-dealer;
(3) injunction by a court of competent jurisdiction against engaging in any practices in connection with the purchase or sale of
securities; and
(4) willful violation of the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any of the Commission's rules or
regulations thereunder.
The Commission has no authority to deny or revoke registration
without finding a disqualification of the types set forth. Therefore,
bad reputation or character, or inexperience in the securities business,

62

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

or even conviction of a felony unrelated to transactions in securities
is not a basis for ordering denial or revocation of registration.
Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act empowers the Commission to suspend or expel a broker-dealer from membership in a
registered securities association upon a 'finding of violation of the
Federal securities laws or regulations thereunder. The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), is the only such
association. Section 19(a) (3) of the Act gives the Commission
power to take similar action against members of national securities
exchanges.
.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 15A(b) (4) of the Securities
Exchange Act, in the absence of Commission approval or direction,
no broker or dealer may be admitted to or continued in membership
in the NASD if the broker or dealer or any partner, officer, director, or
controlling or controlled person of such broker or dealer was a
cause of any order of denial or revocation of registration or suspension or expulsion from membership which is in effect. An individual
named as a cause often is subject to one or more statutory disqualifications under Section 15(b) and his employment by any other brokerdealer thus could also become a basis for broker-dealer revocation or
denial proceedings against such employer.
Set forth below are statistics on administrative proceedings instituted during fiscal 1962 to deny and revoke registration and to
suspend and expel from membership in an exchange or the NASD.

Revocation and Denial Proceedings

The cases in which the Commission revoked or denied brokerdealer registrations during the 1962 fiscal year are briefly summarized
at the end of this section of the report, with the exception of a few
cases of unusual interest or significance which are set forth in some
detail in the following paragraphs:
Rosenson and Baumann.- The Commission found that registrant,
a partnership, and its two partners, directly and through various
salesmen, made numerous misrepresentations in the sale of nonvoting common stock of North American Finance Company, which
had been organized by the partners. Respondents recruited inexperienced young men as salesmen, provided no program of instruction for them, and directed them to concentrate their sales efforts on
unsophisticated persons and to use high pressure selling methods. In
addition, the Commission found that a registration statement filed by
North American falsely stated that the financial statements which
were included had been examined by an independent public accountant, when in fact the accountant who certified the financial statements
was not independent, since he had served as North American's principal bookkeeper so that his certification was merely an authentication
of his own accounting procedures. The Commission held that the two
partners, who signed the registration statement as directors and prin-

64

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

cipal officers of North American and who admittedly controlled that
company, knew or should have known that the accountant was not
independent, and that, by filing an untrue registration statement, they
willfully violated those Sections of the Securities Act which specify
the information to be included in a registration statement and prospectus. Respondents had been enjoined from offering or selling North
American stock in violation of the registration or anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Acts. On the basis of the injunction, the
willful violations and respondents' consent, the Commission revoked
registrant's registration and found each of the partners a cause of
the revocation."
Theodore

A. Landau, doing business as Landau Company, and

Scott Taylor & Co., Inc.-The
registrations of both firms were
revoked because of manipulative practices in the sale of Anaconda
Lead & Silver Company stock. Scott Taylor, before acquiring a large
block of Anaconda stock from Landau and proceeding to a retail distribution, had asked Landau to insert quotations for the stock in the
daily sheets of the National Quotation Bureau, Inc. In March and
April 1959, blocks of stock of Anaconda, which had been an inactive
company since 1952, were sold at 15 cents and 20 cents per share.
Landau inserted bids, generally at $4.25 per share, in the daily sheets
from April to mid-August 1959, and Scott Taylor made a distribution of the Anaconda shares in at least 29 states. The Commission
found that Scott Taylor represented that the stock was being offered
at the market when in fact the market was one made and controlled
by Scott Taylor or by Landau. The Commission further found that
Scott Taylor violated Rule 10b-6 under the Exchange Act by placing
bids for the stock through an intermediary while distributing it.
Sales were made by Scott Taylor through long distance telephone
solicitations in which purchasers were not informed that Anaconda
had been inactive since 1952,and that it had no income, machinery or
equipment and practically no funds. Scott Taylor and Stephen N.
Stevens, its president, consented to revocation of Scott Taylor's registration and a finding that Stevens was a cause of the revocation, based
on the market manipulation and on false and misleading statements
made in the sale of the stock. Landau's registration was revoked
because of his participation in creating a false impression of market
activity in the stock and he was also held responsible for Scott
Taylor's acts in furtherance of the fraudulent enterprise.'
Aldrich, Scott & Co., Inc.-In this proceeding, the registrant and
Edward L. Benedict, Jr., who owned 80 percent of its stock and was its

65

president at the time, admitted violations of the anti-fraud provisions
of the Securities Acts and of the Commission's net capital requirements and consented to revocation of registrant's registration and a
finding that Benedict was a cause of such revocation. The principal
issue was whether Walter Scott Aldrich, who was registrant's vicepresident, secretary, and director and a 20 percent stockholder during
the time of the violations, should also be found a cause. Aldrich
contended, among other things, that he was inexperienced in the
securities business and did not take an active part in registrant's
business during this period. The Commission rejected his contention
and found him a cause of registrant's revocation. It held that he was
accountable for registrant's engaging in the securities business while
insolvent and with a net capital deficiency, stating that a principal
officer,director, and stockholder of a registered broker-dealer has at
the least a duty to keep himself informed of the registrant's financial
condition and to take those steps necessary to insure compliance with
the Exchange Act,"

of D. Earle Hensley 00., Inc.26 was revoked because, among other
things, registrant had engaged in the securities business before becoming registered as a broker-dealer, made misrepresentations in the sale
of its stock, misappropriated customers' funds and securities, and was
enjoined from various acts and practices.
'Willful violation of the securities registration provisions was the
principal basis for revocation in Pauline Zipperman; doing business as
German American Trading 00mpany,27 and Rockwell Securities 001'poration/s where the registrant had also been enjoined against further
violations of such provisions.
The use of customers' funds or securities for registrant's own purposes, accompanied in most cases by willful violations of the Commission's net capital rule or the anti-fraud provisions of the securities
acts by broker-dealers doing business while insolvent, were the causes
of revocation in Miller Smith ill 00., Inc.,29 Ohampion &: 00., Inc.,so

Failure to file required financial reports, coupled in some instances
with failure to amend the application for registration to reflect changes
of names or business address, caused revocation of the broker-dealer

William Douglas Bradford,40 Benjamin Brown Gilbert, doing business

Failure to maintain
current and accurate books or to produce them for Commission inspection were among the grounds resulting in revocation in Quinn, N eu &:

further violations of the anti-fraud and recordkeeping provisions of
the securities acts and Regulation T.
Suspension Proceedings

Section 15 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act authorizes the
Commission to suspend a broker-dealer's registration pending final
determination as to whether registration should be revoked. In order
to suspend registration, the Commission must find, after notice and
opportunity for a hearing, that suspension is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest or for the protection of investors. The registrations of five broker-dealers were suspended during the past fiscal year

in serious misconduct." To prevent further harm to investors the
Commission determined that it was in the public interest to suspend
those registrations pending determination of the question of revocation. The entry of a suspension order is not determinative of the ultimate questions of willful violations or revocation itself.
Other Sanctions

In one instance during the fiscal year the Commission suspended a
registrant from membership in the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. for a period of 30 days." In addition to revoking their
registrations, the Commission also expelled the following broker-dealers from the NASD: Barclay Securities Oorporationr? O. H. Abraham mOo., Inc.,53 D. H. Victor &: Oompany, Inc.,54 Luther L. Bost,
doing business as L. L. B08t 00mpany,55 and Allstate Securities, Inc. 56
In Oady, Roberts &: 00.,57 the Commission suspended Robert M.
Gintel, a partner of this New York Stock Exchange member, from
the exchange for 20 days. Gintel had placed shares of Curtiss",Yright Corporation stock in the discretionary accounts of about 30
customers of registrant. On November 25, 1959, the Curtiss-Wright
directors voted for a reduced dividend for the fourth quarter. A
registered representative of Cady, Roberts, who was a director of
Curtiss-Wright, called registrant's office with the news before the
dividend reduction was made public on the exchange. Immediately
on receiving this information Gintel entered two orders on the exchange, one to se112,000shares of Curtiss-Wright for 10 customers' accounts, the other to sell 5,000 shares short for 11 accounts. These
orders were executed on the exchange before news of the dividend cut
appeared there on the Dow Jones Ticker Service. 'When the news was
made public the exchange suspended trading in Curtiss-Wright stock
because of the large number of sell orders and when trading resumed
the price was approximately $3.'15per share lower.

The Commission held that under the circumstances Gintel's conduct operated as a fraud and deceit upon the purchasers from his
customers' accounts and constituted a willful violation of the antifraud provisions of the securities acts. It found that Gintel had the
responsibility of an "insider" to disclose material facts which were
known to him by virtue of his position but which were not known to
persons with whom he dealt and which, if known, would have affected
their investment judgment. The Commission said that the director
of Curtiss-Wright who had informed Cady, Roberts of the dividend
cut would have been prohibited from selling the securities without
disclosure, and that by logical sequence Gintel, a partner of registrant, was also prohibited from selling without disclosure. Gintel
argued that his sales after receiving news of the dividend action were
part of a continuing program of liquidating the Curtiss-Wright holdings in his discretionary accounts and that he was carrying out a
fiduciary responsibility to his customers. The Commission rejected
these arguments. It found that Gintel's sales after receiving the news
were in contrast to his previous moderate rate of sales of CurtissWright stock, and that he allocated short sales to his wife's account
and to the account of a customer with whom he had had no prior
dealings. The Commission ruled that although Gintel occupied a
fiduciary relationship to his customers, that relationship could not
justify his use of inside information at the expense of the general
public. With respect to the argument that a disclosure requirement
applicable to exchange transactions would present substantial practical difficulties, the Commission stated that such problems are easily
avoided where, as here, all the registered broker-dealer need do is to
keep out of the market until the established procedures for public
release of the information on the exchange are carried out. The
Commission took no action against the registrant because it found
that there was no evidence of a preconceived plan to "leak" the advance information, that Gintel had acted spontaneously, and that
registrant had had no opportunity to prevent the transactions.
Net Capital Rule

The basic purpose of Rule 1503-1, promulgated by the Commission
under Section 15(c) (3) of the Exchange Act, is to safeguard funds
and securities of customers dealing with registered broker-dealers.
This rule, commonly known as the net capital rule, limits the amount
of indebtedness which may be incurred by a broker-dealer in relation
to its capital. It provides that the "aggregate indebtedness" of a
broker-dealer may not exceed 20 times the amount of its "net capital"
as computed under the rule,

70

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

If it appears from an examination of the reports filed by a registered broker-dealer with the Commission, or through inspection of its
books and records, that the ratio is exceeded, the Commission normally
notifies the broker-dealer of the deficiency and affords an opportunity
for compliance. Unless the capital situation is promptly remedied,
injunctive action may be taken by the Commission and in addition
proceedings may be instituted to revoke the broker-dealer's registration. During the past fiscal year, violations of the net capital rule
were charged in 25 injunctive actions and in 23 revocation proceedmgs instituted against broker-dealers.
Registered broker-dealers who participate in "firm commitment"
underwritings must have sufficient capital to permit the participation
provided by the underwriting contract without impairing the capitaldebt ratio prescribed by the rule. For the protection of issuers and
customers of the broker-dealer, the Commission's staff carefully analyzes the latest available information on the capital position of the
participants to determine whether they will be in compliance with the
rule upon assumption of the new obligations involved in the underwritings. Acceleration of the effective date of registration statements
filed under the Securities Act will be denied where underwriting commitments may engender violations of the net capital rule by any
participating underwriter.
A participant found to be inadequately
capitalized to take down his commitment is notified and given an
opportunity to adjust his financial position to meet the requirements
If he is unable to
of the rule without reducing his commitments.
meet such requirements, he must decrease his "firm commitment" until
compliance with the rule is reached. If necessary he may have to withdraw from the underwriting or participate on a "best efforts" basis
only.
Financial Statements

Rule 17a-5 under Section 17 (a) of the Exchange Act requires
registered broker-dealers to file annual reports of financial condition
with the Commission. Such reports must be certified by a certified
public accountant or public accountant who is in fact independent,
with certain specified limited exemptions applicable to situations
where certification does not appear necessary for customer protection.
Under certain circumstances member firms of national securities
exchanges are exempt from the necessity of certification and an exemption is available for a broker-dealer who, since his previous report, has
limited his securities business to soliciting SUbscriptions as an agent
for issuers, has transmitted funds and securities promptly, and has
not otherwise held funds or securities for or owed monies or securities
to customers. Also exempt is a broker or dealer who, from the date of

TWENTY-EIGHTH

ANNUAL REPORT

71

his last report, has confined his business to buying and selling evidences of indebtedness secured by liens on real estate and has carried
no margin accounts, credit balances or securities for any customers.
After his registration, a broker-dealer's first financial report must
reflect his condition as of a date between the end of the 1st and 5th
months after the effecive date of the registration. All reports must
be filed within 45 days after the date as of which the report speaks.
Through these reports the Commission and the public may evaluate
the financial position and responsibility of broker-dealers. The financial report is one means by which the staff of the Commission determines whether the registrant is in compliance with the net capital rule.
Failure to file the required reports may result in the institution of
revocation proceedings. However, it is the policy of the Commission
first to advise the broker-dealer of his obligations under the rule and
to give him an opportunity to file the report.
During the fiscal year 5,228 reports of financial condition were
filed with the Commission compared to the 1961 total of 5,060.
Broker-Dealer

Inspections

Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act provides for regular and periodic inspections of registered broker-dealers. During the fiscal year
the number of such inspections totaled 1,515. The inspection device
is a most useful instrument in protecting investors and detecting violations of the Federal securities laws. The inspection, among other
things, determines a broker-dealer's financial condition, reviews his
pricing practices, evaluates the safeguards employed in handling customers' funds and securities, and determines whether adequate and
accurate disclosures are made to customers.
The Commission's inspectors also determine whether brokers and
dealers are keeping books and records as required by the Exchange
Act and the Commission's rules thereunder and conforming to the
margin and other requirements of Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board. Inspectors also look for excessive trading or switching
in customers' accounts. Inspectors frequently find evidence of the
sale of unregistered securities or of fraudulent practices such as use
of improper sales literature or sales techniques.
When inspections reveal that a broker-dealer is violating the
statutes or rules, consideration is given to the type of violation and
the effect on the public. The Commission does not take formal action as a result of every infraction discovered. Inspections frequently reveal inadvertent violations which are discovered before becoming
serious and before customers' funds or securities are in danger. When
no harm has come to the investing public the registrant is informed
of the violations and advised to correct the improper practices. If

72

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the violation appears to be willful and the public interest is best
served by formal action against the broker-dealer, the Commission
will institute appropriate proceedings.

inspection program during the fiscal year:

The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and the
principal stock exchanges also conduct inspections of their members,
and some states have inspection programs.
Each inspecting agency
conducts inspections in accordance with its own procedures and with
particular reference to its own regulations and jurisdiction.
Consequently, inspections by other agencies are not adequate substitutes
for Commission inspections since they are not primarily concerned
with the detection of violations of the Federal securities laws and the
Commission's regulations.
These other inspection programs, however.
do afford added protection to the public. The Commission and certain other inspecting agencies coordinate their inspections to avoid
duplication and to obtain the widest possible coverage of brokers and
dealers. This program, however, does not prevent the Commission
from inspecting any broker-dealer that has also been inspected by another agency, and such inspections are made whenever reason therefor exists. Agencies now participating in this coordination program
include the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Boston Stock Exchange, the Midwest Stock Exchange,
the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia-Baltimore
Stock
Exchange, the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange, and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
SUPERVISION OF ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
SECURITIES DEALERS, INC.

Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, known as the
Maloney Act, provides for the registration with the Commission of
national securities associations and establishes standards for such as.
sociations, The rules of such associations must be designed to promote
just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and rna-

TWENTY-EIGHTH

73

nipulative acts and practices and to moot other statutory requirements. Such associations are essentially disciplinary in purpose and
serve as a medium for the cooperative self-regulation of over-thecounter brokers and dealers. They operate under the general supervision of this Commission which is authorized to review disciplinary actions and decisions which affect the membership of members,
or of applicants for membership, and to consider all changes in their
rules. The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD),
is the only Association registered under the Act.
In adopting legislation permitting the formation and registration
of such associations, Congress provided an incentive to membership
by permitting such associations to adopt rules which preclude a member from dealing with a nonmember, except on the same terms and
conditions as the member affords the investing public. The NASD
has adopted such rules. Accordingly, membership is necessary to the
profitable participation in underwritings and over-the-counter trading since members may properly grant price concessions, discounts
and similar allowances only to other members. Loss or denial of
membership due to expulsion or suspension or other ineligibility due
to a statutory disqualification, or to failure to meet standards of qualification established in NASD rules, thus imposes a severe economic
sanction.
Membership in the NASD reached an all time month-end high of
4,925 at June 30,1962. During the year net membership increased by
314, as a result of 721 admissions to and 407 terminations of membership. At. the same time there were registered with the NASD as
registered representatives 102,405individuals, also an all time monthend high, including generally all partners, officers,traders, salesmen,
and other persons employed by or affiliated with member firms in
capacities which involved their doing business directly with the public. The number of registered representatives increased by 8,365 during the year as a result of 25,510 initial registrations, 15,014 reregistrations and 32,159terminations of registrations.
NASD Disciplinary Actions

The Commission receives from the NASD summaries of decisions
in all disciplinary actions against members. Each such action
must be based on allegations that a member has violated specified provisions of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice, although registered
representatives of members and persons controlling or controlled by
members may also be cited for having boon the cause of a violation.
Where violations are found one or more of the available sanctions
may be imposed. These include expulsion or suspension from membership, revocation or suspension of registration as a registered rep-

74

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

resentative, fine and censure. An individual may also be found to
have been the cause of a violation and of the penalty imposed on another party for such violation. Such a cause finding can have farreaching effects, particularly in the case of expulsion or suspension of
a member from membership or suspension or revocation of registration
as a registered representative.
A person found to be a cause of
suspension or expulsion from membership cannot be employed by
any NASD member while such suspension expulsion is in effect, except
with the approval of the Commission. Where an individual should
have been, but was not, registered as a representative, a finding that
the unregistered person was a cause of an effective expulsion, suspension or revocation acts as a disqualification from membership, or control of or by a member, just as if such a penalty had been imposed
directly on the person found a cause. In many cases more than a
single penalty may be imposed; thus, expulsion, suspension or revocation might be accompanied by a fine and/or censure. In cases where
the penalty is a fine, censure is customarily added.
All decisions by district business conduct committees of the NASD
are reviewable by the NASD board of governors on its own motion,
or on the timely application of an aggrieved party. On review the
board may affirm, modify, or reverse such decisions or remand them
for further consideration.
During the year the Association reported to the Commission its
final disposition of 411 disciplinary complaint actions against 368
different member firms and 196 registered representatives. 58 With respect to 49 members and 26 representatives, complaints were dismissed
on the basis of findings that the allegations had not been sustained.
Violations were found, and some penalty was imposed, with respect to
362 members and 170 representatives.
The maximum penalty of expulsion from membership was imposed
in 47 decisions (one member being expelled in each of two decisions),
and 9 members were suspended from membership for periods ranging
from 15 days to 2 years. Fines ranging from $50 to $5,000 were imposed on members in 236 cases, including 6 in which members were
suspended and 2 in which members were expelled. In '78 cases the
only penalty was censure, although members subjected to fines were
usually also censured.
Registered representatives found in violation of Association rules
were also subjected to a wide variety of sanctions. The registrations
of 74 representatives were revoked and 19 were suspended for periods
ranging from 15 days to 2 years. Nine representatives were found to

have been causes of penalties imposed on their firms. Fines ranging
from $50 to $5,000 were imposed on 33 representatives, including 5
whose registrations were suspended and 9 whose registrations were
revoked. Censure was the only penalty imposed on 49 representatives
found in violation.
The NASD decisions during the year included 168 solely involving
the NASD's so-called "free-riding" interpretation which states, in
essence, that a member who fails to make a bona fide public offering of
securities acquired for distribution is in violation of the NASD Rules
of Fair Practice." In 15 of these "free-riding" cases, the complaints
were dismissed. With respect to the remainder, fines ranging from
$50 to $4,000 were imposed on members in 110 cases, while censure was
the only penalty in the other 43 cases. Registered representatives
were named as respondents in only 9 "free-riding" cases. In 1 such
case, 13 representatives were named, but the allegations as to them
were dismissed, although the firm was fined. Eight representatives
were fined amounts ranging from $500 to $5.000, and 6 of these were
also suspended for periods ranging from 30 days to 6 months.
Commission Review of NASD Action on Membership

Section 15A(b) of the Act and the bylaws of the NASD provide
that, except where the Commission finds it appropriate in the public
interest to approve or direct to the contrary, no broker or dealer may
be admitted to or continued in membership if he, or any controlling or
controlled person, is under any of the several disabilities specified in
the statute or the bylaws. By these provisions Commission approval
is a condition to admission to or continuance in Association membership of any broker-dealer who, among other things, controls or is controlled by a person whose registration as a broker-dealer has been
revoked or who has been and is suspended or expelled from Association membership or from a national securities exchange, or whose
registration as a registered representative has been revoked by the
NASD or who was found to have been a cause of such an effective
order.
A Commission order approving or directing admission to or continuance in Association membership, notwithstanding a disqualification
under Section 15A (b) (4) of the Act, or under an effective Association
rule adopted under that Section or Section 15A(b) (3), is generally
entered only after the matter has been submitted initially to the Association by the member or applicant for membership. Where, after
consideration, the Association is favorably inclined, it ordinarily files
with the Commission an application on behalf of the petitioner. A
.. See First OaUfornw. Oompanll. infra. p. 78.

76

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

broker-dealer, however, may file an application directly with the Commission either with or without Association sponsorship. The Commission reviews the record and documents filed in support of the
application and, where appropriate, obtains additional relevant and
pertinent evidence. At the beginning of the fiscal year 3 such petitions were pending before the Commission. During the year 6 petitions ",'ere filed; decisions were issued in 8 cases; and 1 petition was
pending at the year end.
The Commission found it appropriate in the public interest to
approve 6 petitions for continuance in Association membership
notwithstanding employment of a disqualified person.f" In 2 other
decisions the Commission by order remanded the applications to the
Association for reconsideration.
In remanding to the NASD, for further consideration, an application by the Association for approval of the continuance of a firm in
membership while employing N. Sims Organ, the Commission stated,
in an opinion written by Chairman Cary, that such an application
"must be weighed in the light of our basic objective of raising standards in the securities industry."
In March 1961, the Commission had revoked the broker-dealer
registration of a firm of which Organ was president, because of
Organ's "fraudulent conduct" in the sale of Continental Mining Exploration stock in 1958, while he was employed by J. H. Lederer Co.,
Inc., whose registration had been revoked in December 1958. Organ
had represented, among other things, that the Continental stock
would be a "tremendous money-maker" without disclosing that the
company had suffered some $584,000 of losses. In addition to this
prior violation of the Federal securities laws, the Commission took
official notice of the fact that in March 1952, the Ontario Securities
Commission had cancelled Organ's registration as a securities salesman in Canada. In that proceeding, Organ, in direct contradiction
of the other evidence developed, had testified under oath that he did
not make sales across the border to U.S. investors, and the Chairman
of the Ontario Commission had stated, "...
his attempt to mislead
the Commission when under oath, fairly indicates the type of representations he would resort to over the telephone, when there is little
risk, if any, of his being held accountable for his actions."
In applying for approval of Organ's employment by the member
firm in question, the NASD took into consideration the fact (among
others) that he would be subject to effective supervisory controls by
60 Securities Exchange Act Releases Nos. 6604 (J"uly 26, 1961) ; 6610 (August 2, 1961) ;
6707 (J"anuary 11, 1962) ; 6766 (March 27, 1962) ; 6783 (April 18, 1962) ; and 6805 (May
15,1962).

the new employer. In view of the basic objective of improving
standards, the Commission asked: "Would approval now give proper
recognition to the nature of his violations? If standards are to be
raised, can fraud once painfully established through extended proceedings be so swiftly ignored?" In remanding this case, the Commission stated that there should be a "penetrating review" of the
employee's history by the prospective employer, the NASD and the
Commission, and that the nature and activities of the firms with which
he was associated could properly be taken into account in evaluating
his training, experience and character."
The other remanded case concerned an application filed by the
Association seeking approval of the continuance of a member firm in
NASD membership while employing Edgar R. D'Abre as a controlled
person.
D'Abre's registration with the NASD as a registered representative
of another firm was revoked by the NASD in March 1961,because of
certain irregularities, including "free-riding" and the "manufacture"
of fictitious accounts and records in an effort to deceive his former
employer and to conceal violations of NASD rules. "If we accept,
as the NASD apparently did," the Commission stated, "the correctness
of the original findings of the District Business Conduct Committee,
it 'would follow that, insofar as the records reveal, D'Abre has never
been candid with his former employer, his prospective employer, or
the NASD. A securities firm must rely to a considerable extent on the
willingness of responsible employees to disclose their activities
accurately and forthrightly, if it is to properly discharge its important
responsibilities of supervision. If D'Abre is unwilling to make such
disclosures, even now, then it would appear doubtful that he fully
appreciates the professional obligations to his employer and to the
public that further participation in the securities field entails. If so,
the necessary finding that it is in the 'public interest' to approve the
continuance of a firm in membership with D'Abre as a controlled
person can hardly be made. A much different record than the one now
before us will be needed to warrant approval of the application." 62
Commission Review of NASD Disciplinary Action

Section 15A(g) of the Act provides that disciplinary actions by the
NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its own motion or
on the timely application of any aggrieved person. This section also
provides that the effectiveness of any penalty imposed by the NASD is
automatically stayed pending determination in any matter which

CO:MMISSION

comes before the Commission for review. Section 15A(h) of the Act
defines the scope of the Commission's review in proceedings to review
disciplinary action of the NASD. If the Commission finds that the
disciplined person engaged in such acts or practices, or has omitted
such acts, as found by the NASD and that such acts, practices, or
omission to act are in violation of such rules of the Association as
have been designated in the determination, and that such conduct
was inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade, the Commission must dismiss such proceedings unless it finds that the penalties
imposed are excessive or oppressive, having due regard to the public
interest, in which case the Commission must, by order, cancel or reduce
the penalties. At the beginning of the fiscal year 15 such review
cases were pending before the Commission. During the year 9 additional such petitions were filed, and decisions were issued in 9 cases,
certain of which are discussed below, leaving 15 petitions pending at
the year end.
The Commission sustained disciplinary action by the NASD against
First Oalifornia Oompany. The NASD had found that First California had violated the Rules of Fair Practice, in that it had failed to
make a bona fide public offering of shares of stock which it had acquired as a member of a selling group participating in a distribution
of such stock. The NASD had fined the company $500 and assessed
costs of $41.89 against it.
The basic facts, which were not in dispute, showed that First California, as a selling group member participating in a public offering of
Permanent Filter Corporation stock at $15 per share, was allotted
1,500 shares on May 7, 1959, and on that day sold 400 shares at the
$15 offering price to its Employees Profit-Sharing Retirement Plan,
an account in which its officers and employees had a beneficial interest.
The stock was quoted on May 7 at 19 to 19% and on the following day
the high bid was 20%. Thus, on the basis of the low bid on May 7,
there was a potential profit on the 400 shares of $1,600 exclusive of the
price concession to members of the selling group. The shares were
held in the account until August 10, when they were sold at prices of
15% and 15%" representing a profit to the Plan of $22.50.
The NASD rested its determination that its rules were violated
solely on its finding that the amount of stock sold to the Plan,
representing 26.6 percent of the 1,500-share allotment, was disproportionate to that sold to public investors. Thus, the sale was held to be
in violation of the NASD's published interpretation with respect to
"free-riding and withholding" in connection with public distributions
of securities. This announced interpretation was to the effect that a
member is obligated to make a bona fide public offering of securities

TWENTY-EIGHTH

79

acquired for distribution and that, among other things, sales to
insiders, including accounts in which the member or its officershave an
interest, in excess of their normal investment practice (unless otherwise provided in a prospectus), or withholding or refraining from
making a public offering of all or any part of its participation to make
an extra profit, are contrary to high standards of commercial honor
and just and equitable principles of trade. With respect particularly
to a practice of sales to such accounts primarily of new issues at a
time when they are being quoted or sold above the offering price
(so-called "hot issues"), and therefore may be resold at a profit, the
NASD had pointed out that such a practice is questionable and should
be the subject of careful consideration. A March 1959 clarification of
the policy stated: ". . . it becomes apparent that allotments of a
member's participation in a 'hot issue' to insider accounts (bona fide
investments or other) in disproportionate amounts, as opposed to
allotments to the public, would hardly indicate a genuine effort to sell
such participation to public investors. Consideration should be given
to the fairness of such ratios in the fulfillment of the member's obligation as a participant."
In its decision, representing its first ruling on the NASD's interpretation with respect to "free-riding" in connection with the distribution of a "hot issue," the Commission expressed agreement with the
NASD position that the basic requirement under the NASD's "freeriding" interpretation that a bona fide public offering be made is
violated, regardless of the investment history or normal investment
practice of an insider account, if a sale of a "hot issue" is made to
such an account in an amount which is disproportionate in comparison with the amount being offered to the public by the member. The
effect of such withholding, the Commission observed, is "not only to
give to the insiders the opportunity for a profit on the shares withheld, which appears highly likely under the circumstances, and
thereby deprive public investors of such opportunity, but also to restrict the supply and tend to raise the market price further and enable
the insiders to realize an increased profit upon subsequent sale of the
shares retained by them."
The Commission concluded that the NASD properly found that
the sale by First California to its own Plan account of 26.6 percent of
its allotment of Permanent Filter stock, at a time when the offering
price of these shares was at least $1,600less than the contemporaneous
market price, was disproportionate in relation to the amount sold to
public investors, and that the NASD rules had been violated." It

also found that the penalty imposed by the Association was not

excessive or oppressive,
The Commission sustained an order of the Association which suspended for 12 months the registration of Leonard H. Zigman as a
registered representative.
Zigman had appealed the action of the
NASD, which found that he had engaged in a "serious breach" of his
obligations to his employer and as a securities salesman, and that his
conduct was inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.
The violation of NASD rules involved the maintenance by Zigman of
an account with his employer in a fictitious name so as to conceal its
true identity and on two occasions allocating to such account portions
of the employer's participation in public offerings being quoted at
above the offering price and immediately thereafter disposing of the
shares at a profit. The Commission rejected Zigman's explanation of
his conduct as an "implausible excuse" and sustained the 12-month
suspension as not excessive or oppressive."

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBUC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935
In administering the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
the Commission regulates interstate public-utility holding company
systems engaged in the electric utility business and/or in the retail
distribution of gas. The Commission's jurisdiction also extends to
natural gas pipeline companies and other nonutility companies which
are subsidiaries of registered holding companies. Although the matters under the Act dealt with by the Commission and its staff embrace
a variety of intricate and complex questions of law and fact generally
involving more than one area of regulation, briefly there are three
principal regulatory areas. The first covers those provisions of the
Act, contained principally in Section 11(b) (1), which require the
physical integration of public utility companies and functionally related properties of holding company systems and those provisions,
contained principally in Section 11(b) (2), which require the simplification of intercorporate relationships and financial structures of
holding company systems. The second covers the financing operations of registered holding companies and their subsidiaries, the
acquisition and disposition of securities and properties, and certain
accounting practices, servicing arrangements and intercompany
transactions. The third includes the exemptive provisions of the Act,
the provisions covering the status under the Act of persons and companies, and those regulating the right of a person affiliated with a
public utility company to acquire securities resulting in a second such
affiliation. Matters embraced within this area of regulation frequently come before the Commission and its staff. Many such matters do not result in formal proceedings and others are reflected in
such proceedings only in an indirect manner when they are related to
issues principally under one of the other areas of regulation.
The Branch of Public Utility Regulation of the Commission's
Division of Corporate Regulation performs the principal functions
under the Act. It observes and examines problems which arise in
81

6721715--63-7

82

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

connection with transactions which are or may be subject to regulation under the Act and discusses such problems with interested persons and companies and advises them as to the applicable sections of
the Act, the rules thereunder and Commission policy with respect
thereto. Questions are raised with and problems are presented to the
staff daily. These include questions raised by security holders and
problems presented by companies contemplating transactions requiring the filing of an application or declaration, particularly financing
operations and the acquisition and disposition of securities and properties. This day-to-day activity includes prefiling discussions and
conferences, in person and by telephone, with company representatives and with other persons where the matter under consideration

SECTION II MATI'ERS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS
IN ACTIVE REGISTERED HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS
Section 11 Matters

At the close of fiscal year 1961, there was pending before the Commission a plan filed by Middle South Utilities, Inc. under Section
11(e) providing for the exchange of its common stock for the 3.18
percent publicly held shares of common stock of New Orleans Public
Service Inc., a public utility subsidiary of Middle South. The
plan provided for the exchange of each share of common stock of
New Orleans for 2% shares of common stock of Middle South. During the current fiscal year the Commission approved the plan and it
was ordered enforced and carried out by a Federal Court,"
Also at the close of the previous fiscal year there was pending
before the Commission a plan filed by National Fuel Gas Co. for
the elimination of the 5.95% minority interest in its subsidiary,
Pennsylvania Gas Company. On February 19, 1962, the Commission approved the plan," and in April 1962, an order was entered by
a Federal court enforcing the plan.'
During this fiscal year Granite City Generating Company (Voting
Trustees) filed a plan under Section 11(e) of the Act with respect
to distribution of the cash remaining from the sale of Granite City's
assets, after retirement of mortgage bonds. The plan proposed that,
after the payment of fees of the Voting Trustees and all liquidating
and other expenses, the balance would be distributed to the holders
of the voting trust certificates of the electric utility company. Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, the Commission approved the
plan 5 and in December 1962 it was ordered enforced and carried out
• Holding Company Act Release No. 14533 (October 19, 1961), enforced by order of
District Court, E.D. La., December 1,1961 (Clv. No. 11646) •
• Holding Company Act Release No. 14575.
• W.D. Pa., Clv. No. 62--140.
• Holding Company Act Release No. 14739 (November 5,1962).

by a Federal court," Prior proceedings in this matter are reported
at page 110 of the 27th Annual Report.
During the fiscal year C. E. Burlingame Corporation, a registered
holding company, filed a plan of dissolution purusant to Section
11(e) of the Act. Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, the
Commission approved the plan and issued an order under Section
5(d) declaring that Burlingame would cease to be a holding company
and that its registration would no longer be in effect upon the consummation of specified transactions,"
Just before the close of the fiscal year, Eastern Utilities Associates
filed Step 2 of a Section 11(e) plan which contemplates the sale of
the common stock of Valley Gas Co. to the public common stockholders of Blackstone Gas & Electric Co. and the shareholders of
Eastern Utilities Associates. This is the final step to be taken to
divest the gas properties from the System. Prior proceedings are
discussed at page 109 of the 27th Annual Report.
On February 20, 1958,the Commission issued its Findings, Opinion
and Order pursuant to Section l1(b) (1) permitting the retention of
all of the New England Electric System's electric properties," Jurisdiction was reserved to consider at later hearings the retainability
of the gas properties. During the present fiscal year briefs were
filed and exchanged by New England Electric System and the Commission's Division of Corporate Regulation. Oral argument was
heard by the Commission on June 12, 1962, and at the close of the
fiscal year the matter was under advisement.
There exists a problem under Section 11(b) (1) in the Middle
South Utilities system relating to the retainability of gas and transportation properties together with electric properties by New Orleans
Public Service Inc. On March 21 and 22, 1962, two bills were introduced in the Congress (H.R. 10872 and H.R. 10898, 87th Cong., 2d
Sess.) which provided generally that no law of the United States
shall be held to require or to authorize any department or agency
of the Federal Government to require New Orleans Public Service
Inc. to divest itself of control of, or any interests in, its facilities for
the transportation of passengers and the distribution of gas in the
City of New Orleans. No action was taken on these bills by the
Congress and no proceedings have been instituted by the Commission."
On December 20, 1961, the Commission issued its order approving
a substantial number of the fees and expenses incurred in connection
• S.D. Ill. Civil Action No. 3234.
Holding Company Act Release No. 14616 (July 30, 1962).
• 38 S.E.C. 193.
• No further action was taken during this fiscal year with respect to certain Section 11 (b)
problems of several other registered holding company systems noted at pages 104, 105 and
108 of the 27th Annual Report.

with a Section l1(d) proceeding resulting in approval of a plan
requiring the elimination of the minority interest in Arkansas Fuel Oil
Corporation, a subsidiary of Cities Service CO.l0 Hearings were held
with respect to the remaining fees and expenses, briefs were filed, and
the Commission heard oral argument. At the close of the fiscal year,
the matter was under advisement.
The Commission has held with court approval that the existence
of a public minority interest in the common stock of a subsidiary of
an integrated registered public utility holding company system constitutes an inequitable distribution of voting power within the meaning of
Section l1(b) (2). Such minority interests have been eliminated in
several systems by plans filed under Section 11(e). There still remain
several systems where minority interests exist as to which no proceedings have been instituted by the Commission or proposed by
holding company systems. These include one or more subsidiaries of
Allegheny Power System, Columbia Gas System and Eastern Utilities
Associates. New England Electric System has minority interests in
several of its gas utility subsidiaries. As noted above, the retainability
of the gas properties is under advisement by the Commission.
Other Developments

Reargument was heard on January 9, 1962 on an application by
Union Electric Company for exemption from the Holding Company
Act pursuant to Section 3(a) (2), and on April 2, 1962, the Commission issued its Findings, Opinion and Order granting the
application.v
On January 3, 1962, the Commission approved the proposed acquisition by General Public Utilities of $52,500,000 face amount of letters
of credit issued through a group of banks as consideration for the
sale by that company of its entire holdings of securities in Manila
Electric Company to Philippine private interests." As a result, the
operations of the General Public Utilities are now confined to
the States of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
On April 2, 1962, New England Electric System filed a declaration
regarding the issuance and sale of 872,786 of its common shares pursuant to a rights offering on the basis of one new share for each 15

shares held. It proposed that bids be invited pursuant to Rule 50
promulgated under the Act for standby compensation during the
subscription period. The Commission permitted the declaration to
become effective," and bids were invited, the subscription price being
set at $21 a share. A bid was submitted for standby compensation of
$1,658,293 or $1.90 per share to purchase the unsubscribed shares at
the subscription price. The company rejected the bid and filed an
amended declaration proposing to proceed with the rights offering
at the same subscription price but without any underwriting, which
the Commission authorized."
Subscriptions were received for 612,440
of the 872,786 shares offered, or approximately 70%. On August 1,
1962, a further amendment proposing to offer the remaining 260,346
shares to the public at competitive bidding was filed and was approved
by the Commission."
Under this proposal 4 bids were received, the
highest bid specifying a price of $22.97 to the company and an offering
price to the public of $23.50 per share. The company accepted this
bid and thereby completed the marketing of the offering.
FINANCING OF ACTIVE REGISTERED PUBLIC UTIUTY HOLDING
COMPANIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES

During the fiscal year 1962, 11 of the active registered holding
company systems issued and sold for cash, by public distribution or
directly to stockholders, 17 issues of long-term debt and capital stocks

• These securrties were sold on July 25,1961,at which tune Union Electric Co was subject to the Act as
a registered holding company. On Apr. 2, 1962,the Commission granted the company an exemption
from the provisions of the Act pursuant to Bection 3(a)(2) thereof Holding Company Act Release No.
14615.

The table does not include securities issued and sold by subsidiaries
to their respective parent holding companies, issuance of short-term
notes to banks, portfolio sales by any of the system companies, or
securities issued for stock or assets of non-affiliated companies. These
issuances and sales also required authorization by the Commission
except in the case of the issuance of notes having a maturity of less
than 9 months where the aggregate amount does not exceed 5% of the
total capitalization of the company. The issuance of such securities
is exempt by the provisions of Section 6(b) of the Act.
Competitive Bidding

All of the 17 issues of securities sold for cash in 1962, as shown in
the preceding table, were offered for competitive bidding pursuant to
the requirements of Rule 50 promulgated under the Act, although one
of such issues ultimately was sold by other means. IS
As described at pages 109-110 of the 27th Annual Report, Valley
Gas Company was organized for the purpose of acquiring and operating the gas properties formerly owned by Blackstone Valley Gas and
Electric Company, a subsidiary of Eastern Utilities Associates, a
registered holding company. In payment for the gas properties,
Valley issued $4.5 million of its :first mortgage bonds and $1.5 million
of its long-term promissory notes to Blackstone. At that time the
Commission granted an exception from the competitive bidding

requirements of Rule 50 with respect to any subsequent sale by Blackstone of the first mortgage bonds and long term notes of Valley and
reserved jurisdiction with respect to the prices to be received and the
other terms and provisions of the first mortgage bonds and long-term
promissory notes of Valley." During fiscal year 1962, the Commission released the jurisdiction formerly reserved and the securities
were sold to institutional investors."
During the period from May 7, 1941, the elective date of Rule 50,
to June 30, 1962, a total of 839 issues of securities with aggregate
sales value of $12,300 million were sold at competitive bidding under
the rule. These totals compare with 231 issues of securities with an
aggregate sales value of $2,371 million which have been sold pursuant
to orders of the Commission granting exceptions from the competitive
bidding requirements of the rule under paragraph (a) (5) thereof."
Of the total amount of securities sold pursuant to orders granting
exceptions under this paragraph, 126 issues with total sales value of
$1,888 million were sold by the issuer and the balance of 105 issues
with a value of $483 million were portfolio sales. Of the 126 issues
sold by issuers, 70 were in amounts of from $1 million to $5 million
and 2 bond issues were in excess of $100 million each.22
PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS OF FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS AND
PREFERRED STOCKS OF PUBUC UTIUTY COMPANIES

Statements of policy were adopted by the Commission in 1956,
codifying the standards to which provisions covering first mortgage
bonds and preferred stocks issued under the Act must conform for the
protection of investors in such securities."
Prior to 1956 these
standards had been established by the Commission on a case-by-case
basis. In passing upon the issuance of first mortgage bonds and preferred stocks under the Act, the Commission examines the applicable
mortgage indentures and charter provisions to insure a continuing
substantial conformity with the codified standards of the respective
statements of policy. Such conformity has been uniformly required
except where, in particular circumstances, deviations from the statements of policy are clearly justified."

187-141,148-151 and 123-126, respectively.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

During the fiscal year, applications or declarations were filed by
public utility companies subject to the Act with respect to nine first
mortgage bond issues involving an aggregate principal amount of
$153,000,000,and three preferred stock issues with a total par value
of $23,000,000.
The statement of policy with respect to first mortgage bonds requires,
among other things, that dividends or other distributions to common
stockholders be limited so as to preserve an "equity cushion" beneath
the claims of the bondholders. This requirement was adequately
provided for in the existing indentures covering three of the nine
bond issues filed by public utility companies. In the other six bond
issues, additional restrictions were required, and were provided for
either at the issuers' initiative or as a result of informal discussions
between the Commission's staff and representatives of the issuer.
Since the bulk of bondholders' security consists of mortgaged
depreciable plant and equipment, the statement of policy for bonds
also requires the periodic renewal and replacement of such property
so as to preserve the book value of the underlying security. This
requirement, in substance, obligates the issuing company to provide
for new property additions (or, alternatively, to deposit cash or outstanding bonds with the trustee) in an amount which over the
estimated useful life of the mortgaged depreciable property, will
maintain the original book cost of the mortgaged property. The
statement of policy requires that the mortgage indenture express the
periodic renewal and replacement obligation as a percentage of the
book cost of the mortgaged depreciable property, but where existing
indentures express the provision on some other basis (usually, as a
percent of operating revenues) such alternate provision is permitted
to remain unchanged if the issuer can satisfactorily demonstrate to the
Commission that the existing provision affords substantially the same
protection as that based on a percent-of-property basis. To insure
observance of this standard of the statement of policy, the Commission's staff conducts a continuous study of the depreciation requirements of the various issuers subject to the Act.
Of the nine bond issues sold during the fiscal year, the indentures
of six expressed the renewal and replacement provision as a percentage
of depreciable property deemed adequate by the Commission. The
indentures covering the other three bond issues expressed the provision as a percentage of revenues which the Commission found
afforded no less protection to the bondholders than that which would
be afforded on an appropriate percent-of-property basis.
With respect to the three preferred stock issues aggregating
$23,000,000as to which applications or declarations were filed during

TWENTY-EIGHTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

the fiscal year, all had charter provisions in substantial conformity
with the statement of policy for preferred stock.
The Commission has continued to require adherence to the provision
contained in both the bond and the preferred stock statements of
policy that the securities be freely refundable at the option of the
issuer upon reasonable notice and payment of a reasonable redemption
premium, if any.25 An exception was allowed in the case of Valley
Gas Company, a new company organized for the purpose of facilitating the divestment by the Eastern Utilities Associates holdingcompany system of the gas utility properties owned by one of the
public utility companies in that system. In light of the unusual
circumstances present, the Commission in fiscal year 1961had granted
an exception from the competitive bidding requirements of Rule 50
under the Holding Company Act, and in fiscal year 1962, the Commission approved an indenture covenant negotiated by Valley Gas
Company with the bond purchasers providing that if any of the bonds
were redeemed during the first five years after issuance through the
issuance of other debt securities bearing a lower interest rate, the company would be required to pay higher redemption premiums than
customary under the Commission's usual standards, but that following
such five-year period the bonds would be freely refundable by the
company upon payment of the normal lower scale of redemption
premiums."
Continuing studies made by the Commission's staff for fiscal year
1962 with respect to electric and gas utility bond issues sold at competitive bidding, whether or not subject to the Act, indicate that the
presence or absence of a restriction on free refundability has not
affected the number of bids received by an issuer at competitive bidding or the ability of the winning bidder to market the bonds. This
finding coincides with that described in the 27th Annual Report, at
pages 125-126, containing a summary of the results of an examination
of all electric and gas utility bond issues (including debentures) sold
at competitive bidding between May 14, 1957, and June 30, 1961, by
companies subject to the Act as well as those not so subject. This
study has been extended to include fiscal year 1962.
During the period from May 14, 1957, to June 30,1962, a total of
361 electric and gas utility bond issues, aggregating $7,838.6 million
principal amount, was offered at competitive bidding. The refundable issues numbered 273 and accounted for a total of $5,036.6million,
while the nonrefundable issues-all except one being nonrefundable
.. The slgnl1lcance of the refunding privilege. both as a matter of conformity with the

for a period of five years, and that one being nonrefundable for a
period of seven years-numbered 88 and totaled $2,802 million principal amount. The number of refundable issues thus represented 15.6
percent of the total number of issues, while, in terms of principal
amount, the refundable issues accounted for 64.3percent."
The weighted average number of bids received on the refundable
issues for the period. was 4.57, while on the nonrefundable issues it
was 4.20. The median number of bids was five on the refundable and
four on the nonrefundable issues." With respect to the success of the
marketing of the bond issues, an issue was considered to have been
successfully marketed if at least 95 percent of the issue was sold at
the syndicate price up to the date of termination of the syndicate. On
this basis, 73.3 percent of the refundable issues were successful, while
61.0 percent of the nonrefundable ones were successful." In terms of
principal amount, 70.8 percent of the refundable issues were successful, while 65.4 percent of the nonrefundable ones were successful."
Extension of the comparison to include the aggregate principal
amounts of all issues which were sold at the applicable syndicate
prices up to the termination of the respective syndicates, regardless
of whether a particular issue met the definition of a successful marketing, indicates that 88.2 percent of the combined principal amount of
all the refundable issues were so sold, as compared with 81.9 percent
for the nonrefundable issues." These statistics developed in respect
of the two groups of bond issues support the Commission's policy of
requiring free refundability of utility bond issues subject to the Act.
In connection with this policy of the Commission, it may be noted
that, on July 13, 1961, Brockton Edison Company, a public utility
subsidiary of Eastern Utilities Associates, a registered holding company, issued and sold, at competitive bidding pursuant to the requirements of Rule 50, a total of 40,000 shares of its $100 par value 5.48%
preferred stock at a dividend cost to the company of 5.44%. Approximately $3,264,000of the net proceeds from the sale of this preferred
stock was used by Brockton to redeem its outstanding $3,000,000par

$1,275.5

18 nonrefundable Issues totallng $673 million. The number of refundable issues represented
64.7 percent of all the issues, while, In terms of principal amount, the refundable issues
accounted for 47.2 percent.

In the 27th Annual Report, at page 126, reference was made to a
comprehensive study of redemption provisions of corporate bonds
being conducted at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce of
the University of Pennsylvania. The final results of this study were
publicly released by the Wllarton School during fiscal year 1962.32
The study, which covers the period 1926-1959 (including in certain
respects data extending to June 30, 1960), indicates that it was not
until the second half of the calendar year 1959 that some differences
appeared in interest costs as between immediately refundable bonds
and those carrying refunding restrictions. These differences, indicating somewhat lower interest costs on bonds having refunding restrictions, were found by the Wllarton School not to have been materialat least when measured against the advantage to the issuer of being
able to refund its bonds at any time. The Commission considers that
the Wharton School study supports the position of the Commission
that issuers of immediately refundable bonds have, on the whole, not
been penalized in the market place as compared with those issuers
which accepted a refunding restriction. In fact, the evidence appears
to point to the contrary, namely, that a refunding restriction does not
provide the issuer with a reduction in interest cost even approximating
what one might reasonably expect as being the financial equivalent of
a refunding restriction."

of a license to Pacific Northwest is being contested by certain Public
Utility Districts. After the close of the fiscal year an examiner of
the Federal Power Commission issued a decision and order, subject
to review, granting the license to Pacific Northwest. It is expected
that the company will now proceed with its application before this
Commission.
"Bottled

Gas" Companies

Unusual problems have arisen from time to time involving various
so-called "bottled gas" companies which distribute gas (usually propane or butane) in portable tanks or containers. A number of companies have aggressively expanded in this field by acquiring the capital
stocks o.f bottled gas companies which previously were operated
independently or by organizing new subsidiary companies to engage
in the business. One parent company, for example, recently had
about 150 such subsidiary companies and another had more than 70.
The operations of the subsidiaries are conducted in many different
States. So long as a company distributes gas only in portable containers, it is not a "gas utility company" as defined in the Holding
Company Act, and if all the subsidiaries of a parent company are
strictly "bottled gas" companies or other nonutility companies, the
parent company is not a "holding company" as defined in the Act.
However, some subsidiary companies in bottled gas systems have
changed their character by undertaking the distribution of liquefied
petroleum gas or natural gas at retail through pipes, thereby becoming "gas utility companies" within the meaning of the Act. The parent company of any such subsidiary automatically becomes a "holding
company," if it is not one already.
The staff of the Commission has found it necessary to observe
closely the operational changes which have been occurring in bottled
gas systems. Where changes of the kind described have been
observed, the staff has sought to assure that the parent company
either registers under the Act, or applies for an exemption from the
Act, if available.

PART VII
PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY
ACT
The Commission's role under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act,
which provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the
United States district courts, differs from that under the various other
statutes which it administers. The Commission does not initiate
Chapter X proceedings or hold its own hearings, and it has no authority to determine any of the issues in these proceedings. The Commission participates in such proceedings in order to provide independent, expert assistance to the court, the participants, and investors on
matters arising therein. Thus, the facilities of the Commission's
technical staff and its disinterested recommendations are placed at
the service of the judge and the parties in a highly complex area of
corporate law and finance. The Commission pays special attention
to the interests of public security holders, who may not otherwise be
effectively represented.
Where the scheduled indebtedness of a debtor corporation exceeds
$3 million, the judge under Section 172 of Chapter X must, before
approving any plan of reorganization, submit it to the Commission
for its examination and report. If the indebtedness does not exceed
$3 million, the judge may, if he deems it advisable to do so, submit
the 'Plan to the Commission before deciding whether to approve it.
Where the Commission files a report, copies or a summary must be
sent to all security holders and creditors when they are asked to vote
on the plan. The Commission has no authority to veto or require the
adoption of a plan of reorganization and is not obligated to file a
formal advisory report on a plan.
The Commission has lawyers, accountants and financial analysts in
its New York, Chicago and San Francisco regional offices who are
actively engaged in Chapter X cases in which the Commission has
filed its appearance. Supervision and review of the regional offices'
Chapter X work is the responsibility of the Division of Corporate
Regulation of the Commission, which, through its Branch of Reorganization, also serves as a field officein cases arising in the Atlanta
and Washington, D.C., regional areas.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

The Commission's activities in Chapter X this year increased over
the previous year and will probably be even more extensive in the
fiscal year 1963. In fiscal year 1962, the Commission actively participated in 64 reorganization proceedings involving 101 companies (64
principal debtor corporations and 37 subsidiaries of those debtors).'
The stated assets of these 101 companies totalled approximately $612,400,000 and their indebtedness totalled approximately $572,300,000.
The proceedings were scattered among district courts in 27 states and
the District of Columbia as follows: 9 proceedings in New York; 5
each in Illinois and California; 4 each in Maryland, Kentucky and
North Carolina; 3 each in Colorado, Oklahoma, Florida and Texas;
2 each in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada; and 1 each in Washington, Iowa, Virginia, Kansas, Georgia, New Jersey, Louisiana,
Wyoming, Indiana, Mississippi, Montana, Arizona, New Mexico,
Arkansas and the District of Columbia.
During the year, the Commission entered its appearance in 18 new
proceedings under Chapter X involving companies with aggregate
stated assets of approximately $108,292,000and aggregate indebtedness of approximately $85,786,000. They involved the rehabilitation
of corporations engaged in the operation of such varied businesses as
a deluxe resort hotel, real estate development, fertilizer plant, automobile race track, retail discount stores, :farmers cooperative, cement
manufacturing, chain food stores, heavy construction contracting,
mining, real estate and mortgage investment and machine products
manufacturing.
Proceedings involving 5 principal debtor corporations were closed
during the year. At the end of the year, the Commission was actively
participating in 59 reorganization proceedings involving 95 companies.
The Commission has not considered it necessary or appropriate to
participate in every Chapter X case. Apart from the excessive administrative burden, many of the cases involve only trade or bank
creditors and few public investors. The Commission seeks to participate principally in those proceedings in which a substantial public
investor interest is involved. However, the Commission may also
participate because an unfair plan has been or is about to be proposed,
the public security holders are not adequately represented, the reorganization proceedings are being conducted in violation of important
provisions of the Act, the facts indicate that the Commission can perform a useful service, or the judge asks the Commission to
participate.
'Appendix table 12 contains a complete list of reorganization proceedings in which the
Commission participated during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1962.

MATTERS

When it has participated in Chapter X proceedings, the Commission has urged upon the court the procedural or substantive safeguards
to which all parties are entitled. The Commission also has attempted
in its interpretations of the statutory requirements to encourage uniformity in the construction of Chapter X and the procedures thereunder.
In Oal-West Aviation, Ino./ the Court appointed as co-trustee the
president of the debtor, who was also a stockholder and director.
After he was advised that he was disqualified from serving as such
under Section 158(1) of Chapter X, he resigned but was retained as
general manager.
In Flora Sun Oorporation.: the Commission objected to the retention of the "additional trustee" on the ground that he was not disinterested. The additional trustee had, in effect, secured an option
to acquire control of the debtor on behalf of a corporation of which he
was president. However, the Court rejected the Commission's contention that retention of the trustee would be contrary to Section
158(4) of the Bankruptcy Act.
In Pickman Trust Deed Oorporation.» investors who had acquired
notes and second deeds of trust through the debtor were classified by
the Court as creditors, each secured by the deed assigned and allocated
to him. On this basis, the creditors supported certain compromises
proposed by the trustee and approved by the Court," After the time
for appeal had run, the trustee sought to have investors with unrecorded assignments reclassified as unsecured creditors. The Court
agreed with the Commission that the trustee was estopped since
investors had relied on the prior classification order.
The Court also accepted the view of the Commission that funds
received from investors and held in separate accounts pending investment should be treated as trust funds rather than general assets.
Since there was a deficiency in these accounts, the Court fixed the
manner of distribution by the adaptation of a formula approved by
Judge Learned Hand in In re Sohmidt.s

ance of its first mortgage on the debtor's assets. The Court adopted
the Commission's position that the costs of the Chapter X administration should be paid out of the mortgaged assets, and the Court of
Appeals denied the petition of the SBA for leave to appeal,"
TRUSTEE'S INVESTIGATION

A complete accounting for the stewardship of corporate affairs
by the old management is a requisite under Chapter X. One of the
primary duties of the trustee is to make a thorough study of the
debtor to assure the discovery and collection of all assets of the
estate, including claims against officers, directors, or controlling
persons who may have mismanaged the debtor's affairs. The staff
of the Commission often aids the trustee in his investigation.
In Texas Portland Oement Oompany,9 a comprehensive investigation by the trustees, assisted by the Commission's staff, led to a reduction in the debtor's total indebtedness from approximately $5,200,000
to about $3,150,000, and almost 215,000 shares of capital stock were
cancelled or surrendered. The plan of reorganization, confirmed by
the Court, provided for the subordination of the stock claims of certain of the debtor's directors who had not settled with the trustee.
In confirming the plan, the Court found that these directors had been
negligent "to the degree that it constitutes a breach of their fiduciary
duty in the management of the corporate affairs." 10
In Shawano Development Oorporationr? as the result of an investigation in which the staff of the Commission is participating, the
trustee has filed a plenary action in the United States District Court
in Jacksonville, Florida, against twenty-two named defendants, seeking compensatory damages in the amount of approximately
$3,000,000.12 In DePaul Educational Aid Sooiety,13 as previously
reported," both the Commission and the trustee urged that DePaul
University's first mortgage claim should be subordinated to that of
the public bondholders. A settlement was effected whereby DePaul
University agreed to reduce its claim by 45%.

ory report is prepared only in a case involving a substantial public
investor interest and presenting significant problems. On occasion,
because of the exigencies of time or for other reasons, no written
report is filed but, instead, Commission counsel is authorized to make
an oral or written presentation detailing the Commission's views.
In Windermere Hotel 00./5 the Commission filed an advisory
report on amended plans for the reorganization of the debtor, which
owned and operated the Windermere Hotel in Chicago. The trustee's
plan, as amended, which was sponsored by a bondholder, gave the
bondholders the alternative of receiving $70 in cash per $100 principal amount of bonds, or 5% 20-year subordinated debentures and
new common stock in exchange for the outstanding bonds. The
other plan, proposed by two bondholders named Shlensky, afforded
the bondholders the option of receiving either $70 in cash or $20 ill
cash plus $50 principal amount of new 5% 15-year first mortgage
bonds of the reorganized company for each $100 principal amount of
bonds then held. The Shlenskys would receive all of the common
stock of the reorganized company. Neither plan accorded the stockholders any participation.
The Commission concluded that both plans were fair, equitable and
feasible in their provision for cash payment to the bondholders, but
that the alternative proposals were not feasible, since no ceiling was
placed upon the proposed debt of the reorganized company and because of the failure of the proposals to provide adequately for the
payment of costs of administration and to include an undertaking by
the respective sponsors to make the cash payment to bondholders.
The proposal in the trustee's plan to issue securities was found in the
advisory report to be unfair since it failed to classify separately the
bondholders, other than the plan sponsor, for purposes of voting
thereon; to indicate clearly the manner of selecting directors; to establish a proper voting procedure; and to provide proper safeguards in
the provisions of the proposed indenture pursuant to which the new
debentures would be issued. The proposal to issue securities under
the Shlensky plan was found to be unfair because of its failure to
indicate the terms of the new first mortgage indenture and to limit
the amount of debt securities of the reorganized company.
The Shlensky plan, as amended, also proposed a public auction of
the debtor's stock and guaranteed a bid which would give the bondholders $70 per $100 principal amount of bonds. The trustee's plan
was amended to provide for a public auction of the debtor's assets at
a minimum upset price of $2,285,000. In its Supplemental Advisory
Report the Commission recommended that the prospective bidders

should be permitted to designate their preference as between a bid for
the debtor's assets directly or for appropriate new securities of a reorganized company, so that effective competitive conditions could be
maintained.
The Court approved the Referee's recommendation that only the
trustee's plan be approved. The Shlenskys filed a notice of appeal,
but dismissed their appeal when the Court of Appeals required them
to post a $2,000,000bond. At the public auction sale the plan sponsor
acquired the debtor's assets with a bid of $2,285,000.
In Texas Portland Oement Oompany,16 the Commission filed an advisory report recommending approval of a plan based upon the offer
of Alpha Portland Cement Company to purchase all of the debtor's
fixed assets and good-will for $4,250,000,to be paid partly in cash, and
the balance in debentures of Alpha and by the assumption of a large
claim allowed against the debtor. After payment of creditors' claims
in :full by cash and Alpha debentures, the remaining assets were to be
distributed to stockholders, other than those whose stock was to be
subordinated."
The plan was confirmed by the Court.
In TMT Trailer Fe1'1'"!fInc.,ls two plans for the reorganization of
the debtor were found worthy of consideration by the Court, and submitted to the Commission for its examination and report. One plan
provided for the internal reorganization of the debtor, vesting ownership and control in the unsecured creditors, the other for the sale of
the debtor's assets for cash. Neither plan accorded participation to
stockholders, since the debtor was said to be insolvent.
The Commission advised by letter that both plans were objectionable. In a memorandum, it was pointed out, inter alia, that the
evidence on valuation was not adequate to justify the exclusion of
stockholders, particularly since both plans allowed some $2,000,000
of seriously contested claims. The Commission also objected to the
provisions in the internal plan which would permit the trustee to
become the president of the reorganized company.
ACflVITIES

WITH REGARD TO ALLOWANCES

Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem of determining the allowance of compensation to be paid out of
the debtor's estate to the various parties for services rendered and
for expenses incurred in the proceeding. The Commission, which
under Section 242 of the Bankruptcy Act may not receive any allowance from the estate for the services it renders, has sought to assist

the courts in protecting debtors' estates from excessive charges and
at the same time in equitably allocating compensation on the basis of
the claimants' contributions to the administration of estates and the
formulation of plans. A summary of interesting developments follows:
In Mason Mortgage dbInoestment Oorp.,19 the trustee and his attorney filed applications for interim fees calculated on the basis of a
percentage of their estimate of the value of their services for the total
time devoted to the debtor's affairs. The Court held that it was impossible to determine what the value of any services rendered might
be until the proceeding had been completed, and that any interim
award based upon a percentage of a hypothetical amount assumed
by an applicant to be the reasonable or full value of the services rendered to date would be improper.
In the Ohamber of Commerce of the Oity of Newark/O a proceeding
in which the Commission was not participating, the Commission was
granted permission to file a memorandum and present oral argument,
amicus curiae, to oppose the petition of a firm of attorneys for the
debtor which sought the Court's approval of a prior transfer of the
debtor's bonds by a partner of the firm, as well as to oppose the firm's
petition for allowance for legal services. During the Chapter X proceeding, the partner, who was co-executor of his father's will, and a
beneficiary under the will, had sold $2,000 of the debtor's bonds
which his father had owned. The Commission urged, and the Court
agreed, that such sale was an absolute bar to compensation under
Section 249.
In Selected In/oestments Uorporatiorc" an attorney who had represented the debtor in the Chapter X proceeding and the debtor's two
principal officersin a pending action by the trustees against them for
an accounting, 22 requested an allowance of $35,000. The District
Court, in accordance with the Commission's recommendations, denied
the request on the grounds that the attorney's services were not of
benefit to the estate, and that he had represented conflicting interests.
After obtaining leave to appeal, 23 the attorney later moved to dismiss
his appeal, stating that he had accepted a $4,000 settlement from the
reorganized debtor. The Commission objected to the settlement on

that no compensxtion should be paid. The attorney's appeal from
such action was pending a t the close of the fiscal year.
I n Inland Gas
the Commission object,ed to the
application by a member of a committee for reimbursement of advances
to the committee attorney, because the committee member had traded
in the securities of one of the debtors in reorganization. The Commission argued that in Chapter X a committee xnd its attorney each
had autonomous standing to apply for compensation for services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incidental to such services,
and that in seeking recovery from the estate for advances to his
attorney, the committee member was requesting in effect to be subrogated to the attorney's rights. The commission further argued that
subrogation, as an equitable remedy, should not be permitted in this
case in view of the substantial trading by the committee member. The
District Conrt agreed and the Court of Appeals affirmed, stating that
"we do not think the District Judge erred in enforcing the public
policy inherent in the pro~<sionsof Section W9 of the Act:' and in
refusing to permit subrogation. 25
Appellant also argued that tlle Comu~ission was estopped from
/ reversing its o m prior recommedation that reimbursement be a l l o ~ e d .
The Court of Appeals held that the doctrine of equitable estoppel was
not applicable to the Commission's correction of a mistake of law and
that in any erent the Commission's prior vievs were not binding upon
thedistrict judge. The Conrt also noted the statement of the Commission that it "necessarily acts in the ligbt of its continuing experience
and that it vould be remiss in its duties if . . it failed to advise the
District Court of what it believes to be the correct view of the f a c k and

expressed a different view."

INTERVENTION IN CHAPTER XI PROCEEDINGS

Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act prorides a procedure by nhlch
debtors can effect arrangements with respect to their unsecured debts
under court supervision. Where a proceeding is brought under that
chapter but the facts indicate that it should hax-e been brought under
Chapter X, Section 328 of Chapter XI authorizes the Commission to
make application to the court to dismiss the Chapter XI proceeding
unless the dehtor:s petition is amended to comply with the requirements
of Cbapter X, or a creditors' petition under Chapter X is filed.

Davega Stores Corporation filed a petition for an arrangement
under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act in Fsbruary 1962.26 This
company is engaged in the sale of sporting goods, photographic equipment and electrical appliances through a chain of 25 retail stores in
the New York City area and concessions in discount centers in two
other states. Davega's convertible debentures and its preferr
common stocks are publicly held and listed on the America& ock
Exchange. The debtor had suffered substantial operating losses and
had undergone several changes in management since 1959, and several
attempts had been made to effect a merger or other hancial arrangements with outside interests. I n March 1962, the Commission fled

after lengthy hearings the motion mas gnnted by the Court. Thereafter, the indenture trustee for the convertible debentures Ned an involuntary Chapter X petition, the Chapter X petition was approved,
and a disinterested trustee was appointed.
In Cal-West Aviatwrz, Inc.,Z7the debtor, which owns and operates
an airport and associated facilities in San Mateo County, California,
filed a petition for an arrangement under Chapter XI. The Commission moved to dismiss the petition, urging that a thorough reorganization and an independent investigation into the acts of former
management were necessary and that Chapter XI did not provide
adequate means for snch a reorganization or proper safeguards &or
the interests of the debtor's 2,300 public investors. The debtor's
amended Chapter X petition was thereafter approved by the Court.

pending, the Chapter XI proceeding was dismissed and the bankruptcy proceeding was reinstated, thus rendering the appeal moot.
PUBUCATION OF BAR DATES

Substantial sums could be lost by public investors who fail to
exchange outstanding securities of corporations which have been
reorganized in recent years for new securities or cash distributable
pursuant to the plans for reorganization of such corporations. To
facilitate these exchanges, the Commission has published a list of
securities of 125 corporations which have been reorganized, informing
the public as to the cut-off or "bar date" after which the right to
exchange such securities for cash or new securities will be lost.29

ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF
1939
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes,
debentures and similar securities publicly offered for sale, except as
specifically exempted by the Act, be issued under an indenture which
meets the requirements of the Act and has been duly qualified with
the Commission. The Act requires that indentures to be qualified
include specified provisions which provide means by which the rights
of holders of securities issued under such indentures may be protected
and enforced. These provisions relate to designated standards of
eligibility and qualification of the corporate trustee to provide reasonable financial responsibility and to minimize conflicting interests.
The Act outlaws exculpatory provisions formerly used to eliminate
all liability of the indenture trustee and imposes on the trustee, after
default, the duty to use the same degree of care and skill "in the exercise of the rights and powers invested in it by the indenture" as a
prudent man would use in the conduct of his own affairs.
The provisions of the Trust Indenture Act are closely integrated
with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant
to the Securities Act of securities to be issued under a trust indenture
subject to the Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective
unless the indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter Act,
and necessary information as to the trustee and the indenture must
be contained in the registration statement. In the case of securities
issued in exchange for other securities of the same issuer and securities issued under a plan approved by a court or other proper authority
which, although exempted from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, are not exempted from the requirements of the Trust
Indenture Act, the obligor must file an application for the qualification of the indenture, including a statement of the required
information concerning the eligibility and qualification of the
trustee.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT
OF 1940
Companies primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities are subject to
registration and regulation under the Investment Company Act of
1940. This Act, among other things, prohibits such companies from
changing the nature of their business or their investment policies
without the approval of their stockholders, requires disclosure of
their finances and investment policies, regulates the means of custody
of the companies' assets, requires management contracts to be submitted to security holders for their approval, prohibits underwriters,
investment bankers, and brokers from constituting more than a
minority of the directors of such companies, and prohibits transactions between such companies and their officers, directors, and affiliates except with the approval of the Commission. The Act also
regulates the issuance of senior securities and requires face-amount
certificate companies to maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity
payments upon their certificates.
The securities of investment companies which are offered to the
public are also required to be registered under the Securities Act of
1933 and the companies must file periodic reports. Such companies
are also subject to the Commission's proxy rules and closed-end companies are subject to "insider" trading rules. The Division of Corporation Finance and the Division of Corporate Regulation both
assist the Commission in the administration of the statute, the former
being concerned with the disclosure provisions and the latter with
regulatory provisions.
COMPANIES REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT

As of June 30, 1962, there were 727 investment companies registered under the Act, including 78 small business investment companies, and the estimated aggregate market value of their assets on
that date was approximately $27.3 billion. These figures represent an
overall increase of 64 registered companies, but a decrease of roughly
$1.7 billion in the market value of assets compared with the corresponding totals at June 30, 1961.1 The total registered companies by
classification are as follows:

The increase in aggregate assets refiects the sale of new securities as well as capital appreciation. By
way of Illustration, the Investment Company Institute reported that during the 1iscal year ended June 30,

had net sales of their securities amounting to $2.1 billion.

TWENTY-EIGHTH
INSPECTION

ANNUAL REPORT

109

PROGRAM

In 1957 the Commission initiated a program for the periodic inspection of investment companies pursuant to the statutory authority conferred under Section 31 (b) of the Investment Company Act.
Under this program, 52 companies were inspected in fiscal 1962
in comparison with a total of 113 inspections in all prior years. While
the primary responsibility for making the inspections in fiscal year
1962 rested on the field offices, teams consisting of attorneys and
analysts from the Division of Corporate Regulation, as in previous
years, assisted the respective field offices in a number of instances.
It is expected that in the fiscal year 1963 most of the inspections will
be made exclusively by personnel of the field offices, which have
become increasingly familiar with the regulatory provisions applicable
to investment companies.
In recognition of the importance of the inspection program, a new
branch has been created in the Division of Corporate Regulation
charged with the responsibility of planning and supervising the
program, and reviewing the reports initially prepared by the field
offices.
A majority of the inspections made during the fiscal year brought
to light violations of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as well
as violations of other statutes administered by the Commission. While
many of the violations uncovered have been of a minor nature which,
when called to the attention of the investment company, its underwriter, or adviser, have been corrected by amending the company's
prospectus, filing additional documents or changing the company's
operations to comply with the law, serious violations have also been
disclosed. Instances were discovered in which the investment advisory contract was not renewed in accordance with the provisions of
Section 15 of the Investment Company Act with the consequence that
the investment adviser received money under a void contract. In one
such situation, the inspection and investigation which followed
resulted in an investment adviser returning a total of $250,000 in
settlement of claims by two investment companies which had been
making payments to the investment adviser under an invalid contract. In another instance, the inspection and investigation which
followed resulted in the resignation of the investment company's
officers and directors and the installation of a completely new interim
management.
In another situation, the inspection program uncovered such serious
violations of the Act that the Commission instituted an injunction
action, alleging, among other things, gross abuse of trust on the part

110

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of the officers and directors of that company," In addition, possible
serious violations of Section 17 of the Act and possible gross abuse
of trust have been uncovered in at least two inspections in which it
was found that officers and directors had been causing the company
with which they were associated to enter into transactions which
benefitted such officers and directors or other affiliated persons. At
the end of the fiscal year one of these cases was under active investigation and the other was being considered for possible injunctive
action.
STUDY OF SIZE OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES

Pursuant to Section 14(b) of the Act) the Commission engaged the
Securities Research Unit of the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce of the University of Pennsylvania to conduct a fact-finding
study of the problems created by the growth in size of open-end investment companies.
Data for the study were obtained by means of two comprehensive
questionnaires. The first was mailed in December 1958 to all active
registered open-end investment companies with gross assets of over
$1 million. It covered the 5,%-year period from December 31,1952 to
September 30, 1958, and analyzed the growth, organization and
control, investment policy, and performance of open-end investment
companies; their impact on securities markets; and the extent of their
control of portfolio companies. In 1960 the study was enlarged to include various aspects of the organizational, operating, and financial
relationships existing among the open-end investment companies and
their investment advisers and principal underwriters.
This further
area of study was surveyed by means of a second questionnaire, covering the year 1960, which was mailed in December 1960 to registered
open-end investment companies and their investment advisers and
principal underwriters.
Shortly after the close of fiscal year 1962, the Wharton School submitted its report to the Commission entitled "A Study of Mutual
Funds." The report was in turn transmitted to the Committee on
The
Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives,"

study concludes that there is little evidence that size per' se of individual funds or companies is a problem at the present time, and that
the more important current problems in the mutual fund industry appear to be those which involve potential conflicts of interest between
fund management and shareholders, the possible absence of arm'slength bargaining between fund management and investment advisers,
and the impact of fund growth and stock purchases on stock prices.
It found these problems to be unrelated to company size, except to the
extent that questions arise concerning the allocation between fund
shareholders and investment advisers of the benefits resulting from
large-scale operations.
The study found that the rates of turnover of portfolio securities
were inversely related to size of fund, with the smallest funds generally having the highest turnover rates throughout the period studied
and the largest funds the lowest turnover rates. It also found that,
on the average, the performance of the funds did not differ appreciably
from what would have been achieved by an unmanaged portfolio consisting of the same proportions of common stocks, preferred stocks,
corporate bonds, government securities, and other assets as the composite portfolios of the funds. About half of the funds performed
better, and half worse, than such an unmanaged portfolio.
With respect to the investment policies of mutual funds, the study found that
approximately 75 percent of the total net assets of the funds was held
in United States common stocks, and that at December 31, 1961 such
common stockholdings were equal to approximately 4% percent of
the value of all stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
With respect to portfolio company control, the study states that,
despite the growth of large holdings of mutual funds, outright control of portfolio companies by the funds is a rarity and is confined
mainly to small portfolio companies. It also concludes that the
growth in the funds' net purchases of common stock which accompanied the great extension of the mutual fund industry has probably
contributed significantly to the increase of stock prices over the past
decade. The study stated that there is some but not strong evidence
that net purchases by mutual funds significantly affect the month-tomonth movements in the stock market as a whole; and that there is
stronger evidence that fund net purchases significantly affect the daily
movements in the stock market, with the statistical data suggesting that
this latter effect may be fairly substantial.
In commenting upon the typical management structure of the industry under which a significant part of the funds' activities are performed by affiliated organizations such as advisers, underwriters and
brokers, who control or are represented on the boards of directors of

112

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the funds, the study draws attention to the potential for divided loyalties arising from these arrangements.
It also comments upon the role
of, and in general questions the effectiveness of, the "unaffiliated"
directors of the typical fund.
The study raises questions as to the relationship or lack of relationship between the growth, size and performance of funds and sales commissions and other sales incentives, and it questions whether the
apparent historical emphasis upon constantly increasing fund assets by
intensive sales efforts has always been in the interest of fund investors.
It also draws attention to the relationship or lack of it between growth,
size and performance of funds, on the one hand, and, on the other
hand, advisory fees and costs of operation of the funds and of the advisers, including fees charged by advisers to other clients. It states
that, for comparable asset levels, advisory fee rates charged mutual
funds tend to be substantially higher than those charged by the same
advisers to the aggregate of their clients other than investment companies. The study found that the expenses involved in advising
mutual funds were less than those incurred in advising other clients.
Inthe letter of transmittal to the Chairman of the House Committee
on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, the Chairman of the Commission pointed out that many of the practices of which the Wharton
School appears critical may be attributable to an industry structure
which is clearly contemplated by the Investment Company Act of
1940, but that many of the comments in the study implicitly raise
questions of broad policy whether some of the practices and patterns
which originated in an earlier time and under different conditions
and which have become conventional within the broad tolerances of
the Act should be reconsidered.
Accordingly, the Commission has
directed its staff to undertake a detailed analysis of the Wharton
School study, and on the basis of such analysis, together with consideration of material being developed in related Commission studies
now in progress, to make such recommendations to the Commission
regarding the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder as may seem appropriate.
The
Commission will then be in a position to determine and formulate
such legislative, rule and enforcement proposals, if any, as may be
desirable and thereafter to report to the Congress.
CURRENT

INFORMATION

The Commission's rules promulgated under the Act require that

The foregoing statistics do not reflect the numerous filings of
revised prospectuses by open-end mutual funds and unit investment
trusts making a continuous offering of their securities. These prospectuses, which must be checked for compliance with the Act, are
required to show material changes which have occurred in the operations of the companies since the last effective date of the prospectuses
on file. In this respect registration statements under the Securities
Act of 1933 covering securities of such companies are essentially
different from registration statements relating to the usual type of
corporate securities.
APPUCATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

Under Section 6 (c), the Commission, by rules and regulations,
upon its own motion or by order upon application, may exempt any
person, security, or transaction from any provision of the Act if
and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions
of the Act. Other Sections, such as 6(d), 9(b), 10(f), 17(b), and
23 (c), contain specific provisions and standards pursuant to which
the Commission may grant exemptions from particular sections of
the Act or may approve certain types of transactions. Also, under
certain provisions of Sections 2, 3, and 8 the Commission may determine the status of persons and companies under the Act. One of the
principal activities of the Commission in its regulations of investment companies is the consideration of applications for orders under
the sections referred to.
During the fiscal year, there were 221 applications under various
sections of the Investment Company Act before the Commission.
The sections of the Act with which these applications were concerned

Some of the more significant matters in which applications were
considered are summarized below:
The Commission denied an application by I'11JVestoT8DweTsified
Services, Inc. ("IDS")4 for an exemption from Section 18(j) (1) of
the Act which prohibits the issuance by a registered face-amount
certificate company of non-voting shares of stock. IDS has out.
standing some 879,000 shares of non-voting stock and 574,540 shares
of voting stock and, in order to effect a 10-for-one split of both classes
of stock, an exemption order was required as to the non-voting stock.
The Commission noted that the holders of the voting stock, who
owned only 39.52% of the proprietary interest in the company,
possessed 100% of the voting power, thus creating an inequitable
distribution of voting power. Applicant contended that since the
stock split would result in lowering the market price of the stock,
which ranged from $181 to $310 per share in 1961, it would create
a broader and more stable market. However, the Commission noted
that the split would also potentially enlarge the absolute number of
shareholders without voting rights, thereby furthering an inequitable
distribution of control contrary to the aims and purposes of the Act.
Commissioner Frear, in a separate opinion, concured in the denial
of the application for the stock split because it carried no assurance
that the non-voting stock would be eliminated to carry out the "basic
reforms of providing equal voting rights."
In a dissenting opinion, Commissioner Whitney expressed the view
that (1) the Act does not require the elimination of the non-voting
stock of IDS which was outstanding on the effective date of the ~Act,
• Investment

Company Act Release No. 8414 (April 21, 1I1U).

TWENTY-EIGHTH

ANNUAL REPORT

115

and (2) the stock split would only be a technical and formalistic
issuance of shares which would not have any aggravating effect on the
existing distribution of voting power. He concluded that an exemption was warranted under the statutory pattern contemplating
exemptions where the result would not be inconsistent with the
policies and purposes of the Act and where the adverse effect on the
market attributable to the existence of a relatively small supply of
IDS shares, coupled with a high unit price, would be relieved.
On June 11, 1962, pursuant to the provisions of Section 25 (b) of
the Act, the Commission invited interested persons to submit their
views with respect to the fairness of a plan of recapitalization proposed by IDS under which each share of non-voting stock would
become a share of voting stock. IS As of the end of fiscal 1962 no
definitive action had been taken by the Commission.
During the fiscal year applications were filed pursuant to Section
2(a) (9) of the Act by shareholders of Fundamentai Lnoestore, Ino.,
Investors Mutual, Imc., and Television-Electronics Fwnd, Ino., registered open-end investment companies, alleging that certain directors
who were represented to be unaffiliated with the respective investment advisers in fact had been and were now controlled by such
investment advisers. Prior to ordering a hearing on the factual
questions raised by the applications, the Commission directed that
the parties and other interested persons file briefs and reply briefs
with respect to certain specified common legal issues raised by the
applications,"
These issues relate to the Commission's jurisdiction,
power and duty under Section 2(a) (9) to determine that a natural
person, e.g., a director of a registered investment company, is controlled, and if so, under what circumstances, for what purposes and
with what effect. In addition the Commission requested that the
briefs consider the effect on its jurisdiction, if any, of the pendency
in courts of competent jurisdiction of suits allegedly involving the
same issues and parties, and also whether an investment company
shareholder is an "interested person" within the meaning of Section
2(a) (9) so as to have standing to file applications under that Section. Oral argument was held on these issues on June 14, 1962, and
the matter was under advisement at the close of the fiscal year.
After publication of the Commission's notice of the filing of the
above applications, an application was filed by a shareholder of AxeHoughton Fund B, Ino., seeking a determination by the Commission
pursuant to Section 2(a) (9) that certain directors of that investment
company are controlled by other directors who also allegedly COl1• Investment

trolled the investment company. Subsequent to the close of the fiscal
year this application was dismissed by the Commission on the ground
that it failed to state a basis for the requested determinations under
Section 2(a) (9). Applicant thereafter filed a petition to review the
Commission's action in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
The petition was dismissed on October 5, 1962.
The Commission's Annual Report for fiscal 1961 referred to an
application filed by The Prudential Insurance 00. of America for
exemption from the Act or, in the alternative, for exemption from
certain provisions thereof, in connection with its proposed plan for
the sale of variable annuity contracts," During fiscal year 1962 the
hearing inthis matter was completed, briefs were filed by the interested
parties, and oral argument was had before the Commission. At the
end of the fiscal year the matter was awaiting a decision by the Commission.

PART X
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT

OF 1940
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration of
persons engaged for compensation in the business of advising others
with respect to securities. Certain advisers are exempt from the
requirement of registration, including those who advise only investment companies or insurance companies and those who, within the
last 12 months, had fewer than 15 clients and who do not hold themselves out generally to the public as investment advisers. Furthermore, the registration requirements do not apply to an adviser whose
investment advice is given only to persons resident in the state in
which he maintains his principal place of business, as long as the
advice does not concern securities listed on a national securities
exchange or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on such an
exchange.
As discussed in the last Annual Report 1 Section 206 of the Act,
which prohibits certain unlawful practices by investment advisers,
was amended in September 1960 by the addition of subsection (4).
That subsection prohibits any investment adviser from engaging in
fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative acts or practices and gives the
Commission authority, by rules and regulations, to define and to
prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent such acts and practices. In accordance with this provision the Commission during the
fiscal year adopted Rule 206(4)-1, effective January 1, 1962,2 which
defines certain advertisements by investment advisers as fraudulent,
deceptive or manipulative. It also adopted Rule 206(4)-2, effective
April 2, 1962,3 which requires an investment adviser who has custody
of funds or securities of any client to segregate them, maintain them
in the manner provided in the rule, and to comply with other conditions specified in the rule.
Investment advisers who also effect transactions as brokers and
dealers must disclose any interest they may have in transactions
effected for clients if acting as an investment adviser with regard to
such transactions. The Act prohibits any investment adviser not

exempt from registration from basing his compensation upon a share
of the capital gains or appreciation of his client's funds. The Act
also makes it unlawful for any such investment adviser to enter into,
extend or renew any investment advisory contract or to perform such
contract if the contract provides for compensation to the investment
adviser on the basis of a share of capital gains or capital appreciation
of the funds or any portion of the funds of the client or fails to
provide that no assignment of such contract shall be made by the
investment adviser without the consent of the other party to the
contract.
Prior to the 1960 amendments, the Act did not require investment
advisers to keep and preserve books and records, nor was the Commission empowered to inspect books and records kept by investment
advisers. Section 204 of the Act, as amended, now requires every
investment adviser who is not exempt from registration to make, keep
and preserve such books and records as may be prescribed by the
Commission and empowers the Commission to inspect such books and
records. In accordance with this provision, the Commission adopted
Rule 204-2, effective July 1, 1961,. specifying the books and records to
be maintained by investment advisers.
Inspection procedures have been revised to obtain information
concerning compliance with the new rules. These rules are more
fully discussed in Part III of this report.
Investment advisers who violate any of the provisions of the Act
are subject to appropriate administrative, civil or criminal remedies.
With respect to administrative remedies, the Act provides, in Section
203(d), that the Commission shall deny, revoke, or suspend for not
more than 12 months, the registration of an investment adviser if
it finds that such action is in the public interest and that the investment adviser or any partner, officer, director or controlling or controlled person of the investment adviser is subject to a specified
disqualification. These disqualifications include willful misstatements in an application or report filed with the Commission, the
existence of a conviction or injunction based on or related to specified
types of misconduct, willful violation of any provision of the Securities Act, Securities Exchange Act or Investment Advisers Act or any
rule or regulation thereunder, or aiding and abetting any other
person's violation of such provisions, rules or regulations.
At the close of the fiscal year, 1836 investment advisers were registered with the Commission. The following tabulation contains statistics with respect to registrations and applications for registration

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS

During fiscal 1962, the Commission instituted revocation proceedings against six registered investment advisers and in another instance
instituted proceedings to determine whether an application for registration should be denied. These proceedings, and four revocation
proceedings previously instituted, were pending at the close of the
year. The proceedings instituted during the year included the
following:
Oarroll Tillman and John Francis Ryan, Jr. each doing business as
The Tillman Survey-The Commission instituted proceedings to determine whether the registrants had engaged in fraudulent and
deceptive acts including the distribution of advertising material
which was "lurid and flamboyant" contrary to Rule 206(4)-1 under
the Act and whether the public interest required that their registrations as investment advisers be revoked. The Commission's staff
charged that Tillman, aided and abetted by Ryan, published and distributed advertising material which contained untrue statements and
was false and misleading. The alleged misrepresentations in the advertisements involved comparisons between the securities recommended by Tillman and other securities without adequately disclosing
the material differences between the securities, and representations
that a list of 10 stocks which Tillman offered was selected in accordance with 7 tests prescribed by him and that these tests could "dig up"
securities which eventually could be enormously profitable.
The
staff charged that the advertising material created false and misleading impressions by referring to 25%, 50% and 100% increases in
market values, by falsely representing that certain subscription offers
were available only to a selected group and by guaranteeing that a
refund would be made to subscribers unless a group of 10 stocks rose
175 points before September 7, 1962, while omitting to disclose Tillman's complex and misleading method of determining the dates and
figures used in ascertaining the availability of such guarantee,"

PART XI
OTHER

ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION

CIVIL LITIGATION

The several statutes administered by the Commission authorize the
Commission to seek injunctions against continuing or threatened violations of such statutes.
Such violations may involve a wide range of
illegal practices, including the purchase or sale of securities by fraud,
and the sale of securities without compliance with the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. The Commission also participates
in various other types of proceedings, including appearances as
amicus curiae in litigation between private parties where it deems important that its views regarding the interpretation of the statutes be
furnished to the court.
At the beginning of the fiscal year 1962 there were pending in the
courts 96 injunctive and related enforcement proceedings instituted by
the Commission to prevent fraudulent and other illegal practices in
the sale or purchase of securities. During the year 89 additional proceedings were instituted and 80 cases were disposed of, leaving 105
such proceedings pending at the end of the year. In addition the
Commission participated in a number of corporate reorganization
cases under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, in 9 proceedings in the
District Courts under Section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act, and in 9 miscellaneous actions. The Commission also
participated in 50 civil appeals in the United States Courts of Appeals.
Of these, 14 came before the courts on petition for review of an administrative order, 9 arose out of corporate reorganizations in which the
Commission had taken an active part, 11 were appeals in actions
brought by or against the Commission, 2 were appeals from orders
entered pursuant to Section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and 10 were appeals in cases in which the Commission appeared as amicus curiae. The Commission also participated in 6
appeals or petitions for certiorari before the United States Supreme
Court resulting from these or similar actions.
Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared before
a Federal or state court during the fiscal year, either as a party or as
amicus curiae, and the status of such cases at the close of the year are
contained in the appendix tables. This section describes a few of the
more noteworthy cases, not including, however, any cases arising

under the Public Utility Holding Company .Act or Chapter X of the
Bankruptcy .Act; cases arising under those statutes are discussed in
the sections of this report dealing with such statutes.
In SE.O. v. Herbert Rapp, et al.,' the Commission sought a permanent injunction against Rapp, a registered broker-dealer, and certain
of his salesmen for violating Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act, by
making false and misleading statements in the offer and sale of the
stock of an aircraft manufacturing
company. The District Court,
after trial, dismissed the complaint for failure of proof, finding,
among other things, that expressions of opinion by salesmen that the
stock would soon increase significantly in value did not constitute a
material misrepresentation.s
The Court made no reference to the distribution of misleading sales literature, and it further apparently exIt also
onerated Rapp because he had made no oral representations.
denied the Commission's motion at the end of the trial, pursuant to
Rule 15 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure," to conform the
pleadings to the proof.
The Court of .Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District
Court, ordering that a permanent injunction issue as to Rapp and
remanding as to the salesman involved in the appeal.' The .Appellate
Court held that where the defendants failed to object to the trial of
issues not raised by the pleadings, the District Court was required
to grant the Commission's motion to conform the pleadings.
It
further held that since the salesmen had no know ledge of the securities
business and their statements were in accord with the sales literature
which Rapp instructed them to follow, the District Court erred in
stating that the latter was not responsible for the misrepresentations
made by them. Furthermore, it held that Rapp was responsible for
misrepresentations in a brochure mailed to prospective investors, and
that he also violated Section 17 (a) by leading customers to believe he
was acting as agent in the sale of the stock, when in fact he was acting
as principal. The action as to the salesman was remanded for further
proceedings since the findings of fact were insufficient to determine
whether his predictions of future value were opinions without basis
in fact.
In S.E.O. v. Ouster Ohannel Wing Oorporation, et al.5 the Commission sought to enjoin an issuing corporation, its president and a
trustee from offering and selling securities without registration in
violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act, and from engaging in
practices operating as a fraud upon purchasers in violation of SecS.D.N.1:. No. 132-344.

tion 17(a) of that Act. Defendants had represented that treasury
shares of the corporation were available for sale. However, as to
those treasury shares which were sold, no registration statement was
in effect, and other shares sold were not treasury shares but shares
which had been placed in a trust by the president. By the terms of
the trust, the shares were to be returned to the president within 1 year
or, if the shares were sold, the proceeds were to be paid over to him
within 2 years and in the interim they were to be loaned to the corporation. These shares were also unregistered. Rejecting the defendants' contention that the shares sold were exempt from registration
because they had at one time been sold as part of an intrastate distribution exempt from the registration requirements by Section
3 (a) (11) of the Act, or as part of a small issue exempt under Section
3(b) and Regulation A thereunder, the District Court declared that
the exempt status of the securities did not continue indefinitely or, as
claimed by the defendants, until such time as there was a fundamental
change in the corporate structure. The Court stated that once such
stock came into the hands of the issuer or persons controlling the
issuer, its subsequent offering constituted a new issuance as to which
the registration requirements again became applicable. The District
Court also found violations of Section 17(a) of the Act, in the sale of
the trust shares to investors accepting the offer of treasury shares,
holding that disclosure should have been made regarding the existence of the trust and the fact that under its terms the money received
for the shares was to be loaned to the corporation, such loan to be
secured by a chattel mortgage on airplanes manufactured by it.
In S.E.C. v, Federal Shopping Way, !rw.,s where the Commission
charged numerous defendants with violations of the registration and
anti-fraud provisions, the defendants sought leave to file a counterclaim against the Commission and to join Seven named Commission
employees as llarties to such proposed counterclaim. The 'Proposed
counterclaim alleged that defendants had been defamed and tortiously
aggrieved by statements contained in Commission litigation releases
and statements made by Commission employees during their conduct
of investigations, and sought damages and injunctive relief. The
Court denied defendants such leave, holding that "Federal officials are
privileged against suit for acts done within the scope of their official
duties," and "(e) xamination of the record and the proposed crosscomplaint clearly shows that the alleged misconduct . . . . (of defendants to the counterclaim) entirely consists of actions wholly
within the course and scope of their official duties."

Chapter X, which provides an exemption for "any transaction ill any

It 'was the 'Commission's view, on the 'other

However, the COmmission's 'attempts to raise the issue 'Were nnsueoessful. The Commission :first moved to intervene in the Chapter
K proceedings, but the District Court denied the motion. Thereafter,
it sought to enjoin the ;proposed distribution, but the Court dismissed
the injunctive action. In an opinion issued later, the Court assigned
R1'l one .ground for its orders that the Commission's actions were not
timely. It also indicated that it considered the distribution Of the
hew stock to be exempt.
On appeal by the Commission, the Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit, without reaching the SUbstantive issue, affirmed solely on the
ground that the trial court had not abused its discretion in ruling
that the Comtnission's actions were not timely." The Appellate
Court's opinion did expressly reject the intimation Of the District
Court that the nonregistration of stock could be excused on the basis
that the time requirements of registration would be inimical to a
proposed plan of reorganization.
Of significance in the opinion,
also, is the Appellate Court's implicit agreement that an application
to intervene by the Commission as the agency administering
the
Securities Act was the proper method of raising the issue of registration; wholly apart from the Commission's role as Chapter X adviser,

class exceeds $2 million, its undertaking to file reports becomes and
remains operative, and the fact that the value of those shares actually

in solicitation of proxies which were to be voted at the 1961 annual
stockholders' meeting. After entering orders temporarily enjoining
further solicitation, the voting of proxies already obtained and the
holding of any stockholders' meeting, the District Court upon trial
held that the failure of the Committee to disclose the full extent of the
participation of two resigned officers and directors of the corporation
in the organization of the Committee and its solicitation of proxies
violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and

in the solicitation of proxies,"
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit modified and affirmed the order enjoining proxy solicitation
by the Committee unless the activities of the two former officers were
disclosed and enjoining the voting of proxies already obtained."
The
enjoined defendants petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of
certiorari, asserting that Section H(a) of the 1934 Act, as applied
through the Conunission's proxy rules, is constitutionally objectionable
as being so vague and ambiguous as to constitute an unauthorized
delegation of legislative powers and as invading rights of free speech
and contract, and that the District Court could not enjoin the voting
of proxies obtained through unlawful solicitation where an opportunity for resolicitation was allowed. The Commission filed a brief in
opposition, pointing out that the terms of the statute are comparable
to many other statutory provisions which have been held to be
sufficiently definite, that the Commission has no power of "censorship"
over proxy material and that an injunction against voting proxies
obtained through unlawful solicitation is relief traditionally ancillary
to the restraint against continued violation of the proxy rules. Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, the Supreme Court denied
certiorari.l6a
In Brown, Barton & Engel v, S.E.O.,l1 the Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit denied a motion to stay the enforcement of a
Commission order suspending petitioner's registration as a broker
and dealer pending final determination of the issue as to whether such
registration should be revoked. The suspension order had been
issued on the basis of the Commission's findings that petitioner had
engaged in a fraudulent course of conduct and was subject to two
injunctions. Court review of the Commission's decision was pending
at the close of the fiscal year.
In Hansen v, S.E.O.,lS plaintiff sought to enjoin the Commission

his papers and that publication of the Commission's order instituting
proceedings against the broker-dealer caused him irreparable injury.

judgment on the pleadings.
Two cases, Berko v. SE.O.,l. and Kahn Y. S.E.O.,20 arose from
an order issued by the Commission revoking the broker-dealer registration of Ml.I.CRobbins & Co., Inc. and finding that nine salesmen,
including Berko and Kahn, were each a cause of the revocation, 21
Mac Robbins had been co-underwriter of an issue of stock of Sports
Arenas, Ine., and after the offering had been completed, its principal
business was trading in Sports Arenas stock. The Commission found
tha.t Berko and Kahn had made highly optimistic statements about
Sports, although they knew that there was no adequate basis for such
statements or were "grossly careless or indifferent" in fa.iling to
determine whether or not such basis existed.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit remanded the cases to
the Commission, on the ground that the factual and legal basis for
the Commission's decision was not stated with sufficient clarity.
A.mong other things, it held that the fact that the issuer had sustained initial operating losses did not in and o.f itself mean that there
was no adequate basis for optimistic statements regarding the stock.
The Court asked the Commission to express its views, among other
things, regarding the significance of participation by salesmen in
a so-called "boiler-room" operation, the right of salesmen to rely on
information given to them hy their employer, and the extent to
which the salesmen's specialization in Sports stock created or increased
the duty to investigate and disclose.
Judge Clark, concurring in the result, concluded that the 'Commission had not made clear whether it relied upon the so-called
"shingle" theory or some other legal theory.
Shortly after the close 6f the fiscaJ; year, the Commission issued
an Opinion and Order reaffirming its previous findings that Berko
and Kahn were each a cause of the revocation (Securities Exchange
Act Release No. 6846 (July 11, 1002)}. In September 1962, Berko
filed a petition for review in the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit. Kahn has not sought such review, and the statutory period

Silver brought an action for damages and injunctive relief alleging
violations of the anti-trust laws. The District Court granted Silver's
motion for summary judgment, permanently enjoining the Exchange
under Section 16 of the Clayton Act from interferring with private
wire and telemeter connections between its members and Silver and
holding that the Exchange was liable for damages under Section 4
of the Clayton Act. The Exchange appealed from this decision and
the Commission, because of language in the opinion of the District
Court suggesting that a registered stock exchange has no right or
duty to discipline its members on the basis of their transactions in
unlisted securities, filed a memorandum as amicus curiae. The Court
of Appeals reversed, 28 holding that "the action of the Exchange
in bringing about the cancellation of the private wire connections
with members of the Exchange was within the general scope of the
authority of the Exchange as defined by the 1934 Act and therefore
outside the coverage of the Sherman Act," and expressly rejecting
the suggestion that the authority of the Exchange in disciplining its
members is limited to transactions in securities listed on the Exchange.
Silver's petition for a writ of certiorari is pending in the Supreme
Court.24
In the last Annual Report, the case of Blau v. Lehman was
described and it was stated that the Supreme Court had granted
certiorari.25
That was a derivative suit by a stockholder of Tidewater
Associated Oil Company against an investment banking partnership
to recover "short swing" profits realized by the firm through transactions in Tidewater's securities while one of the partners was serving
on the company's board of directors. The Supreme Court 26 affirmed
the decrees of the Court of Appeals 21 and the District Court 28 which,
while awarding the plaintiff a judgment for that portion of the
defendant's profits which were chargeable to the partner-director's
income account, refused to hold that the firm itself violated Section
16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, thus permitting the firm to
retain over 96 percent of its "short swing" profits. The Court took
cognizance of the Commission's position, as advocated in its amious
curiae brief, that while the literal language of Section 16(b) limited
liability to "directors," considerations of policy were present which
made it appropriate to expand that Section to cover partnerships
of which a director is a member. However, the majority was of the
opinion that if Section 16(b) were to be so expanded, it should be

accomplished by remedial legislation, rather than by judicial construction. In a strong dissent, charging that the majority opinion
resulted in a ". . . mutilation of the Act," Justice Douglas, with
whom Chief Justice Warren concurred, stated that there should be
no difficulty in charging the partnership with liability as an "insider"
in cases where it is determined, as a factual matter, that the partnership has either "deputed" or informally instructed its partner to
represent its interests on the corporate board of directors.
At the request of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, the Commission filed a memorandum of law
as amicus curiae in Silverman v. Landa and Fruehauf Trailer 00.29
The action was brought by a stockholder of Fruehauf to recover on
behalf of Fruehauf the profits realized by defendant Landa, a director
of the company, in transactions in Fruehauf common stock. While
the beneficial owner of 2000 shares of Fruehauf common stock, Landa
had issued simultaneously two "call" options and one "put" option,
each for 500 shares. Plaintiff claimed that the issuance by the
defendant of a "straddle," i.e, the simultaneous issuance of a put
option and a can option, constituted a purchase and sale of the underlying security for the purposes of Section 16 (b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and that the issuance of the unmatched call
violated Section 16 (c) of the Act, since the underlying security was
not delivered within 20 days of the date of the issuance of the call.
The Commission took the position that the issuance of a straddle
constituted a purchase and sale of the underlying security for the
purpose of Section 16 (b) of the Act, but that no violation of Section 16 (c) occurred since the defendant at all times owned sufficient
shares of the underlying security to deliver in satisfaction of any
obligation under the unmatched call. However, the District Court
held that no purchase or sale of the underlying security occurs until
such time as the options are exercised, and accordingly found no
liability under Section 16(b) and no violation of Section 16(c).
The case was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the Commission filed a brief as amicus curiae, taking the
same position it took in the District Court. Subsequent to the end
of the fiscal year, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the
District Court.so

whom plaintiff's shares were pledged, went into receivership and
such shares were not among the assets.
Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, contending that the
facts alleged in the complaint failed to set forth a cause of action.
The Commission filed a brief amicus curiae urging that the plaintiff
was entitled to rescission or to recover damages because the contract
for the purchase of securities was in violation of the Act and hence
void under Section 29 (b) . Alternatively, the Commission argued that
the plaintiff had an implied private right of action against the brokerdealer for the latter's violation of the margin requirements where the
losses were not caused by fluctuation of the market, but by the insolvency of the moneylender selected by the broker.
The Court denied the motion to dismiss, accepting the positions
urged by the Commission, and the suit was subsequently settled by
compromise.
The case of S.E.O. v. Oapital Gain8 Research Bureau, Inc., is
described in the last Annual Report."
The Commission had charged
an investment adviser and its president with violating Sections 206 (1)
and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act. The trial court's denial of
a preliminary injunction" was affirmed by a divided panel of the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit," and the Commission
petitioned for a rehearing en bane which was granted.

tigative power during the pendency of broker-dealer revocation
proceedings.
In Amos Treat the plaintiff sought to enjoin the Commission from
continuing broker-dealer revocation proceedings, claiming that one
of the members of the Commission who had participated in several
preliminary rulings was disqualified from adjudicating in the case
because he had previously been Director of the Commission's
Division of Corporation Finance at a time when that Division had
investigated a matter factually related to the administrative proceeding. It was claimed that his participation violated due process
and Section 5(0) of the Administrative Procedure Act. The District
Court denied plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction on the
grounds that the administrative remedies had not been exhausted,
review of any final decision could be had in a court of appeals, and
there was no showing of irreparable injury. The Court of Appeals
reversed and remanded the case,39 holding that there had been a
showing of a violation of due process and that the District Court had
jurisdiction on this basis alone. The Commission's petition for
rehearing en bono was denied.
The Commission, following an alternative suggestion of the
Court of Appeals, thereafter terminated the proceedings, but without
prejudice to the subsequent institution of new proceedings. In its
order, the Commission made it clear that this result should not be
regarded as a precedent since the Commission disagreed with the
Court's decision, but that the Commission was of the view that to
seek further court review would entail delay in the determination of
the issues in the proceedings and would not be in the public interest.
The H olmasi case involved the same contention as in Amos Treat,
in this instance regarding two members of the Commission, and the
additional contention that the hearing examiner who had presided
at the administrative hearings was also disqualified because he lacked
the requisite independence from the Commission since he had passed
the age of mandatory retirement and served at the will of the Commission. The District Court granted plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, basing its order solely upon the participation of
one of the members of the Commission and relying entirely upon the
Amo8 Treat case. The Commission's appeal from that order is

pending.v

Midwest Tealmical Development Oorp., et al.,u the Commission
brought an injunctive action alleging that the directors and officers
of the defendant investment company had caused it to violate various
provisions of the Investment Company Act and were committing gross
misconduct and gross abuse of trust. The complaint contains detailed
charges of simultaneous personal investments by several of the officers
and directors in the portfolio companies in which Midwest invested,
resulting in large private profits for them to the detriment of the
fund's interests.
The Commission seeks not only to enjoin the various violations,
but to freeze the private investments of the individual defendants to
prevent further deterioration of the situation, to obtain an accounting
for profits and to have a receiver appointed to preserve the public
interest in Midwest.
All of the individual defendants have entered stipulations agreeing
not to change their present investment position in the portfolio companies, pending trial on the merits. Upon the filing of these stipulations, the Commission withdrew its motion for a preliminary injunction. The Commission has dismissed the case against two corporate
defendants which have entered final stipulations undertaking not to
engage in any transactions with Midwest without first obtaining an
exemption under Section 17(a) of the Investment Company Act.
The case with respect to the remaining defendants was pending at
the close of the fiscal year.
In Ohabot v, Empire Trust 00. and Schwartz v. National Securities
Se1"lJwe,42the shareholders of a mutual fund, organized as a common
law trust, brought an action against the trustee and others for restoration to the fund of fees paid to the trustee. The trustee moved to
stay the proceedings until the plaintiffs had delivered a bond to
indemnify it against the cost and expenses of defending the action.
The District Court 43 held applicable the provision of the trust agreement to the effect that no shareholder of the fund should have the
right to an accounting except upon furnishing indemnity to the
trustee against costs and expenses, with such indemnity to be payable
unless it should be established that the trustee had been guilty of
fraud, misfeasance, or gross negligence. The District Court therefore stayed the action pending the posting of security.
On appeal from that decision, the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit upheld the right of appeal from the order of the District

curiae expressing the view that the provision of the trust agreement
requiring the posting of the security before the shareholders could
commence their action was void under Section 17(h) of the Investment Company .Act, which prohibits an investment company from
operating under any instrument which contains "any provision which
protects or purports to protect any director. . .."
The Court of
Appeals agreed with the Commission's position and reversed the District Court, holding that the indemnity provision was violative of
Section 17(h) and further stating that "any provision that renders
litigation substantially less likely 'protects or purports to protect'
directors and officers from liability under the .Act," and is therefore
invalid."
During the year progress was made in another case involving
implied private rights of action under the Investment Company Act,
At the time of the last Annual Report, the Commission had filed
a brief supporting the petition for certiorari in Brouk v. Managed
Funds, contending that the Court of Appeals decision in that case
was in conflict with numerous court of appeals and district court
decisions holding that the Investment Company Act gives rise to
implied private rights of action." Subsequently the Supreme Court
granted certiorari." and the Commission filed a brief on the merits.
However, before oral argument in the Supreme Court, the companion
state court case 48 was settled by, among others, the respondents before
the Supreme Court, for an amount in excess of $1 million. The
Supreme Court, in a per curiam opinion, mooted the case, vacated
the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (whose
reversal the Commission had urged), and remanded the case to the
District Court for dismissal as to the respondents who were before
the Supreme Court on certiorari."
While no final Supreme Court
decision on the existence of implied rights of action was obtained, the
opinion of the Court of Appeals to the contrary was vacated, and its
value as contrary precedent nullified.
Willheim v. Murchison 50 was a case brought both derivatively and

automatically terminated when control of Alleghany Corporation,
which held approximately 47.6 percent of the voting stock of IDS,
passed from Allan P. Kirby to John D. Murchison and his associates
as a result of a proxy contest. The District Court, in denying the
request for a preliminary injunction, rejected this contention and,
while not grounding its decision on this point, indicated that a transfer of a controlling block of Alleghany voting stock would be insufficient to cause termination of the contracts.
Plaintiffs took an appeal from this decision, and the Commission
filed a brief amiou« curiae urging the Court of Appeals, if it should
reach the merits, to hold that an investment advisory contract is automatically terminated whenever a controlling block of stock of the
investment adviser or of a corporation which controls the investment
adviser is transferred.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of the preliminary injunction, holding that neither the plantiff nor the corporation would
suffer irreparable injury by delay until a hearing on the merits, but
that a sudden termination of the service contracts would precipitate
corporate chaos. Since the merits were not reached, the Court reserved its decision with respect to the position urged by the CommisSIOn.

In Nadler v, 8E.0., the earlier history of which is discussed in the
1961 Annual Report," the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit 52
affirmed in a per curiam opinion the Commission's order refusing to
revoke a previous order granting an exemption pursuant to Section
17(b) of the Investment Company Act for transactions between a
registered investment company and certain affiliates and permitting
it to acquire its own preferred stock pursuant to Section 23(c) (3) of
the Act.
A stockholder had sought review of the Commission's second order
on the ground that the investment company's directors who had authorized the filing of the application for the exemption had not been
elected in accordance with the provisions of Section 16(a) of the Act,
contending that this made the application and the Commission order
void. The Commission had held that the acts of the directors were
voidable only and that under all the circumstances the order should
not be revoked.
The Court, in affirming, held that there is no basis for declaring
void all acts by a board not chosen as required by Section 16(a), and

enjoined the advisers and Wellington Equity Fund from -employing

the word "Wellington"
resulting from the successful operacion 'Of

found pendent jurisdiction, stating that Section 35(d) of the Investment Company Act conferred an implied private right of action, and
based its decision on common law principles of unfair competition.
Both sides have appealed. The plaintiffs assert that the facts show
violations of Sections 15, 20(a), 34(b), 35(d), 36 and 31 1)£ the Investment Company Act, and claim that implied rights 'of action and

appearing in this appeal as amicus curiae, and has filed a brief which
takes the position that implied rights of action flow from violations
of provisions of the Investment Company Act, including Section 36.

CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

The statutes administered by the Commission provide that the Commission may transmit evidence of violations of these statutes to the
Attorney General, who, in turn, may institute criminal proceedings.
The regional offices and, at times, the main office of the Commission
prepare, after investigation, detailed reports where the facts appear
to warrant criminal prosecution. After careful review by the General Counsel's Office, the recommendations of the regional offices
and the General Counsel's Office are considered by the Commission
and, if the Commission believes criminal prosecution is appropriate,
the case is referred to the Attorney General and to the appropriate
United States Attorney.
Commission employees familiar with the
case generally assist the United States Attorney in the presentation
of the facts to the Grand Jury, the preparation of legal memoranda
for use in the trial, the conduct of the trial, and the preparation of
briefs on appeal. The Commission also submits parole reports prepared by its staff relating to convicted offenders.
During fiscal 1962, the Commission referred more cases to the Department of Justice for prosecution than in any other year in the
Commission's history. In addition to the 60 cases referred for prosecution, 4 cases were referred for institution of criminal contempt
proceedings for violations of injunctive decrees secured by the Commission in civil actions. As a result of these and prior referrals, 42
indictments were returned against 205 defendants during the fiscal
year. There were also 67 convictions in 20 cases. Convictions were
affirmed in 2 cases, and appeals were still pending in 13 other criminal
cases at the close of the period. Of 4: criminal contempt cases handled during the year, 1 case was dismissed and 3 cases are still pending.
From 1934, when the Commission was established, until June 30,
1962,3,187 defendants have been indicted in the United States District
Courts in 710 cases developed by the Commission and 1,577 convictions
have been obtained. The record of convictions obtained and upheld
in completed cases is over 86 percent for the 28-year life of the
Commission."
As in prior years, the majority of the criminal cases prosecuted
involved the offer and sales of securities by fraudulent representations
and other fraudulent practices. These activities included high-pressure long-distance telephone "boiler-room" frauds, conversion of

customers' funds and securities by broker-dealers or their salesmen,
frauds involving the sale of securities by new as well as established
businesses, and fraudulent securities sales relating to the promotion of
insurance companies, mortgage companies, oil and gas and other
mining ventures, alleged inventions and other spurious investment
schemes. Because of the large volume of cases, it is impossible to
report in detail all the criminal matters, but some of the more
important and novel fraudulent devices and techniques are described
in the specific cases discussed below.
The past fiscal year has seen the culmination of the Commission's
intensive investigations and prosecutions of a large number of fraudulent mortgage and trust deed promotions. The principal and perhaps
the largest of these promotions was the subject of the prosecution in
United States v. David Farreli et al, (S.D. CaL). In that case some
9,000 investors paid in excess of $40 million into an alleged "Secured
10% Earnings Program" by purchasing securities of the Trust Deed &
Mortgage Exchange, Los Angeles Trust Deed & Exchange, Trust
Deed & Mortgage Markets, and Colorado Trust Deed & Mortgage
Markets. David Farrell and Oliver J. Farrell were convicted on 32
counts of violating the anti-fraud provisions of the securities acts
and the Mail Fraud Statute by falsely representing that investors
were assured of 10% earnings and a degree of liquidity equivalent to
that of insured bank deposits or insured savings and loan certificates,
and failing to disclose that the issuing companies were insolvent and
that funds entrusted to them by investors were in constant jeopardy.
David Farrell received a 10 year jail sentence and was fined $86,000;
Oliver J. Farrell was sentenced to 4 years in jail and was fined
$52,000.56

Numerous convictions also have been obtained and several indictments are pending in the Southern District of Florida, in similar cases
involving the "8% racket," the sale of unregistered mortgage notes to
the public by fraudulently guaranteeing interest payments of between
8 and 15 percent. "Interest" was normally paid from capital contributed by purchasers of mortgage notes and not from income derived
from operations.
As a result of the extensive prosecutions, this type of promotion
seems to have been substantially eliminated. Among the convictions
obtained were those of five defendants in United States v. Joseph A.
Peel, Jr., who were each sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment for violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Mail Fraud Statute in the sale of 8% notes of Insured Capital Corporation of Orlando, Florida. These defendants had received more

than a quarter of a million dollars from public investors. In another
case, United States v. Gradsky, et al., 10 defendants were convicted
shortly after the close of the fiscal year of violating the anti-fraud
provisions of the Securities Act and the Mail Fraud Statute in the
promotion and sale of 8% and 12% short-term notes of Credit Finance
Corporation, and received prison sentences ranging from 6 to 20 years.
This past fiscal year has seen a substantial number of cases involving
manipulation of securities on national stock exchanges or in the overthe-counter market. In United States v. Talenfeld (W. D. Pa.), Edward H., Maurice A. and Burton M. Talenfeld were adjudged guilty
of manipulating the market price of Cornucopia Gold Mines stock on
the American Stock Exchange to aid distribution of their own shares
of Cornucopia in the over-the-counter market. Maurice and Burton
Talenfeld received I-year sentences and were each fined $10,000.
Edward H. Talenfeld was fined $7,500. Charles C. Bales and John C.
Buckley, Jr., among others, pleaded guilty and nolo contendere in
United States v, Bales (W.D. Ky.), to manipulating the market price
of the stock of Cardinal Life Insurance Co., and concealing this and
other facts from investors to whom they distributed over 71,000shares
of their own Cardinal stock. The defendants were fined amounts up
to $15,000 and placed on probation.
In United States v, Garfield, et al. (S.D.N.Y.), still in progress at
the close of the fiscal year, 22 individuals and 7 broker-dealer firms
were charged with manipulating the market price of the common stock
of United Dye and Chemical Corporation, and with distributing this
stock in violation of the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. A number of the defendants have entered pleas of guilty during
the trial. Sentencing has been deferred until its completion. Some
of the same defendants and others are charged, in United States v.
Garfield, et al. (S.D.N.Y.), with fraud and market manipulation in
connection with the sale of more than 5 million shares of Shawano
Development Corporation stock to the public through J. H. Lederer
Company, Inc., by means of an intensive telephone sales campaign
utilizing false and misleading statements and literature.
Manipulation on the San Francisco Mining Exchange was the basis
of two indictments returned near the close of the fiscal year. In
United States v. McDaniel (S.D. Tex.), Paul E. McDaniel, George A.
Mellen and others are charged with manipulating the market price of
Ambrosia Minerals stock to facilitate the fraudulent distribution of
their own stock. George J. Flach, president of the Exchange, is
named as a co-conspirator but not as a defendant. And in United
States v. Oarroll (S.D. Calif.), the defendants are charged with
manipulation and fraudulent sale of the stock of Comstock, Ltd.

138

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In addition to the Ambrosia Minerals and Comstock promotions
noted above, a number of other oil, gas and mining ventures provided,
as in past years, a fertile field for fraudulent stock promotions .
.Among the cases involving such promotions was United States v.
Oolumbus ReaJallOonsolidated Mine 00. (S.D. Fla.), where Irwin C.
Glaser and 12 other defendants were found guilty of merging various
corporations with insubstantial or spurious assets into Columbus Rexall, issuing over 12 million shares to themselves or associates, manipulating the price of the stock upwards on the Salt Lake Stock Exchange, and distributing large blocks of the stock to the public through
"boiler-room" tactics.
A number of broker-dealers and securities salesmen were convicted
in the past year for converting either their customers' securities or
funds obtained from the sale of these securities. Thus, in United
States v. Pruett, (N.D. Ga.), Carl and Gertrude Pruett were each convicted and sentenced to 9 years imprisonment for converting securities
and funds belonging to customers, totaling about one and a half million dollars. In United States v. Ficken (N.D. Ohio), the defendant
was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment after pleading guilty to
charges of converting clients' funds by "bucketing" their orders.
A number of indictments have been returned in the Southern District. of New York against Lowell M. Birrell and his associates charging fraud, manipulation and registration violations. In United States
v. Gerardo A. Be (S.D.N.Y.), it is alleged that Birrell and others, including Jerry and Gerard Re in their capacity as specialists on the
American Stock Exchange, manipulated the price of Swan-Finch
Oil Company stock on that Exchange while distributing large unregistered blocks of the stock to the public through "boiler-rooms"
and the Exchange at artificially inflated prices.
In United States v. J. A. Winston & 00., Inc. (S.D.N.Y.), Joel
Alfred Winston, Birrell and others are charged with the manipulation and sale of unregistered stock of Jeanette Minerals, Ltd. The
indictment alleges that while Birrell and other defendants manipulated the price of Jeanette stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange,
Winston distributed 400,000 shares beneficially owned by Birrell to
the American public through J. A. Winston & Co. The same defendants are also charged with fraud and registration violations in connection with the sale of the stock of American LeDuc Petroleums,
Ltd. in United States v. Albert Bernstein, et ale (S.D.N.Y.). The
indictment alleges that Birrell and the other defendants fraudulently
distributed to the public, through J. A. Winston & Co., over 3 million
unregistered shares of American LeDuc. Winston, J. A. Winston
& Co. and others are also charged with violating the registration

TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT

139

and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in fraudulently distributing over 600,000 shares of Canuba Manganese Mines,
Ltd. stock to the public.
Morris Mac Schwebel, an attorney who has been barred from practicing before this Commission, was charged, in United States v. M orris
Black, et al. (S.D.N. Y.), with rendering fraudulent legal opinions concerning the applicability of the registration requirements of the Securities Act to the sale of the common stock of Great Sweet Grass Oils,
Ltd. and Kroy Oils, Ltd. The indictment also charges Schwebel and
the other defendants with arranging for the issuance of approximately
3 million shares of Great Sweet Grass stock which were placed in the
names of nominees and thereafter fraudulently distributed to the
public. It is alleged that the defendants manipulated the price of
the stock on the American Stock Exchange to facilitate the
distribution.
Several cases involving the promotion of insurance companies and
the sale of their stock were prosecuted during the past fiscal year.
Among these is United Statee v. Lelferdink (D. Colo.), where an
IS-count indictment was returned charging Allan J. Lefferdink and
5 others with defrauding the purchasers of the stock of Denver
Acceptance Corporation which was organized purportedly to engage
in the insurance business. The indictment alleges that proceeds from
the sale of the stock were diverted to other companies belonging to
Lefferdink, after investors had been told the money would be used
to promote one or more insurance companies.
Dr. Curtis L. Attaway, Sr. was one of the more "successful" promoters prosecuted this year. He is charged in United States v.
Attaway (W.D. La.), with fraudulently obtaining over $6 million in
the sale of notes to approximately 4,000 investors. The indictment
alleges that the defendant represented that the profits from his
various business ventures were so large and placed him in such a high
federal income tax bracket that he could afford to pay interest at
rates as high as 120 percent per year. It further alleges that the
defendant issued to purchasers of his notes checks for the dollar
amounts of the loans, and represented that, as long as the investors
did not cash such checks, he would pay interest ranging from 3 percent to 10 percent per month.
At least $22 million worth of securities are alleged to have been
converted to defendants' own use in United Statee v. Eichler
(S.D.N.Y.). Defendants Leo Sinsheimer, who operated First Discount Corporation, a factor of security purchases by customers of
New York broker-dealers, Arthur Katz, Robert Eichler and William

Mulligan are charged with converting and selling securities which
were pledged by such customers with First Discount Corporation.
Near the close of the fiscal year, Edward M. Gilbert was indicted
in the Southern District of New York for violating the anti-fraud
provisions of the Securities Act by selling stock of E. L. Bruce Company to the public without disclosing that he had converted up to
$1,953,000 of Bruce's funds. He was also charged with violating the
registration provisions of the Securities Act, the insider reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act and the Federal Wire
Fraud and Mail Fraud Statutes in connection with his diversion of
Bruce's funds.
COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

Each of the Acts administered by the Commission specifically
authorizes investigations to determine whether specific violations of
the Federal securities laws have occurred.
The nine regional offices of the Commission, with the assistance of
their respective branch offices, are chiefly responsible for the conduct
of investigations.
In addition, the Office of Enforcement of the
Division of Trading and Exchanges of the Commission's headquarters
office conducts investigations dealing with matters of particular interest or urgency, either independently or assisting the regional offices.
The Office of Enforcement also exercises general supervision over
and coordination of the investigative activities of the regional offices.
Its staff examines and analyzes the investigative findings and recommendations of the regional offices and recommends appropriate action
to the Commission.
Prior to the organization of the Office of Enforcement in September
1962, certain of these functions were performed by a Branch of
Special Investigations, Trial and Enforcement, which had been established in October 1961 within the Division of Trading and Exchanges.
This Branch was set up to assist particular regional offices in certain
cases, to coordinate investigations affecting several regional offices,
and in some cases to assume responsibility for prosecuting multiregional investigations.
Among other things, the Branch collaborated with the Washington Regional Office in dealing with the serious
enforcement problem in the Washington, D.C. area, resulting in
injunctive and administrative proceedings against numerous brokerdealers; and it cooperated with several regional offices in an investigation leading to the return of an indictment in the Southern District
of Texas, charging four defendants with fraud in the sale of stock of
Ambrosia Minerals, Inc.

TWENTY~EIGHTH

ANNUAL REPORT

There are available to the Commission several sources of information concerning possible violations of the provisions of the Federal
securities laws. The primary source of information is complaints by
members of the general public concerning the activities of certain
persons in securities transactions. The Division of Trading and
Exchanges and the regional officesgive careful consideration to this
information and, if it appears that violations of the Federal securities
laws may have occurred, an investigation is commenced. Other
sources of information which are of assistance to the Commission in
carrying out its enforcement responsibilities are the national securities exchanges, brokerage firms, state and Canadian securities authorities, better business bureaus, the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. and various law enforcement agencies.
It is the Commission's general policy to conduct its investigations
on a confidential basis. Such a policy is necessary to effective law
enforcement and to protect persons against whom unfounded or
unconfirmed charges might be made. The Commission investigates
many complaints where no violation is ultimately found to have
occurred. To conduct such investigations publicly would ordinarily
result in hardship or embarrassment to many interested persons and
might affect the market for the securities in question, resulting in
injury to investors with no countervailing public benefits. Moreover,
members of the public would have a tendency to be reluctant to furnish information concerning violations if they thought their personal
affairs would be made public. Another advantage of confidential
investigations is that persons under suspicion of having violated the
law are not made aware that their activities are under surveillance,
since such awareness might have the effect of frustrating or obstructing the investigation. Accordingly, the Commission does not generally divulge the result of a nonpublic investigation unless it is made
a matter of public record in proceedings brought before the Commission or in the courts.
When it appears that a serious violation of the Federal securities
laws has occurred or is occurring, a case is opened and a full investigation is conducted." Under certain circumstances it becomes necessary for the Commission to issue a formal order of investigation
which appoints members of its staff as officers to issue subpoenas, to
take testimony under oath and to require the production of documents.
Usually this step is taken when the subjects of the investigation and
others who may be involved are uncooperative and it becomes neces/If Prior
to January I, 1962, Information concerning a possible violation of the Federal
securities laws was carried In a preliminary investigation 1Ile until a full scale investigation was begun or no violation was found. A.a of .January 1. 1962, the category of
prellm1nary Investigations has been el1m1nated.

sary to use the subpoena power to complete the investigation of
the case. During the past year 140 formal orders were issued in connection with investigations handled through the Division of Trading
and Exchanges. In addition, there were 23 formal orders issued upon
recommendation of the Division of Corporation Finance. That Division also conducts certain investigative work in connection with the
processing of filings made with that Division under the Securities
.Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange .Actof 1934.
When an investigation has been completed and enforcement action
appears appropriate, the Commission may proceed in one of several
ways. It may refer the case to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. The Commission may also, when appropriate, authorize the institution of civil proceedings for injunctive relief to halt
further violations of the Federal securities laws. In such event the
complaint is filed with the appropriate United States District Court
and the case is presented by a member of the Commission's staff.
Finally, the Commission may institute administrative proceedings
when its investigation indicates that a registration statement or report
filed with it is false or misleading or omits required information, or
that a broker-dealer or investment adviser registered with this Commission is violating the Federal securities laws.

activities of the Commission during fiscal 1962:

ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS WITH RESPECT TO CANADIAN
SECURITIES

Continued progress was made during fiscal 1962 in reducing the
unlawful offer and sale of Canadian securities in the United States.
The continuing cooperation of responsible Canadian officials and
segments of the Canadian securities industry has greatly reduced
enforcement problems.
However, the problem has by no means ceased to exist. During
the past fiscal year two former Toronto promotions were transferred
to Nassau, British West Indies, and postal fraud orders were obtained
against them at their new location. There are also indications that
some Ontario promoters are transferring their base of operations to
the Northwest Territories and British Columbia. .As new developments become known, the Commission has instituted vigorous enforcement procedures including steps resulting in issuance of postal fraud
orders.
Although the volume of violations has decreased, jurisdictional
problems, including the status of the Supplementary Extradition
Convention with Canada, remain troublesome."
The Commission continues to maintain its Canadian Restricted
List, which is a list of Canadian companies whose securities the Commission has reason to believe currently are being, or recently have been,
distributed in the United States in violation of the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Failure to comply with
the registration requirements deprives investors of material information and facilitates false claims as to the worth of such securities.
Thus investors are denied the essential protections provided by the
Securities Act.
The list and supplements thereto are issued to and published by the
press and copies are mailed to all registered broker-dealers and are
available to the public. The list serves as a warning to the public
and alerts broker-dealers to the fact that transactions in the securities of the companies named therein may be unlawful. Most United
States broker-dealers refuse to execute transactions in such securities.
Twelve supplements to the list were issued in fiscal 1962. .As a result
of more effective enforcement activities, it was necessary to add only
9 names to the list during the year, compared to the 82 names added
in fiscal 1960 and 47 in fiscal 1961. After deletion, upon compliance
with established procedures, of 4 names during the year, the number of
names on the list as of June 30, 1962,was 258.
The current list, as of September 30, 1962follows:
.. See 26th Annnal Report, pp. 202-208 for a description or some of these problems.

VIOLATIONS

A Section of Securities Violations is maintained by the Commission as a part of its enforcement program to provide a further means
of detecting and preventing fraud in securities transactions. The
Section maintains files providing a clearinghouse for other enforcement agencies for information concerning persons who have been
charged with violations of various Federal and state securities statutes. Considerable information is also available concerning violators
resident in the Provinces of Canada. The specialized information in

TWENTY-EIGHTH

ANNUAL REPORT

these files is kept current through the cooperation of the U.S. Post
Office Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, parole and
probation officials, state securities authorities, Federal and state
prosecuting attorneys, police officers, better business bureaus, chambers of commerce and other agencies. At the end of the fiscal year
these records contained information
concerning 79,000 persons
against whom Federal or state action had been taken in connection
with securities violations. In keeping these records current, there
were added during the fiscal year items of information concerning
8,761 persons, including 2,601 persons not previously identified in these
records.
The Section issues and distributes quarterly a securities violations
bulletin containing information received during the period concerning violators and showing new charges and developments in pending
cases. The bulletin includes a "wanted" section listing the names and
references to bulletins containing descriptive information as to persons wanted on securities violations charges. The bulletin is distributed to a limited number of officials of cooperating law enforcement
and other agencies in the United States and Canada.
Extensive use is made of the information available in these records
by regulatory and law enforcing officials. Numerous requests are
received each year for special reports on individuals in addition to
the information supplied by regular distribution of the quarterly
bulletin.
All available information is supplied in response to
inquiries from law enforcement agencies. During the fiscal year the
Commission received and disposed of 1,920 "securities violations"
letters or reports and dispatched 450 communications to cooperating
agenCIes.
APPUCATION FOR NONDISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN INFORMATION

The Commission is authorized under the various Acts administered
by it to grant requests for nondisclosure of certain types of information which would otherwise be disclosed to the public in applications,
reports or other documents filed pursuant to these statutes. Thus,
under paragraph (30) of Schedule A of the Securities Act of 1933,
disclosure of any portion of a material contract is not required if the
Commission determines that such disclosure would impair the value
of the contract and is not necessary for the protection of investors.
Under Section 24 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trade
secrets or processes need not be disclosed in any material filed with
the Commission. Under Section 24(b) of that Act, written objection
to public disclosure of information contained in any material filed
with the Commission may be made to the Commission which is then

148

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

authorized to make public disclosure of such information only If in
its judgment such disclosure is in the public interest. Similar provisions are contained in Section 22 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and in Section 45 of the Investment Company Act
of 1940. These statutory provisions have been implemented by rules
specifying the procedure to be followed by applicants seeking
determination that public disclosure is not necessary in a particular
case.

ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

The several Acts administered by the Commission recognize the
importance of dependable informative financial statements which
disclose the financial status and earnings history of a corporation or
other commercial entity. These statements, whether filed in compliance with the requirements under those statutes or included in other
material available to stockholders or prospective investors, are indispensable to investors as a basis for investment decisions. The Congress, cognizant of the fact that such statements lend themselves
readily to misleading inferences or even deception, whether or not
intended, included express provisions with respect to disclosure
requirements. Thus, for example, the Securities Act requires the
inclusion in the prospectus of balance sheets and profit and loss statements "in such form as the Commission shall prescribe" 59 and authorizes the Commission to prescribe the "items or details to be shown
in the balance sheet and earnings statement, and the methods to be
followed in the preparation of accounts ... " 60 Similar authority

hensive power is embodied in the Investment Company Act 62and
the Public Utility Holding Company Act.63
Pursuant to the broad rule-making power thus conferred with
respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements,
the Commission has prescribed uniform systems of accounts for companies subject to the Holding Company Act; 64 has adopted rules
under the Securities Exchange Act governing accounting and auditing of securities brokers and dealers; 65and has promulgated rules
contained in a single comprehensive regulation, identified as Regulation S_X,66 which govern the form and content of financial statements filed in compliance with the several Acts. This regulation is
supplemented by the Commission's Accounting Series Releases, of
which 93 have so far been issued. These releases were inaugurated in
193'7 and were designed as a program for making public, from time
to time, opinions on accounting principles for the purpose of contributing to the development of uniform standards and practice in
major accounting questions. The rules and regulations thus established, except for the uniform systems of accounts which are regulatory reports, prescribe accounting principles to be followed only in
certain limited areas. In the large area of financial reporting not
covered: by such rules, the Commission's principal means of providing
investors protection from inadequate financial reporting, :fraudulent
practices and over-reaching by management is by requiring a certificate of an independent public accountant based on an audit performed
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
expresses an opinion as to whether the financial statements are presented fairly in conformity with accounting principles and practices
which are recognized as sound and which have attained general
acceptance.
The Securities Act provides, that the financial statements required
to be made available to the public through filing with the Commission
shall be certified by "an independent public or certified accountant." 61

statements be accompanied by a certificate of an independent public
accountant," and the Commission's rules require, with minor excep.. Sections 30, 31.

tions, that they be so certified. The value of certification by qualified
accountants has been conceded for many years, but the requirement
as to independence, long recognized and adhered to by some individual
accountants, was for the first time authoritatively and explicitly introduced into law in 1933. The Commission's rules accept an accountant
who is qualified to practice in his own state as qualified to practice
before the Commission unless he has entered into disqualifying relationships with a particular client, such as becoming a promoter, underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer, employee, or stockholder; 69 or,
in rare cases, has demonstrated incompetence, subservience to the management, or has engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct." The Commission endeavors to encourage and foster the independence of the accountant in his relationships with his client so that
he may better be able to perform the service to the public contemplated by the Congress in the various Acts.
The Commission had occasion during the year to issue for the first
time an opinion 71 regarding the independence of a certifying accountant who also acts as counsel for the registrant.
The Commission's
opinion included the following statements:
Though owing a public responsibility, an attorney in acting as the client's
advisor, defender, advocate and confidant enters into a personal relati6Dship in
which his principal concern is with the interests and rights of his client. The
requirement of the Act of certification by an independent accountant, on the
other hand, is intended to secure for the benefit of public investors the detached
objectivity of a disinterested person. The certifying accountant must be one
who is in no way connected with the business or its management and who does
not have any relationship that might affect the independence which at times
may require him to voice public criticisms of his client's accounting practices.
In our opinion, the partner's relationship as attorney for the registrant here
during the same period covered by his firm's certification disqualified him and
the firm of which he was a partner from certifying registrant's financial statements as independent accountants.

The Commission is vigilant in its efforts to assure itself that the
audits which it requires are performed by independent accountants;
that the information contained in the financial reports represents
full and fair disclosure and that appropriate auditing and accounting
practices and standards have been followed in their preparation.
In
addition it recognizes that changes and new developments in financial
and economic conditions affect the operations and financial status
of the several thousand commercial and industrial companies required

to file statements with the Commission and that accounting and auditing procedures cannot remain static and continue to serve well a
dynamic economy. The Commission's accounting staff, therefore,
studies the changes and new developments for the purpose of establishing and maintaining appropriate accounting and auditing policies,
procedures and practices for the protection of investors. The primary responsibility for this program rests with the Chief Accountant
of the Commission, who has general supervision with respect to
accounting and auditing policies and their application.
Progress in these activities requires continuing contact and consultation between the staff and accountants both individually and
through such representative groups as, among others, the American
Accounting Association, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, the American Petroleum Institute, the Financial Analysts Federation, the Financial Executives Institute, and the National
Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, as well as many
Government agencies. Recognizing the importance of cooperation
in the formulation of accounting principles and practices, adequate
disclosure and auditing procedures which will best serve the interests
of investors, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
the Financial Analysts Federation and the Financial Executives Institute appoint committees which maintain liaison with the Commission's
staff. The Commission on its part has authorized its Chief Accountant to continue to serve as a member of an advisory committee to the
accounting principles board of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants.
The many daily decisions to be made require the attention of some
of the Chief Accountant's staff. These include questions raised by
each of the operating divisions of the Commission, the regional offices,
and the Commission. As a result of this day-to-day activity of the
Commission and the need to keep abreast of current accounting problems, the Chief Accountant's staff continually reexamines accounting
and auditing principles and practices. From time to time members
of the staff are called upon to assist in field investigations, to participate in hearings and to review opinions insofar as they pertain to
accounting matters.
Prefiling and other conferences, in person or by telephone, with
officials of corporations, practicing accountants and others are also an
important part of the work of the staff. Resolution of questions and
problems in this manner saves registrants and their representatives
both time and expense.
Many specific accounting and auditing problems are disclosed in
the examination of financial statements required to be filed with the

152

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

Commission. Where examination reveals that the rules and regulations of the Commission have not been complied with or that applicable generally accepted accounting principles have not been adhered
to, the examining division usually notifies the registrant by an informal letter of comment. These letters of comment and the correspondence or conferences that follow continue to be a most convenient and
satisfactory method of effecting corrections and improvements in
financial statements, both to registrants and to the Commission's staff.
Where particularly difficult or novel questions arise which cannot be
settled by the accounting staff of the divisions and by the Chief
Accountant, they are referred to the Commission for consideration
and decision.
These procedures are particularly
appropriate in resolving the
problems which arise in connection with initial filings made by new
corporate entities and by corporations whose securities had been
closely held or traded over the counter. During the past year many
such filings were made by companies whose business is closely associated with rapidly growing technological and scientific developments
and with our expanding population, as in real estate and recreational
activities.
Certain special problems related to real estate filings and the increase in their number indicated the need for a new form designed to
provide adequate disclosure of the problem areas. The Chief
Accountant and his staff cooperated with other divisions of the Commission in the preparation of a new Form 8-11 for this purpose which
was adopted effective December 1, 1961.12
The Commission also adopted, on June 12, 1962, new Rules 13a-15
and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act, and new Form 7-K to
require real estate companies to file quarterly reports of gross income,
expense and net income; cash available for distribution;
and
distributions to shareholders."
Difficulties often arise in connection with initial filings because
accountants and other advisers who serve the registrant have not had
any prior experience with the Commission. In some cases these persons have not familiarized themselves with the rules and regulations
of the Commission-particularly
the instructions as to financial statements required by the forms, the rules relating to independence
of the certifying accountant, and those relating to the form and content
of financial statements as set forth in Regulation 8-X.
Some of the current problems in initial filings are created because
audits had not been made in years preceding the filing of a registration

statement or the audits for prior years did not measure up to generally
accepted auditing standards and procedures, particularly with
respect to verification of inventories and receivables. These standards
require the observation of inventory taking and the confirmation of
receivables where practicable and reasonable if either of these assets
represents a significant proportion of the current assets. Where these
procedures have not been applied, the auditor must satisfy himself as
to the reasonableness of inventories for prior years by other appropriate auditing procedures. In some instances this is very difficult because the client may not have taken an inventory at the end of any
prior year or because inventory records for such years are incomplete
or may have been destroyed. Failure to adequately verify inventories
and receivables may preclude expression of an opinion as to the fairness of the financial statements taken as a whole since discrepancies
may exist which would materially affect the income, earned surplus,
and working capital.
During the year it came to the attention of the Commission that
wide variations had developed in the certificates of independent accountants with respect to representations concerning the verification
of inventories of prior years in first audits. In some cases such
representations have raised a question as to whether the certifying
accountant intended to limit his opinion regarding the fairness of presentation of the income statements. Accordingly, an Accounting
Series Release 14 was issued to reemphasize that our rules under the
Securities Act require that registration statements contain a certificate
of an independent accountant based on an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and procedures.
The Chief Accountant and his staff cooperated with other divisions
of the Commission and the industry in the preparation of proposals
to amend Articles 7 and 12 of Regulation S-X governing the form
and content of financial statements and schedules filed by insurance
companies other than life and title insurance companies. The revision
of Articles 7 and 12 which was adopted July 26, 1961/5 reflects
changes in requirements of the annual statement filed with state
regulatory authorities and developments in insurance reporting since
those articles were originally adopted. Details of these changes were
discussed in last year's report. Similar cooperative effort during the
year resulted also in the development of a proposed amendment to
Regulation S-X which would add to that regulation provisions governing the form and content of financial statements and related schedules to be filed by life insurance companies."

CO~SffiON

During the year the Chief Accountant and his staff participated in
the determination of requirements regarding disclosures and financial
statements pertaining to employee stock purchase, savings or similar
plans. On July 23, 1962, a new Form ll-K was adopted for use in
filing annual reports with respect to such plans, and Regulation S-X
was amended by the addition of a new Article 6C which prescribes the
form and content of the financial statements to be filed"11
Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the Commission issued its
findings, opinions, and orders in two proceedings under Rule 2 (e) of
its Rules of Practice. In Arthwr Levison,18 the Commission found
that Levison, a certified public accountant, was not in fact independent with respect to a registrant and was therefore disqualified under
Rule 2-01(b) of Regulation S-X from certifying its financial statements. Levison's lack of independence resulted from the facts that
he had been an employee of the registrant and had served as a director
of an associated company during the period under report. In addition he certified materially false and misleading financial statements
of the registrant and an affiliated company without having audited
or ever having seen the books and records of either company. Because Levison's conduct constituted a serious breach of the standards
of his profession and of his responsibilities to the Commission and
to the public, he was denied the privilege of practicing before the
Commission.
In Morton I. Myers,19 the Commission held that Myers, a certified
public accountant, engaged in unethical and improper professional
conduct when he prepared a balance sheet for a "proposed corporation" on the basis of information supplied over the telephone by a
client and sent the statement to the client with a covering letter addressed to the "Board of Directors," which falsely stated that he had
examined the books and records of the "corporation." The balance
sheet was used to obtain a bank loan, the proceeds of which were used
to purchase control of a company whose stock was listed on the
American Stock Exchange. After consideration of several factors
urged by Myers in mitigation of his conduct, the Commission ruled
that Myers should be denied the privilege of appearing or practicing
before the Commission without its prior approval and that no application for approval would be entertained for a period of 1 year from
the date of the order.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT

Section 15 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, as amended, exempts from registration under both the Securities Act of 1933 and
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 securities issued, or guaranteed
as to both principal and interest, by the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. The Bank is required to file with
the Commission such annual and other reports with respect to such
securities as the Commission shall determine to be appropriate in view
of the special character of the Bank and its operations and necessary
in the public interest or for the protection of investors. The Commission has, pursuant to the above authority, adopted rules requiring
the Bank to file quarterly reports and also to file copies of each annual
report of the Bank to its board of governors. The Bank is also required to file reports with the Commission in advance of any distribution in the United States of its primary obligations. The Commission, acting in consultation with the National Advisory Council on
International Monetary and Financial Problems, is authorized to
suspend the exemption at any time as to any or all securities issued
or guaranteed by the Bank during the period of such suspension.
During the Bank's last fiscal year ending June 30, 1962, the Bank
made 29 loans totaling the equivalent of $882.3 million, compared with
a total of $610 million last year. The loans were made in Argentina,
Australia, Austria, Colombia (2 loans), Costa Rica (2 loans), Ethiopia (2 loans), Finland, Ghana, Iceland, India (5 loans), Israel,
Japan, Kenya, Mexico (2 loans), Peru, Philippines (2 loans), South
Africa (2 loans), Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela. This
brought the gross total of loan commitments at June 30 to $6,672.8
million. By June 30, as a result of cancellations, repayments, sales
of loans and exchange adjustments, the portions of loans signed still
retained by the Bank had been reduced to $4,665.4million.
During the year the Bank sold or agreed to sell $318.8 million
principal amount of loans. On June 30, the total sales of loans
amounted to $1,332 million, of which all except $69 million was
without the Bank's guarantee.
The outstanding funded debt of the Bank amounted to $2,520.8
million on June 30, 1962, reflecting a net increase of $292.3 million
in the past year. During the year there was a gross increase in
borrowings of $463 million. This increase consisted of three public
bond issues, including an Italian lire issue in the amount of Lit. 15
billion (U.S. $24 million), a $100 million U.S. dollar issue, and a Swiss
franc issue in the amount of Sw F 100 million ($23.3 million) ; the

($23.2 million) of October 1961; the drawing down of U.S. $120
million and the balance of DM 250 million ($62.5 million) of the
German borrowing of August 1960, and the delivery of $10 million of
bonds which had been subject to delayed delivery arrangements. The
funded debt was decreased by $1'70.'7million as a result of the maturing
of $122.'7 million of bonds, the redemption of Sw F 100 million
($23.2 million), the revaluation of the Canadian dollar issues by $3.2
million, $4.5 million of unissued bonds which were subject to delayed
delivery, and sinking and purchase fund transactions amounting to
$17.1 million.
During the fiscal year, Laos (with a capital subscription of $10
million), Liberia ($15 million), New Zealand ($166.7 million), Nepal
($10 million) and Cyprus ($15 million) became members ofthe Bank;
the Dominican Republic was readmitted to membership in the Bank
with a capital subscription of $8 million; and Syria resumed separate
membership in the Bank with a capital subscription of $20 million.
At June 30, 1962, the Bank had '75members with capital subscriptions
totaling $20,484.8million.
INTER.AMERICAN

DEVELOPMENT BANK

The Inter-American Development Bank Act, which authorizes the
United States to participate in the new Inter-American Development
Bank, provides an exemption for certain securities which may be
issued by the Bank similar to that provided for securities of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Acting pursuant
to this authority, the Commission adopted Regulation IA, which
requires the Bank to file with the Commission substantially the same
information, documents and reports as are required from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Bank is also
required to file a report with the Commission prior to the sale of any
of its primary obligations to the public in the United States. Up to
June 30, 1962, no such sales had been made.
During the year ending June 30, 1962, the Bank made 3'7 loans
totaling the equivalent of $131,607,014 from its ordinary capital
resources, bringing the gross total of loan commitments at June 30,
to 49 loans aggregating $156,102,014, including $4501000representing
one loan which was cancelled. During the year, the Bank sold or
agreed to sell $4,19'7,632in participations in the aforesaid loans, all of
such participations being without the guarantee of the Bank. The
loans from the Bank's ordinary capital resources were made in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, EI Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay.

equivalent of $813,160,000, of which $431,580,000 represented callable
capital.
STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES

During the past fiscal year the Branch of Economic Research continued its regular work in connection with the statistical activities of
the Commission and the overall Government statistical program under
the direction of the Office of Statistical Standards, Bureau of the
Budget. In addition, the Branch of Exchange Regulation continued
its compilation of data on the stock market.
The statistical series described below are published in the Commission's Statistical Bulletin and in addition, except for data on
registered issues, on corporate pension funds, and on the stock market,
current figures and analyses of the data are published in quarterly
press releases.
Issues Registered Under the Securities Act of 1933

Monthly statistics are compiled on the number and volume of
registered securities, classified by industry of issuer, type of security,
and use of proceeds. Summary statistics for the years 1935-62 are
given in Appendix Table 1 and detailed statistics for the fiscal year
1962 appear in Appendix Table 2.
New Securities Offerings

This is a monthly and quarterly series covering all new corporate
and noncorporate issues offered for cash sale in the United States.
The series includes not only issues publicly offered but also issues
privately placed, as well as other issues exempt from registration
under the Securities Act such as intrastate offerings and railroad
securities. The offerings series includes only securities actually offered
for cash sale, and only issues offered for account of issuers. Annual
statistics on new offerings for recent years as well as monthly figures

158

SECURITIES

from January

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

1961 through June 1962, are given in Appendix Tables

3,4, and 5.
Estimates of the net cash flow through securities transactions are
prepared quarterly and are derived by deducting from the amount of
estimated gross proceeds received by corporations through the sale
of securities the amount of estimated gross payments by corporations
to investors for securities retired.
Data on gross issues, retirements
and net change in securities outstanding are presented for all corporations and for the principal industry groups.
Individuals'

Saving

The Commission compiles quarterly estimates of the volume and
composition of individuals' saving in the United States. The series
represents net increases in individuals'
financial assets less net
increases in debt. The study shows the aggregate amount of saving
and the form in which the saving occurred, such as investment in
securities, expansion of bank deposits, increases in insurance and
pension reserves, etc. A reconciliation of the Commission's estimates
with the personal saving estimates of the Department of Commerce,
derived in connection with its national income series, is published
annually by the Department of Commerce as well as in the Securities
and Exchange Commission Statistical Bulletin.
Corporate Pension Funds

An annual survey is made of pension plans of all United States
corporations where funds are administered by corporations themselves, or through trustees. The survey shows the flow of money into
these funds, the types of assets in which the funds are invested and the
principal items of income and expenditures.
Financial Position of Corporations

The series on the working capital position of all United States
corporations, excluding banks, insurance companies and savings and
loan associations, shows the principal components of current assets
and liabilities, and also contains an abbreviated analysis of the sources
and uses of corporate funds.
The Commission, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission, compiles a quarterly financial report of all United States manufacturing
concerns. This report gives complete balance sheet data and an
abbreviated income account, data being classified by industry and
size of company.
Plant and Equipment

Expenditures

The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce, conducts quarterly and annual surveys of actual and anticipated plant
and equipment expenditures of all United States business, exclusive

~ENTY-EIGHTH

~AL

REPORT

159

of agriculture. After the close of each quarter, data are released on
actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated expenditures for the next two quarters. In addition, a survey is made at the
beginning of each year of the plans for business expansion during
that year.
Directory of Registered Companies

The Commission annually publishes a listing of companies required
to file annual reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
In addition to an alphabetical listing, there is a listing of companies
by industry group classified according to The Standard Industrial
Classification Manual.
Stock Market Data

The Branch of Exchange Regulation regularly compiles statistics
on the market value and volume of sales on registered and exempted
securities exchanges, round-lot stock transactions on the New York
exchanges for accounts of members and nonmembers, odd-lot stock
transactions on the New York exchanges, special offerings and
secondary distributions. It also computes indexes of stock market
prices each week based upon the closing market prices of common
stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This stock price index
and data on round-lot and odd-lot trading on the two New York
exchanges are released weekly. The other statistical data mentioned
above, as well as these weekly series, are published regularly in the
Commission's Statistical Bulletin.
OPINIONS OF THE COMMISSION

Administrative proceedings arising under the statutes administrated by the Commission and under its Rules of Practice generally
culminate in the issuance of an opinion by the Commission, which includes findings of fact and conclusions of law. The extent to which
the factual and legal issues are discussed in these opinions depends
largely on their importance and novelty. The Commission's findings
are based on evidence taken at hearings which are in almost all cases
before a hearing examiner, or on stipulated facts or admissions.
In the preparation of opinions, the Commission, or the individual
Commissioner to whom a case may be assigned for the preparation of
an opinion, is assisted by the Office of Opinion Writing. This Office
is directly responsible to the Commission and is completely independent of the operating divisions, consistent with the principle of
separation of functions embodied in the Administrative Procedure
Act. Where the parties to a proceeding waive their right to such

160

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

separation, the operating division of the Commission which participated in the proceeding may assist in the drafting of the Commission's
decision.
The Commission's opinions are publicly released and are distributed to the press and to persons on the Commission's mailing list. In
addition, they are printed and published periodically by the Government Printing Office in bound volumes entitled "Securities and
Exchange Commission Decisions and Reports."
During the fiscal year 1962, the Commission issued 164 opinions
and other rulings of an adjudicatory nature.
DISSEMINATION

OF INFORMATION

Various activities of the Commission supplement the underlying
objective of the securities laws of providing for the dissemination of financial and other information about securities offered for
public sale or traded on exchanges. All registration statements and
other corporate reports filed pursuant to the requirements of these
laws are public documents and available for inspection by investors
and other interested persons. Much of the data included therein is
reprinted and receives general circulation through the medium of
published securities manuals, which are standard reference material
for securities analysts, investment advisers and trust departments
throughout the country.
To facilitate public dissemination with respect to corporate financing and other proposals filed with the Commission and actions
taken by it in its administration of the laws, the Commission issues a
daily News Digest containing a resume of each filing, as well as
a summary of each order, decision or rule issued by or other actioR--Gf
the Commission. In addition to its distribution to the press, the
Digest is distributed on a subscription basis by the Government
Printing Office and some 3,500 investors, securities firms and other
interested persons are currently subscribing to this service. During the year the Digest included a resume of each of the 2,106 registration statements filed with the Commission (not including investment company filings which added additional securities by way of
amendments to previous statements) ; and it also included summaries
of the 1,250 orders, decisions, rules and other actions of the Commission. Much of the information reflected in the Digest is published in
the daily press and in financial and other periodicals. A more limited
distribution of the full text of the Commission's decisions or other
pronouncements is made to registrants, practicing lawyers and others.

SEetJR!TIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Also in October 1961, the Commission established two new branches,
the Branch of Special Investigations, Trial and Enforcement, and the
Branch of Criminal References, in the Division of Trading and Exchanges. This action was designed to consolidate in one division the
Commission's investigation and enforcement activities in the headquarters office and to contribute to more effective coordination of such
activities in the several regional offices. Subsequently, in September
1962, the enforcement activities of the Division of Trading and
Exchanges were reorganized to centralize the responsibility for all
enforcement matters other than criminal references in an Office of
Enforcement, with two Branches of Enforcement.
The Branch of
Criminal References was renamed the Office of Criminal Reference.
In December 1961, the Division of Administrative Management was
abolished and the three branches in that Division were established
as separate organizational units, as the Office of the Comptroller,
Office of Personnel, and Office of Records and Service. The heads of
these offices are responsible directly to the Chairman.
In July 1962, a Branch of Investment Company Inspections was
established in the Division of Corporate Regulation to plan and supervise the Commission's investment company inspection program. In
December 1962, this Branch was assigned the responsibility for investigations and enforcement actions with respect to investment
companies.
Also in December 1962, the Assistant Director of the Division of
Corporate Regulation with responsibility for the Commission's functions under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was also
given responsibility for its functions under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act; and a staff unit was established to assist the Commission
in policy planning under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Finally, there was a realignment of functions in the New York
Regional Office in August 1962, involving principally the consolidation of enforcement activities under an Assistant Regional Administrator and the appointment of another Assistant Regional Administrator with responsibility for the Commission's functions under
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act and for the investment company
and investment adviser inspection programs.
PERSONNEL AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

In fiscal 1962, the Commission continued its intensive efforts to
recruit outstanding law and business graduates.
Several on-campus
visits to law schools and to colleges offering undergraduate
and
graduate programs in finance were made by Commission representa-

TWENTY-EIGHTH

ANNUAL REPORT

165

tives. A number of high-caliber graduates were appointed to the
staff as a result of these visits.
The enactment of Public Law 87-196 by the Congress, authorizing
the Commission to conduct a special study of the securities markets,
required the recruitment of a specialized staff in as short a time as
possible. Authority to appoint employees without regard to Civil
Service laws, rules and regulations and to establish pay without
regard to the Classification Act of 1949, as amended, materially
assisted the Commission in expediting the appointment of wellqualified individuals to the Special Study staff. A general staffing
policy to fill positions created under Public Law 87-196 was approved
by the Chairman on October 6, 1961.
The Commission was authorized by the Civil Service Commission
to examine and rate stenographers and typists in Grades GS-2, GS-3,
and GS-4 and clerical applicants in Grades GS-2 and GS-3. This
authority enabled the Commission to staff its clerical vacancies under
a field recruiting program conducted in states surrounding the )Vashington Metropolitan Area.
The Commission found it necessary to supplement its on-the-job
training of newly appointed professional employees with more formalized training sessions. The Divisions of Corporation Finance
and Trading and Exchanges demonstrated the feasibility of conducting their training sessions outside of office hours. This permitted
them to use senior officials as lecturers or instructors, to solve classroom space problems and to continue work production during office
hours. The New York Regional Office also conducted instructional
sessions for new attorneys and investigators employed during the
fiscal year. Clerical training for stenographic and typing personnel
covering telephone etiquette, correspondence procedures, mail, files
and records, etc., was conducted in the Headquarters Office under the
direction of a special secretarial committee recruited from experienced staff employees.
In its seventh annual service and merit awards ceremony in October
1961, the Commission recognized the long service of its career
employees by presenting pins to 31 employees with 25 years of S.E.C.
service. In addition, 52 employees were presented 20,15, and 10-year
service pins, respectively. In recognition of those members of the
staff whose terms of Government service include service in other
Federal agencies, 8 employees received 30-year pins, 15 received 25year pins, 24 received 20-year pins, 33 received 15-year pins, and 43
received 10-year pins. Cash awards totaling $7,650 and certificates
of merit were presented to 73 employees and 6 employees received a
total of $250 for suggestions which were adopted.
