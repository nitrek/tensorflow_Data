CEYONIQ AG (N/K/A CEYONIQ, INC.)
October 28, 2016

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Cameron Elliot, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registration of the registered securities of Respondent
Ceyoniq AG (n/k/a CEYONIQ, Inc.) due to its failure to timely file required periodic reports
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.1
INTRODUCTION
On February 17, 2016, the Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OIP alleges that Ceyoniq
has a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g)
and is delinquent in its periodic filings. Ceyoniq was served with the OIP by September 30,
2016, and its answer was due by October 11, 2016. Ceyoniq AG, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release
No. 4249, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3856 (ALJ Oct. 12, 2016). Following Ceyoniq’s failure to timely
file an answer, I ordered it to show cause by October 24, 2016, why the registration of its
securities should not be revoked by default due to its failure to file an answer or otherwise
1

The proceeding has ended as to Market Data Consultants, Inc., Mentergy Ltd. (a/k/a Gilat
Communications Ltd.), Mid-Am Systems, Inc., and Nu Energy Inc. Ceyoniq AG, Initial
Decision Release No. 999, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1346 (ALJ Apr. 12, 2016), finality order, Exchange
Act Release No. 77986, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1969 (June 3, 2016).

defend this proceeding. Id. I warned that if Ceyoniq failed to respond to the show cause order, it
would be deemed in default, the proceeding would be determined against it, and the registration
of its securities would be revoked. Id. To date, Ceyoniq has not filed an answer or responded to
the show cause order.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Ceyoniq is in default for failing to file an answer or otherwise defend the proceeding.
See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f). Accordingly, as authorized by Rule of Practice
155(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a), I find the following allegations in the OIP to be true.
Ceyoniq, Central Index Key No. 1104733, is a German corporation located in Bielefeld,
Germany, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having
not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 8-A12G registration statement on November
21, 2000.
In addition to its repeated failure to timely file periodic reports, Ceyoniq failed to heed a
delinquency letter sent to it by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance requesting
compliance with its periodic filing obligations or, through its failure to maintain a valid address
on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive such letter.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1 require public corporations to file periodic
reports with the Commission. Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual reports.
See 17 C.F.R. § 240.13a-1. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and may not be
subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied, Exchange Act
Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not required to establish
violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1. See SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732,
740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978). Ceyoniq failed to
timely file periodic reports, and as a result, violated Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1.
SANCTION
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
the registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. 15 U.S.C. § 78l(j). In determining what sanctions will
adequately protect investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness
of the issuer’s violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of
culpability involved, the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure
future compliance, and the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.”

Ceyoniq’s failure to file required periodic reports is serious because it violates a central
provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is “to supply investors with
current and accurate financial information about an issuer so that they may make sound
[investment] decisions.” Id. at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that
Congress fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate
misrepresentations in the sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st
Cir. 1977). Ceyoniq’s violation is also recurrent in that it repeatedly failed to file periodic
reports. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC
LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21, 2009) (respondent failed to file seven required periodic reports due
over a two-year period); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS
1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008) (respondent’s failure to make eight filings over an eighteenmonth period considered recurrent). Ceyoniq is also culpable because it failed to heed a
delinquency letter sent to it by the Division of Corporation Finance or, through its failure to
maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not
receive such letter. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS
3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that revocation may be warranted even without
proof that a respondent was aware of its reporting obligations). Finally, Ceyoniq has not
answered the OIP or otherwise participated in the proceeding to address whether it has made any
efforts to remedy its past violation and has made no assurances against further violations.
Considering these delinquencies, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of
investors to revoke the registration of each class of Ceyoniq’s registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registration of each class of registered securities of Ceyoniq AG (n/k/a CEYONIQ, Inc.) is
hereby REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, a party may file a petition
for review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of the initial decision. A
party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial
decision, pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of
fact is filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from
the date of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion
to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become
final as to that party.

A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
