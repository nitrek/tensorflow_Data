EXTENSION ORDER

The Applicant has requested an extension of time until July 15, 2016 to file his
response brief in this matter. FINRA does not object. Extensions of time are disfavored.
It appears appropriate, however, to grant the Applicant’s request for good cause shown.
Therefore,
It is ORDERED that the parties’ time for filing responsive briefs, not to exceed 7
pages, is extended to July 15, 2016.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Lynn M. Powalski
Deputy Secretary
