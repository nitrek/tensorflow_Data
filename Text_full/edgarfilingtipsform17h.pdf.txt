Unless you are submitting a TEST Filing, you can select “LIVE.” Test filings give users the
ability to preview the functionality of the system without creating an official filing.
RETURN COPY = A copy of an accepted filing posted on the EDGAR Filing Website and
available to registrants and co-registrants only. After your filing is complete, you would be
able to view your filing in the system for 7 days. It is recommended to select the return copy
box, however it is not required.
“Is this an Electronic copy…” Use this box ONLY if you have submitted / are submitting the
same filing in both paper and electronic form, AND you want the paper copy to be considered
as your “official” submission. If you are only submitting electronically, leave this box blank
(unchecked).
You have an option to select your filing notification method: (1) via this EDGAR website or (2)
via email.
If you select the box (“notify via website only”), you will not receive an email upon the filing
being “Accepted” or “Suspended”.
To receive additional notices (besides the email already on file) that the 17(H) Form was filed,
you can enter an email address in this box. After entering an email address click outside the
email address box (you do not have to click the “Add” button). To add a 2nd additional email
address, click the “Add” button and another box will be created for another email address.
Repeat adding boxes to continue adding additional notification email addresses. If you “Add”
by mistake, you can delete the “blank email box” by selecting “Delete” on the relevant row.

Menu buttons at the top of the page: At any point in the process, a user can select the icons at
the top of the page. See below for the description of each:
Save – downloads a copy of the EDGAR form (*.eis) file to the user computer, which can be used
later to bring up a current copy of the Form. The system will time out if not used for a period of
time (60 minutes), and if the system times out, it will not save your progress. If you wish to save
your progress, select the Save button (the form is saved as an “.eis” file, typically in the
“Downloads” folder of your computer). To re-enter a saved filing, on the Form 17-H Initial entry
page, select “Continue with Saved 17-H”, as shown below, and select the appropriate “.eis” file.

Print – Allows printing of a blank 17(H) form, or the current active form. It is recommended that
before submitting the form, you either print a copy of the form or print the filing to a pdf file,
and save for future reference. Also see Tip #27.
Submit – Once finished, this button can be used to submit the Form 17h. The system will
process the form and perform some additional validation checks on the entries, and notify a
user if there are items to correct. There are two levels of validation, immediate and later after
submission. Please be aware that filings could either pass or fail (i.e., Accept or Suspend) even
though the initial “Submit” appeared to have gone through. Once the second level of validation
finishes, an “Accepted” or “Suspended” notice will be provided (either by email or filer web).
Instructions – currently shows a blank version of the 17(H) Form.
Exit – will exit the 17(H) Form. Be sure to save progress of your work before exiting.

To upload each required or supplemental document, use the following tips about the naming
conventions and file types (not exhaustive):
1) No spaces are allowed in the file names
2) Filenames should be no longer than 32 characters
3) File names can include upper and lower case letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and
underscores. File names must begin with a letter or number. Some browsers may only
allow lower case letters
4) Suggested file types to use: *.txt, *.pdf, or *.html
5) Excel files can be saved as various text file formats, including (but not limited to) tab
delimited *.txt files (see Tip #26 below) or *.pdf files and uploaded
6) PowerPoint or Word documents can be saved as *.pdf files (staff preference, or other
types) and uploaded
For additional details on the Document Type options, please view the Edgar Filing manual
https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/edgarfm-vol2-v37.pdf, on page 752 of 774.
In addition, in some cases while attempting to view your uploaded document, you may see
jumbled characters in the viewer window. You can set your Internet Explorer browser to act like
(Emulate) a prior version using the below steps.
In the Internet Explorer browser, Select Tools -> F12 Developer Tools -> Emulation -> Change
“Document mode” to “8” and change “User agent string” to “Internet Explorer 8.”
After changing these settings, please keep the F12 Developer Tool window open, to view the
document you uploaded without the error message.
**This is an optional step to confirm how the uploaded document looks after being uploaded.
The system receives the actual document uploaded, regardless of this browser setting, or the
way in looks in the browser.

Do not select a “Material Associated Person” for each Document. Unless you need to add a
document related to Part II, as specified further below in Tip #24b, leave the Material
Associated Person field Blank for any 17(H) reporting broker dealer, MAP or holding company
document, as shown in the example.
The only documents that need to have a Material Associated Person specified are documents
referenced in Part II for one specific MAP. If filling out a Part II for a MAP, you need to attach a
document related to a section/number on the Part II form (the above highlighted document
types), those documents require specification of a MAP on the documents tab.
Add Document button – Use to add an additional document to the filing
Delete Document button – Use to remove a document that was added to the filing. Before
selecting the Delete document button, select the selection box to the left of the filename.
Validate Document button – It is optional. The system will validate documents once the filing is
submitted, and provide a notice if there is a problem.
As a note - There is not a save button on the Documents tab. If you receive a system check
message at the top of the page, the message may continue to appear even after uploading a file
to address the system check message. The system check message will be re-evaluated when the
file is submitted. If an error persists, the filing will not be submitted and you will have a chance
to address the message again.

To save an excel file as a Tab delimited Text file, within Microsoft Excel select “Save As” and
then select the option “Text (tab delimited) (*.txt)” as highlighted in yellow in the “save as” type
menu. Other *.txt formats may be used as well.

Once the filing is complete click on the “Submit” icon in the header. The system performs an
interim check and provides a dialog box notifying the filer that they will be making a live filing
(Click “Transmit LIVE Submission”). If no other messages, a final back-end system validation
check will be made; check either your email or the filer web to see if the filing was Accepted or
Suspended. It is NOT complete unless it has been “Accepted” in this final step.
If there are error messages, the system will identify the field/page of the error with a brief
description. If the error message is not clear, please capture a screen shot and reach out to Filer
technical support (202) 551-8900, option #3.
**Before submitting a filing, it is recommended to print it (using the Print Icon in the header).
The current filing will show up in another tab, and you can save as pdf or print to a pdf file to
save for your record. The Print button does not print the documents that you uploaded.
