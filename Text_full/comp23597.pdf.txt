COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” and “Commission”),
hereby files this Complaint alleging the following:
Overview
1.

This matter concerns the fraudulent operation of a $10.7 million fund

of funds by Thomas D. Conrad, Jr. (“Conrad”), a recidivist securities violator, and
one of his sons, Stuart P. Conrad (“Stuart Conrad”). During different periods
beginning in 1994, two entities controlled by Conrad, Financial Management

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 2 of 35

Corporation (“FMC”) and Financial Management Corporation S.R.L. (“FMC
Uruguay”),were the general partners of, and investment advisers to, the World
Opportunity Master Fund, L.P. (“WOF Master”) and its feeder funds, World
Opportunity Fund, L.P. (“WOF”), World Opportunity Fund (BVI) Ltd. (“BVI”),
and World Fund II, L.P. (“World Fund II”).
2.

From 2010 through late 2014, Conrad directed preferential

redemptions and other disbursements out of WOF Master and its feeder funds to
himself, his son (defendant Stuart Conrad), extended family, and certain favored
investors, while representing to other investors that redemptions were suspended.
Conrad also failed to disclose to investors certain fees that he received for his
purported management of the funds and related conflicts of interest, and failed to
disclose his disciplinary history, including a broker-dealer industry bar.
3.

Stuart Conrad, an officer of both FMC and FMC Uruguay, aided and

abetted Conrad’s fraud.
Jurisdiction and Venue
4.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20 and 22 of

the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t and 77v], Sections
21(d), and 21(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15

engaging in the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this
Complaint, and transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business of similar
purport and object, for civil penalties, and for other equitable relief.
5.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22 of

the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v], Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Exchange
Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa], and Section 214(a) of the Advisers
Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-14(a)].

alleged in this Complaint, and in transactions, acts, practices, and courses of
business of similar purport and object.
The Defendants
9.

Thomas D. Conrad, Jr., age 85, is the owner and controlling person of

Defendants FMC and FMC Uruguay. During substantially all of the events in
questions, he resided in Alpharetta, Georgia. He currently resides in both
Alpharetta and Uruguay. In 1971, the Commission barred Conrad from association
with any broker or dealer, and revoked the registration of Conrad & Company,
Inc., a broker-dealer which Conrad controlled, finding Conrad “unfit for assuming
any proprietary or supervisory role with a broker-dealer . . . of engaging in the
securities business in any capacity.” In the Matter of Thomas D. Conrad, Jr., et al.
Admin. Proc. No. 3-2338 (Opinion of the Commission, December 14, 1971).
10.

Stuart Paul Conrad, age 55, is a son of Conrad and a resident of

Alpharetta, Georgia. He is a vice president and member of the Board of Directors
of FMC and FMC Uruguay, and a portfolio manager for WOF Master.
11.

Financial Management Corporation (“FMC”) is a Maryland

corporation organized by Conrad in 1965 that acted as the general partner and
unregistered investment adviser for the hedge funds operated by Conrad under the
4

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 5 of 35

World Opportunity Fund name, including WOF and its successor, World Fund II,
during most of the relevant time period.
12.

Financial Management Corporation S.R.L. (“FMC Uruguay”) is a

Uruguayan entity operated by Conrad. In 2014, FMC Uruguay assumed FMC’s
role as general partner and investment adviser to the World Opportunity feeder
funds.
Related Persons and Entities
13.

World Opportunity Master Fund, L.P. (“WOF Master”) is the master

fund in the WOF master-feeder structure. WOF Master was formed by Conrad
under the laws of the British Virgin Islands in 2007, began operations in 2008, and
became a Nevada limited partnership in 2012.
14.

In a master-feeder structure, investors invest in a feeder fund, which

in turn invests its assets in the master fund. The master fund makes all portfolio
investments and conducts trading activity, while fees are typically payable at the
feeder fund level.
15.

World Opportunity Fund, L.P. (“WOF”) is a Delaware limited

partnership established, under a different name, in 1994 and is one of the
feeder funds for WOF Master.

16.

World Fund II, L.P. (“World Fund II”) is a Delaware limited

partnership established in 2011 for all new investors in the World
Opportunity Funds other than those holding retirement accounts and is one
of the feeder funds for WOF Master.
17.

World Opportunity Fund (BVI) Ltd. (“BVI”) is a British Virgin

Islands entity that was established in 2008 to hold individual retirement
accounts and was, until 2014, one of the feeder funds for WOF Master.
Facts
A.

Conrad Creates Four Hedge Funds

18.

This is Conrad’s second appearance in an SEC enforcement action.

19.

After being barred from association with any registered broker-dealer

in 1971, Conrad has continued in the securities business in an unregistered
capacity.
20.

During the period described herein, Conrad created at least four

hedge funds, WOF, WOF Master, World Fund II, and BVI. Investors in the feeder
funds received limited partnership interests in those funds.

6

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 7 of 35

21.

Conrad created WOF in 1994. Calling it a “fund of funds,” he

invested mostly in a variety of international private equity and hedge funds.
Between 1994 and 2008, WOF was Conrad’s only hedge fund.
22.

In 2008, Conrad created WOF Master (a British Virgin Islands

company) and began using WOF, his first hedge fund, as a feeder fund into the
WOF Master fund.
23.

Also in 2008, Conrad created BVI as a separate feeder fund to accept

investment of retirement assets. As with WOF, all of the money that Conrad raised
from investors in BVI was invested in WOF Master.
24.

In 2011, Conrad created the third of his feeder funds, World Fund II,

after WOF was sued by a court-appointed receiver in connection with WOF’s
investment in Valhalla Investment Partners, LP (“Valhalla”), a Ponzi scheme.
25.

Specifically, between 2001 and 2005, Conrad invested $1.7 million of

WOF’s assets in Valhalla, and withdrew $4 million, including false profits of
approximately $2.3 million.

7

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 8 of 35

26.

In 2010, WOF was sued by the court-appointed receiver for Valhalla

and, in 2013, an arbitrator ordered WOF to repay the $2.3 million. WOF fully paid
this debt to the receiver in September 2014.
27.

Conrad created World Fund II purportedly to segregate investments

from new investors from investments in WOF and BVI, which were impacted by
the $2.3 million payment to the Valhalla Receiver.
28.

Since satisfying WOF’s obligation to the Receiver, Conrad has moved

all investors in WOF into World Fund II, and moved all retirement assets of BVI
into WOF, leaving no assets in BVI.
29.

Currently, therefore, there are two active feeder funds: WOF, which

holds retirement assets, and World Fund II, which holds non-retirement assets.
Each feeder fund is invested 100 percent in WOF Master.
30.

As of November 2012, there were 44 limited partners invested in

WOF, which had a purported portfolio value of $5.7 million.
31.

As of November 2012, there were 48 limited partners invested in

World Fund II, which had a purported portfolio value of $5 million.

8

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 9 of 35

32.

WOF, WOF Master, World Fund II, and BVI are, and were during all

times relevant hereto, “pooled investment vehicles” as that term is defined in the
Advisers Act.
33.

The interests WOF, WOF Master, World Fund II, and BVI that

Conrad offered and sold were securities as defined in the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, and the Advisers Act.
B.

Conrad Creates and Controls the Hedge Funds’ Advisers

34.

Conrad also created and controlled two other entities, FMC and FMC

Uruguay, which were the general partner for each fund and acted as an
unregistered investment adviser to those funds during the events alleged herein.
35.

Before 2014, FMC was the company through which Conrad made

investment decisions for the feeder funds and WOF Master. Since 2014, FMC
Uruguay has assumed the role previously played by FMC.
36.

Through FMC and FMC Uruguay, Conrad made all investment

decisions for WOF, WOF Master, World Fund II, and BVI.
37.

Conrad’s son, Stuart Conrad, serves as vice president and director of

FMC and FMC Uruguay and a portfolio manager for WOF Master.
9

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 10 of 35

38.

In addition to his work for FMC and FMC Uruguay, Stuart Conrad

owns and operates Advanced Image Resources, Inc. (“AIR”), a Georgia
corporation that produces environmentally friendly printer toner and other
products.
39.

FMC and FMC Uruguay disclosed to investors that they charged each

fund an annual management fee ranging between 1.15 percent and 2.18 percent of
the fund’s total assets.
40.

Each year, FMC and FMC Uruguay were also entitled to receive

certain performance allocations if the funds’ performances exceeded certain
benchmarks.
C.

Conrad Misrepresents and Omits Material Facts
1.

41.

Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Conrad’s
Compensation and Conflict of Interest

In January 2013, Conrad, without any disclosure to investors or

prospective investors, arranged to increase his compensation from WOF Master by
appointing himself to be a sub-manager, for a fee, for approximately a third of
WOF Master’s assets. This fee was in addition to the fees disclosed to investors.

10

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 11 of 35

42.

In connection with appointing himself a sub-manager, Conrad

unilaterally decided to pay himself an undisclosed fee of one percent per year, on
top of the one percent yearly management fee and .18 percent administrative fee
that investors already paid annually.
43.

Conrad’s scheme to siphon off approximately $50,000 per year

through the undisclosed fee made the statements in the funds’ offering memoranda
and marketing materials regarding adviser compensation materially false and
misleading.
44.

In addition, Conrad’s failure to disclose that he was taking additional

amounts out of investors’ pockets was a material omission.
45.

Because FMC and FMC Uruguay were the general partners for the

feeder funds, and because Conrad controlled FMC and FMC Uruguay, Conrad
alone evaluated and selected sub-managers for WOF Master’s assets.
47.

A conflict of interest existed because Conrad, as head of FMC and

FMC Uruguay, represented the interests of the feeder funds and WOF Master, but
also had a personal interest in awarding the sub-manager business to himself.

11

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 12 of 35

48.

That conflict of interest should have been, but was not, disclosed to

investors and prospective investors.
2.
49.

Failure to Disclose Conrad’s Disciplinary History

In the “Management” section of offering memoranda for World Fund

II, dated January 2011 and January 2013, Conrad represented that he managed the
investment portfolio of a non-profit organization since 1965.
50.

In another document, a disclosure brochure for the World Fund II

dated approximately January 2012, Conrad touted that FMC has been “managing
wealth since 1965” and related that he has held a seat on the PhiladelphiaBaltimore-Washington Stock Exchange.
51.

WOF Master marketing materials from 2014 also provided a history

of Conrad’s background, including his founding and operation of Conrad and
Company, a registered broker-dealer, beginning in 1965.
52.

Between at least December 2011 through July 2014, Conrad also

distributed a series of “Investor Fact Sheets,” mostly in connection with soliciting
investors for World Fund II. The Investor Fact Sheets list some of Conrad’s career
accomplishments going back to the 1960s.

12

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 13 of 35

53.

Conrad, FMC, and FMC Uruguay prepared and distributed these

marketing materials to investors and prospective investors in connection with the
offer and sale interests in these funds.
54.

On information and belief, in face-to-face and telephonic pitches to

prospective investors, Conrad, FMC, and FMC Uruguay described Conrad’s
experience as they were detailed in the above-mentioned offering memoranda and
marketing materials.
55.

In 2013, a prospective investor who eventually invested $1 million

into World Fund II and BVI, met with Conrad and asked him whether Conrad had
any skeletons in his closet.
56.

Conrad denied “skeletons in his closet” and did not disclose his bar

from association with any broker-dealer or the Commission’s finding that he was
unfit to engage in the securities industry in any capacity.
57.

Neither in the above-referenced offering memoranda and investor fact

sheets, nor in meetings with prospective investors did Conrad disclose that the SEC
(a) barred him from association with any broker-dealer, (b) revoked the registration
of the broker dealer for which Conrad was the majority owner (Conrad
&Company, Inc.), and (c) found that Conrad was unfit to engage in the securities
13

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 14 of 35

business in any capacity. Nor was it disclosed that the Philadelphia-BaltimoreWashington Exchange suspended Conrad for three months in March 1970.
58.

The omission of Conrad’s disciplinary history was particularly

material given that the Commission, in its order against Conrad, opined that “(t)he
record amply demonstrates not only Conrad’s unfitness for assuming any
proprietary or supervisory role with a broker-dealer, but for engaging in the
securities industry in any capacity. The numerous violations and the supervisory
failure found with respect to him are compounded by the lack of candor he
displayed in these proceedings.”
59.

Additionally, the Investor Fact Sheets were misleading in that they

provided the historical positive performance history of certain investments, such as
soybean farms and precious metals, before such investments were actually
acquired by World Fund II. Moreover, in a section describing the six year
performance history of current fund investments, the fact sheet from July 2014
gives World Fund II’s weighted average performance in 2009 and 2010, although
the fund was not established until 2011.

14

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 15 of 35

60.

Finally, the Investor Fact sheets misidentified a third party accountant

as an “auditor” when the accountant never actually audited the financials
statements of the funds.
61.

Subsequently, in 2014, Conrad and FMC Uruguay retained an

accountant to actually audit WOF Master’s financial statements for the year 2013.
62.

That auditor stated that its opinion was subject to possible adjustments

for (1) an inability to verify the fair value of certain investments and limited
partnerships comprising 17 percent of WOF Master’s total assets, (2) the lack of
third party confirmation to verify the existence of a “Basket of Metals” purportedly
worth $88,515, (3) the status of Conrad as principal of the general partner and
custodian in his own name of WOF Master’s investments in metal and land, and
(4) the lack of an audit of WOF, which comprised 36 percent of the partner’s
capital.
3.
63.

Failure to Disclose Conrad’s Transfers to His Family Members

Conrad alone decided how to spend the investor assets invested

through the feeder funds into WOF Master.

15

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 16 of 35

64.

On two occasions, Conrad chose to use investor funds to directly

benefit members of his family, but did not disclose this to investors or prospective
investors.
65.

Specifically, in February 2010, Conrad used investor funds to pay

approximately $18,000 in credit card bills incurred by his daughter-in-law. Conrad
paid the money from the WOF Master account in return for a promise to repay the
money with 12 percent interest. In 2012, Conrad arranged for FMC to purchase
the loan from WOF Master at face value and to remove it from the latter’s books as
an undesirable miscellaneous item. This “loan” was not disclosed to investors.
66.

In July 2013, Conrad allowed his son, Dale Conrad, who sometimes

held the title of “fund administrator” to write himself a $26,500 check from the
WOF Master account for the purchase of a truck. Dale repaid the money two
months later, but paid no interest on the use of the $26,500. This “loan” was not
disclosed to investors.
4.
67.

Failure to Disclose Conrad’s Titling Fund Assets in his
Personal Name

During the relevant period, Conrad used investor funds to purchase

two soybean farms in Uruguay.

16

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 17 of 35

68.

Rather than title the soybean farms in the name of WOF Master,

Conrad took title to the farms personally.
69.

Similarly, Conrad used investor funds to purchase precious metals

worth approximately $88,000, buying them in his own name rather than in the
name of WOF Master.
70.

In none of the offering memoranda or marketing materials does

Conrad or FMC disclose that the Conrad will hold title personally to assets
purchased with investor funds.
D.

Defendants’ Fraudulent Redemption Practices

71.

In November 2008, Conrad sent a notice to investors that FMC was

temporarily suspending “all withdrawals, redemptions and termination of capital
accounts in the Fund.”
72.

Conrad blamed the suspension on the then-current global market crisis

as well as a cash and liquidity problem arising from the calling of a $17 million
line of credit.
73.

By mid-2012 approximately 29 investors were seeking to redeem

some or all of their investment in Conrad’s funds.

17

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 18 of 35

74.

In an email communication to investors dated December 2008,

Conrad wrote that FMC “cannot disburse any funds to partners unless all are
treated equally.”
75.

Neither in the notice of suspension nor afterwards did Conrad or FMC

notify investors that they would or did grant exceptions to the suspension, thereby
deviating substantially from the “all are treated equally” representation.
76.

Secretly, Conrad excepted himself and FMC from the redemption

restriction, redeeming roughly $2 million of FMC’s investment in the funds for his
personal benefit.
77.

Conrad used significant amounts of the cash he received from the

FMC redemptions to, among other things, pay his $180,000 per year salary, pay his
wife $72,000 per year, and make a $100,000 down payment on an airplane.
78.

On a separate occasion in 2012, Conrad redeemed $24,000 from his

personal investment in the funds, again for a down payment on an airplane. The
funds were returned a few days later when the planned purchase fell through.
79.

Like FMC and like his father, Stuart Conrad benefitted from

undisclosed redemptions from the funds while other investors’ requests for
redemption were rejected.

18

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 19 of 35

80.

Stuart Conrad received $160,000 from the funds in 2010 alone,

usually in increments of $15,000.
81.

In 2011, Stuart Conrad received another $30,000 in payments from

82.

In 2012, Conrad redeemed $15,000 from his WOF Master account

FMC.

and transferred the cash directly to Stuart Conrad.
83.

In April 2012, FMC redeemed $25,000 from its WOF Master account

and paid the funds to AIR, a company owned by Stuart Conrad.
84.

During 2013 and the first six months of 2014, WOF Master made ten

payments totaling $214,000 to both Stuart Conrad and AIR.
85.

Cumulatively, between 2009 and 2014, Stuart Conrad received, either

directly or indirectly, approximately $444,000 in redemptions from his WOF
Master investments or redemptions from the WOF Master investments of Conrad
and/or FMC.
86.

At the time of each of the redemptions and receipts outlined above,

Stuart Conrad was a Director of FMC and the funds.
87.

At the time of each of the redemptions and receipts outlined above,

Stuart Conrad knew that Conrad had notified all investors that all redemptions
requests would be suspended.
19

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 20 of 35

88.

At the time of each of the redemptions and receipts described above,

Stuart Conrad knew that Conrad and FMC had pledged to investors that FMC
could “not disburse any funds to partners unless all are treated equally.”
89.

At the time of each of the redemptions and receipts outlined above,

Stuart Conrad knew that the money he received came from redemptions of either
his, his father’s, or FMC’s interest in the funds.
90.

At the time of each of the redemptions and receipts outlined above,

Stuart Conrad knew that his receipt of funds was a deviation from the policy he
had disclosed to investors and which purportedly applied to all investors.
91.

At the time of each of the redemptions and receipts outlined above,

Stuart Conrad knew that neither FMC, Conrad, nor he were disclosing to investors
or prospective investors that Stuart Conrad received money from fund redemptions
when other investors were denied such redemptions.
92.

Beyond the Conrad family and its associated private business

ventures, Conrad also gave favored investors in the funds exceptions to the
redemption restrictions.
93.

In June 2013, WOF Master loaned $20,000 to Investor A, an investor

in WOF Master and the co-owner of Stuart Conrad’s business, AIR.

20

Case 1:16-cv-02572-LMM Document 1 Filed 07/15/16 Page 21 of 35

94.

Although Conrad claimed that the loan to Investor A was in lieu of a

redemption that Gandolfi had requested, when that loan went unpaid, it was
resolved through redemption of Gandolfi’s investment in the funds.
95.

In May 2012, Investor B, an investor in the funds, sued FMC on

behalf of a trust for which he was the trustee. FMC settled the lawsuit with a
payment of $725,000 in May 2013, redeeming the investor’s interest in the funds
to make the settlement payment.
96.

Another investor in the funds, a Family Limited Partnership, had

requested redemption of its investment for many months preceding 2013.
97.

Rather than meet those redemption requests as it met the requests of

all other investors (with a denial), Conrad entered into an agreement with the
Family Partnership whereby Conrad allowed redemption of the Family
Partnership’s interest in the funds, with the proceeds paid into a separate account
that Conrad managed.
