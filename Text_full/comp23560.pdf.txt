UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA

Ft. Myers Division
CASE NO.:

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
Plaintiff,
v.

KINGDOM LEGACY GENERAL PARTNER, LLC
and MARK C. NORTHROP,
Defendants.

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges:
I.

INTRODUCTION

1.

The Commission brings this action to enjoin unregistered investment advisers

Kingdom Legacy General Partner, LLC ("KLGP") and Mark C. Northrop, founder, CEO and

managing member of Kingdom Legacy Fund, LLC ("KLF"), from further violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.
2.

From approximately December 2010 through at least September 2015, KLGP and

Northrop, individually and through his entity, KLF, conducted an offering fraud in which they
fraudulently siphoned to themselves at least $3 million in undisclosed fees charged to investors.
3.

Between December 2010 and September 2015, KLGP and Northrop (collectively

the "Defendants") raised at least $10 million from at least 40 investors. Northrop and KLGP

Case 2:16-cv-00441-SPC-MRM Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 2 of 18 PageID 2

offered interests in KLF through three share classes: (i) KLF Conservative Series A ("KLF

Conservative"); (ii) KLF Aggressive Series B ("KLF Aggressive"); and (iii) beginning in

September 2011, KLF Ultra Conservative A-10 ("KLF A-10") (collectively referred to as "the
Kingdom Share Classes").

4.
manager in

KLGP and Northrop represented to investors that KLF's affiliated investment
charge

of portfolio

management,

Kingdom

Legacy

Management,

LLC

("Management"), charged an asset management fee of 2% per year and KLGP, the fund
manager, received an incentive allocation fee of 20% of all profits made from trading in the
Kingdom Share Classes. These profits were subject to a "high watermark," meaning that the
20% would only be taken when profits were made, and if there were losses, the fee would only

be imposed as to subsequent profits once they exceeded the amount of the losses.
5.

Unbeknownst to KLF's investors, however, KLGP and Northrop also charged

additional undisclosed fees of 40% of the trading profits in KLF Aggressive, and 50% of the
trading profits in KLF Conservative and KLF A-10.

6.

In addition to failing to disclose these excessive hidden 40% or 50% fees, KLGP

and Northrop made other material misrepresentations to investors, claiming that (a) Northrop had

a long-standing successful investing track record, (b) Northrop's family was the largest investor
in KLF, and (c) the Northrop family only made money when investors made money.
7.

In September 2015, long after Northrop had become aware of the Commission's

investigation, Northrop sent investors an addendum to the offering materials, disclosing, for the
first time, these additional fees.

Northrop requested that investors sign the addendum in an

attempt to retroactively cure the fraudulent offering and force investors to waive any legal claims
the investors may have had against him.

Case 2:16-cv-00441-SPC-MRM Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 3 of 18 PageID 3

8.

Through their conduct, KLGP and Northrop each have violated and, unless

enjoined, will continue to violate the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal
securities laws.

9.

Accordingly, the Commission seeks an order permanently enjoining the Defendants

from further violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"),

15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and 77e(c); Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a); Section
10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), 15 U.S.C. §

78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5; and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) and Rules 206(4)8(a)(1) and 206(4)-8(a)(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act"), 15 U.S.C. §§

80b-6(l), 80b-6(2), 80b-6(4), and 17 C.F.R. §§ 275.206(4)-8(a)(l) and (a)(2). Unless restrained
and enjoined, Defendants are reasonably likely to continue to violate the federal securities laws.
10. The Commission also seeks disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, including

prejudgment interest thereon; an order directing the Defendants to pay civil money penalties; and
any other relief that may be necessary and appropriate.
II.

DEFENDANTS

11.

KLGP is a Florida limited liability company based out of Fort Myers, Florida that

Northrop formed in January 2009. KLGP is KLF's fund manager and is responsible for the
selection and the overall allocation of KLF's assets. KLGP controls the access and movement of

KLF's assets under management. KLGP is the "alter ego" of Northrop, who controls KLGP by
exercising ultimate authority over all KLGP's decisions, statements and activities.
12.

Mark Northrop, age 65, resides in Lehigh Acres, Florida. Northrop has been a

licensed CPA since April 26, 1983. From April 24, 2003 to November 14, 2007, Northrop held a
Series 7 license and was formerly associated with a broker-dealer that is no longer registered

Case 2:16-cv-00441-SPC-MRM Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 4 of 18 PageID 4

with the Commission. Northrop is the founder, CEO, and managing member of KLF, and he
controls its operations. Northrop maintains and exercises ultimate authority over KLF, KLGP
and all limited liability companies formed by him that act as nominees and are used to move
assets to him.
III.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

13.

The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d)(1), and

22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d)(l), and 77v(a); Sections 21(d) and 27 of

the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa; and Sections 209(d) and 214(a) of the Advisers
Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-9(d) and 80b-14(a).

14.

This Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants, and venue is proper in the

Middle District of Florida, because many of the acts and transactions constituting violations of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the Advisers Act occurred in the Middle District of

Florida. In addition, Northrop's residence and KLGP's principal place of business were both
located in the Middle District of Florida.

15.

In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Defendants, directly or

indirectly, singly or in concert with others, made use of the means or instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, the means and instruments of transportation or communication in interstate
commerce, or the mails.

IV.

DEFENDANTS* FRAUDULENT INVESTMENT SCHEME

A.

16.

Background

Through word of mouth, at church gatherings and through publications, KLGP and

Northrop enticed investors to invest in KLF. In most cases investors were provided with a copy
of the KLF and KLGP Private Placement Memorandum ("PPM"), dated October 1, 2010, either

in person or by mail, either at the time they invested or shortly thereafter.
17.

KLF's website boasted, "Most people invested in the stock market need the market

to go up for them to make money. With us....Bull or Bear...Who Cares! It doesn't matter the
direction of the stock market.. .or what the economy does."

18. The emphasized tagline in KLF's accompanying brochure stated that KLF "was
established to PRODUCE A BOUNTIFUL HARVEST for our clients. IT IS OUR DESIRE TO
HELP YOU ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMS and unlock THE DOOR OF OPPORTUNITY to

fields ofABUNDANT BLESSINGS." The brochure then went on to emphasize that KLF was a
family-owned and operated investment fund.
19.

The PPM described the offering as interests in KLF, whereby investors became

members of the specific Kingdom Share Class they chose in their subscription agreements. The
PPM described two share classes - KLF Conservative and KLF Aggressive.

20.

Sometime later, Northrop also began offering investments in a third share class

called KLF A-10.

Northrop orally described KLF A-10 to prospective investors as ultra

conservative. There were no written offering materials for KLF A-10 and therefore no written
PPM describing KLF A-10's investments and fees.

Case 2:16-cv-00441-SPC-MRM Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 6 of 18 PageID 6

21.

The

PPM

touted

the

advantages

of investing

through

KLF,

including

diversification, lower transaction costs, experienced management, investor limited liability, and
administrative convenience.

22.

The PPM touted "Economies of Scale - Lower Transaction Costs," asserting that

the trade size and volume of trading "may enable [KLF] to obtain lower commission rates than

would otherwise be available to smaller portfolios invested independently in the strategies
applied by [KLF]."

23.

KLF purportedly traded investors' assets through affiliated or third-party managers.

Trading activity in the Kingdom Share Classes involved trading options on one or more market

indices including both equities and commodities.

In reality, the affiliate and "third-party

managers" were limited liability companies formed and controlled by Northrop through his
nominees, including his wife and sons. All of the trading was being executed and managed
entirely by Northrop or his stepson.
B.

Misrepresentations and Omissions

(1)

24.

Excessive Undisclosed Fees

Despite Northrop telling investors, and the PPM specifically indicating, that there

was only a 2% annual asset management fee and a 20% investment incentive allocation fee on
any profits made each month, KLGP and Northrop first charged investors 40% or 50%
(depending on the share class) in fees on monthly trading profits.
25.

Specifically, through an elaborate structure of limited liability companies and bank

accounts controlled by Northrop, an initial 40% or 50% of the trading profits were taken from

investors before the amount remaining was then subjected to the 2% annual asset management
fee (1/12 of 2% monthly) and the 20% incentive fee, subject to the high watermark provision.

Case 2:16-cv-00441-SPC-MRM Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 7 of 18 PageID 7

26.

The beginning balance and the indicated profits for the month on investors'

monthly statements had already been reduced by this 40% or 50% fee without any indication to

the investors. Hence, investors were kept in the dark that KLGP and Northrop had skimmed
these fees for themselves and were funneling them to entities controlled by Northrop.
(2)

False Statements that KLF Only Makes
Money When Investors Make Money

27.

In KLF's accompanying brochure, KLGP and Northrop, after asserting that each of

KLF's principals and employees had personal investments in KLF which were invested in the
same pool as the investors, falsely claimed that the principals and employees of KLF "only make
money when you make money."

28.

KLF's website also falsely stated "Our fund is one big pool of money. If the fund

makes 2% for the month we all make 2% for the month. If the fund loses 1% for the month we
all lose 1% for the month..."

29.

These statements were false, as the fortunes of the principals and employees of KLF

were not always tied to investors.

In 2011, KLGP and Northrop together collected over $1

million, and in 2014 almost $500,000, in revenue from fees from both KLF Conservative and

KLF Aggressive investors, despite the fact that investors lost as much as 19% in KLF
Conservative and 11% in KLF Aggressive in 2011, and 28% in KLF Aggressive and 0.5% in
KLF Conservative in 2014.

30.

Further, there are other instances in which KLGP and Northrop made money

through taking fees while the investors experienced overall losses. Beginning in January 2012,
monthly profits or losses were accounted for in four categories:. Section 1256 trading, short term
capital, interest, and account expenses.

Case 2:16-cv-00441-SPC-MRM Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 8 of 18 PageID 8

31.

In most periods, rather than netting the profit and losses in all the categories before

calculating his 40% and 50% undisclosed fee, Northrop collected a fee from any individual
category that showed a profit while allocating 100% of any category that showed a loss to the
investor.

32.

This practice resulted in Northrop collecting a fee in months when the net amount

allocated to investors was a loss.

(3)

False Statements and Omissions Regarding
KLF's and Northrop's Background and Past Performance

33.

KLGP and Northrop made various misrepresentations and omitted material facts

concerning Northrop's investing acumen and the past performance of investments he managed.

The PPM proclaimed that Northrop had "more than thirty years of successful financial and
business management experience." In a letter at least one investor received, Northrop, after
boasting he was regarded as a "mathematical guru," claimed he had "increased each investor's

account by double digit returns every year since he started managing hedge funds beginning in
2000." Promotions also touted KLF's performance as "14 years of Proven Performance through

all kinds of market movements." They also boasted that their investing strategy gave them "the
opportunity to continue earning consistent, conservative monthly returns of 1-2% per month in
order to generate double digit annual compound returns."

34.

However, in none of these promotions was it disclosed that (a) Northrop previously

operated a hedge fund called CPA Directed Investments ("CPA") that experienced tremendous
losses and was dissolved by Northrop in 2008, and (b) in 2009, Northrop and CPA were sued
under the anti-fraud provisions of the Kansas Uniform Securities Act and a default judgment was
entered against them.

Case 2:16-cv-00441-SPC-MRM Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 9 of 18 PageID 9

(4)

False Claims Regarding Northrop's Family Being the Largest
Investor in KLF

35.

KLGP and Northrop made false statements on KLF's website claiming "Our family

is the largest investor in the fund...which means NOBODY is going to watch your money any
closer than we do."

36.

However, at no time were KLGP, Management, and Northrop's stepson, Landon

Sexton ("Northrop's Family"), the largest investor in KLF. Indeed, while investors bought into
KLF in December 2010, Northrop's Family did not even invest in KLF until November 2011.

Furthermore, from the time Northrop's Family did invest in KLF, through at least September
2014, at least two investors always held a larger investment in KLF than Northrop's Family.
Moreover, in many different months during the same time period of November 2011 through

September 2014, several investors held larger investments in KLF than Northrop's Family.
(5)

Attempt to Retroactively Cure Fraudulent Offering
Through False and Misleading Addendum

37.

In September 2015, in an effort to retroactively cure the undisclosed and fraudulent

fee structure, Northrop sent letters to all the KLF investors telling them to sign an enclosed
Addendum "to try and eliminate any confusion any of our investors may have" concerning
KLF's fee structure. Northrop told investors that "I should have made clear these returns to you,
the investor, are AFTER ALL FEES."

38.

The September 2015 Addendum, for the first time ever, disclosed that KLF

Conservative and KLF Aggressive paid, respectively 50% and 40% of profits to "third party"
managers which were affiliated managers of KLF, before any income was allocated to KLF and
hence to investors.

Case 2:16-cv-00441-SPC-MRM Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 10 of 18 PageID 10

39.

Northrop sent this letter to investors long after he was aware the Commission's

investigation into the matter had begun. Further, these statements were also false and misleading
because the "third party" managers were not bona fide third parties but in fact were entities that
were alter-egos of Northrop that he created and controlled and used as conduits to pass money
through to Northrop.
