SUMMARY OF THE ACTION

8

10
11

5.

This case involves unlawful insider trading by Peter D. Nunan in the securities of

FSI International, Inc., a Minnesota-based semiconductor equipment company. In 2012, Nunan
traded on material, nonpublic information that Tokyo Electron Ltd., a Japanese semiconductor

12
13
14

equipment company, was in negotiations to acquire FSI. At the time, Nunan was a senior
engineering executive at the U.S. subsidiary of another Japanese semiconductor equipment

15

company, Screen Holdings Company, Ltd. A member of FSI’s board of directors provided

16

Nunan with material, nonpublic information concerning the acquisition in an attempt to solicit a

17

competing bid from Screen Holdings. Over the course of many months, Nunan was a conduit for

18

confidential information about the acquisition negotiations from the FSI director to an executive

19
at Screen Holdings responsible for evaluating potential corporate acquisitions.
20
21

6.

Pursuant to his employment agreement and his company’s policies, Nunan had a

22

duty not to trade on or otherwise misuse confidential information concerning this potential

23

acquisition. In breach of that duty, between February 14 and August 9, 2012, Nunan purchased in

24

his personal accounts 105,000 shares of FSI stock using the material, nonpublic information that

25

the FSI director had provided him about the potential acquisition of FSI. Nunan also

26

recommended the trade to his brother, who purchased 1000 shares of FSI stock in July 2012.

7.

On the morning of August 13, 2012, Tokyo Electron and FSI publicly announced

that they had entered into a definitive agreement for Tokyo Electron to acquire FSI, pursuant to a
cash tender offer, at a price of $6.20 per share. This agreed purchase price represented a premium

4
of more than 50% over the prior closing price of FSI stock at $4.04 per share. That day, after the
5
6

public announcement of the acquisition, the price of FSI stock increased over 52% on heavy

7

trading and closed at a price of $6.16 per share. The next day Nunan sold most of his FSI stock.

8

The illicit profits from his unlawful trading and tipping totaled $254,858.

8.

By engaging in the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Nunan violated the antifraud

provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)
[15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78n(e)], and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5

12

14

and 240.1 4e-3]. The Commission seeks in this action a permanent injunction, disgorgement with
prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.

At all relevant times in this Complaint, Nunan was as a Senior Engineering Fellow

at Screen SPE USA, the U.S. subsidiary of Screen Holdings, a Japanese semiconductor

15

15.

No later than February 2012, a member of FSI’s board of directors who had a

professional relationship with Nunan informed Nunan that Tokyo Electron was in negotiations to
acquire FSI. The director told Nunan this confidential information because FSI’s board of

4
directors was interested in soliciting a competing bid for FSI. Nunan worked for the U.S.
5
6

subsidiary of Screen Holdings, another semiconductor equipment company. The FSI director

7

knew Nunan had a professional relationship with an executive at Screen Holdings responsible for

8

evaluating potential corporate acquisitions, and Nunan acted as a conduit for information between

9

the FSI director and the executive at Screen Holdings.

10
11

16.

From at least early February 2012 and continuing through August 2012, the FSI

director provided Nunan with material, nonpublic information about Tokyo Electron’s

12
13
14

negotiations to acquire FSI. This included information about proposed pricing and the timing and
progress of due diligence. Nunan provided this information to the executive at Screen Holdings

15

responsible for evaluating a potential competing bid, and he also gathered additional information

16

about FSI as requested by the executive. Ultimately, Screen Holdings did not submit a competing

17

bid.

18

17.

Nunan knew from the material, nonpublic information that the FSI director had

19
provided him, that Tokyo Electron was bidding to acquire FSI at a substantial premium over the
20
21

market price of FSI stock. Nunan received the material, nonpublic information about the

22

potential acquisition in the course of his employment, and had a duty not to trade on or otherwise

23

misuse the confidential information for his personal benefit.

24
25
26

18.

In breach of his duty, Nunan traded on the material, nonpublic information.

Between February 14 and August 9, 2012, Nunan purchased 105,000 shares of FSI in his personal
brokerage accounts at a weighted average price of approximately $3.76 per share. Additionally,

2

shares of FSI on July 23, 2012 at a price of $3.45 per share.

On the morning of August 13, 2012, Tokyo Electron and FSI publicly announced

4
that they had entered into a definitive agreement for Tokyo Electron to acquire FSI, pursuant to a
5

cash tender offer, at price of $6.20 per share. The agreed purchase price represented a premium

7

of more than 50% over the prior day’s market closing price of $4.04 per share. After the public

8

announcement of the acquisition, the market price of FSI stock increased more than 52% on

9

heavy trading and closed at a price of $6.16 per share. Nunan sold most of his FSI stock the

10
11

following day. The illicit profits, realized and unrealized, from his unlawful trading and tipping
totaled $254,858.
