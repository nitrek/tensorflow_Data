INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940
Release No. 4402 / May 27, 2016
Admin. Proc. File No. 3-14162

In the Matter of
JOHN W. LAWTON

ORDER VACATING NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING
ORGANIZATION AND MUNICIPAL ADVISOR BARS
John W. Lawton seeks to vacate an administrative order, dated December 13, 2012 (the
"Order"), to the extent that it bars him from association with any nationally recognized statistical
rating organization ("NRSRO") or municipal advisor.1 The NRSRO and municipal advisor bars
at issue were imposed based solely on conduct occurring prior to July 22, 2010, the effective date
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.2 Accordingly, in our
discretion, we vacate the Order to the extent it prohibits John W. Lawton from associating with
any NRSRO or municipal advisor, but otherwise leave the Order unmodified.
By the Commission.
