In the Matter of

EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested a fourth extension of time
until September 8, 2015 for entry of an order approving or disapproving the proposed plans of
distribution (“Plans”) that were noticed for public comment on August 14, 2014.
On November 16, 2012, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist
Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order
(“Order”) against Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (“Credit Suisse”), DLJ Mortgage
Capital, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston Mortgage Acceptance Corp., Credit Suisse First
Boston Mortgage Securities Corp., and Asset Backed Securities Corporation (“Asset Backed
Securities”) (collectively, “Respondents”). 1 The Order stated that Credit Suisse and affiliated
entities made omissions of material facts and failed to comply with offering documents in
transactions for which Respondents sponsored and/or underwrote residential mortgage backed
securities. The Commission simultaneously accepted Respondents’ offers of settlement,
whereby Respondents agreed to pay disgorgement of $55,747,769, prejudgment interest of
$13,000,000, and a civil money penalty in the amount of $33,000,000 for violations relating to
the Bulk Settlements Practice, and Credit Suisse and an affiliate, Asset Backed Securities,
agreed to pay disgorgement of $10,056,561, prejudgment interest of $2,200,000, and a civil
money penalty in the amount of $6,000,000 for violations relating to the First Payment
Default Practice. The Order provided that, pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
1

Securities Act Rel. No. 9368 (Nov. 16, 2012).

Act of 2002, as amended, two separate fair funds may be created for the disgorgement,
interest and penalties paid by Respondents.
On August 14, 2014, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund
and Disgorgement Plans (“Rules”), 2 the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution (Bulk Settlements Practice) and Opportunity for Comment, and a Notice of
Proposed Plan of Distribution (First Payment Default Practice) and Opportunity for
Comment 3 (“Notices”) for the distribution of monies paid pursuant to the Order. The Notices
provided all interested parties thirty (30) days from the date of each Notice to submit a
comment on the Plans. The Commission received comments on the Plans. On December 19,
2014, February 27, 2015, and April 24, 2015, the Commission issued Extension Orders
extending the time to enter an order approving or disapproving the Plans until February 27,
2015, April 17, 2015, and June 6, 2015 respectively. 4 The extension is requested for both
Plans.
In its request for an extension of time, the Division states that additional time is needed
for further evaluation, analysis and consultation with other offices to properly address the
comments. Consequently, the Division requests that the Commission extend the time to issue
an order approving or disapproving the Plans to September 8, 2015.
Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 1104 of the Commission’s Rules, 5 for good cause
shown, it is hereby ORDERED that the time for entering an order approving or disapproving
the Plans is extended to September 8, 2015.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary
