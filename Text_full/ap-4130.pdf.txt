on August 10, 2016, alleging that each Respondent has a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is delinquent
in its periodic filings. Respondents were served with the OIP by August 15 and their answers
were due by August 29, 2016. Dominion Minerals Corp., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No.

conference for September 1, 2016, and notified Respondents that if they failed to file answers,
participate in the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend the proceeding, I would deem them
in default, determine that the allegations in the OIP were true, and revoke the registrations of
Respondents’ securities. Id.

registration of the registered securities of Dominion Minerals Corp. Dominion Minerals Corp.,
Exchange Act Release No. 78709, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3234. Foxwedge, Inc., Harrington
Resources, Inc., Juniper Acquisition Corporation, and Nexus Data Security Corp. have not filed
answers and did not participate in the September 1 prehearing conference. At the prehearing
conference, the Division of Enforcement stated that none of these remaining respondents had
contacted the Division.
I ORDER the remaining respondents to show cause by September 19, 2016, why the
registrations of their securities should not be revoked by default due to their failures to file timely
answers, appear at the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend this proceeding. OIP at 3; 17
