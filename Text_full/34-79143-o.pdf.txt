("Exchange Act") Section 12(g) because it is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-K for the period
ended December 31, 2013. On March 30, 2011, the Commission’s Division of Corporation
Finance (“Corporation Finance”) sent a delinquency letter to CCAA requesting compliance with
its periodic filing requirements which was delivered. As of October 13, 2016, the common stock

10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2009. On November 16, 2010, Corporation Finance
sent a delinquency letter to CHRN requesting compliance with its periodic filing requirements
but CHRN did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid address on
file with the Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule 301 of Regulation S-T, 17
C.F.R. Section 232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual). As of October 13, 2016, the
common stock of CHRN was quoted on OTC Link, had three market makers, and was eligible
for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
It appears to the Commission that there is a lack of current and accurate information
concerning the securities of Daystar Technologies, Inc. (“DSTI”) (CIK No. 1262200), a void

registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g) because it is delinquent
in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a
Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2012. On February 19, 2016, Corporation
Finance sent a delinquency letter to DSTI requesting compliance with its periodic filing
requirements but DSTI did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid

S-T, 17 C.F.R. Section 232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual). As of October 13,
2016, the common stock of DSTI was quoted on OTC Link, had eight market makers, and was
eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).

the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g) because it is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for
the period ended September 30, 2014. On January 21, 2016, Corporation Finance sent a
delinquency letter to HJOE requesting compliance with its periodic filing requirements but
HJOE did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid address on file
with the Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule 301 of Regulation S-T, 17 C.F.R.
Section 232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual). As of October 13, 2016, the
common stock of HJOE was quoted on OTC Link, had seven market makers, and was eligible
for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors
require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed companies. Therefore, it is
ordered, pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(k), that trading in the securities of the above-listed
companies is suspended for the period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on October 24, 2016, through 11:59
