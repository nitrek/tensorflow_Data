ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17004

In the Matter of
DEVEN SELLERS and
ROLAND BARRERA

ORDER FOLLOWING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

This proceeding commenced with the issuance of an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
against Respondents Deven Sellers and Roland Barrera on December 15, 2015. Respondents
and the Division of Enforcement submitted a proposed briefing schedule to resolve the case by
motions for summary disposition, and I issued an order adopting that schedule on January 28,
2016. Deven Sellers, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3547, 2016 SEC LEXIS 299.
A telephonic prehearing conference was held today at Barrera’s request. Based on the
stipulations already reached in this matter and on Respondents’ positions regarding the
allegations in the OIP, I dispensed with the requirement for Respondents to file answers to the
OIP. I also clarified that the summary disposition briefing schedule applied to both parties, such
that in addition to filing an opposition to the Division’s motion for summary disposition,
Respondents may each file their own motion for summary disposition according to the same
schedule set forth in my January 28 order.
SO ORDERED.
