ORDER FOLLOWING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE
AND TO SHOW CAUSE

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative
Proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on
December 8, 2015, alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission
and are delinquent in their periodic filings. I previously notified the parties that a telephonic
prehearing conference would be held on December 28, 2015. Cadan Res. Corp., Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3428, 2015 SEC LEXIS 5226 (Dec. 22, 2015).
I previously found that Respondents were served with the OIP by December 16, 2015,
and that their answers were due by December 29, 2015. Id. To date, none of the Respondents
has filed an answer. At the December 28, 2015, prehearing conference, the Division of
Enforcement appeared, but Respondents did not.
Accordingly, I ORDER Respondents to SHOW CAUSE by January 15, 2016, why the
registrations of their securities should not be revoked by default due to their failure to file
answers, appear at the scheduled prehearing conference, or otherwise defend this proceeding. If
Respondents fail to respond to this Order, they will be deemed in default, the proceeding will be
determined against them, and the registrations of their securities will be revoked. OIP at 3; 17
C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(1)-(2), .220(f), .221(f).
