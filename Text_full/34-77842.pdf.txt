EXTENSION ORDER

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) has requested an
extension of time until May 31, 2016 to file the certified record in this matter. FINRA
states that applicant has not served FINRA with the application for review, and FINRA
has been unable to obtain a complete copy of the application by the applicant’s counsel,
who has been out of the office. Extensions of time are disfavored. It appears
appropriate, however, to grant FINRA’s request for good cause shown. Therefore,
It is ORDERED that the time for filing the certified record is extended to
May 31, 2016.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Jill M. Peterson
Assistant Secretary
