UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS
MIDLAND-ODESSA DIVISION

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
Plaintiff,
C.A. No. 7:16-cv-282
v.
JEFFERY A. MCCOLLUM AND
JNL OILFIELD INSTRUMENTS, LLC,
Defendants.

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) files this Complaint
against Defendants Jeffery A. McCollum (“McCollum”) and JNL Oilfield Instruments, LLC
(“JNL”), and alleges as follows:
SUMMARY OF THE ACTION
1.

Defendants raised more than $12 million from approximately 30 investors by

offering investment contracts for the purchase and resale of oilfield services equipment.
Defendants told investors that their money would be used to invest in used equipment that
Defendants would purchase and resell for large profits. These statements, however, were false.
In reality, Defendants were not purchasing the equipment and were instead using investor funds
to pay off earlier investors and to pay McCollum’s personal expenses.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
2.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d)(1),

and 22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d)(1), &

Case 7:16-cv-00282 Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 2 of 7

77v(a)], and Sections 21(d)(1), 21(d)(3)(A), 21(e), and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(1), 78u(d)(3)(A), 78u(e), & 78aa].
3.

Defendants have, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or

instrumentalities of interstate commerce and/or the mails in connection with the transactions,
acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.
4.

Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15

U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because certain of the
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of conduct constituting violations of the federal
securities laws occurred within this district. Among other things, Defendants offered and sold
the securities at issue in this district. McCollum also resides in this district and JNL’s principal
place of business is in this district.
DEFENDANTS
5.

Defendant Jeffery A. McCollum is an individual residing in Odessa, Texas.

6.

Defendant JNL Oilfield Instruments, LLC is a Texas limited liability company

with its principal place of business in Odessa, Texas. McCollum is the founder and owner of
JNL.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
7.

McCollum lives and works in Odessa, Texas. McCollum started JNL to provide

services to oilfield companies in West Texas. The business struggled, and McCollum found
himself short of funds to pay his business and personal expenses.
8.

McCollum decided to buy used oilfield services equipment that he believed he

could quickly resell for a profit. But McCollum did not have the money to purchase the
equipment. So McCollum began soliciting outside investors.

COMPLAINT

9.

McCollum told investors that he had specialized knowledge of, and contacts in,

the thriving used equipment market, and that he was staring a business venture to capitalize on
resale opportunities. McCollum would then tell investors that he had identified a specific piece
of equipment for sale. McCollum represented that if the investor provided funds to JNL to
purchase the equipment, the investor would be guaranteed a high rate of return on their
investment. Typically, McCollum would promise a specific rate of return of approximately 13%.
10.

The initial investors were people that McCollum or his family knew in the

Midland-Odessa area. Later, McCollum took a job at a local dealership for a major construction
equipment company. This put McCollum in contact with a stable of well-heeled individuals in
the oil and gas industry from whom he solicited additional funds.
11.

McCollum first operated his business under the fictitious name “Oilfield

Instruments” and then formed JNL in 2012. Beginning in 2009, and continuing through at least
June 2, 2015, McCollum raised more than $12 million from approximately 30 investors. The
investors contributed amounts ranging from several thousand to over a million dollars.
12.

McCollum, and JNL, by and through McCollum, affirmatively made multiple

misstatements and omissions directly to investors. More specifically, McCollum told investors
that their funds would be and were used, to purchase specific, identified pieces of used
equipment. But this was false and Defendants, with a few exceptions, did not actually purchase
any equipment. Instead, McCollum typically pooled investor funds in his company or personal
accounts and used the money to payback earlier investors and to pay unrelated expenses,
including personal expenses.
13.

In some instances, McCollum directed investors to make their investment checks

payable to the party purportedly selling the equipment. In truth, the payees were earlier investors

SEC v. McCollum, et al.
COMPLAINT

Page 3

Case 7:16-cv-00282 Document 1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 4 of 7

in the scheme. When investors requested details about an equipment transaction, McCollum
made up stories about fictitious pieces of equipment and phantom buyers. When asked to
provide stronger support, McCollum simply obtained photographs of unrelated equipment and
claimed that this was the equipment that had been purchased in connection with their investment.
On some occasions, McCollum also sent investors fake equipment invoices that he had created.
14.

These misrepresentations and omissions were undoubtedly material to a

reasonable investor, including because a reasonable investor would consider false statements
about the equipment purchases and how Defendants planned to use investor funds important in
making their investment decision. Investors turned over money to Defendants as a direct result
of Defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions.
15.

Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that their misrepresentations

and omissions were false and misleading. By making these misrepresentations and omissions to
fraudulently solicit investor funds, Defendants have acted with scienter. McCollum’s scienter is
imputed to JNL, because JNL acts through McCollum.
16.

The investments Defendants offered and sold are investment contracts and

securities within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The investors
expected that their returns would come solely from the efforts and expertise of Defendants in
identifying, purchasing, and reselling equipment. The investors had no role in the management
of JNL and no control over their investment. Defendants also pooled investor funds in one or
more bank accounts.
