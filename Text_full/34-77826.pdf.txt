ACT OF 1934, SECTION 203(f) OF THE
INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940
AND NOTICE OF HEARING

In the Matter of
John Steven Blount,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to
Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Section 203(f) of the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) against John Steven Blount (“Respondent” or
“Blount”).
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A.

RESPONDENT

1.
From September 1992 through December 2001, Blount was a registered
representative with NYLife Securities, Inc., a registered broker-dealer. From January 2002 through
August 2003, Blount was a registered representative with Pan-American Financial Advisers, a
Louisiana-based broker-dealer which withdrew its registration with the Commission on January 1,
1

2007. From approximately June 1, 2007, through December 17, 2014, Respondent offered and
sold securities to individual investors while acting as an unregistered investment adviser and broker.
Respondent, 55 years old, is a resident of Lake Charles, Louisiana.
B.

RESPONDENT’S CRIMINAL CONVICTION

1.
On July 16, 2015, Blount pled guilty in the United States District Court for
the Western District of Louisiana to wire fraud in violation of Title 18, United States Code Section
1343. On October 29, 2015, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 235 months (19.58 years) and
ordered to pay approximately $4.3 million in restitution. USA v. John Steven Blount, No. 15-CR00143 (W.D. La.) (Oct. 29, 2015). Blount is currently in custody at the Calcasieu Correctional
Center in Lake Charles, Louisiana, awaiting transfer to a Federal Bureau of Prisons facility.
2.
In his plea agreement, Blount stipulated that that from approximately June
1, 2007, through December 17, 2014, he orchestrated a Ponzi scheme while acting as an
unregistered investment adviser and broker. While holding himself out as an investment adviser
and broker, Blount solicited investors and offered at least 72 investors the opportunity to invest in
certain fictitious securities and received approximately $5.8 million. These investors were
primarily elderly and retired and invested all or substantially all of their respective retirement
funds. Using an internet website, personal, familial, business and charitable connections, Blount
represented to investors that he would ensure their retirement goals were met with “financial
products including IRA’s, health insurance, life insurance and investments” and offered personal
and business financial planning, retirement funding, annuities, life insurance and individual
retirement accounts. To allegedly meet their retirement goals, Blount personally induced investors
to purchase various securities such as bonds, investment contracts and promissory notes and
guaranteed exorbitant returns ranging up to 19 percent. In actuality, these securities did not exist
and Blount simply used the investors’ funds for his own personal use. In order to keep the scheme
operating, Blount admitted that he fabricated account statements and sent them to investors and used
a portion of the most recent investors’ funds to make lulling payments to prior investors to give
them a false impression of the performance of their investments.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it
necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be instituted
to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
B.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act;
C.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act; and
2

D.
Whether, pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, it is appropriate and
in the public interest to bar Blount from participating in any offering of penny stock, including:
acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in activities with a
broker, dealer or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny stock; or inducing or
attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock.
IV.
IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and before an
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the
Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220
of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.
If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly
notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against
him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as
provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310.
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent as provided for in the Commission’s
Rules of Practice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 210 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness
or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within
the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the
provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action.
By the Commission.
