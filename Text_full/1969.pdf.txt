One of the most serious problems facing the securities industry, the
investing public and the Commission today is the "back office" or
"paper work" problem. Its chief cause was the unprecedented rise in
share trading volume. Since 1965 the combined annual volume of the
New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange has increased from 2.1 to 4.4:billion shares. The increase with respect to peak
periods is even more dramatic. In 1962 the N ew York Stock Exchange
was experiencing an average daily volume of 3.8 million shares, and it
was projected that volume would double by 1975. Instead, volume
almost quadrupled by December of 1968, during which month the Exchange averaged 14.9 million shares daily. By hindsight, it seems that
the industry took longer than it should have to regard the progressively higher levels of activity as a new norm and to recognize that
such levels of activity would require fundamental changes. Because of
the prevalent tendency to view the increased trading as a temporary
phenomenon, for a long time the reaction of many firms was to attempt
to meet the new demand by more intensive use of their existing facilities. And, of the firms which attempted to meet the challenge by automating, some selected computer systems which had not been adequately
tested and which they did not have the personnel to utilize effectively.
Some firms survived the crisis only by reducing their operations to
manageable size, while others remain only as parts of larger firms
which acquired them.
One method of measuring the magnitude of the operational difficulties encountered throughout the securities industry is by statistics
regarding the number of complaints against broker-dealers received
by the Commission from members of the public. The Commission
has always paid close attention to letters from individual investors,
both because it feels a responsibility to protect public stockholders and
because an analysis of complaints may give the Commission insight
into previously unnoticed problems being experienced by a particular
firm or by the industry in general. In fiscal year 1969, however, the
Commission was so inundated with complaints that at times it was
unable to make a prompt reply to a complainant, much less an investigation of his charges.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Total complaints to the Commission against broker-dealers jumped
from 3,991 in fiscal 1968 to 12,494:in fiscal 1969. This increase is all the
more significant in light of the fact, which the Commission has learned
from inspections of broker-dealer records, that for every letter of complaint sent to the Commission, 20 others are handled directly by the
broker-dealer. Nine out of every 10 complaints currently filed relate
to back office matters, particularly the failure to deliver customers'
funds and securities, and virtually the entire increase in complaints
this past year can be attributed to such matters. Although many firms
with a large number of public customers came in for criticism, one
firm alone accounted for a 10th of the complaints. The Commission
has instituted proceedings against that firm and has cautioned many
other firms about their duty to handle customers' accounts properly
and service their complaints. The Commission is also encouraging the
self-regulatory bodies to exercise closer supervision of their members with regard to the handling of customer complaints. It is a cause
for concern that the number of complaints shows no signs of declining in fiscal 1970, but rather seems to be stabilizing at the rate of about
14,000 complaints a year.
Accompanying the trading volume peak in December 1968 was a
record number of "fails to deliver" (securities contracts which a
broker has not consummated by delivery of securities on settlement date). In that month, overdue contracts reached a total
of $4.1 billion, an amount which presented serious risks both to brokerage firms and their customers. With an improvement in operational
capabilities and a decline in trading volume during the last half of
fiscal year 1969 came a decrease in fails to $2.2 billion. The improvement in this key statistic is somewhat encouraging, and the restrictions
on trading hours have been eased so that at present trading on the
exchanges and in 'the over-the-counter market is taking place 5 hours
a day, 5 days a week. The Commission believes that through the joint
efforts of the Commission and the industry more progress can be made
in reducing the level of fails and in preventing fails from soaring with
an increase in share volume. One measure taken by the Commission to
assist in providing additional protections for the investing public was
to amend its net capital rule to impose a graduated percentage deduction from market value of securities in the "failed to deliver" accounts
of broker-dealers. By limiting the credit which firms can take for such
securities as assets, the rule requires the firms either to make delivery
of the securities or to reduce their aggregate indebtedness.
In dealing with the back-office problem, a nation-wide program of
inspecting broker-dealers on an emergency basis was implemented
by the Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers,

Inc. and the stock exchanges. This program singled out those firms
experiencing the greatest difficulties. Various measures were taken
during fiscal 1969 with respect to such firms, including warning letters,
office conferences, restrictions on operations and the institution of 36
administrative proceedings and 14 injunctive actions. Because of the
strain that back-office problems create on a firm's capital, in seven of
the injunctive actions brought by the Commission receivers were appointed. The Commission has worked very closely with the self-regulatory organizations in this area to encourage and assist them in identifying troubled firms and taking appropriate corrective action. Where
practicable the Commission coordinated its measures with those of the
self-regulatory organisations,'
The Commission has also encouraged and worked closely with the
self-regulatory organizations and private groups in studying the problems and devising means to process efficiently the present and projected
high levels of trading. The staff has met with groups to establish systems for the gathering and exchange of information on the financial
and operating conditions of the brokerage industry. Several studies
have been and are being conducted by private consultants retained by
stock exchanges or other organizations to solve the back -office problem
by modernizing the industry's operations through the use of systems
logic and modern technology in the processing of securities transactions. The Commission and its staff have actively encouraged these
studies and given of their time and effort to the extent possible, For
example, one major recommendation has been to adopt a nation-wide
system of clearing over-the-counter securities transactions so as to
reduce the movement of the various papers and stock certifioates. In
furtherance of this proposal, the Commission sponsored. a meeting in
February 1969 at which representatives of the self-regulatory organizations, the banking industry, broker-dealers, the Commission and
other government agencies discussed the proposal and reached certain
basic agreements as to the nature and operation of such a system.ll
Subsequent meetings on this matter have been held.
The Commission and its staff have also worked closely with the
American Bankers Association, with regard to its attempts to utilize
the capabilities of the computer with respect to the various forms
used to process securities transactions. The ABA Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures has developed a uniform num1See F6fTU cf Oompany, Securities

bering system for the identification of all securities, and has also issued
a report recommending the adoption of a man-machine-readable punch
card size stock certificate. The Commission and its staff assisted in the
studies that went into this report. A very auspicious development occurred in November 1969, when the New York and American Stock
Exchanges endorsed in principle the machine-readable stock certificate
and requested public comment on the Committee's report.
Despite the many unresolved operational problems which remained
as fiscal year 1969 drew to a close, there were signs that the crisis was
shifting from the operational to the financial area. Firms were increasingly experiencing difficulties in maintaining the required degree
of liquidity, in part because of the additional expenditures necessary to reduce the paperwork logjam, and in part because of
undercapitalization.
Automated Trading Information

Systems

Advances in electronic data processing during the last few years
have made possible the development of automated trading information
systems for securities. These systems generally involve the use of
time-shared computers to transmit, among persons having access to
them, indications of interest and, in some cases, firm offers and acceptances to purchase or sell securities. Consequently, such systems can
be programmed to facilitate various steps in the process of trading
securities, up to and including the actual execution of transactions.
During the 1969 fiscal year, plans for three automated systems
for the trading of blocks of securities, two of them under private sponsorship and the third to be sponsored by the New York Stock Exchange, were announced to the industry. The systems are all designed
to facilitate the bringing together of institutional buyers and sellers.
There are, however, substantial differences between them. The proposed "Instinet" system is designed to permit direct dealing on an
anonymous basis between institutions, without the -intervention of
brokers. The "AutEx" system, on the other hand, is geared more
toward the use of brokers and existing exchanges. Only brokers would
be allowed to enter into the system messages which disclose an interest to buy or sell, although institutional subscribers could enter general buying or selling preferences for particular securities. All negotiations would take place outside the system, and all executions would
be effected either on an exchange or over-the-counter. The third system, known as the Block Automation System ("BAS"), is being developed by the New York Stock Exchange. As proposed, this system
would be owned and controlled by the Exchange, only members of
the Exchange would be allowed to subscribe for broker terminals, and
entries would be limited to stocks listed on the Exchange. Institutions

THIRTY-FIFTH

would also be able to enter indications of interest, but all negotiations
would take place between member firms designated by the institutions.
In August 1969, the Commission released for comment proposed
Rule 15c2-10 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which
would provide a regulatory framework for automated trading information systems that are not within the existing scope of regulation of
exchanges and national securities associations," Any system for transmitting, among participants, subscribers or customers, indications of
interest or offers to purchase or sell securities through the use of a computer would be covered by the rule unless specifically exempted. The
rule would provide, among other things, that no broker or dealer may
operate or participate in such an automated trading information system unless a plan describing the system, detailing specific rules of
operation designed to prevent abuse of the system and providing for
adequate recordkeeping, has been submitted to and declared effective
by the Commission. The Commission could impose appropriate terms
and conditions. The proposed rule would thus permit operators of the
systems to develop flexible plans consistent with their own particular
technologies and at the same time permit the Commission to make
certain that such plans are consistent with its regulatory responsibilities. The Commission invited comments on both the regulatory status
of the various systems and the specific terms of the proposed rule.
During the past fiscal year further progress was made in the development of an automated quotations system for the over-the-counter
market to be known as the "NASDAQ System." 4 On December 11,
1968, following adoption by the NASD of by-law amendments authorizing establishment of the NASDAQ System and of rules governing the operation of and access to the system, the NASD signed a
1-year contract with the Bunker-Ramo Corporation to build and
operate the system. Presently scheduled to become operational in late
1910, the system envisions three levels of services capable of handling
as many as 20,000 different over-the-counter issues. Initially it will
provide instantaneous quotations on approximately 1,500 securities to
offices of brokers, retail traders and market makers throughout the
country.
Level I service will supply registered representatives of retail securities firms with immediate access to current representative bid and ask
quotations on over-the-counter securities. Level II service will supply
trading departments of securities firms and such other persons as the
NASD's Board of Governors may authorize with actual current quotaI Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 8661 (August 4, 1969).
• For a discussion of earlier stages in the development of this system, see 34th
Annual Report, pp. 15-16.

tions of over-the-counter market makers for securities included in
the system. Level ill service is similar to that of Level IT except that
it will be available only to market makers registered with the NASD
and will include input devices to enable market makers to insert their
current quotations into the system.
The NASDAQ System will also furnish end-of-day reports to newspapers and wire services for publication in the daily stock tables. These
reports will include volume figures and representative bid and ask
quotations and net price changes for the securities in the system. The
system will aid the NASD in its regulatory responsibilities by providing daily and other periodic summary reports of over-the-counter
activity.
After it became apparent that the N ASD would shortly enter into
an operating contract, the Commission, in late 1968, adopted Rule
15Aj-2 under the Exchange Act which prescribes certain requirements applicable to a national association of securities dealers which
establishes a system of quotations," These include the requirement that
the applicable rules of the association incorporate as guides to interpretation and application certain public interest standards set forth
in the Act, and also that such rules provide a fair procedure with
respect to any refusal or limitation of access to such system by a customer, issuer, broker or dealer. The rule also provides for Commission
review of adverse action by the association with respect to such matters. The Commission determined that the rules adopted by the NASD
were consistent with Rule 15Aj-2 and other applicable requirements
of the Act.
Structure and Level of Commission Rates

Under Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
Commission is responsible for determining the reasonableness of commission rates established by the exchanges for their members. Where
necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors or to insure
fair dealing in securities, the Commission, after notice and opportunity
for hearing, may order an adjustment of such rates. In May 1968, the
Commission moved to correct some of the inequities produced under
the then existing rate schedule by requesting the New York Stock
Exchange to adopt an interim rate structure incorporating a volume
discount or, in the alternative, to eliminate fixed rates of commission
for large transactions, and by announcing that it would institute public
hearings to give more extensive consideration to various aspects of the
commission rate structures of the exchanges,"

These hearings commenced in July 1968. Testimony and statements
have been received from numerous interested persons and organizations including the New York, American, Midwest, Pacific Coast,
and Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington
Stock Exchanges; the National Association of Securities Dealers; broker-dealers, including
both exchange members and nonmembers; third market-makers; representatives of trade associations; and the Anti-Trust Division of the
Department of Justice which, in addition to presenting its own comments, invited a number of independent economists to present their
VIews.
In August 1968 the New York Stock Exchange submitted a proposal to amend its constitu.tion and rules to provide for a reduction
in intra-member commission rates and minimum commissions on trades
involving more than 1,000 shares, and to prohibit the customer-directed
"give-up." The Commission approved this proposal with the understanding that the changes were only acceptable on an interim basis
pending the completion of the hearings and the development of longterm solutions to the various problems under consideration. The new
schedules and prohibitions became effective December 5, 1968. The
American Stock Exchange and all major regional exchanges effected
similar interim adjustments of their rates coupled with prohibitions
of customer-directed give-ups. It has been estimated by the New York
Stock Exchange that, on the basis of 1967 trading volume, the new
schedule will result in a yearly commission savings of approximately
$150 million, or over $600,000 per trading day.
As a result of the Commission's inquiry, the New York Stock Exchange retained an economic consulting firm, National Economic
Research Associates, Inc., to make a detailed economic analysis of the
commission rate structure and to assist it in developing a new rate
structure. NERA has indicated that it considers it necessary first to
determine the proper level of commission income which member firms
should receive for carrying out the brokerage function, and secondly
to develop a rate structure which will yield that level and at the same
time not discriminate unfairly among customers. It expects to make
the necessary determinations through: (1) a conceptual study of
profit rates to determine the appropriate criteria for evaluating profit
levels; (2) a measurement of the capital invested in the industry;
(3) a comparison with profitability rates in other industries; and
(4) a measurement of profit earned in the securities commission
business. The rate structure itself will be based on the costs associated
with the execution of orders and the appropriate income level; an
extensive transactions revenue study is being undertaken in order to

8

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

determine such costs. It is anticipated that the entire study, including
recommendations to the Exchange, will be completed by January 1970.
The American Stock Exchange has engaged the services of the
Cambridge Research Institute to study and further develop the various approaches to commission rates which have been suggested during
the hearings and to ascertain the impact of these approaches on those
who will be affected. A report based on this study is expected to be
ready for the Exchange in January 1970.
The Commission has not yet reached definite conclusions as to the
many matters under inquiry in the hearings. The results of the studies
described above will contribute to the body of information on which
its determinations can be based.
Public Ownership of Securities of Exchange Members

The question of whether members of securities exchanges should be
allowed to issue debt and equity securities to public investors has been
studied by the Commission and the major exchanges for many years.
Certain member firms have argued that in view of the need for capital
of a permanent nature, the continuity of the firm, tax benefits which
may be obtained, and the advantage of being able to attract outstanding management through stock option plans, they Should be permitted
to issue freely transferable subordinated debt securities and equity
securities. Until recently, however, the rules of the New York and
American Stock Exchanges have in effect prevented such public
ownership.
As early as 1961, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith had proposed to the N ew York Stock Exchange that member firms be permitted to issue equity securities to the public. At that time, the
Exchange objected on the grounds that it might lose regulatory control over its members and that public ownership might be used by
institutional and other investors to undermine the minimum commission rate structure. However, the proposal, though never actually acted
upon by the Exchange, led to the appointment by the Board of Governors of a Public Ownership Committee in 1964 to study the entire
question.
In November 1967, the Committee issued a final report recommending that members be permitted to issue debt securities to the public.
The Exchange subsequently submitted this report to the Commission
together with its endorsement of the Committee's position. The Commission raised. certain questions concerning, among other things, the
ratio of allowable debt to equity capital, the making of markets in
these debt securities and applicable provisions of the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939. The proposal was tabled by the Exchange until June 1969

THIRTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

9

at which time it was re-submitted in revised form. Though aware of
the fact that for the most part the questions previously raised remained unanswered, the Board of Governors approved the necessary
rule changes with the stipulation that the changes would not take effect
until the details had been worked out with the Commission.
In May 1969, the New York Stock Exchange member firm of
Donaldson, Lufkin and J eurette, Inc., notified the Exchange's Board
of Governors of its intention to issue its equity securities to the public,
and it filed a registration statement covering a proposed offering of
its common stock with the Commission. At the same time, it proposed
changes in the Constitution and Rules of the Exchange which would
permit the firm to retain its membership. In July the Exchange's
Board of Governors endorsed the "concept" of public ownership of
member firms. Prior to a vote by its members on the issue of public
ownership, the Exchange submitted for Commission comment proposed amendments to its Constitution which would allow member
firms to issue equity securities to the public. The Exchange also set
forth 20 conditions which it intends, through these amendments and
later' rule changes, to impose on public ownership of member firms.
The fact that the New York Stock Exchange accounts for approximately four-fifths of stock exchange trading volume underscores the
importance of the policy considerations associated with its proposals
to permit public ownership of member firms.
Since the Exchange proposals would have a significant impact not
only on member firms, but on all broker-dealers, institutional investors, other exchanges and the public, the Commission considered that
all interested persons should have an opportunity to comment on the
proposed conditions, and it therefore invited the submission of views
and comments," The Exchange has postponed its planned membership vote until such time as the Commission can comment on the Exchange's proposals.
Institutional Investor Stud,.

Against the background of a very significant increase in recent years
in the amount of securities held and traded by institutional investors,"
the Congress, by a joint resolution approved on July 29,1968 (Public
Law 90-438), authorized and directed the Commission to make a study
and investigation of the purchase, sale, and holding of securities by
institutions such as banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, employee pension and welfare funds, and foundation and college endowments in order to determine the effect of such purchases, sales, and

holdings upon the maintenance of fair and orderly securities markets,
the stability of such markets, the interests of the issuers of such
securities, and the interests of the public. The Commission was directed
to report to the Congress the results of its study and investigation,
together with its recommendations. To fulfill these directives, the Commission constituted a study group of economists and lawyers, designated the Institutional Investor Study ("Study").
The Study's design has been divided into five sections. Three major
sections deal with (1) the impacts of institutional investors on the
securities markets and securities industry, (2) relationships between
institutional investors and the companies whose securities are held in
their portfolios and (3) the structures and investment operations of
the institutions themselves. Two other sections deal with (4) savings
flows to institutions and their aggregate asset holdings and (5) continuing needs for the regular reporting of data about institutional
investing.
1. Markel8

As indicated in the authorizing legislation the Congress' first concern
was with the impacts of institutional investors on the nation's securities
markets. One major project will ascertain the extent and market impact of parallel trading by institutions (the buying or selling of the
same security at the same time). In another project a number of individual position changes by institutions will receive detailed analysis
to discover relationships between the size of the position change, characteristics of the security traded, the manner in which the position
change is effected and the resulting market impact of that position
change.
Institutionalization
may affect not only the market prices of securities but also the structure of the securities markets and the securities
industry that services them. Therefore, the extent to which and reasons
why institutions use particular markets and services offered by the
securities industry will be examined. Policy implications of the information developed inthe markets section are among the most important
of the entire Study.
2. Portfolio

Companies

Public Law 90-438 expressly directs the Commission to assess relationships between institutional investors and the corporations whose
securities they hold. Data will be compiled regarding concentrations
of aggregate and individual stockholdings in particular portfolio com-

THIRTY-FIFTH

11

panies, types of companies and industry groups. Institutional purchases and sales of portfolio companies' securities, the manner in which
they vote or refrain from voting their holdings and their contacts with
portfolio company managements will be examined. Representative
transfers of corporate control will be analyzed, as they appear to constitute an avenue through which institutional investors may have a
potentially important impact on the national economy. Data also will
be gathered about institutional involvement with portfolio companies
in less dramatic questions concerning dividend policy, financial structure and management compensation.
In response to Congressional interest the effects of institutional investment upon the financing of American business will be examined in
this portion of the Study. Institutional preferences for different types
of securities, particularly debt versus equity, and the effects of these
preferences upon both the ability of portfolio companies to obtain
financing and the manner in which they do so, will be analyzed. In
addition, the Study will analyze institutional participation in new
issues of securities.
3. Institutions

The principal purpose of the institutions part of the Study is to
understand the interior of the existing phenomenon of institutionalization. Inthis section of the Study, data are being gathered over various
time periods about the internal organization of the different classes of
investment management entities: the sizes and structures of the funds
they manage, the existing legal environments within which they operate, the characteristics of the securities held in their portfolios (including their riskiness), their investment policies, trading activities and
other determinants of either the growth or behavior of institutional
investors.
The institutional part of the Study will look primarily at each of
the various classes of institutional managers. Increasingly, however,
lines between these classes have become blurred as institutions in one
class expand into or become affiliated with institutions in another, and
as institutional managers similarly expand into or are acquired by
various portions of the securities industry. A special project will be
devoted to analyzing the various forms these integrating trends appear to be taking and their effects on both market organizations and
the provision of various financial services.
4. Flow of Funds

The Congress also has directed the Study to evaluate the impact of
institutionalization
on the amount and nature of savings in our econ-

12

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

omy and the allocation of the capital so generated," To ascertain savings flows to financial institutions and the net holdings into which
they have been put, existing national balance sheet, income statement
and flow of funds accounts are being extended to cover more detailed
and meaningful institutional groups. An attempt also will be made
to segregate asset growth into new money flows and investment return
components.
5. Continuous Reporting

An objective of the Study will be recommendations for the reporting
of information about institutional investing on a continuing basis. This
is to prevent gaps in information, which in part led to the present
Study, from necessitating one-shot data collection efforts in support
of future studies," This portion of the Study surveys existing reporting patterns by institutional investors and securities firms with an eye
toward determining how this information might better serve the needs
of government statistical programs, regulatory bodies and public
investors.
Public Law 90-438 specified September 1, 1969, as the Study's
reporting date and authorized an appropriation of up to $875,000. As
a result of delays in obtaining funds for operations in fiscal year 1969,
and in forming a special staff drawn largely from outside the Commission, the Commission requested and was granted an extension of
time until September 1, 1970, and permission to spend in fiscal year
1971 $70,000 which had not been expended in fiscal year 1969Y
Reform of Laws Relating to Investment Companies

Efforts to obtain much-needed reform of the Investment Company
Act of 1940 have continued in the 91st Congress. As described in the
34th Annual Report, legislation which would have implemented proposals of the Commission originally had been introduced in May
1967.12 The principal Commission proposals involved the reduction
of sales loads imposed on the acquisition of fund shares where these
loads are excessive, the elimination of the so-called "front-end load,"
and establishment of a means to test the fairness of management fees.

The proposals also dealt with a number of other areas which in the
Commission's opinion required legislative action.
The Commission's proposals represented 10 years of effort by and on
behalf of the Commission. In December 1966, the Commission had
submitted a report, entitled "Public Policy Implications of Investment
Company Growth," to the Congress. Two other reports which analyzed
various problems associated with the investment company industry and
its growth-the
Wharton Report, commenced in 1958 and submitted
to Congress in August 1962, and the Report of the Special Study of
Securities Markets, published in 1963-1964-had preceded the Commission's Report.
Hearings were conducted before the Senate Committee on Banking
and Currency during July and August 1961 and before the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of the Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives during October
1961 and March 1968. The Senate Committee reported a bill, S. 3124
(90th Cong.), on July 1, 1968 which, as amended, was passed by the
Senate on July 26,1968. However, no action was taken by the House
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce.
Early in the 91st Congress, Senator Sparkman introduced S. 34,
which was the same as S. 3124, and hearings were held before the
Senate Committee on Banking and Currency in April 1969. In May
1969, the Committee reported out, and the Senate passed, S. 2224
which was similar to S. 3124 in most major respects. This bill includes
provisions reflecting Commission proposals with regard to so-called
"performance fees" and oil and gas drilling funds. On June 10, 1969,
Chairman Moss of the House Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance
introduced an identical bill, H.R. 11995. That Subcommittee held
hearings on this and related bills in November and December 1969.
In proposing mutual fund legislation in 1961, the Commission
recognized that most of the specific abuses aimed at in the Investment
Company Act had been substantially eliminated. However, the dramatic growth of the industry and accompanying changes have created
new situations which were not anticipated in 1940. While many of the
changes proposed by the Commission were accepted or even welcomed
by the industry, the industry took exception to the principal recommendations of the Commission, and as a result these have been modified
in the pending legislation, as described below.
Investment Advisory Fees.- The Commission had recommended
that the Act be amended to provide expressly that compensation
received by investment advisers and other persons affiliated with investment companies shall be "reasonable" and that there be opportunity
for judicial enforcement of this standard. This recommendation

14

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

reflected the Commission's view that a requirement that compensation
not be unreasonable was inherent in the fiduciary relationship existing between an investment company and its manager or adviser. The
Commission also considered that the Federal courts would provide
an appropriate forum in which the reasonableness of compensation
could be tested.
The bill passed by the Senate in July 1968 substantially adopted
these recommendations, with certain changes designed to meet some
of the industry's objections. However, the industry, while not objecting to the concept that compensation should be reasonable, continued
to oppose the form of the amendments. Following the April 1969
Senate hearings, the Commission and industry representatives resumed
their discussions of this matter and in May 1969, agreed on and jointly
submitted to the Senate Committee a substitute provision which specified that an investment adviser has a fiduciary duty with respect to
such compensation. This is in accord with the Commission's recommendation that the presently applicable standards of "waste" and "gross
abuse of trust" as applied to management fees be replaced with a more
meaningful standard. The Senate Committee and the Senate adopted
the management fee proposal in substantially the language proposed
by the Commission and the industry representatives.
Thus, H.R. 11995 and S. 2224 add a new Section 36 (b) to the Investment Company Act to specify that the adviser has a fiduciary duty
with respect to compensation for services or other payments paid by
the fund or its shareholders to the adviser or to affiliated persons of
the adviser. Other persons enumerated in Section 36(a) who may
have a similar fiduciary duty with respect to compensation or payments received by them from the fund or its shareholders may also
be sued for breach of such duty in addition to liability imposed by
Section 36 (a). Subsection (b) also provides that payments by the
fund to affiliated persons of the adviser are subject to challenge under
this section. Approval of the management fee by the directors, and
shareholder ratification are to be given such consideration as the court
deems appropriate in the circumstances.
Performance Fees.-Performance-based
fees are a specialized type
of advisory compensation which has been used increasingly in recent
years.18 The proposed legislation, in addition to subjecting such arrangements to the fiduciary standards of Section 36(b), includes provisions specifically directed to performance-based fees. The CommisU For a discussion of this type of compensation
arrangement, which generallY
relates the adviser's compensation either to the realized or unrealized appreciation of the client's portfolio or to the performance of a specified securities index,
see pp. 129-130.

THIRTY-FIFTH

sion originally proposed that the prohibition of performance-based
fees now applicable to advisers of private clients be extended to advisers of registered investment companies. However, after discussion
with industry representwtives, a modified provision, permitting a limited type of performance fee, was incorporated into the pending legislation. Under that provision, contracts which base any part of the
adviser's fee on a specified percentage of the company's capital appreciation would be prohibited. On the other hand, fees which increase
and decrease proportionately on the basis of investment performance
measured against an appropriate index of securities prices or other
appropriate measure of performance would be permissible. The "base"
or "standard" fee would be permitted only at the point that the fund's
performance equaled the index.
H.R. 11995 would also give the Commission authority to permit
other performance fee arrangements by adding new Section 206A to
the Investment Advisers Act, which would give the Commission
authority to exempt any person or transaction from any provision
of that Act to the extent necessary or appropriate in the public interest
and consistent with the protection of investors.
Level of Sales Charges.-The
Commission proposed that a 5-percent ceiling be placed on the charge for mutual fund sales subject
to a power in the Commission to approve appropriate higher ceilings.
The pending legislation would give authority to the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., a self-regulatory organization of
brokers and dealers, to eliminate excessive sales charges, subject to
Commission oversight.
The Front-End Load on Contractual Plans.-The
Commission had
recommended the abolition of the so-called "front-end load" on periodic payment plan certificates (i,e., certificates issued in connection
with contractual plans for the accumulation of fund shares on an
installment basis), under which as much as 50 percent of the payments
made by the investor during the first year may now be deducted for
sales charges. The bill, as passed by the Senate, permits a front-end
load, if either of two alternative conditions are met. Under the first
alternative periodic payment plan certificates could be sold with the
presently authorized front-end load, provided that if the investor
elects for any reason to redeem his certificate for cash during the first
3 years after its issuance he would be entitled to receive a refund of
the difference between the total sales charges paid and 15 percent of
such payments. The Commission would be authorized to adopt rules
and regulations specifying the form of refund notice and setting forth
reserve requirements so that sellers could meet their refund obligations. The other alternative would permit sellers Qf periodic payment

16

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

plan certificates to charge a sales load which does not exceed 20 percent of any payment nor average more than 16 percent over the first
4 years.
The Front-End Load on Face-Amount Certificates.-On
August 27,
1969, the Commission submitted to the Senate Committee on Banking
and Currency a "Report on Face-Amount Certificate Companies," the
result of an in-depth study conducted at the request of the Committee.
In this Report, the Commission reasserted the position taken in its
1966 report that the imposition of the front-end load on installment
face-amount certificates (i.e., certificates which have a fixed ultimate
value and a reduced rate of return if redeemed prior to maturity), is
contrary to the public interest and the interest of investors, 'and recommended that such practice as well as the practice of imposing
equivalent surrender charges be discontinued. A bill, H.R. 13754,
which would implement the Commission's recommendation, was introduced in the House of Representatives on September 11, 1969.
The Commission's Report pointed out that during 1968 only four
companies were issuing face-amount certificates and that one of those
companies accounted for over 94 percent of the assets of all such
companies. However, approximately 20,000 installment face-amount
certificates were sold in the United States in that year, and investors
made payments of over $5.7 million. At June 30, 1969, more than
370,000 such certificates were in force. The Report observed that a substantial percentage of investors lose money on their investment in
race-amount certificates because of the deduction of a front-end load
from early years' payments. On most of the certificates currently being
sold, the investor does not break even on his investment until after
the payments required in the first 8 years have been made. Of those
persons who purchased the most popular face-amount certificate (a
20-year certificate sold by the dominant company) from 1945-1948,
more than 55 percent surrendered their certificates prior to the breakeven point and therefore lost money. In October 1965, this company
began issuing new series of certificates which had lower front-end
loads, improved yields to maturity, and improved first-year and immediate minimum cash values; however, its new certificates have been
surrendered at a loss by investors at approximately the same rate as
the certificates previously sold.
The losses to investors are particularly significant since the median
annual family income of purchasers of the leading company's certificates in 1968 was only $9,750. On the other hand, the total 1968 payments of $5.7 million represent only .0002 percent of the total volume
of securities traded that year on the registered securities exchanges in
the United States. On the basis of these and other comparative figures,

THIRTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

17

the Commission concluded that the economic impact of its recommendation on the securities industry, if any, would be negligible.
The Commission found that the front-end load also tended to support a highly structured personal selling effort, with salesmen generally receiving the same commission for selling a face-amount
certificate as for selling an equity investment in a mutual fund contractual plan requiring the same monthly payments. In addition, the
investment yield on face-amount certificates, if held to maturity, was
found to be less than that realized from comparable alternative savings
programs. For investors who were in a constant 20, 30 or 40-percent
tax bracket through the life of a 20-year certificate, the after-tax
yield on the highest-yield certificate offered by the dominant company
was no better than the median annual yield on U.S. Series E Savings
Bonds, or on deposits in savings associations, mutual savings banks
and commercial banks. Thus, if discontinuance of the front-end load
should result in a less intensive sale of face-amount certificates, alternative accumulation programs with comparable after-tax benefits
would still be available.
Oil and GasDrilling Funds.- The pending legislation would amend
Section 3(c) (11) of the Act to terminate the exclusion from the Act
of those oil and gas funds which issue redeemable securities, or sell
their securities on the installment plan. Oil and gas funds in which
investors make only a single payment and do not receive a redeemable
security would still be excluded from the definition of investment
company.
The new provision would not become effective until 18 months
after passage. The discussion on the floor of the Senate regarding
8. 2224 makes it clear that it is intended that the Commission and
oil and gas industry representatives confer during that interval to
work out an equitable arrangement for regulation which would protect
and safeguard investors and not impose an unreasonable burden on
the industry.
Subsequent to the passage of S. 2224, the Commission staff conferred
with representatives of the oil and gas industry. During hearings on
S. 2224 before the House Subcommittee in December 1969, the Commission confirmed its original view that there is a need for regulation
to some degree of the type provided in the Investment Company Act
for this industry but that such regulation would appear to present
certain real problems for the industry, primarily because of the difficulty of accommodating the industry structure contemplated by the
Investment Company Act with the structure in fact adopted by this
industry in order to provide favorable treatment for its investors
under the Internal Revenue Code.
373-754-70-3

18

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Therefore, the Commission stated to the House Subcommittee that
if the Committee wishes to delete the oil and gas amendment from
the bill, the Commission would not object. The Commission stated
that it made this suggestion on the assumption that representatives
of the oil and gas industry would cooperate with the Commission in
working out a reasonable regulatory statute consistent with the protection of investors, for submission to Congress within 18 month after
passage of the mutual fund legislation.
Study of "Hedge Funds"

In January 1969 the Commission commenced an investigatory study
of so-called "hedge funds." These are generally private investment
partnerships which employ speculative investment techniques with a
view to rapid capital appreciation. The study also encompasses the
activities of some 50 registered investment companies which engage
in similar investment techniques.
During the last few years, there has been a rapid increase in the
number and assets of hedge funds. It is estimated that the number of
such funds is now approaching 200, with estimated total assets of
about $1.5 billion. Most hedge funds are structured to avoid the need
for registration as investment companies, relying on an exception
provided by the Investment Company Act for an issuer whose outstanding securities are owned by not more than 100 persons and which
is not making and does not presently propose to make a public offering of its securities.
Typically, hedge funds trade on margin, sell short and write or
buy put and call options. The general partner of the fund, who is
frequently an officer, partner or registered representative of a brokerdealer, or an investment adviser, is given the power to make portfolio
decisions and effect transactions for the partnership. Because hedge
funds are so strongly performance-oriented, they may have a greater
impact on the securities markets than their asset size would indicate.
In order to obtain meaningful information concerning the organization and activities of hedge funds, about 200 nonregistered investment
partnerships and 50 registered investment companies which engage
in hedge fund trading techniques were requested to file comprehensi ve
statements with the Commission. Analysis of the submissions should
permit the Commission to determine what, if any, additional measures
are necessary or appropriate for investor protection.
Report of the Disclosure Policy Study

At the end of 1967, a small group of Commission staff members began an over-all study of the disclosure process.> Under the direction
1< See 34th Annual
Report, pp. 12-13; Securities Act Release No. 4885 (November 29,1967).

19

of former Commissioner Francis M. Wheat and working with representatives of the legal and accounting professions, the securities industry, and the general business community, the Study Group devoted
about 15 months to the study which culminated in the submission to
the Commission in March 1969 of a report entitled Disclosure to I noestors-s-A Reapprai8al of Federal Admini8trative Policies Under the
'33 and '34- ActS.15 That report constitutes an attempt to discover what
could be done within the existing statutory framework to :
(a) enhance the degree of coordination between the disclosures
required under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;
(b) clarify the law of disclosure and make its application more
certain;
(c) assure that appropriate disclosures are made prior to the
creation of interstate trading markets in securities; and
(d) enhance the utility to investors and to those who advise them
of the documents generated under the Federal securities statutes
without imposing undue burdens on those who must prepare these
documents.
The Report notes that disclosure is and has from the outset been
central to national policy in the securities field. This emphasis on
disclosure stems from two considerations. One relates to the proper
function of the Federal Government in investment matters. Apart
from the prevention of fraud and manipulation, this responsibility was
viewed by the draftsmen of the statutes as being primarily one of seeing to it that investors and speculators have access to enough information to enable them to arrive at their own informed decisions. The
other, less direct, rests on the belief that appropriate publicity tends to
deter questionable practices and to elevate standards of business
conduct.
The Report pointed out that the trading markets in outstanding securities involve much more money and far more people than does the
distribution of securities being offered to the public for the first time.
Thus the Report's emphasis is on continuous disclosure under the
Securities Exchange Act.
Space limitations preclude any attempt to discuss or even to list the
61 specific recommendations made in the Report. However, a capsule
,. See Securities Act Release No. 4963 (April 14, 1969).
Budgetary limitations precluded the Commission from disseminating copies of
the full Report; it was, however, distributed by several private concerns and attained wide circulation. The Commission distributed copies of Chapter I of the
Report, which contains a comprehensive summary of the entire document.

20

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

summary of some of the Report's most significant
recommendations is set forth below:

conclusions and

(1.) Steps should be taken to assure that prospectuses are more
readable. These should include:
(a) denying acceleration to registration statements the prospectus portions of which are unnecessarily long or complex; and
(b) requiring a "guide" to any prospectus whose text portion
exceeds 10 pages.
(2.) Short-form prospectuses should be permitted in certain
situations (e.g., secondary offerings on exchanges and offerings
of stock to be issued on the exercise of publicly held warrants) in
which conventional prospectuses are now required. However, the
proposed short-form prospectus would be available only to issuers
that make adequate continuous disclosures under the Securities
Exchange Act.
(3.) The group of issuers permitted to make condensed Securities
Act disclosures on the Commission's Form S-7 should be enlarged.
(4.) In first public offerings, preliminary prospectuses should be
delivered to investors before the registration statement becomes
effective. The Commission should use its discretionary power to
accelerate (or refuse to accelerate) the effective date of Securities
Act registration statements in order to achieve this objective.
(5.) The lines of demarcation between those offerings that must
be registered under the Securities Act and those as to which such
registration is not required should be made more precise. Present
uncertainties stem largely from the traditional subjective criteria
of investment intent and change of circumstances.
(6.) A distinction should be drawn between companies that file
regular, informative reports on their affairs with the Commission
("reporting companies"), on the one hand, and those that do not
file such reports ("nonreporting companies"), on the other.
(7.) The area in which this distinction would be most significant
is that of the so-called "secondary" sale, i.e., a sale by a person who
is not himself the issuer of the securities in question, but who is
treated as though he were their issuer for purposes of the Securities Act's registration requirements. He may be so treated because
he is a controlling person of the issuer or because he acts as a link
in a chain of nonpublic transactions by which securities move
from an issuer to the public. Present distinctions in the rules
applicable to the two types of secondary sellers should be largely
abandoned.
(8.) In the case of a reporting company, both the controlling
person and the nonpublic purchaser should be permitted to resell-

THIRTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

21

without Securities Act registration-in normal trading transactions. A valid general framework for differentiating normal trading transactions from those that do not fall within that
category can be found in the Commission's present Rule 154.16
(9.) However, the use of ostensible private purchasers as conduits for the sale of securities to the public must be prevented.
To achieve this objective, a short mandatory holding period
during which the private purchaser is at risk and precluded from
reselling to the public is essential. The Report recommends one
year for this purpose.
(10.) In the case of the nonreporting company, on the other
hand, adequate investor protection requires that unregistered secondary sales be inhibited. Accordingly, registration (or in appropriate cases qualification under Regulation A) should be required
whenever a controlling person of a nonreporting company makes
an interstate public offering of its securities. The Report suggests
that the holder of any security acquired "in a transaction or chain
of transactions none of which was a public offering or other
public disposition" be free to reoffer or resell it publicly after
5 years have elapsed from the date of its sale by the issuer or by
a person in control of the issuer.
(11.) At present some-but only some-business combinations in
which the acquiring corporation issues its own securities in payment are deemed to involve "offers" and "sales" for Securities
Act purposes. When a combination is effected by means of a
statutory merger or consolidation, the Securities Act's disclosure
requirements are inapplicable because, under a long-standing
Commission rule (Rule 133 under the Securities Act), the submission of an acquisition transaction to shareholders is deemed to
involve neither a "sale" nor an "offer to sell." On the other hand,
an offer of its securities by one company to the security holders
of a second company which it wishes to acquire has always been
regarded as involving both an "offer to sell" and a "sale." The
Report would remove this distinction and provide a specialized
registration form for those business combinations now covered
by Rule 133.
(12.) Regulation A under the Securities Act should be amended
so as to increase the quantities of securities salable thereunder by
persons other than issuers.
(13.) The present Regulation A rule obviating any need to deliver
an offering circular to public investors so long as the amount of
16 Although the Report recommended retention
of the basic quantity limitations
of present Rule 154, it recommended a number of significant changes in the rule.

22

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

securities sold in anyone year does not exceed $50,000 should be
abandoned.
(14.) In its present form continuous disclosure under the Securities Exchange Act is an inadequate substitute for the occasional
but comprehensive disclosures produced under traditional Securities Act practice. This disparity should be narrowed by :
(a) rearranging the items in the initial disclosure document
under the Exchange Act (Form 10) in the order of their
importance.
(b) converting the issuer's annual report to the Commission
(Form 10-K) into an annual updating of the material in the
Form 10; and
(c) substituting a new quarterly report to the Commission (to
be designated Form 10-Q) for present Forms 8-K and 9-K.
The proposed quarterly report would be due 45 days after
the close of each fiscal quarter (except that a report of a significant acquisition or disposition of assets would be due 10 days
after the execution of a written agreement for such acquisition
or disposition). This quarterly report would consist of two
parts. The first would coyer the substance of the present 8-K
with a number of changes. The second would consist of condensed, comparative financial information.
In September and October 1969,the Commission invited public comments on a number of proposed new or revised rules and forms designed to implement or put into effect most of the recommendations of
the Report."
Additional Financial Disclosure by Diversified Companies

The increase in acquisitions and mergers in recent years has caused
the Commission to consider the need for more detailed reporting on
the operations of registrants which are broadly diversified and to study
the problems involved in any extension of the requirements in this area
of financial reporting. Staff surveys have indicated that there has been
an increase in voluntary disclosures by diversified companies in recent
annual reports to stockholders. During 1968 important studies by professional organizations and by individuals on the topic of financial
reporting by diversified companies were completed. The Commission
had authorized its Chief Accountant to serve on an Advisory Committee, representing various sectors of the accounting, financial and
17 Securities
Act Release Nos. 4996 and 4997 (September 15, 1969), 5010 and
5011 (October 7. 1969) and 5012 (October 9, 1969); Securities Exchange Act
Release Nos. 8680, 8681, 8682, 8683, 8684 and 8686 (September 15, 1969).

industrial communities, in connection with a comprehensive study and
survey conducted under the sponsorship of the Financial Executives
Institute.
The studies and surveys indicated that an extension of the Commission's requirements was feasible. As a result, the staff undertook
to develop amendments of the rules to elicit additional information
from all companies affected which will be meaningful to investors but
not unduly burdensome to registrants. In September 1968, a proposal
to revise the disclosure requirements in certain registration forms
under the securities acts was issued for public comment."
The comments received on the proposals were considered in the formulation of revised proposals which were published for comment in
February 1969.19 Definitive amendments to the registration forms were
adopted by the Commission in July 1969.20
The items of the forms to which the amendments relate call for a
brief description of the business done and intended to be done by the
registrant and its subsidiaries. The amendments require, where a
registrant and its subsidiaries are engaged in more than one line of
business, the disclosure for each of a maximum of the last 5 years
subsequent to December 31, 1966, of the approximate amount or percentage of total sales and operating revenues and of contribution to
income before income taxes and extraordinary items attributable to
each line of business which contributed, during either of the last 2
fiscal years, a certain proportion to the total of sales and revenues, or
to income before income taxes and extraordinary items. For companies
with total sales and revenues of over $50 million the proportion is
10 percent and for smaller companies it is 15 percent. Similar disclosure is also required with respect to any line of business which resulted in a loss of 10 percent or more, or 15 percent or more for the
smaller companies, of such income before deduction of losses. Where
the percentage test as applied to both sales and earnings contributions
results in more than 10 lines of business, the disclosure may be limited
to the 10 most important lines of business. Where it is not practicable
to state the contribution to income before income taxes and extraordinary items for any line of business, the contribution to the results of
operations most closely approaching such income is to be disclosed.
The amendments continue the existing requirements on breakdown
of total volume of sales and revenues by principal classes of similar
products or services, except that the percentage test has been reduced

from 15 to 10 percent in the case of companies having total sales and
revenues in excess of $50 million during either of their last 2 fiscal
years. Under this provision, repetition of the disclosure is not required
when a company uses classes of similar products or services as its basis
for determining lines of business.
In September 1969,the Commission issued a proposal for comment,
based on a recommendation of the Disclosure Study, which would
amend the annual reporting form under the Securities Exchange Act
to require disclosure of comparable data."
Organized Crime Program

The Commission has always gi,'en priority to the investigation of
cases where there is an indication that organized crime may be involved. The Commission maintains a close liaison with the Organized
Crime and Racketeering Section of the Department of Justice and
submits quarterly reports relating to organized crime investigations.
At the request of the Attorney General, the Commission requested that
its appropriation for fiscal year 1970 include funds which would
enable it to mount an increased drive against organized crime within
the Commission's over-all enforcement program. During the 1969fiscal
year, the Commission placed four enforcement staff members on the
Department of Justice's New York Strike Force against organized
crime, and designated enforcement staff members in its headquarters
office to investigate certain organized crime cases. It is anticipated
that additional enforcement personnel will be assigned to Department
of Justice Strike Forces in other major cities, and that a "back-up"
unit will be created in the Commission's headquarters officeto assist in
establishing an effective program to keep organized crime out of the
securities markets .

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE
ISSUERS OF SECURITIES

One basic purpose of the Federal securities laws administered by
the Commission, in particular the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is to provide disclosure of financial
and other information about publicly held companies and those companies seeking to raise capital through the public offering of their
securities, so as to enable public investors to evaluate the securities of
these companies on an informed and realistic basis. To this end, the
Securities Act, generally speaking, requires a company proposing to
offer its securities to the public to file a registration statement with
the Commission disclosing prescribed categories of financial and other
information and further requires that in the offer and sale of the
securities investors be furnished a prospectus containing the most
significant information set forth in the registration statement. The
Securities Exchange Act, which deals in large part with trading in
securities already outstanding, requires the registration of securities
listed on a national securities exchange as well as of over-the-counter
securities in which there is a substantial public interest. It also requires
the issuers of such securities to file annual and other periodic reports
which are designed to keep the information in the Exchange Act
registration statement current. That Act also requires disclosure of
material information to holders of registered securities in connection
with the solicitation of proxies for the election of directors or the
approval of corporate action at a stockholders' meeting, and requires
"insiders" of companies whose equity securities are registered to report
their holdings of and transactions in all equity securities of the company with which they are affiliated.
The scope of disclosure was further extended early in the 1969
fiscal year by the "take-over-bid" amendments to the Securities Exchange Act,' which, as implemented by Commission rules, afford disclosure to investors in connection with purchases of substantial blocks
of stock of publicly held corporations either through cash tender offers

or private or open market purchases and in connection with repurchases by corporations of their own stock,"
The program for revision of the Commission's disclosure requirements recommended by the Disclosure Study Report, which was submitted to the Commission in March 1969, and the steps which have
been taken to implement the recommendations, are discussed in Part I
of this report.
A. DISCLOSURE IN CONNECTION WITH PUBLIC OFFERINGS

In order to provide disclosure with respect to securities to be offered
for public sale, either by an issuing company or a person in a control
relationship to such company, the Securities Act requires that (1) a
registration statement containing certain required financial and other
information be filed with the Commission, and (2) a prospectus which
is a part of the registration statement and contains the more significant data set forth in that statement, be furnished to investors so as
to enable them to evaluate the securities and make an informed investment decision.
The registration statement is available for public inspection as soon
as it is filed. Although the securities may be offered for sale upon filing
of the statement under prescribed limitations, actual sales may not
be made until the statement has become effective. The Commission has
no authority to pass on the merits of the securities to be offered or
the fairness of the terms of distribution. In fact, the Act makes it
unlawful to represent to investors that the Commission has approved
or otherwise passed on the merits of registered securities.
Type of Information Included in Registration Statement

Generally speaking, a registration statement relating to securities
issued by a corporation or other private issuer must contain the information specified in Schedule A of the Act, while a statement relating
to securities issued by a foreign government must include the information specified in Schedule B. The Act empowers the Commission to classify issues, issuers and prospectuses, to prescribe appropriate forms, and to increase, or in certain instances vary or diminish,
the particular items of information required to be disclosed as the
Commission deems appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. To facilitate the registration of securities by different types of issuing companies, the Commission has prepared
special registration forms which vary in their disclosure requirements
so as to provide maximum disclosure of the essential facts pertinent
1

See pp. 48-!l) intra.

TF.URTY-F~

~AL

REPORT

27

in a given type of case while at the same time reducing the burden and
expense of compliance with the law.
In general, the registration statement of an issuer other than a
foreign government must disclose such matters as the names of persons
who participate in the management or control of the issuer's business;
the security holdings and remuneration of such persons; the general
character of the business, its capital structure, past history and earnings; underwriters' commissions; payments to promoters made within
2 years or intended to be made; the interest of directors, officers and
principal stockholders in material transactions with the issuer; pending legal proceedings; and the purposes to which the proceeds of the
offering are to be applied, and must include financial statements certified by an independent accountant. The registration statement of a
foreign government must contain information concerning the purposes for which the proceeds of the offering are to be used, the natural
and industrial resources of the issuer, its revenues, obligations and expenses, the underwriting and distribution of the securities being registered, and other material matters, but need not contain certified
financial statements.
Prior Delivery of Preliminary Prospectus

The Act provides that a registration statement shall become effective on the 20th day after filing, or the 20th day after the last amendment is filed. The Commission can, however, set an earlier effective
date ("accelerate" the effective date), taking into account among other
things the adequacy of the information theretofore publicly available.
During the fiscal year, the Commission announced a new acceleration
policy, relating to the distribution of prospectuses to prospective investors," In doing so, it called attention to the continued high volume
of filings and the fact that well over half of the filings were being
made by companies filing for the first time, and it emphasized that
the investing public should be aware that many such offerings of
securities are of a highly speculative character and that the prospectus
should be carefully examined before an investment decision is reached.
The Commission had previously declared its policy in Rule 460 that
it will not accelerate the effective date of a registration statement unless
the preliminary prospectus contained in the registration statement is
distributed to underwriters and dealers who it is reasonably anticipated will be invited to participate in the distribution of the security
to be offered or sold. The purpose of this requirement is to afford all
persons effecting the distribution a means of being informed with
• Securities Act Release No. 4968 (April 24, 1969).

28

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

respect to the offering so that they can advise their customers of the
investment merits of the security.
The Commission announced that it would henceforth consider
whether persons making an offering of securities of an issuer which is
not subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 had taken reasonable steps to furnish preliminary prospectuses to those persons who may reasonably be expected to be purchasers of the securities. The Commission will ordinarily be satisfied
by a written statement from the managing underwriter to the effect
that it has been informed by participating underwriters and dealers
that copies of the preliminary prospectus have been or are being distributed to all persons to whom it is then expected to mail confirmations of sale, not less than 48 hours prior to the time it is expected to
mail such confirmations.
Proposed Summary Sheet For Registration Statements

During the fiscal year, the Commission invited public comments
on proposed amendments to its forms and rules under the Securities
Act to require companies filing registration statements to file a summary sheet as an exhibit to each statement or amendment.' The sheets
would summarize essential information relating to the registrant and
the registration statement and are designed to facilitate the automated
processing of data through the use of the Commission's computer; the
Commission's recordkeeping, including its internal workload control;
and the dissemination of information to the Commission's regional
offices for public information purposes. The information in the summary sheets would be confined substantially to information which is
presently required by the registration forms.
Some copies of each summary sheet would be kept in the Commission's principal officefor the use of the staff and for public inspection while other copies would be placed in the regional offices of the
Commission so that the information would be more readily available
to interested persons.
Guides for Preparation and Filing of Registration Statements

During the fiscal year the Commisison published certain guides for
the preparation and filing of registration statements under the Securities Act," These guides represented a revision and expansion of guides
previously published.
The guides are subject to review and modification from time to time
as circumstances may require and interested persons are invited to
submit, at any time, suggestions for such modifications or for the

• Securities Act Release No. 4936 (December 9,1968).

publication of guides covering additional matters. They are not rules
of the Commission nor are they published as bearing the Commission's
official approval. The guides represent policies and practices followed
by the Commission's Division of Corporation Finance in the administration of the registration requirements of the Act, but they do not
purport to furnish complete criteria for the preparation of registration statements.
In April 1969, a proposed guide of the Division, relating to the misleading character of certain registrants' names, was published." It
stated that the Division had observed that an increasing number of
registrants proposed to adopt names which could create a misleading
impression as to the nature of their business. For examples, registrants
proposed to use words such as "nuclear," "missile," "space," "nucleonics" or "electronics" in their names where they were not engaged, or
engaged only to a very limited extent, in activity normally associated
with those words.
The release further stated that the Division also may deem a registrant's name to be misleading if it is so similar to the name of another
company, particularly a well-known and established company, that it
is likely to be confused with the name of that company.
Following the close of the fiscal year, the proposed guide was
adopted."
Amendment of Rule 429

Rule 429 under the Securities Act previously provided that where
two or more registration statements were effective for different blocks
of securities of the same class, a combined prospectus could be used
in connection with the offering and sale of the securities covered by
such registration statements provided the prospectus contained the
information with respect to the underwriting and distribution of the
securities and the use of the proceeds therefrom which would be required in each prospectus if separate prospectuses were used.
During the fiscal year the rule was amended to provide that such a
combined prospectus may be used even though the securities covered
by the several registration statements are not all of the same class,"
Use of the combined prospectus is not permitted, however, where the
latest registration statement is filed on Form S-14. The reason for
this is that a prospectus for securities registered on Form S-14 consists
of a proxy statement supplemented by certain additional information.
Such a prospectus is not deemed suitable for securities other than those
for which that form may be used.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Spin oft's of Securities and Trading in the Securities of Inactive or Shell
Corporations

Shortly after the end of the fiscal year, the Commission issued a
release expressing its concern with the methods being employed by a
growing number of companies and persons to effect distributions to the
public of unregistered securities in possible violation of the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and the anti-fraud and anti-manipulative provisions of that Act and the Securities Exchange Act,"
The Commission pointed out that the methods employed can take
and in fact have taken a variety of patterns. Frequently, the pattern
involves the issuance of its shares by a company with little, if any,
business activity to a publicly-owned company in exchange for what
mayor may not be nominal consideration. The publicly-owned company subsequently "spins off" the shares to its shareholders and active
trading in the shares begins although no information on the issuer is
available to the investing public. The potential for fraud and deceit
in these situations is manifest. The Commission stated that it takes the
position that the shares distributed in certain spin offs are subject
to the registration requirements of the Securities Act and subsequent
transactions in the shares by dealers, unless otherwise exempt, are subject to the provisions of the Act requiring the delivery of a prospectus.
The Commission pointed out that it was not, in this release, addressing itself to problems attributable to more conventional spin offs,
which do not involve a process of purchase of securities by a publiclyowned company followed by their spin off and redistribution in the
trading markets.
Another pattern discussed in the release involves the acquisition by
certain promoters of corporations which have ceased active operations,
or which have little or no assets ("shell corporations"), and which
have a substantial number of shares outstanding, generally in the
hands of the public. Following such acquisition, the promoters have
engaged in activities designed to increase quickly the market value
of their shareholdings. For example, in some cases promoters have
initiated a program of acquisitions, transferring assets of dubious
value to the "shell corporations" in exchange for substantial amounts
of newly issued shares. This activity is frequently accompanied by
publicity containing exaggerated or misleading statements and
designed to stimulate interest of public investors in the company's
shares in violation of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act. Thereafter the market prices of these securities have
risen sharply under circumstances which bear no relationship to the
underlying financial condition and business activities of the company.
• Securities Act Release No. 4982 ( July 2, 1969).

THIRTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

31

In some of these cases the promoters or other corporate insiders, taking
advantage of the market activity and the price rise which they have
generated, have sold their shares at the inflated prices to the public
in violation of the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities laws.
The Commission stressed that activity of the type described in the
release generally can be accomplished successfully only through the
efforts of brokers and dealers, and it cautioned brokers and dealers
to be mindful of their obligations under the securities laws in effecting
transactions in securities of little-known, inactive issuers, or issuers
as to which there is no reliable current information available.
Staff Examination of Registration Statements

Registration statements filed with the Commission are examined by
its staff for compliance with the standards of adequate and accurate
disclosure. This examination is primarily the responsibility of the
Division of Corporation Finance,'? Expedited review procedures
adopted in November 1DGSto cope with the tremendous volume of
registration statements filed were described on pages 11-12 of the 34th
Annual Report. Generally speaking, if it appears that a statement
fails to conform, in material respects, with the applicable requirements, the issuing company is notified by a letter of comment and is
afforded an opportunity to file correcting or clarifying amendments.
The Commission also has the power, after notice and opportunity for
hearing, to issue a "stop-order" suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement if it finds that material representations are misleading, inaccurate or incomplete. In certain instances, such as where the
deficiencies in a registration statement appear to stem from careless
disregard of applicable requirements or from a deliberate attempt
to conceal or mislead, a letter of comment is not sent and the Commission either conducts an investigation to determine whether "stop-order"
proceedings should be instituted or immediately institutes such proceedings. The exercise of the "stop-order" power during fiscal year
1969 is discussed on page 36.
Time Required to Complete Registration

The Commission's staff endeavors to complete its examination of
registration statements in as short a time as possible. The Act provides
that a registration statement shall become effective on the 20th day
after it is filed (or on the 20th day after the filing of any amendment

thereto). Since most registration statements require one or more
amendments, they usually do not become effective until some time
after the original20-day period. The period between filing and effective
date is intended to afford investors an opportunity to become familiar
with the proposed offering through the dissemination of the preliminary form of prospectus. The Commission can accelerate the effective date so as to shorten the 20-day waiting period, taking into
account, among other things, the adequacy of the information respecting the issuer theretofore available to the public and the facility with
which the facts about the offering can be understood. The note to Rule
460 under the Act lists some of the more common situations in which
the Commision considers that the statute generally requires it to deny
acoeleration.!"
During the fiscal year, a record number of 3,316 registration statements became effectiveY As a result of the enormous number of
filings 18 and the resulting backlog, the median time from the date
of original filing to effective date rose to 65 calendar days. This
compares with 44 days for 2,131 registration statements in fiscal year
1968 and 36 days for 1,460 registration statements in fiscal year 1967.
The following table shows by months during the 1969 fiscal year the

Statistics Regarding Registration Statements Filed

During the 1969 fiscal year, 4,706 registration statements were filed
for offerings of securities aggregating $86.9 billion. These record
figures compare with 2,906 registration statements filed during the
1968 fiscal year for offerings amounting to $5-1.0billion and represent
an increase of 61.9 percent in the number of statements filed and 60,9
percent in the dollar amount involved.
Of the 4,706 registration statements filed in the 1969 fiscal year,
2,350, or 49.9 percent, were filed by companies that had not previously
filed registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933. Comparable figures for the 1968 and 1967 fiscal years were 893, or 30.7
percent, and 440,or 24 percent, respectively.
From the effective date of the Securities Act to June 30, 1969, a
total of 36,567 registration statements, covering proposed offerings
of securities aggregating over $485.9 billion, was filed by 15,748 different issuers. The following table contains further particulars concerning these statements:

Stalislics Regarding Securities Registered

During the fiscal year 1969 a record 3,645 registrations of securities
in the amount of $86.8 billion became effective under the Securities
Act.14 Both the number of statements and the dollar amount of registrations were the largest on record. The chart on page 201 shows the
number and dollar amounts of registrations for the past 35 years.
The figures for 1969 include all registrations which became effective
including secondary distributions, i.e., distributions of already outstanding securities, and securities registered for other than cash sale,
such as issues exchanged for other securities and securities reserved for
conversion. Of the dollar 'amount of securities registered in 1969, 60
percent was for the account of the issuer for cash sale, 34 percent for
the account of the issuer for other than cash sale, and 6 percent for the
account of others.

ANNUAL REPORT

As the above table shows, the amount of securities offered. for cash
sale for the account of the issuer approximated $52 billion, an increase
of $15 billion over the previous year. Registration of securities for the
account of the issuer for other than cash sale totaled $29.6 billion, more
than double the amount during the preceding fiscal year. These securities included $17.8 billion of securities registered. for exchange transactions and $11 billion of securities reserved for conversion. Registrations of secondary offerings totaled $4.8 billion, $1.7 billion more than
in the preceding fiscal year. Appendix Table 1 shows the number of
statements which became effective and total amounts registered for
each of the fiscal years 1935 through 1969, and contains a classification
by type of security of issues to be offered for cash sale on behalf of the
issuer during those years. More detailed information for 1969 is given
in Appendix Table 2.
Corporate issues intended for immediate cash sale totaled $17.3 billion, an increase of $900 million over the preceding year. Common stock
totaled $5.9 billion, or 34 percent of the total, as compared. to $2.9 billion, or 17 percent, in the preceding fiscal year. Preferred stock: totaled
$500 million, 3 percent of the total, while bonds, notes and debentures
aggregated $10.8 billion, or three-fifths of the total. A breakdown of
registered corporate issues for cash sale by industry of issuer and data
on the intended use of proceeds will not be available until programs to
adapt these statistics to the Commission's computer are completed.

Stop Order Proceedings

Section 8( d) of the Securities Act gives the Commission the power,
after notice and opportunity for hearing, to issue a stop order "suspending" the effectiveness of a registration statement which includes
an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading. The effect of a stop order, which may be issued
even after the sale of securities has begun, is to bar distribution of the
securities so long as the order remains in effect. Although losses which
may have been suffered by investors before issuance of the order are
not restored to them by a stop order, the Commission's decision and
the evidence on which it is based may serve to put them on notice of
their rights and aid in their own recovery suits. As provided by the
Act, a stop order is lifted when the registration statement has been
amended to correct the deficiencies.
As of the beginning of the fiscal year, one stop order proceeding was
pending. During the year five additional proceedings were instituted
and three were terminated through the issuance of stop orders."
Examinations and Investigations

The Commission is authorized by Section 8 (e) of the Securities
Act to make an examination in order to determine whether a stop
order proceeding should be instituted under Section 8 (d) and in connection therewith is empowered to examine witnesses and require the
production of pertinent documents. The Commission is also authorized
by Section 20(a) of the Act to conduct an investigation to determine
whether any provision of the Act or any rule or regulation prescribed
thereunder has been or is about to be violated. In appropriate cases,

EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION OF SMAIL ISSUES

The Commission is authorized under Section 3 (b) of the Securities
Act to exempt, by its rules and regulations and subject to such terms
and conditions as it may prescribe therein, any class of securities from
registration under the Act, if it finds that the enforcement of the
registration provisions of the Act with respect to such securities is not
necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors by
reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of the
public offering. The statute imposes a maximum limitation of $300,000 upon the size of the issues which may be exempted by the
Commission in the exercise of this power.
Acting under this authority, the Commission has adopted the
following exemptive rules and regulations:
Rule 234: Exemption of first lien notes
Rule 235: Exemption of securities of cooperative housing corporations.
Rule 236: Exemption
of shares offered in connection with certain transactions.
Regulation A: General exemption
for U.S. and Canadian
issues up to
$300,000.
Regulation B: Exemption for fractional
undivided interests in oil or gas
rights up to $100,000.
Regulation F: Exemption for assessments
on assessable stock and for assessable stock offered or sold to realize the amount of
assessment thereon.

Under Section 3(c) of the Securities Act, which was added by Section 307(a) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, the Commission is authorized to adopt rules and regulations exempting
securities issued by a small business investment company under the
Small Business Investment Act. Acting pursuant to this authority the
Commission has adopted Regulation E, which is described below.
Exemption from registration under Section 3 (b) or (c) of the Act
does not carry any exemption from the provisions of the Act prohibit-

ing fraudulent conduct in the offer or sale of wuritias and imposing
civil liability or criminal responsibility for such conduct.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A

Regulation A permits a company to obtain needed capital not in
excess of $300,000 (including underwriting commissions) in any one
year from a public offering of its securities mithout registration, provided specified conditions are met. These include the filing of a notification supplying basic information about the company with the
Regional Office of the Commission in the region in which the company
has its principal place of business, and the filing and use in the offering
of an offering circular. However, an offering circular need not be filed
or used in connection with an offering not in excess of $50,000 by a
company with earnings i n one of the last 2 years.
During the 1969 fiscal year, 1,043 notifications were filed under Rwlation A, covering proposed offerings of $267,074,784, compared with
515 notifications covering propobd offerings of $112,318,744 in the

Suspension of Exemption.-The Commissihn may suspend an exemption under Regulation A where, in general, th'eexemption is sought
for securities for which the regulation provides no exemption or where
the offering is not made in accordance with the terns and conditions
of the regulation or with prescribed disclosure standards. Following
the issuance of a temporary suspension order by the Commission, the
respondents may request a hearing to determine whether the temporary
suspension should be vacated or made permanent. If no hearing is
requested within 30 days after the entry of the temporary suspension
order and none is ordered by the Commission on its own motion, the
temporary suspension order becomes permanent.
During the 1969 fiscal year, temporary suspension orders mere issued
in 15 cases, which, added to the 2 cases pending, at the beginning of the
fiscal year, resulted in a total of 17 cases for disposition. Of these, the
temporary suspension order was vacated in one case and became
permanent in eight cases: in two by lapse of time, in four b y withdrawal of the request for hearing, and in two by acceptance of an offer
of settlement. Eight cases were pending a t the end of the fiscal year.
Exempt Merings Under Regulation B

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1969, 613 offering sheet$ and
447 amendments thereto were filed pursuant to Regulation B and werc
examined by the Oil and Gas Section of the Commission's Divisiorl of
Corporation Finance. During the 1968 and 1967 fiscal years, 453 and
353 offering sheets, respectively, were filed. The following table indicate, the nature and number of Commission orders issued in connection
with such filings during the fiscal years 196749. The balance of the

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation E

Regulation E provides a conditional exemption from registration
under the Securities Act for securities of small business investment
companies which are licensed under the Small Business Investment
Act of 1958 or which have received the preliminary approval of the
Small Business Administration and have been notified by the Administration that they may submit an application for such a license.
The regulation, which is similar in many respects to the general
exemption provided by Regulation A, requires the filing of a notification with the Commission and, except in the case of offerings not in
excess of $50,000,the filing and use of an offering circular containing
certain specified information.
Regulation E also authorizes the Commission to suspend an
exemption, substantially on the same grounds as those specified in
Regulation AOne notification was filed under Regulation E during 1969 fiscal
'year for an offering totalling $160,000.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation F

Regulation F provides an exemption for assessments levied upon
assessable stock and for delinquent assessment sales in amounts not
exceeding $300,000 in anyone year. It requires the filing of a simple
notification giving brief information with respect to the issuer, its
management, principal security holders, recent and proposed assessments and other security issues. The regulation requires a company
to send to its stockholders, or otherwise publish, a statement of the
purposes for which the proceeds of the assessment are proposed to be
used. Copies of any other sales literature used in connection with the
assessment must be filed. Like Regulation A, Regulation F provides for
the suspension of an exemption thereunder where the regulation provides no exemption or where the Offering is not made in accordance

THIRTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

41

with the terms and conditions of the regulation or in accordance with
prescribed disclosure standards.
During the 1969 fiscal year, 18 notifications were filed under Regulation F, covering assessments of $492,076,compared with 20 notifications covering assessments of $835,274 in the 1968 fiscal year. These
notifications were filed in three of the nine regional offices of the
Commission: Denver, San Francisco and Seattle. Underwriters were
not employed in any of the Regulation F assessments. One Regulation F exemption was suspended during the fiscal year.
B. CONTINUING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, contains a number of significant disclosure provisions with respect to securities
traded in the securities markets. These provisions, applicable in general to issuers of securities listed on exchanges and issuers of securities
traded over-the-counter which meet minimum asset and number of
stockholder tests, include requirements for the registration of securities with the Commission and for periodic reports, as well as for
appropriate disclosure in connection with the exercise of stockholders'
voting rights, takeover bids and insiders' securities transactions.
Registration of Securities on Exchanges

Unless a security is registered on a national securities exchange
under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act or is exempt from registration, it is unlawful for a member of such exchange or any broker or
dealer to effect any transaction in the security on the exchange. In
general, the Act exempts from registration obligations issued or guaranteed by a State or the Federal Government or by certain subdivisions or agencies thereof and authorizes the Commission to adopt rules
and regulations exempting such other securities as the Commission
may find necessary or appropriate to exempt in the public interest or
for the protection of investors. Under this authority the Commission
has exempted securities of certain banks, certain securities secured by
property or leasehold interests, certain warrants and, on a temporary
basis, certain securities issued in substitution for or in addition to
listed securities.
Pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, an issuer may register a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission and the exchange an application which discloses pertinent
information concerning the issuer and its affairs. Information must
be furnished regarding the issuer's business, its capital structure, the
terms of its securities, the persons who manage or control its affairs,
the remuneration paid to its officers and directors, and the allotment

42

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of options, bonuses and profit-sharing plans. Financial statements
certified by an independent accountant must be filed as part of the
application.
Form 10 is the form used for registration by most commercial and
industrial companies. There are specialized forms for certain types of
securities, such as voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit and
securities of foreign governments.
Statistics regarding securities traded on exchanges may be found
in Part III of this report, as well as in certain of the appendix tables.
Registration of Over-the-Counter Securities

Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act requires a company with total
assets exceeding $1 million and a class of equity securities held of
record by 500 or more persons to register those securities with the
Commission, unless one of the exemptions set forth in that section is
available," or the Commission issues an exemptive order under Section 12(h).
During the fiscal year, 651 registration statements were filed under
Section 12(g). This makes a total, from the enactment of Section 12(g)
in 1964, through June 30, 1969, of 3,819 registration statements filed.
Eight of these statements were withdrawn before they had become
effective upon determination that they were not required to be filed
under the Act.
Of the 651 registration statements filed under Section 12(g) in fiscal
year 1969, 353 were filed by issuers already subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Act. The latter figure ineludes 22 registration statements filed by issuers with another security
registered on a national securities exchange, and 331 filed by issuers
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) because they had
registered securities under the Securities Act. These latter companies,
however, had not been subject to the proxy solicitation and other disclosure and insider trading provisions of Sections 14 and 16 of the
Exchange Act. The remaining 2D8 issuers which filed registration statements had not been subject to any of the disclosure or insider trading
provisions and became subject to them through registration.
Adoption of Rule 12g-2.-During the fiscal year the Commission
adopted a rule relating to the registration of securities under Section
12(g) of the Exchange A ct.17 That section exempts from registration
'8 Section 12(g)
contains various exemptive provisions with respect to certain
types of securities. Of par-ticular significance are the provisions relating to securities issued by insurance companies and securities of foreign issuers. See discussions in 32nd Annual Report, p. 13 and 33rd Annual Report, pp. 13-14,
respectively,
17 Securities
Exchange Act Release Xo, 8573 (April 17, 19G9).

THIRTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

43

securities listed and registered on a national securities exchange and
securities issued by an investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. The new rule provides that where
a class of securities would have been required to be registered except
for the fact that it was so exempt, when the exemption terminates such class shall be deemed to be registered under Section 12(g)
if at that time securities of the class are held of record by 300 or more
persons. Thus, the rule accomplishes the transition from registration
under Section 12(b) or under the Investment Company Act to registration under Section 12(g) without the necessity of filing an additional registration statement.
Exemptions From Registration.-Section
12(h) of the Act authorizes the Commission, either by rules and regulations or by order upon
application of an interested person, to grant a complete or partial
exemption from the provisions of Sections 12(g), 13, 14, 15(d), or 16
if the Commission finds that because of the number of public investors,
the amount of trading interest in the securities, the nature and extent
of the activities of the issuer, the income or assets of the issuer, or
otherwise, the exemption is not inconsistent with the public interest
or the protection of investors.
At the beginning of the fiscal year 17 applications were pending
and 10 were filed during the year. Of these 27 applications, 6 were
withdrawn, 12 were granted and 1 was denied. The remaining 8 applications were pending at the end of the fiscal year.
Periodic Reports

Section 13 of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities registered pursuant to Section 12(b) or 12(g) to file periodic reports
keeping current the information contained in the application for registration or registration statement. These periodic reports include
annual, semi-annual, and current reports. The principal annual report
form is Form 10-K, which is designed to give current information
regarding the matters covered in the original filing. Semi-annual reports required to be filed on Form 9-K are devoted chiefly to furnishing mid-year financial data. Current reports on Form 8-K are required
to be filed for each month in which any of certain specified events of
immediate interest to investors has occurred. A report on this form
deals with matters such as changes in control of the registrant, important acquisitions or dispositions of assets, the institution or termination of important legal proceedings and important changes in the
issuer's securities. Certain real estate companies are required to file
quarterly reports on Form 7-K. Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act,
generally speaking, requires issuers which have registered securities

44

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

under the Securities Act of 1933 and which have no securities registered under Section 12 to file the reports described above.
The following table shows the number of reports filed during the
fiscal year pursuant to Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
As of June 30, 1969, there were 2,764 issuers having securities listed
on a national securities exchange and registered under Section 12(b)
of the Act, 3,331 issuers having securities registered under Section
12(g), and 2,359additional issuers which were subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 15(d) of the Act.

Administrative Proceedings to Obtain Compliance with Exchange Act Registration or Reporting Requirements

Section 15(c) (4) of the Exchang-e Act empowers the Commission
to find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that any person
subject to the provisions of Section 12, 13 or 15(d) of the Act or the
rules thereunder has failed in any material respect to comply with
any of those provisions. This establishes an administrative procedure,
similar to that provided in proceedings to delist securities under
Section 19(a) (2) of the Exchange Act, for apprising investors of
materially mi.sleading filings and for the resolution of accounting
and other complex and technical questions involving the disclosure
provisions of the Act. Under Section 15(c) (4) the Commission can
publish its findi.ngsand issue an order requiring compliance and, when
the circumstances of a particular case so warrant, apply to a U.S.
district court for enforcement of its order.
Two proceedings under Section 15(c) (4) were pending as of the
end of the fiscal year, in one of which 18 it is alleged that a schedule
filed in connection with a tender offer was misleading. This is the first
administrative proceeding arising out of the "Takeover Bid Bill"
enacted in July 1968.19

Proxy Solicitations

Scope and Nature of Proxy Regulation.-Regulation
14A under
the Exchange Act, implementing Section 14(a) of that Act, governs
the manner in which proxies or other authorizations may be solicited
from the holders of securities registered under Section 12 of that Act,
whether for the election of directors, approval of other corporate
action, or some other purpose." It requires that in any such solicitation, whether by the management or minority groups, disclosure must
be made of all material facts concerning the matters on which security
holders are asked to vote, and they must be afforded an opportunity to
vote "yes" or "no" on each matter other than elections. The regulation
also provides, among other things, that where the management is
soliciting proxies, any security holder desiring to communicate with
other security holders for a proper purpose may require the management to furnish him with a list of all security holders or to mail his
communication to security holders for him. A security holder may also,
subject to certain limitations, require the management to include in its
proxy material any appropriate proposal which he wants to submit to
a vote of security holders. Any security holder or group of security
holders may at any time make an independent proxy solicitation upon
compliance with the proxy rules, whether or not the management is
making a solicitation. Certain additional provisions of the regulation
apply where a contest for control of the management of an issuer or
representation on the board is involved.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminary form prior to the date of the proposed solicitation.
Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed disclosure
standards, the management or other group responsible for its preparation is notified informally and given an opportunity to correct the
deficiencies in the preparation of the definitive proxy material to be
furnished to security holders.
Under Section 14(c) of the Act, issuers of securities registered
under Section 12 must, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission, transmit information comparable to proxy
material to security holders from whom proxies are not solicited with
respect to a stockholders' meeting. Regulation 14C implements this
provision by setting forth the requirements for "information
statements."
Amendment of Item 7(f) of the Proxy Rules.-During
the fiscal
year, the Commission adopted a clarifying amendment to its proxy
.. This regulation also applies to securities holders of registered public-utility
holding companies, their subsidiaries and registered investment companies.

46

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

rules to codify a long-standing interpretation of Item 7 (f) of Schedule
14A, which specifies the information to be included in proxy statements.v Item 7(f) calls for information with respect to the interests
of insiders in transactions to which the issuer or any of its subsidiaries
was or is to be a party. Instruction 3 to that item permitted the omission of information as to certain indirect interests, including those
which arise from the ownership of a limited equity interest in another
party to the transaction. The amendment makes it clear that a general
partnership interest is regarded as being more than an "equity interest"; it is regarded as the equivalent of the interest of a corporate
officer who has an equity interest in the corporation.
Amendment of Rule 14e-2.--'During the fiscal year the Commission amended Rule 14c-2 of Regulation 14C.22That rule previously
required the transmission of an information statement only where
action was to be taken at an annual or other meeting of the holders of
a class of registered securities. The rule was amended so that it would
apply, not only where action is to be taken at a meeting of security
holders, but also where corporate action is to be taken with the written authorization or consent of the holders of a class of registered
securities.
Recent changes in the corporate codes of certain states (notably
Delaware and Pennsylvania) permit the taking of certain corporate
action, which would normally be voted upon at a meeting of security
holders, by securing the written authorization or consent of the requisite percentage of the holders of securities of the class entitled to vote.
Thus, the rule amendment was necessary to prevent important corporate action being taken under the above-mentioned statutory provisions by a relatively few large stockholders without the prior knowledge or consent of the other stockholders.
Statistics Relating to Proxy and Information Statements.-During
the 1969 fiscal year, 5,316 proxy statements in definitive form were
filed, 5,284 by management and 32 by nonmanagement groups or
individual stockholders. In addition, 115 information statements were
filed. The proxy and information statements related to 4,940 companies, some 491 of which had a second solicitation during the year, generally for a special meeting not involving the election of directors.
There were 4,548 solicitations of proxies for the election of directors,
742 for special meetings not involving the election of directors, and 26
for assents and authorizations.

Typical of such stockholder proposals submitted to a vote of security
holders were resolutions relating to amendments to charters or by-laws
to provide for cumulative voting :for the election of directors, preemptive rights, limitations on the grant of stock options to and their
exercise by key employees and management groups, the sending of a

Proxy Contests.-During
the 1969 fiscal year, 25 companies were
involved in proxy contests for the election of directors. A total of 549
persons, both management and nonmanagement, filed detailed statements as participants under the requirements of Rule 14a-l1. Proxy
statements in 20 cases involved contests for control of the board of
directors and those in 5 cases involved contests for representation on
the board.
Management retained control in 8 of the 20 contests for control of
the board of directors, 2 were settled by negotiation, nonmanagement
persons won 3, 1 resulted in a tie and 6 were pending as of June 30,
1969. Of the five cases where representation on the board of directors
was involved, management retained all places on the board in three
contests, opposition won places on the board in one case and one was
settled by negotiation.
Disclosure in Connection

with Takeover

Bids and Other Large Acquisitions

Amendments to Sections 13 and 14 of the Exchange Act relating to
full disclosure in connection with cash tender offers and other stock
acquisitions which may cause a shift in control became effective on
July 29, 1968.23 This legislation, which is more fully described in the
previous annual report," was designed to close gaps in the full disclosure provisions of the securities laws and to put cash tender offers
and other block acquisitions on the same footing as proxy contests for
control.
During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted temporary rules
and regulations to make the provisions of the legislation operative."
Rule 13d-l under the Act among other things requires the filing with
the Commission of a Schedule 13D report by a person or group which
acquires any of a class of equity securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Act or issued by a closed-end investment company registered under the Investment Company Act, if such acquisition results in
the ownership by such person or group of more than 10 percent of such
class of securities, During the 1969 fiscal year 251 Schedule 13D acquisition reports were filed. Rule 14d-l requires the filing of a Schedule
13D report by a person or group making a tender offer (other than an
exchange offer by means of a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933) which, if successful, would result in such person or
group owning more than 10 percent of any class of equity securities of

Insiders' Security Holdings and Transactions

Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act and corresponding provisions in Section 17 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 and Section 30(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 are
designed to provide other stockholders and investors generally with
information as to insiders' securities transactions and holdings, and
to prevent the unfair use of confidential information by insiders to
profit from short-term trading in a company's securities.
Ownership Reports.-Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires
every person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, more than
10 percent of any class of equity security which is registered under Section 12, or who is a director or an officerof the issuer of any such security, to file statements with the Commission disclosing the amount
of all equity securities of the issuer of which he is the beneficial owner
and changes in such ownership. Copies of such statements must also
be filed with exchanges on which securities are listed. Similar provisions applicable to insiders of registered public-utility holding companies and registered closed-end investment companies are contained
in Section 17(a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act and
Section 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act.
During the fiscal year, 93~708ownership reports (16,036 initial
statements of ownership on Form 3 and 77,672 statements of changes
in ownership on Form 4) were filed with the Commission. By comparison, during fiscal year 1968, 93,823 such reports were filed (14,893
initial statements and 78,930statements of changes) .
All ownership reports are made available for public inspection as
soon as they are filed at the Commission's officein Washington and
at the exchanges where copies are filed. In addition, the information
contained in reports filed with the Commission is summarized and
373-754--70----5

50

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

published in the monthly "Official Summary of Security Transactions
and Holdings," which is distributed by the Government Printing Office
to more than 24,000 subscribers.
Recovery of Short-Swing Trading Profits.- In order to prevent
insiders from making unfair use of information which they may have
obtained by reason of their relationship with a company, Section 16(b)
of the Exchange Act, Section 17(b) of the Holding Company Act, and
Section 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act provide for the recovery
by or on behalf of the issuer of any profit realized by insiders (in the
categories listed above) from certain purchases and sales, or sales and
purchases, of securities of the company within any period of less than
6 months. The Commission at time participates as amicue curiae in actions to recover such profits when it deems it important to present its
views regarding the interpretation of the statutory provisions or of
the exemptive rules adopted by the Commission thereunder.
Proposed Amendment of Rule 16a-I.-During
the fiscal year the
Commission invited public comments on certain proposed amendments
to Rule 16a-1 which relates to the filing of statements of beneficial
ownership of equity securities, and changes in such ownership, pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Act, and, after the close of the fiscal year,
it adopted the amendments in modified form.26
One of the amendments requires a person who has become a director
or officer of a company whose equity securities are registered pursuant
to Section 12 of the Act, or who is a director or officer of a company
whose securities have become so registered, to furnish with any statement regarding changes in his beneficial ownership of equity securities
occurring within 6 months after he became subject to Section 16(a)
information as to any changes in such beneficial ownership which
occurred during the preceding 6 months. The other amendment requires any person who has ceased to be a director or officer of such a
company, or who was a director or officer at the time the company
ceased to have any equity securities registered pursuant to Section 12,
to file a report with respect to any change in beneficial ownership
which occurs within 6 months after any change in beneficial ownership
prior to such cessation.
The purpose of the amendments is to provide disclosure under
Section 16(a) of the Act with respect to all transactions which may
be subject to Section 16(b) of the Act. The courts have held that
for the purpose of Section 16 (b) a purchase of an equity security made
before a person becomes a director or officer of a company having such
securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Act may be matched
with a sale within 6 months thereafter at a time when such person has

THIRTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

51

become a director or officer of the company. Similarly, it has been
held that for the purpose of Section 16 (b), a purchase of an equity
security of such a company by another company having a representative on the first company's board of directors may be matched with a
sale of such security, within 6 months, after the representative ceased
to be a director of the company. The same principles would seem to
apply where equity securities become registered, or cease to be registered, between the dates of purchases and sales, or sales and purchases,
made within a period of 6 months.
Changes in Rule 16h-3.-The
Commission is authorized to exempt
from the operation of Section 16 (b) of the Exchange Act any transaction not comprehended within the purpose of that Section. Rule
16b-3 exempts from Section 16(b) of the Act the acquisition of certain
securities pursuant to stock bonus, profit sharing, retirement and
similar plans which meet certain specified conditions, The rule exempts
the acquisition of shares of stock other than stock acquired upon the
exercise of options, warrants or rights and also exempts the acquisition of restricted, qualified and employee stock purchase plan stock
options, but not the acquisition of stock upon the exercise of such
options.
Paragraph (d) (3) of Rule 16b-3 previously provided that the
term "exercise of an option, warrant or right," as used in the rule, did
not include the making of an election to receive under any plan an
award of compensation in the form of stock or credits therefor, provided the election is made prior to the award and subject to certain
other conditions. However, in some instances the election to receive
stock under a plan is made annually with respect to the portion of the
award relating to the particular year. For this reason paragraph (d)
(3) of the rule was amended during the fiscal year to provide that an

Investigations With Respect to Reporting and Proxy Provisions

Section 21 (a) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to
make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether
any person has violated or is about to violate any provision of the Act
or any rule or regulation thereunder. The Commission is authorized,
for this purpose, to administer oaths, subpoena witnesses, compel their
attendance, take evidence and require the production of records. The
following investigations were undertaken pursuant to Section 21(a)
in connection with the enforcement of the reporting provisions of Sec-

Summary Suspension of Trading

Section 19(a) (4) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission
summarily to suspend exchange trading in a security listed on a national securities exchange for up to 10 days if in its opinion the public
interest so requires. Under Section 15(c) (5) of that Act the Commission may summarily suspend over-the-counter :trading in any nonexempt security for up to 10 days if it believes that such action is
required in the public interest and for the protection of investors.
During the 1969 fiscal year, the Commission temporarily suspended
trading in 33 securities, compared to 39 in fiscal 1968 and 22 in fiscal
1967. In seven instances exchange-listed securities were involved and
the Commission acted under both Section 19(a) (4) and Section 15(c)
(5) .28 In each of these cases, the exchange on which the securities were
listed had previously halted trading.
The principal grounds on which the Commission ordered suspension
of trading were that adequate or accurate information concerning the
issuer was not available; it appeared that misleading information was
being circulated; there was a need for clarification of information
published about the company; or the Commission learned of information not generally known to the securities community and investors
which indicated the existence of substantial questions concerning the
financial condition or business operations of the company or the purchase or sale of its securities. For example, suspensions were ordered
pending clarification and/or adequate public dissemination of information concerning: the market activity in a company's shares despite a
corporate by-law restricting their transferability; 29 the company's
principal product and its future prospects; 30 the apparent absence of

any known properties 01' operations; 31 the extent of losses discovered
by the company; 32 financial statements of the company and of companies acquired; 33 the existence of a genuine market for the company's
stock at the prices at which it had recently been quoted; 34 circumstances surrounding a change of control, the company's acquisition
program, accuracy and completeness of filings made with the Commission by the company and certain transactions in the company's securities by insiders and others; 35 and the offer and sale of stock allegedly sold as "lettered stock" (i.e., stock purportedly issued pursuant
to an exemption from registration) .36
In 13 cases, the Commission instituted enforcement action subsequent to or concurrently with the trading suspension where violations
of law were indicated." For example, the Commission had suspended
over-the-counter trading in the common stock of O'TlU3gaEquities Corporation following a spectacular increase in the market price of such
stock within a few months." The Commission noted that it had received information indicating that the securities of Omega, a so-called
"emerging conglomerate," were being sold on the basis of incomplete
and inaccurate information relating to the company's financial condition, product lines and acquisition program. It also noted that serious
questions had been raised as to whether so-called "lettered stock" reportedly issued at prices substantially below the prices then being
publicly quoted was being issued without compliance with the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities laws. Thereafter, the Commission filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for
the Central District of California, alleging, among other things, that
Omega, its officers and directors, and others had violated those provisions in the course of a program which involved reconstituting
Umega (which had an operating deficit of over $14 million) as a
conglomerate through the acquisition of a number of businesses and
obtaining the necessary cash through the sale of unregistered "letter"
secm ities at prices far below current market prices. Omega and nine
other defendants, while denying the allegations, consented to a final

suspension of trading was then terminated by the Commission.
In another case, involving United Australian Oil, Inc., the Commission suspended trading in the company's stock on the basis of information that the price had risen sharply and the fact that there appeared
to be no financial information currently available about the company
and information currently being circulated about the company's assets
and operations appeared to be inaccurate and incomplete." The company and its president had previously been enjoined from further
violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act. Company representatives had refused to provide pertinent information and
documents and the Commission had obtained an order directing the
president to comply with a subpoena requiring the production of corporate records. Upon his failure to comply with that order, the
president was found guilty of civil contempt and was sentenced to 6
months in jailor until he purged himself by producing the records or
giving a satisfactory explanation of his failure to do SO.41 United
previously had pled guilty and its president nolo contendere to a
charge of criminal contempt of the injunctive order." The Commission
terminated the trading suspension in August 1969.42 In its release
announcing such action, the Commission pointed out, among other
things, that the company was apparently insolvent and had no current
operations, and it cautioned investors to consider this and other adverse
information recited in the release, including the matters referred to
above.

C. ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING MATTERS

The several Acts administered by the Commission reflect a recognition by Congress that dependable financial statements of a company
are indispensable to an informed investment decision regarding its
securities. The value of such statements is directly dependent on the
soundness of the judgment exercised in applying accounting principles
and practices in their preparation, and on the adequacy and reliability
of the work done by public accountants who certify the statements.
A major objective of the Commission has been to improve accounting
and auditing standards and to assist in the establishment and maintenance of high standards of professional conduct by certifying account.. See Litigation Release No. 4283 (April 10,1969).

ants. The primary responsibility for this program rests with the Chief
Accountant of the Commission.
Pursuant to the Commission's broad rulemaking power regarding
the preparation and presentation of financial information, it has
adopted a basic accounting regulation (Regulation S-X) which, together with opinions on accounting principles published as "Accounting Series Releases," governs the form and content of financial
statements filed under the statutes administered by the Commission.
The Commission has also formulated rules wit:h respect to accounting
for and auditing of brokers and dealers and has prescribed uniform
systems of accounts for companies subj ect to the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935. The accounting rules and the opinions of the
Commission 'and its decisions in particular cases have contributed to
clarification and wider acceptance of the accounting principles and
practices and auditing standards developed by the profession and generally followed in the preparation of financial statements.
The rules 'and regulations thus established, except for the uniform
systems of accounts which are regulatory reports, prescribe accounting
principles to be followed only in certain limited areas. In the large
area of financial reporting not covered by its rules, the Commission's
principal means of protecting investors from inadequate or improper
financial reporting is by requiring a certificate of an independent public
accountant, based on an audit performed in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards, which expresses an opinion as to whether
the financial statements are presented fairly in conformity with accounting principles 'and practices which are recognized as sound and
which have attained general acceptance. The requirement of the opinion
of an independent accountant is designed to secure for the benefit of
public investors the detached objectivity of a knowledgeable professional person not connected with the management.
The accounting staff examines the financial statements filed with
the Commission to insure that the required standards are observed and
that accounting and auditing procedures do not remain static in
the face of changes 'and new developments in financial and economic
conditions. New methods of doing business, the formation of new types
of business, the increasing number of combinations of old businesses,
the use of more sophisticated securities, and other innovations, create
accounting problems which require a constant reappraisal of the
procedures.
Relations with the Accounting ProCession and the Public

In order to keep abreast of such changes and new developments and
in recognition of the need for a continuous exchange of views and information between the Commission's staff and outside accountants

56

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

regarding appropriate accounting and auditing policies, procedures
and practices for the protection of investors, the staff maintains continuing contact with individual accountants, other government agencies, and various professional organizations. These include the
American Accounting Association, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, the American Petroleum Institute, the Financial
Analysts Federation, the Financial Executives Institute, the National
Association of Accountants, and the National Association of Railroad
and Utilities Commissioners. Since the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants is the principal organization involved in the development and improvement of accounting and auditing standards and
practices in the profession, regular liaison is maintained with it through
its Committee on Relations with Securities and Exchange Commission and Stock Exchanges. Conferences are held from time to time
at which the staff is briefed on the work being done by the Institute,
including its Committees on Ethics and Auditing Procedures and the
Accounting Principle Board, and problems of mutual interest are discussed. A similar program of meetings is being instituted with the
Committee on Corporate Reporting of the Financial Executives
Institute.
As part of the Commission's effort to maintain a continuing exchange of views with the accounting profession, the Chairman, other
Commissioners, the Chief Accountant and other members of the accounting staff accept speaking engagements and participate in pane]
discussions at professional society meetings. In this way the Commission can indicate problem areas in accounting as to which it believes
the profession can aid in developing solutions. As an example, both
the Chairman and the Chief Accountant have urged the profession
to restudy the accounting principles applicable to business acquisitions
or combinations in order to develop criteria which will prevent abuses
arising from inadequate restrictions on the choice between the alternatives of purchase or pooling-of-interests accounting to be accorded
such transactions. The Chairman included a statement expressing his
concern on this matter in testimony before the Subcommittee on
Commerce and Finance of the House Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce in February 1969. The Chief Accountant also accepts engagements to explain the work of the Commission at colleges
and universities throughout the country.
Because of its many foreign registrants and the vast and increasing
foreign operations of American companies, the Commission has an
interest in the improvement of accounting and auditing principles and
procedures on an international basis. To promote such improvement
the Chief Accountant corresponds with foreign accountants, inter-

views many who visit this country. and, on occasion, participates in
foreign accounting conferences 01' writes for foreign professional
journals. During the fiscal year, he presented a paper at the Annual
Conference of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario at
Ottawa, Canada, and contributed an article for publication in The
Accountant's Mngazine, the journal of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland.
The Work of the Accounting Principles Board

The Accounting Principles Board sponsors research studies of
problem areas in accounting and formulates formal opinions and advisory statements for the improvement of accounting standards and
practices. The advisory statements contain recommendations of the
Board which companies may adopt voluntarily. In furtherance of the
policy of cooperation between professional organizations and the
Commission, the Board submits drafts of these studies, opinions and
statements to the Chief Accountant for review and comment prior to
publication, and representatives of the Board confer with him on
projects in progress or under consideration.
During the fiscal year the Board issued three opinions, one of which,
entitled "Earnings per Share," was an extensive revision and clarification of a prior opinion which became necessary because of the proliferation of increasingly complex securities. Another opinion
presented the results of a restudy of the accounting for convertible
debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants. The third opinion
removed an exemption, which had applied to the financial statements
of commercial banks, from the requirements of an opinion that specified the format of the income statement in regard to the determination
of net income. In July 1969, representatives of the banks, the Federal
regulatory agencies and the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants agreed upon specificstandards to be followed by the banks
in previously unsettled areas which are to be incorporated into the uniform reporting requirements of the three bank regulatory agencies and
the AICPA guide "Audits of Banks." Also in July the Board issued a
statement, "Financial Statements Restated for General Price-Level
Changes," in which the benefits of such statements when presented
on a supplemental basis are discussed, but which recommends against
their substitution for the basic historical-dollar financial statements.
This statement deals with a long-standing problem.
The Board has indicated that it has given top priority to a reexamination of the problems of accounting for business combinations and
it expects to issue an opinion on this subject by June 1970. Also
scheduled for issuance in the early part of 1970 are opinions on the
equity method of accounting for intercorporate investments, and on

58

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the effects of changes in accounting methods, and a statement urging
that companies include a statement of their accounting principles in
their annual reports. Other topics on which the Board or its subcommittees are working with a view to issuing opinions are: segmented data in the financial statements of diversified companies (for
the Commission's recently adopted rules in this area, see pages
22-24, 8upra.), capitalization of leases, preparation of interim financial statements, valuation of marketable securities, and components
of a business enterprise. A subcommittee is also developing a document
pertaining to basic concepts and accounting principles underlying
financial statements of business enterprises.
Research studies are being conducted on the subjects of extractive
industries (completed in December 1969), materiality, research and
development, foreign operations, stockholder equities, and asset and
liability valuation in income determination. Two other research projects are being prepared on inventory pricing and depreciation
methods.
In connection with the development of opinions in four problem
areas, earnings per share, business combinations, the equity method
of accounting and the valuation of marketable securities, the Board
sponsored symposiums attended by representatives of all professional
groups concerned with the particular accounting problems, including
the Commission, in order to foster a better understanding of the problems and agreement on the proposed solutions.
Oilier Current Developments

The Chief Accountant's Office is continuing its work on the project
of revising the accounting rules in Regulation S-X, the first general
revision since 1950, in order to make changes, additions or eliminations
that have become necessary as a result of changing conditions over the
years. A committee of the AICPA has submitted many helpful suggestions for revisions. More recently recommendations for revisions,
particularly with respect to the schedules specified in Regulation S-X,
were made by the Commission's Disclosure Study Group. The Commission issued a proposal in September 1969,43 to include in Regulation S-X a section which would specify the content of a statement of
source and application of funds. This proposal reflected recommendations by the Study Group, as well as by the AICP A and other professional groups, that such statements be required in certain filings
made by registrants. At that time the Commission also issued proposals 44 to require such statements in registration statements and annual reports filed under the Exchange Act .

During the fiscal year a compilation of all the Accounting Series
Releases was completed for printing in one volume. In this compilation
each release number is retained together with a brief statement of
circumstances or problems which made the release necessary at the
time it was issued, but only those releases which appear to be of value
currently were included intheir entirety.
During the prior fiscal year the Chief Accountant's Office studied
questions relating to the independence of accountants who examine a
nonmaterial foreign segment of an international business, in lieu of
the independent accountants of the parent company in the United
States. In August 1968, the Commission issued an interpretative
release 45 which stated that, insofar as ownership of securities by partners is concerned, the accounting firm performing the audit of the
division or subsidiary in these circumstances would be held to be not
independent only if securities of the parent company or the subsidiary
are owned by any of the partners of that accounting firm or of its
affiliated firms who are located in the officewhich makes the examination or who are otherwise engaged in such examination.
D. CIVIL LITIGATION INVOLVING DISCLOSURE MAITERS

As more fully discussed below," the Commission in its enforcement program frequently institutes injunctive actions in the Federal
district courts in order to halt or prevent violations of the statutes
administered by it and of its rules adopted thereunder. Many of these
actions relate in whole or in part to noncompliance with the various
disclosure requirements. In many other cases the Commission participates as amicus curiae in litigation between private parties where it
is requested to do so by the court or where it deems it important to
furnish to the court its views regarding the interpretation of statutory
provisions or of its rules. Two such cases relating to disclosure matters
are discussed below. Civil litigation relating to other phases of the
Commission's work is discussed in Parts IV-VII
of this report."
The Commission sought the aid of the courts on several occasions
during the fiscal year in order to insure compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Thus, for example, in S.E.O.
v. Golconda Mining 00.,48 summary judgment was entered in the Commission's favor on its allegation that, in violation of Section 16(a)
of that Act, Harry F. Magnuson, a director of Hecla Mining Company,

had failed to file timely ownership reports and had :filedfalse reports
regarding numerous transactions in that company's stock. The court
found that a similar pattern obtained as to the stock of seven other
corporations of which Magnuson was also a director, and it therefore
enjoined Magnuson from future violations of Section 16(a) with
respect to any securities registered on a national securities exchange.
In Gerstle v. Gamble-Skogmo, Inc.,49 an action in which shareholders of a company merged into Gamble alleged that a proxy
statement for the merger was materially misleading, the District
Court for the Eastern District of New York made several significant
rulings relating to disclosure of the value of assets in such a proxy
statement. The court adopted the views expressed by the Commission,
amicus curiae, that
(1) good faith offers from third parties to buy corporate assets for more than
their book value must be disclosed in the proxy statement if their
omission would render the statement materially misleading, but the
corporation's own asking price for the properties may not be disclosed;
(2) except when expressly authorized by statute or Commission rule, assets
may not ordinarily be written up above cost in either the body or the
footnotes of financial statements filed with the Commission; and
(3) existing asset appraisals of current liquidating value made by qualified
experts and having a sufficient basis in fact must be disclosed in the
text or narrative portion of a proxy statement for a merger or sale
of assets, along with a summary statement of (a) the factual basis for
the appraisal, (b) the relationship-if
any-between
the appraiser and
interested persons and (c) the terms of the appraiser's engagement,
Including the Instructton given to the appraiser as to the purpose and
method of appraisal, if the failure to disclose such appraisals would
render the proxy statement materially misleading.

The court also held that in an action brought under the proxy
provisions of the Exchange Act proof of an intent to deceive is not required, stating that "[n]egligence alone either in making a misrepresentation or in failing to disclose a material fact in connection with
proxy solicitation is sufficient to warrant recovery." 50 It further held
that in actions under the proxy provisions, the plaintiffs are not
required to establish "causation" by direct proof that with proper
disclosure enough shareholders would have voted against the merger
to defeat it, but that causation would be inferred if the" 'reasonable
man' test" 51 had been satisfied.

filed a brief, amicus curiae, in which it argued that the intrastate
exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act provided by Section 3(a) (11) was not available for the sale of such
interests to residents of the same State of which the individual issuer
was a resident and in which he maintained his office,where the land
covered by the leases was located in another State. The Commission
urged that in such cases Federal regulation is necessary because State
securities commissions cannot investigate the out-of-State activities
in order to determine whether the issuers' public disclosures of their
financial affairs are fair and adequate for the protection of investors,
The court adopted the Commission's reasoning that the issuer was
not "doing business" in his home State, as required by Section
3(a) (11).
E. CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS

INVOLVING DISCLOSURE

VIOLATIONS

During the fiscal year a significant appellate decision was handed
down in a case involving noncompliance with the Securities Act
registration provisions, which had been referred by the Commission
to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.
In United States v, W olfson,53 the court of appeals for the second
circuit affirmed the convictions of Louis Wolfson and Elkin Gerbert
for violating Section 5 of the Securities Act in selling unregistered
"control" stock of Continental Enterprises, Inc. The court held among
other things that: (1) neither Section 4 nor Section 5 of the Securities
Act, nor the concept of "control" stock, are unconstitutionally vague
or indefinite; (2) a person need not be an officeror director of an issuer
to be deemed a "control" person for the purposes of Section 5; (3)
the exemption from the registration provisions of Section 5 provided
by Section 4(1) for "transactions by any person other than an issuer,
underwriter or dealer" is not available for the sale of stock of a "control" person since a person taking the stock from a "control" person
becomes a statutory "underwriter"; and (4) a "control" person cannot claim the exemption under Section 4(4) for unsolicited brokers'
transactions, even though a broker selling stock for him may be
entitled to that exemption where the broker is not aware of circumstances indicating that the "control" person is engaged in a
distribution.
Also during the fiscal year, the former treasurer and a director of
General Development Corporation was convicted of wilfully violating
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act by failing to file with the Commission and the American Stock Exchange a Form 4 Statement re63

also involved violations of the registration provisions together with
other violations, may be found in Part IV of this report. 55
F. EXEMPTION FOR SECURITIES OF INTERNATIONAL BANKS
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development

Section 15 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, as amended,
exempts from registration under both the Securities Act of 1933 and
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 securities issued, or guaranteed as
to both principal and interest, by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Bank is required to file with the
Commission such annual and other reports with respect to such securities as the Commission determines to be appropriate in view of the
special character of the Bank and its operations, and necessary in the
public interest or for the protection of investors. Pursuant to this
authority, the Commission has adopted rules requiring the Bank to file
quarterly reports and also to file copies of each annual report of the
Bank to its board of governors. The Bank is also required to file reports with the Commission in advance of any distribution in the
United States of its primary obligations. The Commission, acting in
consultation with the National Advisory Council on International
Monetary and Financial Problems, is authorized to suspend the exemption at any time as to any or all securities issued or guaranteed by
the Bank during the period of such suspension. The following summary
of the Bank's activities reflects information obtained from the Bank.
Gross income of the Bank for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1969,
was $410 million, compared with $356 million in 1968. Expenses, which
included $197 million for interest on Bank borrowing, bond issuance
and other financial expenses, totaled $239 million, compared with $187
million last year. Net income in 1969 amounted to $171.4 million
compared with net earnings of $169.1 million in 1968.
The Executive Directors have recommended to the Board of Governors, for action at its meeting in Washington beginning September 29, that $100 million of the year's net income be transferred as a
grant to the Bank's affiliate, the International Development Association. The remaining portion of the year's earnings, $71.4 million, will
be transferred to the Bank's Supplemental Reserve, increasing this

Reserve to $1,034.3 million. Total reserves, including the Special R~serve, will amount to $1,326 million.
During the year, the Bank made 84 loans in 44 countries totaling
$1,399 million, compared with a total of $847 million last year. The
loans were made in Argentina (2 loans), Brazil (3), Cameroon (2),
Ceylon, Chile, Republic of China (2), Colombia (6), Cyprus, Ecuador,
EI Salvador, Ethiopia
(2), Finland, Gabon, Ghana, Guatemala,
Guinea, Guyana (2), India (2), Iran (2), Ireland, Ivory Coast (3),

Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria (2), Pakistan (6), Paraguay, Philippines,
Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore (2), Sudan, Tanzania, Thailand,
Trinidad and Tobago (2), Tunisia (4), Turkey (4), Venezuela (2),
Yugoslavia (2) and Zambia (4). This brought the total number of
loans to 636 (including $100 million to the International Finance
Corporation) in 86 countries and territories and raised the gross total
of commitments to $12,917 million. By June 30, as a result of cancellations, exchange adjustments, repayments and sales of loans, the portion
of loans signed still retained by the Bank had been reduced to $8,621
million.
Disbursements on loans were $762 million, compared with $772
million in the preceding year. Cumulative disbursements amounted to
$9,583 million on June 30,1969.
During the year the Bank sold or agreed to sell $35 million principal
amounts of loans, compared with sales of $107 million last year.
On June 30, the total of such sales was $2,177 million, of which all
except $69 million had been made without the Bank's guarantee,
Repayments of principal received by the Bank during the year
amounted to $298 million, and repayments to purchasers of parts of
loans amounted to $105 million. Total principal repayments amounted
to $3,321 million on June 30, consisting of $1,798 million repaid to
the Bank and $1,523 million repaid to purchasers of borrowers' obligations sold by the Bank.
On June 30, the outstanding funded debt of the Bank was $4,081
million, reflecting a net increase of $791.6 million in the past year.
During the year the funded debt was increased through the public
sale of $250 million of U.S. dollar bonds of which $70.9 million were

During the year Botswana, Lesotho and Mauritius became members of the Bank and the following five countries increased their
subscriptions to the Bank's capital: Trinidad and Tobago, Cyprus,
Tunisia, Ghana and Burma. Thus on June 30, 1969, there were 110
member countries and the subscribed capital of the Bank amounted
to $93,036.4 million.
Inter-American

Development

Bank

The Inter-American Development Bank Act, which authorizes the
United States to participate in the Inter-American Development Bank,
provides an exemption for certain securities which may be issued or
guaranteed by the Bank similar to that provided for securities of the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Acting pursuant to this authority, the Commission adopted Regulation lA, which
requires the Bank to file with the Commission substantially the same
information, documents and reports as are required from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The following summary of the Bank's activities reflects information submitted by the
Bank to the Commission.
During the year ended June 30, 1969, the Bank made 16 loans
totaling the equivalent of $178,840,000 from its ordinary capital resources, bringing the net total of loan commitments outstanding, after
cancellations, to 172, aggregating $1,098,575,000.During the year, the
Bank sold or agreed to sell $8,398,078 in participations in the aforesaid loans, all of such participations being without the guarantee of
the Bank. The loans from the Bank's ordinary capital resources were
made in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Uruguay
and Venezuela.
During the year the Bank also made 42 loans totaling the equivalent
of $324,850,000 from its Fund for Special Operations, bringing the
gross total of loan commitments outstanding to 219, aggregating
$1,358,513,000. The Bank made no loans during the year from the
Social Progress Trust Fund, which it administers under an Agreement with the United States, leaving the gross total of loan commitments outstanding from that Fund at 116,aggregating $497,457,000.
On June 30, 1969, the outstanding funded debt of the ordinary
capital resources of the Bank was the equivalent of $714,071,000,
reflecting a net increase in the past year of the equivalent of $206,642,000. During the year the funded debt was increased through pub-

was decreased through the retirement of $31,650,000 of short-term
dollar bonds and $5 million through sinking fund purchases.
The subscribed ordinary capital of the Bank on June 30, 1969, was
the equivalent of $2,263,735,000 of which $1,878,015,000represented
oullable capital.
Asian Development Bank

The Asian Development Bank Act adopted in March 1%6 authorizes
United States participation in the Asian Development Bank and provides an exemption for certain securities which may be issued or
guaranteed by the Bank similar to the exemption accorded the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the InterAmerican Development Bank. Acting pursuant to this authority, the
Commission has adopted Regulation AD which requires the Bank
to file with the Commission substantially the same information, documents and reports as are required from those Banks.
During the fiscal year 1969 the Asian Development Bank approved
11 loans amounting to $71.4 million equivalent from its Ordinary
Capital resources. This brought the Bank's loans from Ordinary
Capital resources as of June 30,1969, to a total of 13 amounting to the
equivalent of $76.4 million, against which disbursements of $4.37 million had been made. In addition, the Bank approved its first loan
from Special Funds resources in June 1969-a loan of $990,000equivalent to Indonesia for an irrigation project in Central Java. As of
June 30, 1969, the Bank had approved 15 technical assistance projects
in eight countries at an estimated cost of $2.1million.
On March 27, 1969, Hong Kong was accepted as a member of the
Bank, subscribing to $8 million of stock. This raised the total subscriptions to $978 million and brought the total membership to 33, of
which 20 are countries of the region and 13 are nonregional developed
countries.
The third of the United States' five $20 million installments on its
paid-in capital subscription was paid during the fiscal year, and consisted of $10 million in cash and $10 million in the form of a noninter373-754-70~

est-bearing letter of credit which may be drawn on in the future when
required by the Bank for disbursement. Of the $489 million subscriptions on paid-in capital, installments totalling $291.5 million had
matured as of June 30, 1969.
In September 1968 the Bank's Board of Directors formally established the "Consolidated Special Funds" of the Bank and adopted
the "Special Funds Rules and Regulations" which constitute a framework for the administration of such Special Funds. Japan, Canada,
Denmark and the Netherlands have offered to contribute a total of
$128.1 million to the Bank's Consolidated Special Funds, $33.1 million
of which had been made available to the Bank as of June 30, 1969.
In his Message on Foreign Aid of May 28, 1969, President Nixon
expressed his intention to submit to the Congress a new proposal for
a U.S. contribution to the Bank's Consolidated Special Funds.
At the Bank's Second Annual Meeting, held in Sydney, Australia,
April 10-12, 1969, the Board of Governors set aside for Special Funds
operations 10 percent of the convertible currency portion of the Bank's
paid-in capital which had been paid by the members as of that date
($14,575 million).
As of June 30, 1969, Canada, Denmark, Japan and the United
States had agreed to contribute a total of $1.98 million to the Bank
for technical assistance, against which disbursements totalling $382,149
had been made. In addition, Finland, Germany and the U.K. agreed
to contribute unspecified amounts for technical assistance; as of
June 30,1969, the Bank had disbursed $60,264 from these contributions.
G. TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939

This Act requires that bonds, debentures, notes, and similar debt
securities offered for public sale, except as specifically exempted, be
issued under an indenture which meets the requirements of the Act
and has been duty qualified with the Commission.
The provisions of the Act are closely integrated with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant to the Securities
Act of securities to be issued under a trust indenture subject to the
Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective unless the
indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter Act designed to
safeguard the rights and interests of the purchasers. Moreover, specified information about the trustee and the indenture must be included
in the registration statement.
The Act was passed after studies by the Commission had revealed
the frequency with which trust indentures failed to provide minimum protections for security holders and absolved so-called trustees
from minimum obligations in the discharge of their trusts. It re-

THIRTY-FIFTH

67

ANNUAL REPORT

quires that the indenture trustee be free of conflicting interests which
might interfere with the faithful exercise of its duties in behalf
of the purchasers of the securities. It requires also that the trustee
be a corporation with minimum combined capital and surplus; imposes high standards of conduct and responsibility on the trustee;
precludes preferential collection of certain claims owing to the
trustee by the issuer in the event of default; provides for the issuer's
supplying evidence to the trustee of compliance with indenture terms
and conditions such as those relating to the release or substitution
of mortgaged property, issuance of new securities or satisfaction of
the indenture; and provides for reports and notices by the trustee to
security holders. Other provisions of the Act prohibit impairment
of the security holders' right to sue individually for principal and
interest except under certain circumstances, and require the maintenance of a list of security holders which may be used by them to
communicate with each other regarding their rights.

PART TIl
REGULATION

OF SECURITIES

MARKETS

In addition to the disclosure provisions discussed in Part II of
this report, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 gives the Commission significant responsibilities with respect to the securities markets
and persons engaged in the securities business. Among other things,
it requires securities exchanges to register with the Commission and
provides for Commission supervision of the self-regulatory responsibilities conferred on registered exchanges. The Act also provides for
the registration and regulation of brokers and dealers doing business
in the over-the-counter markets, and grants to registered associations of brokers or dealers self-regulatory functions under Commission supervision. In addition, it contains provisions designed to
prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and manipulative acts and practices
on the exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets.
This and the next part of the report deal with developments and
actions taken in these areas during the 1969 fiscal year. Statistical
information concerning the securities markets is presented in this part.
Certain recent developments of particular significance are discussed
in Part T.
REGULATION

OF EXCHANGES

Registration and Exemption of Exchanges

The Securities Exchange Act requires an exchange to be registered
with the Commission as a national securities exchange unless the
Commission exempts it from registration because of the limited volume of transactions effected. As of June 30, 1969, the following 13
stock exchanges were registered:
Amertcan Stock Exchange
Boston Stock Exchange
Chicago Board of Trade
Cincinnati Stock Exchange
Detroit Stock Exchange
Midwest Stock Exchange
National Stock Exchange

New York Stock Exchange
Pacific Coast Stock Exchange
Philadelphia- Baltimore-Washington
Stock Exchange
Pittsburgh Stock Exchange
Salt Lake Stock Exchange
Spokane Stock Exchange

The Commission's staff has under consideration the details of a
proposed acquisition of the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange by the
Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington Stock Exchange. Under the Act,
68

THIRTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

69

the former exchange will be required to withdraw its registration as a
national securities exchange and the latter will have to amend its registration statement to reflect the acquisition. In addition, particular
attention is being given to the numerous rule changes which must necessarily accompany such a reorganization.'
The Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington
Stock Exchange has entered into an associate membership agreement with the Cincinnati
Stock Exchange. This agreement, which became operative on October 15, 1969,enables a member of either exchange to obtain associate
membership on the other exchange and thereupon to have orders
executed at preferred commission rates. The Philadelphia-Baltimore'Vashington Stock Exchange has similar trading arrangements with
the Pittsburgh, Boston and Montreal Stock Exchanges.
As of the end of the fiscal year, two exchanges, the Honolulu Stock
Exchange and the Richmond Stock Exchange, were exempted from
registration. In June 1969, the Commission issued an order withdrawing its exemption from registration of the International Stock Exchange (formerly the Colorado Springs Stock Exchange)." The
exemption order, which had been granted in 1936, provided that after
appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, the exemption might
be withdrawn if the Commission subsequently found registration to
be necessary or appropriate in the public interest. By 1967 the Exchange had become defunct, and the Commission was thereafter
advised that new management had been appointed and that a reorganization was planned, including marked changes in operations, membership, securities to be listed and location. In the course of discussions
between the Exchange's new management and the Commission's staff
regarding these developments, the Exchange consented to the issuance
of an order vacating the exemption.
Review of Exchange Rules and Procedures

A major aspect of the Commission's supervisory function with respect to national securities exchanges is the continuous review by its
Division of Trading and Markets of the existing rules, regulations,
procedures, forms, and practices of all exchanges. Such review is
necessary in order to: (1) ascertain the effectiveness of the application
and enforcement by the exchanges of their rules; (2) determine the
"On December 24,1969, the Commission issued an order granting the application
of the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange for withdrawal of its registration by reason
of its being merged into the Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington Stock Exchange,
and declaring the latter's acquisition of the Pittsburgh Exchange effective December 30, 1969. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 8789.

adequacy of exchange rules and of related statutory provisions and
rules administered by the Commission in light of changing market
conditions; and (3) anticipate and define problem areas so that members of the Commission's staff can meet with exchange representatives
to work out salutary procedures within the framework of cooperative
regulation. In addition, Rule 17a-8 under the Exchange Act provides
that each national securities exchange must file with the Commission
a report of any proposed amendment or repeal of, or addition to, its
rules and practices not less than 3 weeks (or such shorter period as
the Commission may authorize) before taking any action to effectuate
the change. These proposals are submitted for review and comment to
the Branch of Regulation and Inspections of the Division of Trading
and Markets.
During the 1969 fiscal year, 96 changes in exchange rules and practices were submitted to the Commission pursuant to Rule 178.-8.3
Among the more significant were:
1. Amendments of the New York Stock Exchange Constitution and
Rules providing for greater disciplinary jurisdiction and increasing
the maximum fine which can be imposed by the Exchange against a
member, allied member, member firm, or member corporation.
2. Revisions in the New York Stock Exchange's delisting criteria
under which the common stock of a company may be delisted when that
company or a parent or subsidiary thereof issues a debt security without sufficient earnings to cover the interest charges on all outstanding
debt and when, on a pTO forma basis, common stock equity is less than
25 percent of the capitalization. The criteria with regard to preferred
stock and guaranteed railroad stock or similar issues were also revised.
3. Amendments to the American Stock Exchange Constitution establishing a special trust fund to provide assistance to customers
threatened with loss of money or securities due to the insolvency of
a member, member firm, or member corporation.
4. Changes in the policies of the Midwest Stock Exchange to require
greater disclosure of certain information to the public where a stock is
to be listed, and to require delisting when the volume of trading in a
particular stock declines to a specified level.
5. A new rule of the Boston Stock Exchange requiring each member,
member firm, and member corporation doing business with the public
to carry fidelity bonds.
I Proposed
amendments to the Constitution of the New York Stock Exchange
to permit member firms to issue securities to the public, which were submitted
to the Commission after the end of the fiscal year, are discussed at pp. 8-9.

Delisting of Securities From Exchanges

Under Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act and the Commission's Rule 12<12-2thereunder, securities may be stricken from
listing and registration upon application by an exchange, or withdrawn
:from listing and registration upon applicaton by an issuer, in accordance with the rules of the exchange and upon such terms as the Commission may impose for the protection of investors. During the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1969, the Commission granted applications for
the removal of 109 stock issues, representing 95 issuers, and 5 bond
issues from listing and registration. Since 6 stocks were each delisted
by two exchanges and 1 stock by three exchanges, the total of stock
removals was 117. The distribution of these removals among exchanges
was as follows:

Delisting applications by exchanges are generally based on the
ground that continued listing is no longer appropriate because of a reduced number of shares of the issue in public hands or an insufficient
number of shareholders; the low market value of outstanding shares;
insufficient trading volume on the exchange; failure to meet the exchange's requirements as to earnings or financial condition; failure to
file required reports with the exchange; cessation of operations by the
issuer; or a combination of these factors.
The great increase in the number of delistings by the New York
Stock Exchange over the previous year, when it delisted 22 stock
issues, is largely attributable to the revision in the Exchange's criteria
under which preferred stock may now be delisted when there are less
than 50,000 publicly held shares, or when the aggregate market value
of publicly held preferred shares is less than $1 million.
The three applications by issuers which were granted during the
year resulted in the removal of one security from the American Stock
Exchange and two securities from the Richmond Stock Exchange.

Inspections

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of Exchanges

Pursuant to the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act, the Commission actively oversees the discharge by the national securities
exchanges of their self-regulatory responsibilities. As part of the
program, the Branch of Regulation and Inspections in the Division
of Trading and Markets conducts regular inspections of various
phases of exchange activity. This inspection program provides a
means of ensuring exchange compliance with regulatory responsibilities and enables the Commission to recommend, where appropriate,
improvements and refinements designed to increase the effectiveness
of self-regulation.
In cases where it appears that revisions in internal policies are
desirable in order to improve an exchange's performance, the Commission's staff communicates its views to the particular exchange
and discusses the matters with exchange personnel to arrive at appropriate solutions.
STATISTICS RELATING TO SECURITIES

TRADED ON EXCHANGES

Number of Issuers and Securities

As of June 30, 1969, 5,047 stock and bond issues, representing
2,880 issuers, were admitted to trading on securities exchanges in the
United States. Of these, 4,880 securities issues (3,238 stock issues and
1,642 bond issues), representing 2,764 issuers, were listed and registered on national securities exchanges, the balance consisting primarily of securities admitted to unlisted trading privileges and
securities listed on exempted exchanges. The listed and registered
issues included 1,773 stock issues and 1,450 bond issues, representing
1,528 issuers, listed and registered on the New York Stock Exchange.
Thus, with reference to listed and registered securities, 53.1 percent
of the issuers, 54.8 percent of the stock issues and 88.3 percent of
the bond issues were on the New York Stock Exchange. Table 4 in
the appendix to this report contains comprehensive statistics as to
the number of securities issues admitted to exchange trading and the
number of issuers involved.
During the 1969 fiscal year, 337 issuers listed and registered securities on a national securities exchange for the first time, while the
registration of all securities of 207 issuers was terminated. A total
of 765 applications for registration of securities on exchanges was
filed.
Market Value of Securities

Available for Trading

As of December 31, 1968, the market value of stocks and bonds
admitted to trading on U.S. stock exchanges was approximately $883

fell from 11.59 percent of aggregate share volume on that exchange in

volume in 1967 to 2.4 percent in 1968. The New York Stock Exchange
has indicated that this continuing drop is due in part to the Interest
Equalization Tax.
Comparative Exchange Statistics

During fiscal year 1969, there was a moderate increase in the total
number of stocks listed on exchanges. Although the increase in listings
on the New York and American Stock Exchanges was consistent with
the trend of recent years, the increase in stocks listed exclusively on
other exchanges was a reversal of the downward trend that had prevailed for many years.

accounted for by American Stock Exchange stocks rose for the second
consecutive year, while the percentage for stocks traded exclusively
on other exchanges increased for the first time since 1961.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The figures below show the annual volume of shares traded, including rights and warrants, on all exchanges during selected :rears since
1940. In 1968, both share and dollar volume continued their steady
climb of the preceding 5 years and reached new peaks. Trading was
particularly active on the American Stock Exchange with share and
dollar volume on that Exchange increasing 22 and 51 percent, respectively, over the previous year. "Whilevolume on both the New York and
American Stock Exchanges receded to some extent from the record
1968 rate during the first 6 months of 1969, volume on the regional
exchanges was moderately larger.

The ratio of share volume on the New York Stock Exchange to the
total on all exchanges again declined in 1968, but its dollar volume
ratio experienced an even steeper decline. The share volume ratio of
the American Stock Exchange increased moderately last year, while its
dollar volume ratio rose markedly. The American Stock Exchange
percentage of share and dollar volume has risen steadily since 1963,
while the percentage of the New York Stock Exchange has decreased.
The regional exchange percentage of both share and dollar volume
increased moderately in 1968. In the first 6 months of 1969, both the
share volume and dollar volume ratios for the New York Stock Exchange declined slightly further, while these ratios for the American

Block Distributions Reported by Exchanges

The usual method of distributing blocks of listed securities considered too large for the auction market on the floor of an exchange is to
resort to "secondary distributions" over the counter after the close of
exchange trading. There were 174 secondary distributions in 1968
compared to 143 in the preceding year. The dollar value of the shares
sold in this manner increased 36 percent to $1,571.6 million. During
the first 6 months of 1969, there were 88 secondary distributions with
a total value of $718.7million.
Special Offering Plans were adopted by many of the exchanges in
1942, and Exchange Distribution Plans in 1953,in an effort to keep as
much trading as possible on their floors. There was one special offering
in 1968, the first one since 1962. Exchange distributions continued to
decline from the record of 72 in 1963 to 35 in 1968. The value of the
1968 exchange distributions fell one-fourth to $93.5 million.

Unlisted Trading Privileges on Exchanges

The number of stocks with unlisted trading privileges which are not
listed and registered on other exchanges further declined during the
fiscal year, from 97 to 89. The decline was accounted for by five American Stock Exchange stocks, two stocks traded on the Honolulu Stock
Exchange and one on the Salt Lake Stock Exchange. During the
calendar year 1968, the reported volume of trading on the exchanges
in stocks with only unlisted trading privileges increased to about
52,321,064shares, or about 0.98 percent of the total share volume on all
exchanges, from about 38,065,577shares, or about 0.85 percent of share
volume during calendar year 1967.About 96 percent of the 1968 volume
was on the American Stock Exchange, while three other exchanges
contributed the remaining 4 percent. The share volume in these stocks
on the American Stock Exchange represented 3.2 percent of the total
share volume on that exchange.
D nlisted trading privileges on exchanges in stocks listed and registered on other exchanges numbered 2,018 as of June 30, 1969. The
volume of trading in these stocks for the calendar year 1968 was reported at about 178,172,008shares. About 78.6 percent of this volume
was on regional exchanges in stocks listed on the New York or American Stock Exchanges. The remaining 21.4 percent represented unlisted
trading on the American Stock Exchange in issues which were listed
on regional exchanges but as to which the primary market was the
American Stock Exchange. While the 178,172,008shares amounted to
only 3.4 percent of the total share volume on all exchanges, they constituted major portions of the share volume of most regional exchanges, as reflected in the following approximate percentages:
Cincinnati 61.4 percent; Boston 82.8 percent; Detroit 65.6 percent;
Philadelphia- Baltimore-Washington 79.4 percent; Pittsburgh 55.4
percent; Midwest 29.3 percent; and Pacific Coast 29.9 percent!
Applications by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges in stocks
listed on other exchanges, filed pursuant to Rule 12f-1 under Section
12(f) (1) (B) of the Securities Exchange Act, were granted by the
Commission during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1969,as follows:

NATIONAL SECUlllTIES EXCHANGES

accordance with Rule l7a-9, since January 1065 brokers and
dealers who niako markets in corninoil stocks traded on national securities exchanges (sometimes referred to as the "third market") have
been reporting their trading over the counter and on exchanges in the
mmmon stocks in which they make markets. They also report certain
oif-board trading in other coinnloil stocks .tri~dedon excl~anges.
~roker-dealerswho are not market makers report their large third
market transactions. Tlre reporting system is designed to reflect all sales
to persons other than hroker-dealers, i.e., to individuals and institutions. Since the beginning of 1967, reports have been required only for
common stocks listed on the Kew York Stock Exchange. About 98 percent of over-the-counter volume in listed common stocks is in New York
Stock Exchange issues.
During the calendar year 1068, total over-the-counter sales of common stocks listed on tho New York Stock Exchaiigc rose to 119.7
million shares valued a t $5,983 million. This dollar volume amounted
to 1.2 percent of the dollar volume in common and preferred issues on
the Excl~ange,the highest ratio since figures first became available.
In the first ltalf of 1969, third market volamc continued to increase

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

continued during fiscal year 1969 in the Commission's Officeof Policy
Research. The statistical series described below are published in the
Commission's monthly Statistical Bulletin. In addition, current figures
and analyses of the data are published quarterly on new securities
offerings, individuals' saving, stock transactions of financial institutions, financial position of corporations, and plant and equipment
expenditures.
Issues Registered Under the Securities Act of 1933

Monthly statistics are compiled on the number and volume of registered securities. Summary statistics for the years 1935-69 are given in
Appendix Table 1 and detailed statistics for the fiscal year 1969appear
in Appendix Table 2.
New Securities Offerings

Monthly and quarterly data are compiled covering all new corporate
and noncorporate issues offered for cash sale in the United States. The
series includes not only issues publicly offered but 'also issues privately
placed, as well as other issues exempt from registration under the
Securities Act, such as intrastate offerings and offerings of railroad
securities. The offerings series includes only securities actually offered
for cash sale, and only issues offered for the account of issuers.
Estimates of the net cash flow through securities transactions are
prepared quarterly and are derived by deducting, from the amount of
estimated gross proceeds received by corporations through the sale of
securities, the amount of estimated gross payments by corporations to
investors for securities retired. Data on gross issues, retirements and
net change in securities outstanding are presented for all corporations
and for the principal industry groups.
Individuals' Saving

The Commission compiles quarterly estimates of the volume and
composition of individuals' saving in the United States. The series
represents net increases in individuals' financial assets and net investment in tangible assets less net increases in debt. The study shows the
aggregate amount of savings and the form in which they occurred,
such as investment in securities, expansion of bank deposits, increases
in insurance and pension reserves, etc. A reconciliation of the Commission's estimates with the personal saving estimates of the Department of Commerce, derived in connection with its national income
series, is published annually by the Department of Commerce as well
as in the Securities and Exchange Commission Statistical Bulletin.
Private Noninsured Pension Funds

An annual survey is published of private pension funds other than
those administered by insurance companies, showing the flow of money

TIllRTY-FIFl'H

ANNUAL REPORT

into these funds, the types of assets in which the funds are invested
and the principal items of income and expenditures, Quarterly data
on assets of these funds are published in the Statistical Bulletin.
Stock Transactions of Financial Institutions

A statistical series containing data on stock trading of four principal
types of financial institutions is published quarterly. Information on
purchases and sales of common stock by private non insured pension
funds and nonlife insurance companies has been collected on a quarterly basis by the Commission since 1964; these data are combined
with similar statistics prepared for mutual funds by the Investment
Company Institute and for life insurance companies by the Institute
of Life Insurance.
Financial Position of Corporations

The series on the working capital position of all U.S. corporations,
excluding banks, insurance companies, investment companies and
savings and loan associations, shows the principal components of current assets and liabilities, and also contains an abbreviated analysis
of the sources and uses of corporate funds.
The Commission, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission, compiles a quarterly financial report of all U.S. manufacturing concerns.
This report gives complete balance sheet data and an abbreviated income account, data being classified by industry and size of company.
Plant and Equipment Expenditures

The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce, conducts quarterly and annual surveys of actual and anticipated plant and
equipment expenditures of all U.S. business, exclusive of agriculture.
After the close of each quarter, data are released on actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated expenditures for the next
two quarters. In addition, a survey is made at the beginning of each
year of the plans for business expansion during that year.

Exchanges for account of members and nonmembers, odd-lot stock

and block distributions of exchange stocks. Since January 1965, the
Commission has been compiling statistics on volume of over-the-counter trading in common stocks listed on national securities exchanges
(the so-called "third market"), based on reports.filed under Rule 17a-9
of the Securities Exchange Act.
Data on round-lot and odd-lot trading on the New York and American Stock Exchanges are released weekly. The other stock market data
mentioned above, as well as these weekly series, are published regularly
in the Commission's Statistical Bulletin.
Cost of Flotation of Security Issues

The Commission has completed a study of the cost of flotation of
registered equity issues offered by issuing corporations as well as selling shareholders for the years 1963-65.
Costs of flotation measure the initial costs of marketing securities,
i.e., the costs entailed in transmitting funds from the investor to the
issuing corporation. These costs are measured as the difference between
the price paid by the investor (gross proceeds) and the net amount
available to the issuer. They include compensation paid to underwriters, securities dealers, finders or agents, fees for lawyers and accountants, printing and engraving costs, Federal and State fees and
other expenses connected with the issuance of securities. The current
study covers initial costs of flotation only and does not attempt to
measure or compare the net cost of raising capital. Consequently, insofar as possible, costs not pertinent to the initial flotation, such as
advertising charges for redemption notices or trustees' charges for
continuing services, are excluded from the study. Moreover, this study
only attempts to cover cash compensation; noncash compensation such
as options-an important cost in the distribution of some smaller, more
speculative securities--is omitted because of problems of valuation.
Costs of flotation studies have been prepared by the Commission at
various ,times with the last previous study covering the years 1951,
1953 and 1955. The current study, however, is broader in coverage and
more comprehensive in its analysis. For example, the study covers all
types of securities which represent ownership interests in a business
or which are convertible into or represent a call on such securities.
Costs were analyzed for each type of equity securities to show differences or similarities between limited partnership interests and common
stock as well as for preferred stocks and convertible bonds. Moreover,

TEURTY-F~

~AL

REPORT

83

the study covers issues offered through securities dealers-either as
an offering to the general public or to stockholders-as well as those
sold directly by the issuer. Also, the current study incorporates into
the analyses factors influencing costs not covered in past studies.
Among these factors are the market place for outstanding securities of
the issuer and the offering price of the issues in the case of common
stocks.

REGULATION OF BROKER.DEALERS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS
Registration, Financial Responsibility and Financial Reporting Requirements

Registration.-Subject
to limited exemptions, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires all brokers and dealers who use the mails
or the means of interstate commerce in the conduct of an over-thecounter securities business to register with the Commission. Similarly,
investment advisers (with certain exceptions) must register under the
Investment Advisers Act of Hl40, which establishes a pattern of regulation comparable to that established by the Exchange Act with respect
to brokers and dealers.
As of June 30, 1969, 4,793 broker-dealers and 2,476 investment
advisers were registered, reflecting substantial increases in both categories during the year.
The following tabulation reflects various data with respect to
registrations of brokers and dealers and investment advisers during the

These forms required, among other things, that corporate applicants
and registrants submit certain descriptive data about their officers,
directors, and any other person who owned shares of any class of
equity security of the applicant or registrant, no matter how small
his holding. The Commission was advised of the difficulty being encountered by publicly held broker-dealers and investment advisers in
attempting to comply with this requirement. Accordingly, the Commission amended the forms so as to require the listing only of those
persons who own at least 1 percent of the authorized shares of any
class of equity security of the applicant or registrant, and the furnishing of information as to business, background, education, and
other pertinent facts only as to those stockholders who own at least
10 percent of any class of equity security.
Capital Requirements with Respect to Broker-Dealers.-Rule
15c3-1 under the Exchange Act, commonly known as the net capital
rule, imposes minimum net capital requirements on brokers and dealers. It also limits the amount of indebtedness which may be incurred
by a broker-dealer in relation to its capital, by providing that the
"aggregate indebtedness" of a broker-dealer may not exceed 20 times
the amount of its "net capital" as computed under the rule.
During the fiscal year, the Commission, as a consequence of the
acute delivery backlogs confronting the securities industry and the
attendant strain on the financial condition of many broker-dealers,
amended the net capital rule to require, in the computation of net

capital, certain deductions for "failed to deliver" securities," The Commission noted that delays in deliveries of securities to customers by
selling broker-dealers were in large part a reflection of the failure of
other brokers and dealers to deliver those securities to the selling
broker-dealers. It further noted that the great length of time in which
amounts due are carried in the "failed to deliver" accounts of brokerdealers exposes them to undue risk of market fluctuations in the securities as well as to the possibility of financial difficulties of the broker on
the other side of the transaction. Under the amendment a broker or
dealer, in computing his net capital, must deduct amounts equal to
specified percentages of the contract prices of securities in the "failed
to deliver" account, in accordance with a formula based on the age
of the items in the account.
Financial Reports of Broker-Dealers.-Rule
17a-5 under the Exchange Act requires registered broker-dealers to file annual reports of
financial condition with the Commission. These reports must be certified by a certified public accountant or public accountant who is in
fact independent, with certain limited exemptions applicable to situations where certification does not appear necessary for customer protection. During the fiscal year 4,369 reports were filed with the
Commission.
These reports enable the Commission and the public to determine the
financial position of broker-dealers. They provide one means by which
the staff of the Commission can determine whether a broker-dealer is
in compliance with the net capital rule. Failure to file required reports
may result in the institution of administrative proceedings to determine whether the public interest requires remedial action against the
registrant.
Regulation

of Broker-Dealers

Who Are Not Members of Registered

Securities

Association

Under the Exchange Act, as amended in 1964, the Commission has
the responsibility of establishing and administering rules relating to
qualification standards and business conduct of broker-dealers who are
not members of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
(NASD) 3 and persons associated with them, so as to provide regulation for these "nonmember" broker-dealers (sometimes also referred
to as SECO broker-dealers) comparable to that provided by the
NASD for its members,' Prior annual reports have described the
• Securities Exchange Act Release No. 8508 (January 80, 1969).
3 The Act does not specifically refer to the NASD, but to broker-dealers who
are not members of a registered "securities association." However, the NASD is
the only such association.
• See pp. 104-108 for the discussion of NASD regulation.

During the fiscal year, the number of nonmember broker-dealers
decreased from 495 to 455, and the number of associated persons
(which includes principally partners, officers,directors, and employees
not engaged in merely clerical or ministerial functions) decreased
from about 20,000 to about 19,750.6

One of the requirements applicable to nonmember broker-dealers is
that each associated person engaged in specified securities activities
successfully complete the Commission's General Securities Examination or an examination deemed by the Commission to be a satisfactory
alternative. Such alternative examinations include, thus far, those
given by the NASD, by certain of the national securities exchanges, by
many States, and by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). However, successful completion of the NAIC examination by an associated person qualifies him to sell variable annuities
only. During the fiscal year 1969, 1,924 associated persons successfully
completed the Commission's examination and 5,807 others an acceptable alternative examination.
Rule 15b9-2 provides for the annual fees to be paid by nonmember
broker-dealers to defray the costs of regulation. These include a base

During the fiscal year, the Commission amended the rule by deleting
the $15,000 maximum fee previously specified, and providing that the
maximum would be set each year on the form which must be filed/ In
addition, the 'amended rule provides that the maximum will include
the office :feesas well as the other fees. The maximum for fiscal year
1969 was set at $20,000.
Pursuant to the inspection program for nonmember broker-dealers,
25 inspections were conducted during the fiscal year. These inspections were designed to determine compliance with applicable Commission rules and to obtain information which will prove helpful in the
further development of the SECO program.
Detection of Improper Practices

Public Complaints.- The Commission has various sources of information concerning possible violations of the Federal securities laws.
A primary source is complaints by members of the general public concerning the activities of certain persons in securities transactions.
During fiscal 1969 the Commission received some 12,495 complaints
from investors 'and others relating to broker-dealers. The Commission's
staff gives careful consideration to such complaints and, if violations
are indicated, an investigation may he commenced. Other outside
sources of information include the stock exchanges, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., brokerage firms, State and Canadian
securities authorities, better business bureaus, and various law enforcement agencies.
Inspections.-The program of surprise inspections of brokerdealers and investment advisers by the Commission's staff is another
important device for the detection of improper practices. During fiscal
1969,732 broker-dealer inspections and 128 investment adviser inspections were carried out. These inspections produced indications of
various types of infractions, as shown below:

'''Hedge clauses" used in literature distrlbuted by investment advisers generally state
in substance that the information furnished is obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that no assurance can be given as to its accuracy. A clause of this nature may
be improper where the recipient may be led to believe that he has waived any right of action
against the investment adviser.

In order to enable the Commission to meet
its responsibilities for the surveillance of the securities markets, the
market surveillance staff has devised a number of procedures to identify
possible manipulative activities. A program has been adopted with
respect to surveillance over listed securities, in which the staff's activities are closely coordinated with the stock watching operations of the
New York and American Stock Exchanges. Within this framework,
the staff reviews the daily and periodic stock watch reports prepared
by these exchanges and, on the basis of its analysis of the information
developed by the exchanges and other sources, determines matters of
interest, possible violations of applicable law, and the appropriate
action to be taken.
In addition, the market surveillance staff maintains a continuous
ticker tape watch of transactions on the New York and American
Stock Exchanges and the sales and quotation sheets of regional exchanges to observe any unusual or unexplained price variations or market activity. The financial news ticker, leading newspapers and various
financial publications and statistical services are also closely followed.
If any of these sources reveals possible violations, the market surveillance staff conducts a preliminary inquiry into the matter. These
inquiries, some of which are conducted with the cooperation of the
exchange concerned, generally begin with the identification of the
brokerage firms which were active in the security. The staff may communicate with partners, officers or registered representatives of the
firm, with customers, or with officials of the company in question to
determine the reasons for the activity or price change in the securities
involved and whether violations may have occurred.
The Commission has also developed an over-the-counter surveillance
program involving the use of automated equipment to provide more
Market Surveillance.-

90

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

efficient and comprehensive surveillance. That equipment is programmed to identify, among other things, unlisted securities whose
price movement or dealer interest varies beyond specified limits in a
pre-established time period. When a security is so identified, the automated system prints out current and historic market information concerning it. This data, combined with other available information, is
collated and analyzed to select those securities whose activity indicates
the need for further inquiry or referral to the Commission's enforce-

mentstaff.
Section of Securities Violations.-A
Section of Securities Violations is maintained by the Commission as a part of its enforcement
program to provide a further means of detecting and preventing fraud
in securities transactions. This Section maintains files which contain
information concerning persons who have been charged with, or found
in violation of, various Federal and State securities statutes, as well as
considerable information concerning Canadian violators. These files
play a valuable role in the Commission's enforcement program and
provide a clearinghouse for other enforcement agencies. The information in the files is kept current through the cooperation of various governmental and nongovernmental agencies.
During the fiscal year, the Section received 3,841 "securities violations" letters either providing or requesting information and dispatched 1,852 communications to cooperating agencies. Among other
matters, information was received from several States and Canada
respecting 104 criminal actions, 49 injunctive actions, 169 actions in
the nature of cease and desist orders and 104 other administrative
orders, such as denials, suspensions and revocations of registrations of
issuers, broker-dealers and salesmen. Information was also received
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Commodity Exchange Authority, regarding administrative actions taken against futures commission merchants and floor brokers under the Commodity Exchange
Act. Action'S taken during the last 10 years under that Act include 71
decisions and orders and 68 stipulations and compliances. The information received was incorporated into the Commission's records.
All in all, information with respect to 5,385persons or firms was added
to the files, including information regarding 2,094 persons and firms
not previously identified, and information regarding 1,161 persons
and firms was removed from the files as obsolete or for other reasons.
As of the end of the fiscal year, the files contained information concerning 78,256persons and firms.
Use of Computer for Name Searches.- The use of the Commission's computer for "name searches" in the enforcement program has
resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of information avail-

REPORT

able and the speed with which it can be obtained. The names of suspected securities law violators are checked against the more than 1
million entries presently stored in the computer. Upon request, the
Commission also performs "name searches" on prospective securities
salesmen and others whose names are submitted by the exchanges, the
NASD and the State securities commissions. If the subject checked has
been named in formal filings with the Commission, has been a party to
a proceeding, or has been involved in an investigation, such information, together with pertinent dates, relationships and cross references,
is available immediately on a printout. Formerly a time-consuming
manual search of indices and files was required.
Investigations

Each of the Acts administered by the Commission specifically authorizes it to conduct investigations to determine whether violations
of the Federal securities laws have occurred.
The nine regional offices of the Commission are chiefly responsible
for the conduct of investigations. In addition, the Office of Enforcement of the Division of Trading and Markets at the Commission's
headquarters office conducts investigations dealing with matters of
particular interest or urgency, either independently or with the assistance of the regional offices. The Office of Enforcement also exercises
general supervision over and coordinates the investigative activities
of the regional offices and recommends appropriate action to the Commission.
It is the Commission's general policy to conduct its investigations
on a confidential basis. Such a policy is necessary to effective law enforcement and to protect persons against whom unfounded or unconfirmed charges might be made. The Commission investigates many
complaints where no violation is ultimately found to have occurred.
To conduct such investigations publicly would ordinarily result in
hardship or embarrassment to many interested persons and might
affect the market for the securities involved, resulting in injury to investors with no countervailing public benefits. Moreover, members of
the public would tend to be reluctant to furnish information concerning violations if they thought their personal affairs would be made
public. Another advantage of confidential investigations is that persons suspected of violations are not made aware that their activities
are under surveillance, since such awareness might result in frustration or obstruction of the investigation. Accordingly, the Commission
does not generally divulge the results of a non public investigation unless it is made a matter of public record in proceedings brought before
the Commission or in the courts.

92

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

When it appears that a serious violation of the Federal securities
laws has occurred or is occurring, a full investigation is conducted.
Under certain circumstances it becomes necessary for the Commission
to issue a formal order of investigation which designates members of
its staff as officers to issue subpoenas, take testimony under oath and
require the production of documents. During the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1969,the Commission issued 194 such formal orders.

activities of the Commission during fiscal 1969:

In Dosek v. United States,S the Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit, in affirming Dosek's conviction for mail and securities fraud,
addressed itself to the applicability of the doctrine of Miranda v.
Arizona 9 to Commission investigations. Dosek had claimed that information obtained from him during an investigation conducted pursuant to a formal order of investigation entered by the Commission
had been obtained in violation of his constitutional rights established
by the Supreme Court in the Miranda case. He urged that he was entitled to be informed, in the terms specified by the Supreme Court, that
he had a "right to silence," that he could refuse to surrender documents and records which had been subpoenaed, and that counsel would
be appointed for him if he so desired. The court rejected these contentions, primarily on the grounds that the defendant was not "in
custody" when his investigative testimony was taken and that no
coercion was practiced on him. The court pointed out that Dosek was
advised prior to giving any testimony that he had a right to be represented by counsel and to refuse to give testimony which might tend
to incriminate him.
Enforcement of Investigative Suhpoenas.-In S.E.O. v. Wall Street
Transcript Oorp./o the district court denied enforcement of an administrative subpoena duces tecum issued in the course of an investigation under the Investment Advisers Act into the question whether
the 'Wall Street Transcript Corporation, by publishing the Wall Street

tinguished a long line of cases holding that a court in a subpoena
enforcement action is not to determine whether the subject of the investigation is covered by the statute, on the ground that the First
Amendment was not in issue in those cases. Reasoning that "the Commission's broad inquiry under the Act can end only in restraint of
expression by the 'Vall Street Transcript," 11 the court concluded that
it was empowered in these unusual circumstances to decide whether
the subject of the Commission's investigation was covered by the
Investment Advisers Act. The Commission had argued that a determination whether the Transcript was a bona fide newspaper or financial
publication, and thus excluded from the coverage of the Act, must
neccessarily await the results of an investigation and that the question
was to be determined in the first instance by the Commission rather
than by the court.
Having concluded that it had jurisdiction to decide the issue, the
court reviewed the publication and its advertisements and concluded
that it was a bona fide financial publication of general and regular
circulation which was excluded from the coverage of the Act by Section 202(d). The court, however, specifically indicated that
"[a]n entirely different question would be presented if the SEC had COlliplaints or other evidence of conduct by the publisher outside the normal
functions of compiling and distributing an excluded publication. In ...
[that] situation, I believe that the Commission should be entitled to proceed
with court assistance under Section 209 if necessary, provided, of course, that
the scope and particulars of the subpoena were not unreasonable or
oppressive." 12

A motion by the Commission for reargument or clarification was
denied by the court and the Commission filed an appeal which is
presently pending."
In another subpoena enforcement action, a Florida attorney was
convicted of criminally violating Section 21(c) of the Exchange Act
by failing and refusing to testify and produce records in obedience to
a Commission investigative subpoena."
Imposition of Sanctions

Where enforcement action appears appropriate, the Commission
may proceed in one of several ways, although the use of one procedure
does not necessarily preclude the USeof another with respect to the
same conduct. The Commission may: (1) institute administrative
proceedings, (2) institute civil proceedings in the appropriate U.S.

Administrative Proceedings.-Under
the Securities Exchange Act,
as amended in 1964, the Commission has available to it a wide range of
administrative sanctions which it may impose against brokers and
dealers and persons associated with them. The Commission may deny
a broker-dealer's application for registration. With respect to a brokerdealer already registered, it may impose sanctions ranging from
censure through suspension of registration to revocation of registration. It may also suspend or terminate a broker-dealer's membership
in a stock exchange or registered securities association. Associated
persons of broker-dealers may be censured, or suspended or barred
from association with any broker-dealer. Under the Investment Advisers Act, the Commission may impose comparable sanctions against
investment advisers, but has no authority to take direct disciplinary
action against persons associated with investment advisers.
Generally speaking, the Commission may impose a sanction only if,
after notice and opportunity for hearing, it finds that (1) the respondent wilfully violated any provision of the securities acts or the rules
thereunder; aided and abetted such violations by others; (in the case of
Exchange Act proceedings) failed reasonably to supervise another
person who committed such violations; or is subject to certain disqualifications, such as a conviction or injunction relating to specified
types of misconduct, and (2) a particular sanction is in the public
interest.
While all respondents in broker-dealer and investment adviser proceedings are entitled to a hearing, such proceedings are frequently
disposed of without hearings where respondents waive a hearing and
consent to the imposition of certain sanctions or submit offers of settlement which the Commission accepts as an appropriate disposition of
the proceedings. In those instances where hearings are held, the hearing
officer who presides normally makes an initial decision, including an
appropriate order, unless such decision is waived by the parties. If
Commission review is not sought, and if the case is not called up for
review on the Commission's own initiative, the initial decision becomes
the final decision of the Commission and the examiner's order becomes
effective.
In those instances where it prepares its own decision upon review or
'waiver of an initial decision, the Commission or the individual Commissioner to whom a case may be assigned for the preparation of an
opinion is generally assisted by the Office of Opinions and Review.
This Officeis directly responsible to the Commission and is completely
independent of the operating divisions of the Commission, consistent

with the principle of separation of functions embodied in the Administrative Procedure Act. 'Where the parties to a proceeding waive
their right to such separation, the operating division which participated in the proceeding may assist in the drafting of the Commission's

A few of the more significant decisions of the Commission in
administrative proceedings with respect to broker-dealers and investment advisers are summarized in the following paragraphs:

THIRTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

97

In Armstrong, Jones and Oompany,15 the Commission, among
other things, held that the Securities Act registration provisions had
been violated. It found that a claimed intrastate exemption from
registration was not available for a particular offering of securities
because certain purchasers were in fact nominees for nonresidents
and an out-of-state distribution occurred when a part of the original
offering was resold by resident subscribers shortly after the Armstrong firm commenced trading in the stock. 'Vith respect to the latter
point, the Commission stated that, in considering whether the firm
and its principals had acted properly to limit the distribution to
residents, it deemed significant the facts that the firm's president had
solicited orders and indications of interest from nonresidents during
the initial offering and that, at the commencement of trading, the
firm's opening bid was substantially higher than the offering price,
thus tending to induce residents to sell their stock and enabling the
firm to resell to nonresidents.
On the basis of these violations and other serious misconduct,
including the making of extravagant and unwarranted representations and price predictions to customers, failure to disclose to customers common control of the firm and the issuer whose securities
were being sold, and the sending of confirmations to persons who had
not agreed to purchase stock, the Commission revoked the firm's
broker-dealer registration and expelled it from the Detroit Stock
Exchange, barred its president from association with any brokerdealer (subject to the proviso that after a year he could, upon an
appropriate showing, work for a broker-dealer in a nonsupervisory
capacity), and imposed sanctions of bar and censure, respectively,
against two other respondents.
In Paine, Webber, Jackson & Ourtis/6 the Commission found that
Ralph M. Klopp, a salesman for Paine, Webber, induced excessive
trading in the accounts of two customers by means of false representations concerning the securities activities of another customer and that
Paine, Webber and the manager of the branch office where Klopp
worked had failed reasonably to supervise Klopp 'with a view to
preventing his misconduct. Klopp falsely told the customers that
another customer, a doctor, had a large account, used the services of a
"Chinese chartist" and an investment adviser, and had made large
profits. He offered to apprise the customers of the purported doctor's

transactions so that they could duplicate them. The customers thereafter effected transactions on the basis of Klopp's statements regarding
transactions by the doctor, and their trading activity increased significantly. The Commission further found that the firm's procedures
were not adequate to detect excessive trading and that the firm and
the branch manager did not reasonably discharge their supervisory
duties.
The Commission concluded that in view of the serious nature of
Klopp's violations, which persisted for over 1 year, and its finding that
Klopp deceived his employer through the use of a secret account for
transactions by himself and his wife, it was appropriate in the public
interest to bar him from association with any broker or dealer, with
the proviso that such bar would not preclude his association, after
a period of 1 year, with a broker or dealer in a nonsupervisory capacity
upon a showing that he would be adequately supervised. The Commission censured Paine, Webber and the branch manager, noting
the improvements in supervisory procedures which had been effected
since the time of the violations.
In a case involving the improper use of inside information, Van
Alsty1U3, Noel &: 00.,17 the Commission found, on the basis of offers
of settlement, that the firm and certain of its partners and employees,
in connection with a prospective underwriting of the stock of Spiral
Metal Company, Inc. and a private placement of that company's debentures, received nonpublic information from Spiral with respect to
improved sales, earnings, productive capacity and future prospects.
Thereafter they purchased Spiral stock for themselves and for customers to whom they recommended the stock, prior to the public release
of the information. The Commission held that respondents' advance
use in market purchases of the favorable information, which they had
obtained by virtue of their special relationship with Spiral, for their
own or their customers' benefit and to the detriment of public investors
to whom the information was not known violated anti-fraud provisions
of the Exchange Act.18 Pursuant to the settlement offers, the Commission suspended the firm's retail sales and over-the-counter marketmaking activities for a period of 20 business days and its underwriting
activities for a period of 15 business days, and ordered the dissociation
from the firm of its senior partner for 90 days and of the other individual respondents for 20 business days.

formation, the Commission, pursuant to an offer of settlement, suspended the activities of the government bond department of Blyth &:
Oompany, Ino., for 15 business days and suspended the former manager of that department from association with a broker-dealer for 5
business days.19Certain traders in the firm's government bond department obtained from an employee of a Federal Reserve Bank nonpublic
information regarding the terms of prospective new issues of government securities and effected transactions for the firm's account in
outstanding government securities before the terms of the new financing were made public. When that information was made public, it
affected the market price of the outstanding securities. The Commission stated that transactions in government securities are subject to
the anti-fraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 10b-5 thereunder, even though such securities are exempt from
certain other requirements under the securities acts, and that the
legal principles enunciated in prior court and Commission decisions
relating to the improper use of inside information are no less applicable
to transactions in government securities than they are to transactions
in "nonexempt" securities. Itfurther stated that
"[u]nder those principles, since it was clear to participants in the government securities markets that the material information involved here was
intended to be kept nonpublic until a predetermined time and then disseminated pursuant to established official procedures, it was the duty of
registrant when it obtained advance possession of such information to
refrain from trading in government securities until the information had
been duly made public under those procedures."

In Oonsumer-Iruoestor Planning Oorporation,20 the Commission
found, pursuant to offers of settlement, that Consumer-Investor Planning Corporation (CIPCO), a registered broker-dealer and investment
adviser and manager of Associated Fund Trust, a registered investment company, and two of its officers and directors violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws in connection with the Fund's
portfolio transactions whose execution they directed. The respondents
selected brokers to execute such transactions who would "give-up" a
part of their brokerage commission or confer other benefits on the
respondents. The Commission, pointing out that the respondents
occupied a fiduciary relationship to the Fund, held that they were
required to direct the execution of portfolio transactions so as to
achieve the most favorable results for the Fund and not to prefer
their own interest. Instead, the Commission found, respondents engaged in "blatant trafficking of the Fund's business" and "committed

themselves and the Fund to relationships that did not permit them to
n .tnin the freedom of judgment and action that as managers they owed
to the Fund." The Commission had previously issued an order accepting the settlement offers which provided for various remedial action,
including suspension of CIPCO's broker-dealer registration for 45
days.
In two decisions under the Investment Advisers Act, the Commission
took action with respect to misleading or deceptive advertising by
investment advisers. Thus, in Dow Theory Forecasts, Inc.,21 it found,
pursuant to an offer of settlement, that Dow Theory Forecasts, Inc., a
registered investment adviser, and Le Roy B. Evans, its president,
published and distributed false and misleading advertisements soliciting subscriptions to registrant's advisory service. Among other things,
the advertisements implied that the advisory service would provide
information enabling a subscriber to obtain immediate profits or to be
protected against losses; implied that the Dow Theory, which is a
method for ascertaining market trends, was the principal basis for
registrant's selection of individual securities to be bought, sold or held;
and made misleading comparisons between the methods used by
registrant and by other advisers. In summing up, the Commission
stated that investment advisory advertisements
"should fairly present the services that are being offered and should not be
couched in terms that appeal to the investor's quest for instant riches or fear
of impoverishment. Registrant's advertisements were deceptive in content
and dramatic in their tone and form of presentation, particularly in the
wording, size, and color of their headlines. They were obviously of a character to whet the appetite of the gullible and the unsophisticated and disregarded the restraint and qualification that the intricate and complicated
nature of securities requires."

In an order previously issued, the Commission, as provided in the
settlement offer, suspended all advertising and solicitation for new subscribers by the registrant for 120 days.
In Stanford Investment Management, Inc.,22 advertising material
published by an adviser whose business included the management of
accounts in which clients wrote put and call options was found to be
misleading. The Commission held that a brochure soliciting persons to
use the adviser's management service gave a misleading impression of
the probability of gains to be achieved in the sale of puts and calls
under the adviser's guidance and of the unlikelihood of losses. The
Commission emphasized, as it had on prior occasions, that

"advertising and sales practices which mayor may not be suitable for products which are subject to actual inspection and testing in use clearly have
no place in the sale of securities which are goods of an intricate, complicated
and intangible nature. And put and call option contracts are securities of a
most complicated and technical kind whose many intricacies and complex
nature are not fully understood even by many persons engaged in the securities business itself, much less by the average or unsophisticated investor.
Transactions involving puts and calls have substantial speculative aspects
and entail significant risks of loss, and dealings in them are highly specialized
and difficult. In such a field adherence to high standards of fair and accurate
advertising is particularly important ... " [Footnote omitted]

Under all the circumstances, however, including the facts that the
advertisement followed the general pattern of other publications relating to put and call options and had been discontinued prior to the
institution of proceedings, and that this was the first occasion on which
the Commission had addressed itself to advertising literature relating
to puts and calls, the Commission concluded that censure of the adviser
and its president (who is also a registered adviser) was an adequate
sanction.
Among the court decisions reviewing Commission orders in brokerdealer proceedings the following are noteworthy:
In Nees v. S.E.O.,23 the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
affirmed an order barring the two petitioners, who were securities
salesmen for Century Securities Company, from association with any
broker or dealer.24 One of the petitioners had not actually received
notice of the hearings originally held, and he claimed a denial of due
process. However, the court sustained the procedure adopted by the
hearing examiner by which the hearings were reopened to afford him
an opportunity to confront witnesses and otherwise to respond to the
evidence previously introduced against him. The court also affirmed
the right of the Commission to take action against one who aids another
in securities law violations, and to impose a more severe sanction than
that imposed by the examiner.
In Beck v, S.E.O.,25 the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit summarily rejected the challenge of Beck, a former salesman for Commonwealth Securities Corporation, to the sufficiency of the evidence of willful violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act found by the Commission." It also rejected his

claim that he had been denied procedural due process-a claim which
included an argument that the commencement of the hearing had been
unreasonably delayed. The court stated, however, that it was unable to
determine whether the sanction imposed on Beck (a four-month exclusion from the securities business with a requirement that his subsequent employment be in a nonsupervisory capacity) constituted
an abuse of the Commission's discretion, because the Commission had
failed to "articulate the reasons for the proposed sanction." Accordingly, the court remanded the case to the Commission for a disclosure
of the reasons for the imposition of that sanction."
In Hanly v. S.E.0.,28 the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
affirmed a Commission order barring five securities salesmen from
further association with a broker or dealer." The court held that there
was substantial evidence to support the Commission's finding that the
salesmen made affirmative misrepresentations and made recommendations without disclosing material adverse facts of which they were or
should have been aware. The court emphasized that a salesman
"cannot recommend a security unless there is an adequate and reasonable
basis for such recommendation. He must disclose facts which he knows and
those which are reasonably ascertainable. By his recommendation he implies
that a reasonable investigation has been made and that his recommendation rests on the conclusions based on such Investigation. Where the salesman
lacks essential information about a security, he should disclose this as well
as the risks which arise from his lack of information."

Concerning the sanctions, the court stated that the Commission "clearly
has the authority to increase sanctions ordered by a hearing examiner
in his initial decision."
In Penmaluna db 00., Inc. v, S.E.0.,30 the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit reviewed a decision in which the Commission found
violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act and the
anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions of that Act and of the
Exchange Act.31 The court affirmed as to a majority of the violations,
but reversed certain of the Commission's findings of violations based
on the registration provisions. In light of its reversal, the court remanded the matter to the Commission for a reexamination of sane27 The Commission subsequently

Court.
Civil Proceedings.-Each
of the several statutes administered by
the Commission authorizes the Commission to seek injunctions in the
Federal district courts against continuing or threatened violations of
those statutes or the Commission's rules thereunder. Injunctive actions
frequently are directed against broker-dealers and persons associated
with them, and in such cases the complaint may allege noncompliance
with various regulatory provisions such as the net capital or books
and records requirements, as well as violations which may be committed
by any person such as securities sales or purchases in violation of the
anti-fraud or registration provisions of the securities acts."
For a discussion of civil litigation of particular interest, see pp. 109115, infra.
CriminalProsecution.- The statutes administered by the Commission provide that the Commission may transmit evidence of violations
of any provisions of these statutes to the Attorney General, who in
turn may institute criminal proceedings. Where an investigation by
the Commission's staff indicates that criminal prosecution is warranted, a detailed report is prepared. After careful review by the Office
of Criminal Reference and Special Proceedings and the General Counsel's Office,the report and the General Counsel's recommendations are
considered by the Commission. If the Commission believes criminal
proceedings are warranted the case is referred to the Attorney General and to the appropriate U.S. attorney. Commission employees
familiar with the case generally assist the U.S. attorney in the presentation of the facts to the grand jury, the preparation of legal
memoranda for use in the trial, the conduct of the trial, and the
preparation of briefs on appeal.
During the past fiscal year 37 cases were referred to the Department
of Justice for prosecution. As a result of these and prior referrals, 64
indictments were returned against 213 defendants, including 17 brokerdealers and broker-dealer principals and 9 broker-dealer employees.
Convictions were obtained against 83 defendants in 47 cases, including 15 broker-dealers and broker-dealer principals and 3 broker-dealer
employees. Convictions were affirmed in 9 cases, and appeals were still
pending in 15 other criminal cases at the close of the period."

Supervision of Activities of National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

Section 15A of the Exchange Act provides for registration with
the Commission of national securities associations and establishes
standards and requirements for such associations. The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), which is the only association registered under the Act, includes as members most of the brokerdealers who do business in the over-the-counter market or who underwrite new issues. The Act contemplates that such associations will
serve as a medium for self-regulation by over-the-counter brokers
and dealers. Their rules must be designed to protect investors and the
public interest, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and
to meet other statutory requirements. They are to operate under the
general supervision of the Commission, which is authorized to review
disciplinary actions taken by them, to disapprove changes in their
rules, and to alter or supplement their rules relating to specified
matters.
In adopting legislation permitting the formation and registration
of national securities associations, Congress provided an incentive
to membership by permitting such associations to adopt rules which
preclude a member from dealing with a nonmember broker or dealer
except on the same terms and conditions as the member affords the
general public. The NASD has adopted such rules. As a result, membership is necessary to profitable participation in underwritings since
members may properly grant price concessions, discounts and similar
allowances only to other members.
At the close of the fiscal year the NASD had 4,102 members, reflecting a net increase of 332 members during the year. This increase
was the net result of 543 admissions to and 211 terminations of membership. As of the end of the year NASD member firms had 7,099
branch offices.This figure reflects a net increase of 1,154 officesduring
the year, resulting from the opening of 1,712 new offices and the
closing of 558 offices.During the year the number of registered representatives and principals, categories which include all partners,
officers,traders, salesmen and other persons employed by or affiliated
with member firms in capacities which involve their doing business
directly with the public, increased by 50,146to stand at a record level
of 159,029 as of June 30, 1969. This increase, which was the net
result of 57,683 initial registrations, 22,355 re-registrations and
29,892 terminations of registrations, was attributable to the entry
of an increased number of insurance companies into the securities

THIRTY-FIFTH

105

business for the purpose of offering mutual funds and/or variable
annuities to the investing public and to the increase in activity in
the securities markets generally.
During the fiscal year the NASD administered 103,351 qualification examinations, of which approximately 71,408 were for NASD
qualification and the balance to meet the requirements of other organizations or authorities, including major exchanges, the Commission 34
and various States.
In Harwell v. Growth Programs, Inc., which principally involved
the power of the NASD to act by interpretation of one of its Rules
of Fair Practice, the Commission filed a brief as amicus curiae in the
District Court for the Western District of Texas supporting the
NASD's action. An interpretation promulgated by the Board of
Governors of the NASD in 1966 stated that the speculative use of
the withdrawal-and-reinstatement privilege contained in certain contractual plans for the accumulation of mutual fund shares was contrary to the public interest and inconsistent with Article III, Section
1 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice, which requires NASD members to conduct their business in accordance with "high standards
of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade." The
plaintiffs, who were purchasers of single-payment contractual plans
containing the withdrawal-and-reinstatement privilege, sued the
NASD, among others, seeking damages and the resumption of the
right to unlimited exercise of that privilege, alleging both breach of
contract and violations of the Federal anti-trust laws. The Commission, in its brief, took the position that contracts entered into by
others with members of a registered securities association, such as
the NASD, must be deemed subject to the rules of such associationand to any duly adopted interpretations thereof-in order to achieve
the effective self-regulation of broker-dealers intended by the Securities Exchange Act. The Commission also urged that collective action
under Commission supervision by the NASD and its members in
promulgating new rules or new interpretations of existing rules and
in enforcing those rulings is clearly contemplated under that Act
and cannot without more constitute a violation of the anti-trust laws.
NASD Disciplinary Actions.-The Commission receives from the
NASD copies of its decisions in all disciplinary actions against members and registered representatives. In general, such actions are based
on allegations that the respondents violated specified provisions of
the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice ..Where violations are found the

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

NASD may impose one or more sanctions upon a member, including
expulsion, suspension, fine or censure. If the violator is an individual,
his registration as a representative may be suspended or revoked, he
may be suspended or barred from being associated with any member,
and he may be fined and/or censured. Under Section 15A(b) (4) of the
Exchange Act and the NASD's by-laws, no broker-dealer may be admitted to or continued in NASD membership without Commission
approval if he has been suspended or expelled from membership in
the NASD or a national securities exchange; he is barred or suspended
from association with a broker or dealer or with members of the NASD
or an exchange; his registration as a broker-dealer has been denied,
suspended, or revoked; he has been found to be a cause of certain
sanctions imposed upon a broker-dealer by the Commission, the NASD
or an exchange; or he has associated with him any person subject to
one of the above disqualifications.
During the past fiscal year the NASD reported to the Commission its final disposition of disciplinary complaints against 123 member firms and 69 individuals associated with them. With respect to 12
members and 6 associated persons, complaints were dismissed because
the alleged violations had not been established. In the remaining
cases, violations were found and penalties were imposed on 111 members and 63 registered representatives or other individuals. The maximum penalty of expulsion from membership was imposed against 7
members, and 13 members were suspended from membership for periods ranging from 5 days to 6 months. In many of these cases, substantial fines were also imposed. In another 87 cases, members were
fined amounts ranging from $100 to $15,000. In four cases, the only
sanction imposed was censure, although censure was usually a secondary penalty where a more severe penalty was also imposed.
Various penalties were also imposed on associated individuals found
in violation of NASD rules. The registrations of 24 registered representatives were revoked, and 17 representatives had their registrations
suspended for periods ranging from 5 days to 60 days. Fines in various
amounts were also imposed against many revoked or suspended representatives. In addition, 19 other representatives were censured and/or
fined amounts ranging from $250 to $10,000. Three individuals were
barred from association with any NASD member.
Commission Review of NASD Disciplinary Action.-Section
15A(g) of the Exchange Act provides that disciplinary actions by the
NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its own motion or
on the timely application of any aggrieved person. This Section also
provides that upon application for or institution of review by the
Commission the effectiveness of any penalty imposed by the NASD is

TmRTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

107

automatically stayed pending Commission review, unless the Commission otherwise orders after notice and opportunity for hearing.
Section 15A(h) of the Act defines the scope of the Commission's review. If the Commission finds that the disciplined party committed
the acts found by the NASD and thereby violated the rules specified
in the determination, and that such conduct was inconsistent with just
and equitable principles of trade, the Commission must sustain the
NASD's action unless it finds that the penalties imposed are excessive
or oppressive, in which case it must cancel or reduce them.
At the start of the fiscal year, five NASD disciplinary decisions were
pending before the Commission on review. During the year five additional cases were brought up for review. Seven cases were disposed of
by the Commission. In five of these cases, the Commission sustained
in full the disciplinary action taken by the NASD.35 In one case the
Commission modified the penalties 36and in the seventh case the review
proceedings were discontinued upon request of the applicants. Three
cases were pending at the end of the year.
Commission Review of NASD Action on Memhership.-As
previously noted, Section 15A(b) (4:) of the Act and the by-laws of the
NASD provide that, except where the Commission finds it appropriate
in the public interest to approve or direct to the contrary, no broker
or dealer may be admitted to or continued in membership, if he, or any
person associated with him, is under any of the several disabilities
specified in the statute or the NASD by-laws. A Commission order
approving or directing admission to or continuance in Association
membership, notwithstanding a disqualification under Section 15A(b)
(4:) of the Act or under an effective Association rule adopted under
that Section or Section 15A(b) (3), is generally entered only after the
matter has been submitted initially to the Association by the member
or applicant for membership. The Association in its discretion may
then file an application with the Commission on behalf of the petitioner. If the Association refuses to sponsor such an application the
broker or dealer may apply directly to the Commission for an order
directing the Association to admit or continue him in membership.
At the beginning of the fiscal year, five applications Tor approval of
admission to or continuance in membership were pending. During the
year, four additional applications were filed, six were approved, one
was remanded to the NASD and one was withdrawn, leaving one
application pending at the year's end .

Commission Inspections of the NASD.-Under
the regulatory
scheme of the Exchange Act the Commission, as noted, is charged with
general oversight of national securities associations in the performance
of their self-regulatory activities .. With a view to insuring that the
NASD is meeting its responsibilities, the Commission's staff conducts
periodic inspections of various phases of NASD activity. During the
past fiscal year, the staff inspected the entire operation of the Association's district office in New York City. This is the largest NASD
district from the standpoint of number of members (1,463) and
associated personnel (35,069).
Disciplinary Actions by Exchanges

Although the Exchange Act does not provide for Commission review of disciplinary action taken by exchanges, each national securities
exchange reports to the Commission actions taken against members
and member firms and their associated persons for violation of any
rule of the exchange or of the Exchange Act or of any rule or
regulation thereunder.
During the fiscal year, nine exchanges reported approximately 136
separate actions, including impositions of fines in 72 cases ranging
from $50 to $100,000,with total fines aggregating $6093,510;the suspension from membership of 31 individuals; and the censure of 26 member
firms. These exchanges also reported the imposition of various sanctions against 58 registered representatives and employees of member
firms. In addition the American Stock Exchange reported a number
of informal staff actions of a cautionary nature. Many of the actions
against members and member firms resulted from back-officeand other
operational difficulties.
VIOLATIONS OF ANTI-FRAUD OR RELATED PROVISIONS-CIVIL
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

AND

A substantial proportion of the Commission's enforcement actions
is concerned with the use of false or misleading representations in connection with the sale or purchase of securities or other conduct violative of the anti-fraud or anti-manipulative provisions of the Securities
Act or Securities Exchange Act. Action designed to deal with such
practices often takes the form of injunctive suits or referral to the
Department of Justice for criminal prosecution," The Commission also
frequently participates as amicus curiae in litigation between private
parties under the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws, where it
considers it important to present its views regarding the interpretation
of those provisions. For the most part, such participation is in the

Civil Litigation

During the course of the fiscal year, the Commission participated
either as a party or as amicus curiae in a number of cases involving
important issues under the anti-fraud provisions.
In S.E.O. v. Texas Gulf Sulphur 00.,39 as previously reported,"
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed a decision of
the district court and held that certain corporate "insiders" had violated Section 10 (b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 under that
Act by purchasing stock of Texas Gulf on the basis of material
inside information not known to the general public. On April 21,
1969, the United States Supreme Court denied petitions for writs of
certiorari filed by two of the defendants, Frances G. Coates and
Harold B. Kline. Mr. Coates was a director of Texas Gulf who
purchased Texas Gulf stock after the company, at a specially called
press conference, had announced a major ore discovery near Timmins,
Ontario, Canada, but before that announcement had appeared in any
news medium of widespread circulation. Mr. Kline was an officer
of Texas Gulf who accepted a stock option from the company without
disclosing to the directors who granted the option information he
knew concerning the company's mining activities near Timmins. The
case has been returned to the trial court for further findings with
respect to a press release issued by Texas Gulf which the Commission
charges was misleading, and for a determination of the remedies to
which the Commission is entitled as against all the defendants.
After the close of the fiscal year, Mr. Coates and the Commission
settled their litigation. By the terms of the settlement, which was
approved by the district court, Mr. Coates has paid to Texas Gulf
$26,250, which represents the difference between the price of Texas
Gulf common stock purchased by Mr. Coates and his "tippees" on
April 16, 1964, and the mean price of that stock on the New York
Stock Exchange on April 17, 1964. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, the company is to hold the money until the court orders its
disposition; in the absence of such an order, the money is to become
the property of the company.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In an amicus curiae brief filed at the behest of the court in Oammon
v. Texas Gulf Sulphur 00.,41 the Commission supported a broad remedial construction of the class-action provisions of Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 23, as amended effective July 1, 1966,to permit private
actions arising under the Federal securities laws to be maintained
on behalf of a class of investors to the fullest possible extent. The
Commission's views were similar to those expressed in Hohmann v.
Packard Instrument 00. and Doqloui v. Anderson, reported in the
34th Annual Report at pages 103-104. The court's decision in the
Cannon. case was consistent with the views expressed by the
Commission.
In Heit 'V. Weitzen,-42 as previously reported," the Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit agreed with a position taken by the Commission, amicus curiae, concerning the scope of the "in connection with"
clause of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court found that language sufficiently broad to be applicable to statements made by a corporation whose securities are publicly
held whenever those statements are likely to affect the market for
those securities irrespective of actual trading by the corporation or
those connected with the issuance of the statement and irrespective of
the absence of motive to affect the market. After the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari, and the filing of a brief in opposition,
the Supreme Court invited the United States to express its views. The
Commission and the Department of Justice filed a brief in response
to this invitation, expressing the view that the decision of the court
of appeals was correct and that review by the Supreme Court was
not required. On May 19,1969, the Supreme Court denied the petition.
In Sohoenbauoi v. Firstbroolc,44 the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit sitting en bane followed the ultimate recommendations of the
Commission, contained in its brief amious curiae, in an action under
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The
suit was a derivative action brought by an American shareholder of
Banff Oil Ltd., a Canadian corporation that conducts all of its business operations in Canada although its common stock is registered
with the Commission and traded on the American Stock Exchange
as well as the Toronto Stock Exchange. The complaint alleged violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 based on sales of Banff treasury
stock to Aquitaine Company of Canada, Ltd., a Canadian corporation
which controlled Banff, and to another corporation. These sales were

at the current market price, but it was alleged that they were far below
actual value since they did not reflect the value of a rich oil strike in
which Banff had an interest. All of the directors of Banff were aware
of the oil discovery but the news had not yet been disclosed to the
public. Defendants were Aquitaine, the other corporations and all
directors of Banff.
As to the Aquitaine transaction the court held that the complaint
stated a cause of action under Section lO(b) and Rule 10b-5 because:
"It is alleged that Aquitaine exercised a controlling influence over the
issuance to it of treasury stock of Banff for a wholly inadequate consideration. If it is established that the transaction took place as alleged it constituted a violation of Rule 10b-5, subdivision (3) because Aquitaine engaged
in an 'act, practice or course of business which operates or would operate
as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or
sale of any security.' Moreover, Aquitaine and the directors of Banff were
guilty of deceiving the stockholders of Banff (other than Aquitaine)."

This holding required a reversal of the district court 45 which had
been affirmed by a panel of the court of appeals." The reasoning below
was that there was no violation of the anti-fraud provisions because
all of the Banff directors knew the relevant facts at the time of the
transaction, those who were directors of both Aquitaine and Banff, and
were thus subject to a conflict of interest, had refrained from voting,
and there was no showing why the knowledge of its directors should
not be imputed to Banff. The :full court also held that the allegations
of the complaint were sufficient to withstand a motion for summary
Judgment when supported by affidavits demonstrating little more than
Aquitaine's controlling shareholdings in Banff, its possession of material inside information about an oil discovery and the difference
between the price at which the stock was sold and its market price
after the news had been released.
Three judges dissented, adhering to the views expressed in the
majority opinion of the panel. In their view, the majority opinion of
the :full court "does indeed open the floodgates" and is "nothing short
of a standing invitation to blackmail and extortion."
No review had been sought of the panel's decision that the fact
that the sales in question took place in Canada between foreign buyers
and sellers did not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction
under Section 30 (b) of the Exchange Act.

Pappas v, J.l!088,J,8 where the court held, in accordance with the views
of the Commission, that a corporation may be the victim of a violation
of Rule lOb-5 even though all directors know all the true facts. The
case involved the issuance of common stock of the corporation to certain outsiders and to the defendant directors at a price which the
court found was not fair and reasonable. The directors, who approved
the transaction, were aware of the pertinent facts, and shareholder
approval was not required under State law. Nevertheless, approval
was sought so that the newly issued stock could be listed on the American Stock Exchange. The defendant directors owned a majority of
the outstanding shares and voted them in favor of the transaction.
Following remand by the court of appeals, the district court filed a
supplemental opinion awarding judgment of $344,446in favor of the
corporation, against all of the defendants jointly and severally." The
defendants included all of the directors of the corporation and most of
its corporate officers at the time of the transaction in question. The
district court found under State law that the defendants had failed to
sustain their burden of proving that the entire transaction was "honest,
fair and reasonable." In this connection the court found that the
defendants caused the corporation to execute certain documents which
were admittedly untrue and that they had misrepresented certain
facts to the corporation and its shareholders. In connection with its
finding of a violation of Rule lOb-5, the court stated:
"Without regard to the other misrepresentations and failures to reveal,
heretofore found, the defendants caused . . . [the corporation] to sell its
investment letter shares to themselves and to the outsiders at prices substantially below the fair value thereof on the dates of sale. These transactions constituted material acts, practices and a course of conduct which
would operate as a fraud or deceit on the corporation (assuming the independent stockholders were standing in the place of the defrauded corporate
entity as suggested by the court of appeals) in violation of subdivision (3)
of Rule 10b--5."

Last year's annual report 50 discussed the reasons for the Commission's disagreement with the decision by the Court of Appeals for the

tion of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act to
false and misleading statements made in soliciting stockholder consents w a merger of insurance companies. While recognizing that
approval of insurance company mergers is a matter governed by State
law, "the paramount Federal interest in protecting shareholders [was
held] in this situation [to be] perfectly compatible with the paramount State interest in protecting policyholders." Since the McCarran-Ferguson Act purports to make the States supreme only with
respect to laws "regulating the business of insurance," the court
observed that State activity focusing upon the relationship between
a stockholder and the company in which he owns stock "is not insurance regulation, but securities regulation" and thus not within the
scope of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The court also stated that,
although securities regulation by the States "may co-exist" with
securities regulation under the Federal securities laws, "it has never
been held that State regulation of insurance securities preempts Federal regulation."
The court rejected an argument, based on the so-called "no-sale
doctrine," that the complaint failed to allege misstatements "in connection with the purchase or sale of any security," as required by Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 1Ob-5thereunder.
It pointed out that the "no-sale doctrine" is specifically applicable only
to cases involving the registration provisions of the Securities Act, and
that, where an exchange of shares is involved, as in some merger situations, stockholders of a nonsurviving company are deemed to have
" 'purchased' shares in the new company by exchanging them for their
old stock." The court also held that there was no bar to the application
of Rule 10b-5 to misstatements in proxy soliciting materials, stating:
"Section 10(b) applies to all proscribed conduct in connection with a purchase or sale of any security; Section 14 applies to all proxy solicitations,
whether or not in connection with a purchase or sale. The fact that there
may well be some overlap is neither nnusual nor unfortunate."

In Mader v: Armel,54 the court, following the position advocated by
the Commission in a brief, amicus curiae, held that an exchange of
shares by minority shareholders pursuant to a merger agreement
constitutes a "purchase" and "sale" of securities and affords those
shareholders standing to maintain a suit under Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

amended complaint stated a claim against the defendant bank for
violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.
The complaint alleged a scheme whereby the bank would delay the
payment of sight drafts for securities purchased by certain of its
customers, in the hope that the price of the purchased securities would
rise, and the purchase could be financed by the proceeds of the sales or
pledges of the securities purchased. The court agreed that the Securities
Exchange Act is not intended to provide protection only for unsophisticated investors; ruled that the bank's participation in the scheme
was a sufficient connection with the fraud to satisfy the "in connection
with" clause even though the bank itself neither bought nor sold securities; ruled that the bank was "any person" within the purview of
Section 10(b) 'and Rule 10b-5; and refused to read into Section 10(b)
and Rule 10b-5 a contributory negligence standard as the bank had
urged.
Tender Offer Cases.- The Commission during the fiscal year participated as amicus curiae in three cases invol vil1g tender offer
situations.
In Eleotronic Specialty v, International Oontrols,56 the Commission
took the position that a company that is the target of a cash tender offer
has standing to sue for alleged violations of Sections 14(d) (1) and (e)
of the Exchange Act which were part of the recently enacted tender
offer legislation." Its memorandum, which dealt only with the issue of
standing, was submitted at the request of the district court in connection with the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The district
court held, as the Commission had urged, that the target corporation
did have standing to seek injunctive relief. On appeal, the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit disagreed with the district court's
finding that the complaint stated a violation of the tender offer provisions involved but agreed that the target corporation had standing. It
reasoned that the purposes of the tender offer legislation would best
be accomplished by allowing the target corporation to have standing
since, among other things, "the superior resources of the corporation
. . . can be vital in . . . [the context of violations of the securities
laws in the course of a tender offer] where remedial action must be
speedy and forceful"
Subsequently, the Commission, in Pan American Sulphur Oompany
v, The Susquehanna Corporations» had occasion to take exception to
certain language in the court of appeals' decision in Eleotronic Spedalty which suggested that the remedies of divestiture or disfranchise58 409 F. 2d 937 (C.A. 2,1969) .

ment are inappropriate for violations of the tender offer provisions.
In a memorandum dealing solely with the question of appropriate
remedies, the Commission stated that the opinion in that case "failed to
give sufficient recognition to the principles, ... establishing the importance of effective remedies as an enforcement weapon to deter further violations. In this connection, the court attached undue significance to the possible monetary loss to the defendant from an order of
divestiture or disfranchisement." The Commission further urged that
the remedy of precluding (either by injunction or divestiture) the
tender offeror from exercising control over the target company through
the use of the unlawfully acquired shares affords "some redress to the
nontendering shareholder by preventing what may be a change in the
nature of his investment that he did not desire; it also serves as a
deterrent to future violations by depriving the wrongdoer of the fruits
of his misconduct." The district court opinion, which enjoined the
defendants from voting the shares acquired in connection with violations of the securities laws, is consistent with the views expressed by
the Commission."
In a related case, Iroquois Industries, Inc. v, Syracu.se Ohina Oorporation, where the alleged violations of the securities laws occurred
prior to the passage of the tender offer bill, the Commission took the
position in a brief submitted amicus curiae to the Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit that the corporation making a tender offer had
standing to sue the target corporation for its alleged violations of
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. Subsequent to the
end of the fiscal year, the court affirmed the district court's dismissal
of the action for lack of standing."
Criminal Proceedings

Among the important criminal prosecutions initiated during the
year were several involving attempts to evade provisions of the securities laws by channelling activities through various foreign countries
that have strict secrecy laws regarding financial activities. The Arzi
Bank A. G. of Zurich, Switzerland, was indicted and pleaded guilty
to a charge that it violated the margin rules established by the Federal Reserve Board and enforced by the Commission." The indictment charged that since 1964 the Bank had been assisting certain
American investors to circumvent these requirements by permitting

such investors to trade on as little as 10 percent margin through
omnibus accounts maintained by the Bank at various New York
Stock Exchange member firms. In a related case, Coggeshall & Hicks,
a New York Stock Exchange member firm, and five of its partners and
employees were indicted on charges of conspiring with the Bank to
arrange illegal extensions of credit, in connection with purchases and
sales of securities channelled through an omnibus account maintained
with the firm by the Bank." Three of the individual defendants
pleaded guilty to the charge.
In another case involving the use of Swiss and other foreign banks
to circumvent provisions of the Federal securities laws, two indictments were returned against Jerome Deutsch, executive vice-president
of Realty Equities Corporation, a diversified New York concern."
The first indictment among other things charged Deutsch and Nate
Dolin, an officerand director of an affiliated company, with violations
of the mail fraud statute and anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange
Act in connection with the sale by Realty Equities and others of
promissory notes with warrants attached to Swiss banks, with undisclosed personal profits being realized by Dolin when the Swiss
banks in turn resold the notes and warrants to Equity Growth Fund
of America, Inc., a mutual fund. The second indictment charged
Deutsch and Frank D. Mills, a former vice president of the Puritan
Fund of Boston, Massachusetts, and an officer of the Fidelity Trend
Fund of Boston, Massachusetts, with violations of anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act and the provisions of Section 11 of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, which prohibit joint ventures between investment companies and their affiliates without prior Commission approval and prohibit investment company officers from
receiving undisclosed compensation in transactions entered into by
the investment company. The charges centered around Mills' purchase from Deutsch, for Puritan Fund and Fidelity Trend Fund, of
Realty Equities promissory notes with warrants attached without
prior Commission approval, and the payment of undisclosed compensation to Mills by Realty Equities and one of its officers in connection with these transactions.
The former president and chairman of the board of directors of
VTR, Incorporated, whose shares are listed on the American Stock
Exchange, was indicted together with a former broker-dealer, three
promoters, another person associated with VTR, and a Liechtenstein
trust, for conspiracy to violate, and substantive violations of, the

registration and anti-fraud and antimanipulative provisions of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act in connection with a scheme to
distribute unregistered VTR shares at manipulated prices, and to
conceal the identity of the sellers by utilizing Swiss and German
banks and a Liechtenstein trust, all operating under cover of strict
secrecy laws in their respective countries. The indictment charged
that simultaneously with the illegal distribution, the defendants made
a world-wide effort to manipulate upward the price of VTR stock on
the American Stock Exchange." One promoter and the Liechtenstein
trust have pleaded guilty to the charges, and the remaining defendants are awaiting trial.
Two Canadian promoters and one English promoter, along with a
Panamanian bank, and a Bahamian bank operating out of Switzerland, were indicted for conspiring to violate and substantive violations of the registration and anti- fraud provisions of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, and the Federal mail fraud statute." The
indictment charged a scheme whereby American investors were enticed
by the defendants to exchange securities held in dormant or defunct
Canadian mining companies for allegedly valuable new securities of a
complex of companies operated by the defendants in Panama and the
Bahamas. To effect such exchanges, investors were required to pay
transfer fees, transfer taxes, and a supposedly due United States interest equalization tax to a bank controlled by the defendants in Panama.
All of such funds were converted to the defendants' own use and benefit. This case has not been tried, since the defendants are currently
either fugitives or incarcerated in other countries. Canadian Provincial
authorities in Toronto, Ontario, rendered material assistance to the
Commission in the development of this international securities fraud
case.
Shortly after the end of the fiscal year, First Hanover Corporation,
a New York Stock Exchange member firm, Alfred M. Lerner, its
president, and three other defendants were indicted for conspiracy
to violate, and substantive violations of, the margin requirements of
Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal false
statements statute." The indictment charged that in connection with
an attempted takeover of Holly Sugar Corporation the defendants
permitted another company to purchase Holly Sugar securities in an
omnibus account maintained at First Hanover by a brokerage firm
located in Montevideo, Uruguay, without complying with applicable
margin requirements. In a second indictment, Lerner was charged
with violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act

for failure to disclose in registration statements filed with the Commission on behalf of three corporate issuers that material amounts of
each issue were to be sold to a Panamanian company controlled by
Lerner, and that such purchases were to be channelled through several
Swiss banks and a broker-dealer located in Montevideo.
Significant indictments returned during the year in other cases included indictments charging violation of Federal Reserve Board Regulation U which regulates the amount of credit that banks can extend to
finance the purchase of listed securities; 67 violation of anti-fraud provisions by officers of a broker-dealer who allegedly failed to disclose
that the firm could not promptly deliver securities being sold, because
of the precarious financial condition of the firm; 68 manipulation of
the price of Rand Development Corporation stock through misleading
press releases relating to an alleged "cancer cure," in an attempt to
forestall a bank from calling substantial loans secured by Rand Development stock; 69 and violations of the registration and anti-fraud
provisions of the Securities Act and the mail fraud and conspiracy
statutes in connection with the sale of "bond investment certificates"
and other securities of Louisiana Loan and Thrift Corporation 70 and
Arkansas Loan & Thrift Corporation."
In disposing of pretrial motions in a case that has not yet been
tried, the Federal district court in the Southern District of New York
held that the "short selling" provisions of Section lO(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule lOa-l thereunder were not unconstitutionally
vague, since on their face they define a crime with sufficient precision
to enable a person of common intelligence to understand the type of
activity proscribed and to conduct himself within the confines of the
law.? In the same case, the court upheld the constitutionality of the
penalty provision of Section 32 of the Exchange Act which makes the
wilful violation of a rule under the Act a felony unless the defendant
can prove that he had no knowledge of the rule, in which case the
crime is reduced to a misdemeanor. Another district court, interpreting Section 32, held that two defendants who had pleaded guilty to
violations of Rule lOh-5 in the case involving the collapse of Westec
Corporation, the Texas-based conglomerate, were guilty of felonies,
rejecting their claim that they were guilty only of misdemeanors

of Rule 10b-5.73 The court found that they knew that the Act proscribed fraud and manipulation, and held that, notwithstanding their
claimed ignorance of the specific language of Rule 10b-5, such knowledge constituted sufficient criminal intent to make their activities
felonious.
In United States v. Frank,74 involving a charge of criminal contempt based on violation of an injunction issued at the Commission's
request, the U.S. Supreme Court held that it was not error for the
trial court to place the defendant on probation for 3 years even though
he had requested and been denied a jury trial. The Court applied
the principle of Ohelf v. Schmaokenberq 75 to criminal contempt cases
arising out of violations of civil injunctions obtained by Commission;
i.e., that the defendant is not entitled to a jury trial as long as
the sentence imposed upon conviction does not exceed 6 months
imprisonment.
COOPERATIVE

ENFORCEMENT

PROGRAM

In recent years the Commission has given increased emphasis to the
coordination of its enforcement activities with those of the various
State and local authorities, the self-regulatory agencies and foreign
securities agencies. This program encompasses the referral to State
and local authorities for investigation and criminal or other action of
those violations where the amounts of money or the number of investors involved do not appear to be substantial enough to warrant development of the case at the Federal level. The Commission frequently
provides manpower assistance to these authorities in the development
of such cases."
During the fiscal year, the Commission continued its program of
cooperative regional enforcement conferences at each of its regional
offices. These conferences, during which Commission personnel meet
with personnel from State securities commissions, post officeinspectors,
Federal, State and local prosecutors and local representatives of 001£regulatory agencies such as the NASD, are designed to promote the
exchange of information concerning regional enforcement problems,
the development of methods of increasing cooperation and communication, and the elimination of needless effort and waste of manpower

and other resources in the regulation of the securities markets. Although the Commission served as the primary agency in establishing
these cooperative enforcement conferences, they have progressed to
the point where State securities commissions are now often the hosts
or co-hosts of the programs. In addition, the Commission's regional
officeshave taken steps to improve the coordination of inspections and
other activities with State securities administrators and with the
NASD in those areas where their respective jurisdictions overlap. Staff
members of the Commission and of certain State authorities have
conducted joint inspections which have made the entire inspection
program more effective.
For the past 3 years the Commission has held one or two-week
nation-wide enforcement training sessions at its headquarters officein
"'\Vashington,D.C. to which it has invited staff members of State and
foreign securities commissions. The 1969 session was attended by government officials from France, Canada, Brazil, Puerto Rico and practically every State, as well as by staff members from each of the
Commission's offices throughout the country.
In September 1968, representatives of various regulatory agencies
met in Philadelphia to consider problems of supervision of the operations of broker-dealers in light of the serious problems raised by the
high volume of securities transactions. It was concluded that many
broker-dealer managements had not used adequate supervisory procedures to cope with current selling and back officeproblems in any
meaningful manner. As a result, a joint release was issued by the
participating agencies-the Commission, the NASD, the PhiladelphiaBaltimore-Washington Stock Exchange, and the securities administrators of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the District of
Columbia-emphasizing the responsibility of broker-dealer managements for adequate supervision so as to safeguard against improper
sales practices and deficiencies in back officeprocedures, listing certain
supervisory functions of vital concern and pointing out that noncompliance with supervisory responsibilities may lead to disciplinary
action."
ENFORCEMENT

PROBLEMS

WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN

SECURITIES

During fiscal year 1969 the staff of the Commission, working in
many instances in cooperation with foreign authorities, intensified its
efforts to curb sales within the United States of foreign securities
not registered under the Securities Act of 1933. Attempts to sell foreign securities in violation of the registration provisions included
campaigns by mail sent from outside the United States to prospective
77

THIRTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

121

purchasers in the United States soliciting the purchase of securities of
worthless or nonexistent companies, and distributions of shares by controlling stockholders of a foreign company whose stock is listed on the
American Stock Exchange. In these and other cases shares were purchased by investors in the United States without the benefit of the
extensive disclosures provided by the registration and prospectus provisions of the Securities Act.
An example of the former type of operation was the mailing of a
purported market letter bearing a Jamaica, West Indies, address but
printed in and mailed from Toronto, Ontario, Canada, recommending
shares of stock of a company called California and Caracas. This letter was sent to a list of United States shareholders of a well-known
Canadian company having substantial assets. The mailing was followed by long distance telephone calls from New York City urging
these shareholders to send in their shares of the Canadian company in
order to exchange them for shares of California and Caracas. As a
result of these activities, the Commission added California and Caracas to its Foreign Restricted List," which consists of foreign companies whose securities the Commission has reason to believe are being,
or recently have been, offered for public sale and distribution in the
United States in violation of the registration requirements of the
Securities Act,79
Another unlawful distribution involved sales of the shares of Revenue Properties Company Limited, a Canadian real estate company. As
a result of the large volume of trading in Revenue Properties' stock on
the American Stock Exchange and a rapid and substantial price increase, the American Stock Exchange halted trading in April 1969.
The Commission subsequently instituted an action in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York against the company,
its controlling persons and others to enjoin further offers and sales
of such stock in violation of the Securities Act. The complaint alleged
among other things that controlling persons of the company had sold
a large number of shares of its common stock, including some to U.S.
residents, at a time when a registration statement covering other shares
of the controlling persons was pending before the Commission and
that the registration statement, when it became effective, failed to disclose such sales. With the defendants' consent, the court permanently
enjoined them against further violations of the Securities Act's registration provisions in connection with the offer and sale of Revenue

Properties shares,"? The Ontario Securities Commission concurrently
conducted an investigation that resulted in the filing of criminal
charges against the controlling persons for false statements or misleading omissions in registration statements and financial statements
filed with that Commission.
In February 1969, the Commission obtained an injunction in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District. of Illinois against a
number of Panamanian, Bahamian and European companies, including DeVeers Consolidated Mining Corporation S.A., and their principal promoters who were engaged in the offer and sale to American
investors of unregistered securities of those companies by fraudulent
means." Simultaneously with the filing of its complaint seeking an injunction, the Commission had also added to its Foreign Restricted
List several of the defendant companies which were not already on
the list.
At the Commission's request, the U.S. Post Office Department at
various times during the past few years has issued foreign postal
fraud orders against several of the companies referred to above in an
effort to combat fraudulent promotions emanating from Panama and
the Bahamas Islands. While such orders do not halt mail sent into the
United States by foreign-based promoters, return mail from United
States residents to the promoters' foreign addresses is returned to the
senders stamped "Fraudulent." In this manner, the promoters are
denied the fruits of their illegal schemes.
At June 30, 1969, the following 39 companies were on the Commission's Foreign Restricted List:

PART V
REGULATION OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES
In broad terms, an investment company is any arrangement by which
a group of persons invests funds in an entity that is itself engaged in
investing in securities. Investment companies are an important vehicle
for public participation in the securities markets. They enable small, as
well as large, investors to participate in a professionally managed and
diversified portfolio of securities.
The Investment Company Act of 1940 sets forth the Commission's
responsibilities in protecting investors in such companies. It provides
a comprehensive framework of regulation which, among other things,
prohibits changes in the nature of an investment company's business
or its investment policies without shareholder approval, protects
against loss, outright theft or abuse of trust, and provides specific
controls to eliminate or to mitigate inequitable capital structures.
The Act also requires that an investment company disclose its financial
condition and investment policies; requires management contracts
to be submitted to shareholders for approval; prohibits underwriters,
investment bankers, or brokers from constituting more than a minority of the investment company's board of directors; regulates the
custody of its assets; and provides specific controls designed to protect
against unfair transactions between investment companies and their
affiliates.
In addition to the requirements of the Investment Company Act,
an investment company must comply with the Securities Act of 1933
when it makes an offering of its securities and it is subject to the applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including
those relating to proxy and tender offer solicitations and insider
trading and reporting rules.
COMPANIES REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT

As of June 30, 1969, there were 1,167 investment companies registered under the Act, whose assets had an aggregate market value
of approximately $72.5 billion. Compared with corresponding totals
at June 30, 1968, these figures represent an over-all increase of approximately $2.7 billion, or about 4 percent, in the market value of
assets and an increase of 200, or almost 20 percent, in the number
of registered companies.
The following table shows the numbers and categories of registered
companies and the approximate market value of the assets in each
category as of June 30,1969.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

As the table shows, 20, or approximately 9 percent, of the newly
registered companies were variable annuity separate accounts of insurance companies.' Including these companies, there were 49 active
variable annuity separate accounts registered at June 30, 1969, consisting of 10 unit investment trusts and 39 management open-end investment companies. A significant part of the Commission's regulatory
effort with respect to variable annuities has involved the application of
the requirements of the Investment Company Act to the patterns and
procedures which have grown up in the insurance industry.

1 The applicability
of the requirements of the Investment Company Act to variable annuity contracts was discussed in prior annual reports. Typically, a variable
annuity contract provides payments for life commencing on a selected date with
the amounts of the payments varying with the investment performance of equity
securities which are set apart by the insurance company in a separate account
which is registered with the Commission as an investment company. The separate
accounts now registered are either open-end management companies or unit
investment trusts,

The registration statements filed by such companies are reviewed for
compliance with that Act as well as the Investment Company Act.
Proxy soliciting material filed by investment companies is reviewed
for compliance with the Commission's proxy rules. Periodic and other
reports must also be filed by investment companies. The number of
registration statements and proxy soliciting materials filed or processed

Investment companies also filed 681 annual reports, 2,176 quarterly
reports, 1,752 periodic reports to shareholders containing financial
statements and 2,269 copies of sales literature. In each category of filings (except copies of sales literature) , there was a substantial increase
as compared to the preceding year.
Moreover, 22.5 percent more Securities Act registration statements
and post-effective amendments and 66 percent more registration statements under the Investment Company Act were processed in fiscal
1969than in the previous year,"
Expedited Procedures and Registration Statement Guidelines

The increase in the number of registration statements processed, with
no increase in staff personnel, may be attributed in part to the institution of certain expediting procedures and the publication of proposed
guidelines on the preparation of registration statements.
On March 12, 1969, the staff announced that certain procedures designed to expedite investment company filings would be introduced."
One of the major features of the expediting procedures is a check list
that serves as an aid both to counsel in the preparation of registration
statements and to the staff in its analysis of registration statements to
determine whether only a cursory or a detailed review is necessary. The
, The 222 newly registered companies represent the largest number of companies ever registered in one year, exceeding by 323 percent the nnmber registered in fiscal 1968, the next largest number.

check list provides an opportunity for investment company counsel
to consider in advance questions which the staff otherwise routinely
raises. It also enables the staff to grunt expedited treatment to those
registration statements which do not raise novel or complex questions
and for which clear disclosure procedures have been established. In
addition, the check list may indicate to the staff that the registrant
has not complied with particular regulatory provisions and that
amendments are required.
In another effort to facilitate and expedite processing of filings,
the staff proposed guidelines for the preparation of registration statements on Forms S-4 and S-54 and Form N-8B-1.5 They represent
tentative views on matters which present recurring problems to the
securities bar and the investment company industry in the preparation of registration statements; public comment on the proposed guidelines has been invited.
DEVEWPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR TYPES
OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The increase in filings under the Act has been accompanied by an
increase in the variety of forms of investment companies and in the
problems presented by developments in the industry.
Bank-Affiliated Investment Companies

Among the new types of companies which have filed registration
statements under the Investment Company Act during the past fiscal
year are various bank-affiliated investment companies.
The National Association of Mutual Savings Banks, an organization
of 529 member banks in 18 States, was instrumental in the organization of one of these affiliated funds. Shares of the fund will be offered
only to the depositors of mutual savings banks which have advised the
Association that they wish to participate in the program, to mutual
savings banks themselves or organizations controlled by such banks
and to trusts of which banking organizations are trustees, Unlike the
Commingled Managing Agency Account of the First National City
Bank of New York," this fund has not been organized as a department
of a bank and it will have an outside investment adviser which is not
a bank.
Also registered during the fiscal year were two investment companies
whose shares were to be offered exclusively to Ohio banks and trust

129

companies. These companies were designed as investment vehicles for
the trust accounts of those banks and trust companies whose size did
not warrant the employment of a large staff of investment advisory
personnel.
Investment Companies Using Leverage and Other Special Investment Techniques

During the year, an open-end investment company registered which
proposes to invest in all types of registered investment companies and
in private limited partnerships, both foreign and domestic, and also to
establish private limited partnerships in which it may be the only
limited partner or major investor. Among other proposed investment
techniques, the fund contemplates utilizing leverage, effecting short
sales of mutual fund shares, making loans of portfolio stocks to mutual
funds, writing put and call options on mutual fund shares held in the
fund's portfolio, buying and selling put and call options written by
others and making loans to private limited partnerships.
Another new fund will invest in "conglomerate" companies, i.e.,
those companies which assemble subsidiary companies or operating
divisions in diverse industries under a central management, often
through programs of acquisition, merger and tender offer, and which
make extensive use of leverage in acquiring new companies.
One registrant proposed, as its main business activity, to invest in
special situations by acquiring at least a controlling interest in a number of relatively small companies and supplying those companies with
management and financial assistance. The securities of the portfolio
companies would not be retained but sold and the proceeds used for
further similar acquisitions.
Advisory Fees Tied to Performance

In recent years there has been a substantial increase in the number
of investment advisory contracts providing for compensation to the
investment adviser based on the performance of the investment company. At the end of fiscal 1968, some 54 investment companies with
performance fees had registered; in fiscal 1969, 66 more companies
with this type of fee arrangement registered. Performance fees are
essentially of two types. In one type the investment adviser receives a
fee (which mayor may not be in addition to a basic management fee)
based on a certain percentage of the investment company's net realized
capital gains and net unrealized capital appreciation. The other, and
more common, arrangement provides for payment of a basic fee of a
percentage of the company's net assets if the company's performance
is the same as that of a specified securities index or, in some cases, even
if such performance is below that of the index. An additional percentage of the company's net asset value, a so-called performance
373-754-70--10

130

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

bonus, is added if it out-performs the index by a certain percentage.
Under such formulas, the total annual advisory fee may be as high as
6 percent of the company's net assets.
Recently, a number of investment companies have adopted arrangements which provide for decreases in compensation in the event the
company under-performs the index. However, in many cases the percentage decrease is disproportionately less than the corresponding
percentage increase. With few exceptions, both types of performance
fees have been adopted by companies having capital appreciation as
their objective. Frequently the companies adopting such arrangements
are trading companies which engage in various speculative and highrisk investment activities. In light of these developments, the Commission proposed certain changes in the laws applicable to the receipt of
performance-based fees by investment advisers of investment companies. For a discussion of these proposals, see pages 14-15, supra.
Study of Speculative Investment Techniques

Prompted by the increase in the number and size of registered investment companies and private investment limited partnerships
("hedge funds") engaging in speculative investment techniques such
as those used by several of the funds discussed above, the Commission
directed its staff to conduct a detailed evaluation of the organization
and activities of such investment vehicles," The study involves an
analysis of the activities of some 50 registered companies and about 200
private limited partnerships. An analysis is being made of brokerage
practices; affiliations among broker-dealers, portfolio companies, and
other investment companies; the composition of portfolios; and the
mechanics of investment and trading operations. The staff study is
designed to 'aid the Commission in determining what effects the high
portfolio turnover and speculative investment practices and other
activities of such companies have on the securities markets and the
appropriateness of such practices for registered investment companies.
Investment Companies Which Invest in Restricted Securities

Many investment companies, both open and closed-end, have included some restricted securities in their portfolios. During the fiscal
year for the first time two closed-end companies registered which had
been formed for the specific purpose of investing primarily in restricted
securities. Restricted securities, sometimes referred to 'as "letter stock,"
are securities acquired in private placements and other transactions
exempted from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The
transferability of such securities is limited because they may not he
1

For further discussion of the hedge fund study, see p, 18, supra.

THIRTY-FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

131

publicly sold absent registration and purchasers generally provide letters stating that they are acquiring the securities for investment and
not with a view to public distribution.
Because of the restrictions on transferability, restricted securities
are different from unrestricted securities of the same class. Under the
Investment Company Act, securities for which market quotations are
readily available are required to be valued at such quotations. Other
securities are required to be valued at fair value as determined in good
faith by the board of directors. Various approaches to the valuation
of restricted securities have been tried by investment companies: (1)
where there is a market quotation for unrestricted securities of the
same class that quotation has been used even though restricted securities were acquired at a discount from the market quotation for the
unrestricted securities; (2) such discount has been maintained; (3)
the discount has been amortized; or (4) a discount otherwise determined has been applied.
Valuation of an investment company's portfolio affects the price
that purchasers pay for shares of the company and the amount which
shareholders who redeem their shares receive. It also affects the compensation of management where such compensation is based either on
performance of the company or on net asset value. Finally, since valuation affects the reported performance of the company, it has an effect
upon the attitudes of investors toward the company.
For these reasons the Commission studied the valuation of restricted
securities by investment companies, giving attention also to the related
problems of liquidity and circumscription of investment judgment
which may arise when open-end companies acquire restricted securities. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the Commission
issued a release setting forth its views regarding the problems inherent
in the acquisition of restricted securities by investment companies."
Portfolio

Turnover Disclosure

In the past, the prospectuses of new funds often expressed portfolio
turnover policy in terms of reservation of freedom of action. During
the fiscal year, the Commission further refined the disclosure requirements in this area. Thus, a registrant which indicated that its annual
portfolio turnover rate could generally be expected to be greater than
100 percent was required to make additional related disclosures, including an explanation that. such a rate means that on the average the
entire portfolio would be turned over within a year and that the :fund's
portfolio operations would be based on short-term market considerations as distinct from long-term investment. The company was also

132

SECURIT!ES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

required to disclose that such trading entailed heavier brokerage expenses and might increase Federal taxes payable. New registrants
are now required to estimate their portfolio turnover rate in terms of a
percentage.
FOREIGN SALES GUIDEUNES

In response to the rapid expansion of many domestic registered investment companies into overseas markets and the concern that some
'fo,reign governments have exhibited about the activities of such
companies in their countries, the Commission, in February 1969, published proposed guidelines on the applicability of the Federal securities laws to the offer and sale outside the United States of shares
of registered open-end investment companies," The proposed guidelines call for Securities Act registration of open-end investment company shares sold abroad and for the use of a prospectus in foreign
sales substantially similar to the one used domestically. In addition,
the regulatory requirements of the Investment Company Act would
generally be applicable. For example, the guidelines would make clear
that applications under the Investment Company Act must be filed
and granted to permit the foreign sale of shares at a price other than
the public offering price in effect in this country. Registration requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for foreign
broker-dealers who offer and sell shares of open-end companies outside
the United States were also set forth. In response to comments received, revision of certain provisions of the guidelines is currently
under consideration.
APPLICATIONS FOR COMMISSION ACTION

Under Section 6(c) of the Act, the Commission, by rules and regulations, upon its own motion or by order upon application, may exempt
any person, security, or transaction from any provision of the Act
if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate in
the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the
Act. Other Sections, such as 6(d), 9(b), 10(f), 17(b), 17(d), and
23(c), contain specific provisions and standards pursuant to which
the Commission may grant exemptions from particular sections of
the Act or may approve certain types of transactions. Also, under
certain provisions of Sections 2, 3, and 8, the Commission may determine the status of persons and companies under the Act. One of

Some of the more significant matters in which applications were
considered are summarized below:
The Slick Oorporatioti made an offer in January 1969, to the
common stockholders of Filtrol Corporation to exchange their shares
of Filtrol for shares of Slick. Because of the relative sizes of the two
companies Slick could acquire only about 10 percent of Filtrol's outstanding stock before exceeding the test set forth in Section 3(a) (3)
of the Investment Company Act that if 40 percent or more of a
company's assets are investment securities it is an investment company. However, the term "investment securities," as defined in the
Act, excludes securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries of the

staff, Slick agreed to file an application for exemption under Section
3(b) (2), which exempts companies primarily engaged in a business
other than that of investing in securities, as soon as it acquired 30

percent of Filtrol's outstanding common stock and, if at the end of
the automatic exemption period of 60 days Slick had not acquired 50
percent or more of such stock and had not in that period obtained
an order pursuant to Section 3 (b) (2), to dispose of sufficient Filtrol
shares so that its remaining holdings of Filtrol stock would be no
more than 35 percent of its assets. Within the 60-day exemption period,
more than 50 percent of Filtrol's stock was acquired by Slick, and
Slick's Section 3(b) (2) application was withdrawn as moot.
Builders Resources (lorporation. applied pursuant to Section 6(c)
of the Investment Company Act for an exemption from all provisions
of the Act. The company was organized by Property Research Corporation and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc. to provide equity
financing for residential construction through the formation of limited partnerships or joint ventures with small and medium sized
builders. All the shares of Builders Resources were held by the two
organizing corporations and six large publicly held corporations.
Because the definition of "security" in Section 2(a) (35) of the Act
includes a "participation in any profit-sharing agreement," Builders
Resources' participation in the joint ventures and limited partnerships could have been viewed as ownership of securities and the company might have been deemed an investment company subject to
regulation. Since the six publicly held corporations each owned more
than 10 percent of the voting securities of Builders Resources, the
company did not come within the exception from the definition of an
investment company which is provided by Section 3 (c) (1) of the Act
for a company which is beneficially owned by not more than 100
persons and which is not making and does not presently propose to
make a public offering of its securities. Builders Resources urged
that since none of the publicly held corporations had more than 1
percent of their assets invested in the company and all the eight
shareholders were financially sophisticated, regulation of the company under the Act was not necessary in the public interest.
The Commission granted the requested exemption with the conditions, to which Builders Resources consented, that (1) shareholders
shall be limited to the eight present corporate shareholders and a
limited number of employees who may receive options to purchase
shares and (2) none of the publicly held corporations owning stock
of Builders Resources shall invest more than 5 percent of their assets
in Builders Resources.t?

exemptions from the Act. The Fund is an "employees' security company," and as such is subject to Section 6(b) of the Act, which provides that the Commission shall exempt such companies "to the extent ... consistent with the protection of investors." The Fund is a part
of the General Electric Savings and Security Program under which
participating employees may purchase, in addition to Fund shares,
life insurance, U.S. Savings Bonds and General Electric common stock.
Several unions, whose membership includes employees of General
Electric, opposed a majority of the requested exemptions. After a
hearing was held and the staff in its brief to the hearing examiner
opposed a number of the requested exemptions, General Electric modified its application so as to request only those exemptions which the
staff considered appropriate.
The hearing examiner's initial decision granted these exemptions,
with two important exceptions. General Electric had requested an
exemption from Section 16(a) to permit it to appoint the five Fund
trustees, rather than have employees participating in the Fund elect
them. The hearing examiner decided that General Electric could appoint only two trustees, and that the employees were to elect the other
three. In addition, he denied an exemption from the requirement of
Section 32(a) that the Fund participants ratify the selection of the
Fund's auditor.
At General Electric's request, the Commission reviewed the hearing
examiner's decision relating to Sections 16(a) and 32(a). In a decision
rendered subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the Commission
granted exemptions from these two Sections, concluding that the exemptions were consistent with the protection of investors in view of the
special character of an employees' securities company and the safeguards provided under the terms of the Fund and other applicable
statutory provisions."
The National Association of Small Business Investment Oompanies,
("NASBIC") filed an application pursuant to Section 6(c). NASBIC
is a trade association whose active membership consists of 230 small
business investment companies licensed by the Small Business Administration ("SBA") pursuant to the Small Business Investment Act of
1958. As of June 30, 1969, 49 of these SBIC's were also registered
under the Investment Company Act as management, closed-end, nondiversified investment companies. The application, on behalf of
those of NASBIC's members which are so registered, essentially seeks
an order exempting them from all the provisions of the Act except
those relating to registration, and transferring to the SBA the admin.. Investment

istratiou of those provisions of the Investment Company Act deemed
applicable to SBIC's. The applicant contends that dual regulation by
the SBA and this Commission has resulted in conflicts which impede
the ability of small business investment companies to accomplish their
statutory mission of stimulating and supplementing the flow of private
equity capital and long-term loan funds to small business concerns.
Hearings were held on the application, in which the SBA participated;
as of the close of the fiscal year, no determination had been made.
Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the Commission granted
applications by three open-end investment companies for exemption
from the retail price maintenance provision contained in Section 22(d)
of the Investment Company Act so as to permit sales of fund shares
to certain groups of persons without a sales load.
Thus, Transamerica Capital Fund, Inc. was authorized to sell its
shares without the usual 8l!z percent sales load to persons connected
with Transamerica Corporation, the parent of both the distributor of
the Fund's shares and its investment adviser, or to anyone of the more
than 100 subsidiaries or Transamerica Corporation, a total group of
over 22,000 persons." FML Fund, Inc. was permitted to sell its shares
without a sales load to persons who are officers,directors or full-time
employees of the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company, the parent
of both the distributor of the shares of FHL Fund and of its investment adviser.> And Hartwell & Campbell Fund, Inc., was permitted
to continue to sell its shares without a sales charge to those persons
who had been shareholders at the time that Hartwell & Campbell
changed from a no-load fund to a load fund."
In N .A.S.D. v. S.E.O.16 the Commission's order granting First National City Bank of New York exemptions from certain provisions
of the Investment Company Act with respect to a Commingled Investment Account which the Bank established and registered under
the Act was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit. In the same opinion, the court reversed the judgment of the district court in Investment Oompany Institute v. Oamp,
which had invalidated Regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency relied on by the Bank in establishing its Commingled Account.

PRACTICES

Inspection and Investigation Program

During the fiscal year, the Commission's staff conducted 72 inspections pursuant to Section 31(b) of the Investment Company Act.
Many of these inspections disclosed violations of the Investment Company Act and of other statutes administered by the Commission.
Among the violations were inadequate arrangements for safekeeping
of the investment company's portfolio securities, inadequate disclosures
concerning the activities of the investment company, failure to maintain adequate fidelity bond coverage for persons dealing with investment company assets and self-dealing transactions which included
arrangements by affiliates of investment companies to recapture fund
brokerage for their own benefit.
The tremendous influx of money into the mutual fund industry and
the proliferation of new funds have resulted in serious accounting and
bookkeeping problems. Some funds have priced shares inaccurately
because their books did not enable them to compute their net asset
value correctly. As a result of back officeproblems, several funds voluntarily suspended sales of shares until they were able to develop new
procedures for handling the increased volume of orders.
Largely as an outgrowth of information obtained during inspections,
11 private investigations were commenced during the fiscal year to
develop facts concerning what appeared to be serious violations. As a
result of the Commission's inspection and investigation program, approximately $1.1 million was returned to investors either directly or
indirectly during fiscal 1969. This brings to $6.8 million the sums returned to investors since the inception of the inspection program in
1963.
Civil and Administrative Proccedings

During the fiscal year, the Commission instituted two civil actions
and three administrative proceedings involving investment companies,
and continued prosecution of other investment company proceedings.
Portfolio Transactions.-Several
proceedings involved alleged improprieties by investment advisers and principal underwriters of
mutual funds in the execution of portfolio transactions for the funds
and misrepresentations related to these transactions in the sales of the
funds' securities.
Brokerage commissions paid by Hubshman Fund, Inc. were being
recaptured by the Hubshman Management Corporation, the fund's
adviser-underwriter, in return for allocations of fund portfolio transactions. The Commission accepted an offer of settlement which provided, among other things, for the repayment to the Fund by the

138

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

adviser-underwriter of all amounts it had received or which had
been applied to obligations of the adviser as a result of such
"give-ups." 11
Consumer-Investor Planning Corporation, the manager-underwriter of Associated Fund Trust, and certain of the latter's affiliates,
allegedly received money and other benefits in connection with investment company portfolio transactions. Two affiliated persons were
directly compensated by certain broker-dealer firms in return for placing the Fund's portfolio business with those firms. In addition, compensation was received at a time when there was no valid management
or underwriting contract, since the management and underwriting
contracts with the Fund had been automatically terminated by the
hypothecation of outstanding voting securities of the Fund's managerunderwriter. No adequate disclosure of these matters had been made
in the Fund's prospectus. The Commission accepted an offer of settlement resulting in the suspension of the manager-underwriter and
respondent affiliates from certain brokerage activities. In doing so it
took into account that the practices had ceased and that certain payments were to be made to the Fund by the respondents. IS
In Provident Fund for Income, I'lUJ. the staff alleged, among other
things, that the Fund's registration statement failed to disclose that
(1) the president of the Fund, who was also president of a registered
broker-dealer, had made arrangements with other broker-dealers to
direct commissions to his brokerage firm in return for Fund brokerage
and (2) that the president's brokerage firm had received tender fees
when the Fund tendered certain of its securities in tender offers. In
April 1969, the Commission issued a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Fund's registration statement; 19 the Fund thereafter
amended its registration statement, which, as amended, was declared
effective.
In S.E.O. v, Salik, which involved the receipt, by affiliated persons
of Republic Technology Fund, Inc., of brokerage commissions resulting from the Fund's portfolio transactions, the Commission sought an
injunction against Charles E. Salik, the Fund's chairman and president, alleging, among other things, that he had accepted compensation
for the purchase or sale of securities to or for the Fund, other than in
the course of business as an underwriter or broker, in violation of Section 17(e) of the Investment Company Act. On September 19, 1968,
the district court entered an order, with Sulik's consent, permanently
enjoining him from further violating certain provisions of the InvestSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 8557 (March 20, 1969).

ment Company Act and the Securities Act,20and the affiliates agreed
to return $140,224to the Fund, this sum representing the total amount
of "give-ups" received by the affiliates on Fund transactions.
Purchase of Restricted Securities.-Portfolio
transactions by the
Mates Investment Fund, Inc., involving large purchases of restricted
securities, gave rise to a series of administrative proceedings. An in ,"estigation was initiated after the Mates Fund voluntarily suspended sales
of its shares in June 1968because of the chaotic condition of its books
and records.
On December 20,1968, pursuant to Section 22(e) (3) of the Investment Company Act, the Commission issued an order suspending the
right of redemption of the Fund's outstanding redeemable securities.
The Fund had applied for the order after the Commission had suspended trading in the securities of Omega Equities Corporation, a
company whose securities represented almost 20 percent of the Fund's
portfolio.
In June 1969,the Commission instituted an administrative proceeding against Frederic S. Mates ("Mates"), Mates Financial Services,
a registered investment adviser owned by Mates, and Mates Management Company, investment adviser to the Mates Fund. Among other
matters, it was alleged that, contrary to representations to Fund
shareholders, Mates caused the Fund (a) to acquire substantial
amounts of restricted securities, (b) to impair its shareholders' right
to redemption, and (c) to obtain from banks loans of more than $7
million secured by a lien on the Fund's entire portfolio. It was further
alleged that Mates improperly valued the restricted securities and misrepresented to Fund shareholders and clients and prospective clients of
Mates Financial Services that the resulting increase in the Fund's net
assets and net asset value per share was due to his investment advice.
On June 12, 1969, the Commission issued an Order accepting an
offer of settlement." As a part of the settlement, Mates undertook that
he would not become associated with a broker-dealer without the approval of the Commission, the registration of Mates Financial Services
as an investment adviser was suspended for 100 days, and certain limitations were imposed on purchases of securities by the Fund. The
Commission's Order stated that detailed findings and an opinion
would be issued at a later date. At the same time, the Commission
ordered the Fund to process requests for redemption of its outstanding
shares beginning on July 22,1969.22

Transactions with Affiliated Persons.-In S.E.O. v. W 011g,23 involving Puerto Rico Capital Corporation, a registered investment
company, the Commission, in June 1969, agreed to a settlement with
defendants Quing N. Wong and Josiah M. Scott which was thereafter
approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.
The Commission had asserted that \V"ong and Scott caused the investment company, of which they were officers and directors, to employ
its assets for their use and benefit.
Under the settlement, judgments in favor of the company were
entered against Wong for $350,000 and against Scott for $150,000,to
be paid in designated installments; and Wong and Scott were enjoined
(Wong permanently and Scott until 1977) from further violations of
Section 17 (the anti-selfdealing Section) of the Investment Company
Act and Section 10(b) (anti-fraud provision) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10lr-5 thereunder, and from serving as
officers, directors or investment advisers of registered investment
compames.
In June 1969,the Commission filed a complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking the appointment of
a receiver for Advance Growth Oapital Oorporation; a registered investment company and small business investment company licensed by
the Small Business Administration." The Commission's complaint
also seeks an injunction against violations of the Investment Company
Act by Peter D. Giachini, chairman of Advance's board of directors,
and John J. Murphy, president of the company. An order is also requested, under Section 36 of the Act, barring these two persons from
serving or acting as officersor directors (or in other designated capacities) of any registered investment company.
The complaint alleges that during the years since 1965Giachini and
Murphy caused companies affiliated with Giachini to sell to, and to
purchase from, Advance and companies controlled by Advance, securities and other assets in violation of the prohibitions of Section
17(a) of the Investment Company Act. The complaint also alleges
that since July 1964 Giachini and Murphy caused Advance to effect
numerous loan or investment transactions in which Advance and
companies affiliated with Giachini were joint participants, in contravention of Section 17(d) of the Investment Company Act and Rule
17d-1 thereunder. It is alleged that such loans and investments by Advance exceeded $2,200,000 and constituted by far the major part of
Advance's business during the period in question .

Failure to Register.- The American College Foundation, Inc.
("ACF") registered as an investment company by filing a Notification
of Registration on December 26,1967. Approximately 5 months later,
on May 24, 1968, it filed suit against the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division,
requesting the court to declare that ACF does not "fall within the
purview of the Investment Company Act or the Securities Act" and to
issue an order enjoining the Commission from interfering in the business of ACF. The Commission moved to dismiss ACF's suit for lack of
jurisdiction over the subject matter and failure to state a claim upon
which relief could be granted due to the fact that ACF had failed to
exhaust its administrative remedies. On September 11, 1968, the
court granted the Commission's motion.
Subsequently, the Commission brought suit against ACF and a
related corporation, International University Foundation, Ltd., and
certain of their associated persons. The complaint charged ACF with
failure to comply with the registration and reporting requirements
of the Investment Company Act. It charged that International was
operating an unregistered investment company; was offering and selling unregistered securities in violation of the Securities Act; and was
violating the anti-fraud provisions of that Act and the Securities
Exchange Act in connection with such sales. On October 2, 1969, a
judgment was entered in the case enjoining International, Gardner T.
Mulloy and Robert Downs from further violations of Sections 5 (a)
and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 8(d) of the Investment
Company Act and ordering ACF, Mulloy and Downs to file registration statements for ACF. The charges of fraud were dismissed by
consent.
Performance Fees.-In
De Reneis v. Levy/5 involving Oppenheimer Fund, Inc., the court found that Congress exempted investment
advisory contracts with investment companies from Rule 440A.11 of
the New York Stock Exchange, which prohibits fees for investment
advisory services "based on the profits realized." It had been claimed,
among other things, that the investment advisory contract between
Oppenheimer Fund, Inc., and its investment adviser from 1960 to 1967
was in violation of that rule. The Commission, at the request of the
court, had filed a memorandum, amicus curiae, in which it expressed
the view that the contract in question violated the rule. The court disagreed with that view, holding that the rule could not be applied to a
contract with an investment company. The court did not reach the
question of whether a private right of action exists, as the Commission
.. 297 F. Supp. 998 (S.D.N. Y., 1969).

142

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

had urged in its memorandum, for violation of a New York Stock
Exchange rule.26
Status Cases.-Last year's annual report 27 discussed H.E.O. v, Fifth
Avenue Ooaoh.Lines, Inc.,28 in which certain individuals affiliated with
Fifth Avenue were enjoined from violating the securities laws and a
trustee-receiver was appointed to conduct the affairs of Fifth Avenue,
register the company as an investment company, prosecute damage
suits against certain individuals and investigate and determine
whether other actions should be maintained. Appeals from that order
are pending. Subsequently, the trustee-receiver, among other things,
registered Fifth Avenue as an investment company and filed suit on
behalf of the company against the defendants in the Commission's
action and certain other individuals and corporations, 29 alleging that
certain of the defendants had systematically looted Fifth Avenue and
diverted its funds to the extent of approximately $7 million. In addition, he seeks an accounting and $20 million in punitive damages.
In Tanzer v. Huffines,so the Commission filed a brief, amicus curiae,
urging affirmance of the district court's appointment of a receiver
pendente lite for B.S.F. Company, a registered investment company,
in a stockholder's derivative action. B.S.F. is one of the companies that
had been under the control of several individuals who were also
defendants in the Commission's action against Fifth Avenue Coach
Lines, Inc. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, adopting the
position urged by the Commission, affirmed the receiver's appointment.

any such securities except at a price determined in accordance with the
provisions of the rule." The rule requires that the price be based on the
current net asset value of such security which is next computed after
receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to
purchase or sell such security. Current net asset value is defined by the
rule to be that computed on each day during which the New York
Stock Exchange is open for trading, not less frequently than once
daily as of the time of the close of trading on such Exchange. The effect
of the rule is to prohibit the former practice, deemed by the Commission to result in dilution of the value of the outstanding securities of the
issuer and to be unfair to security holders, of selling securities for a
certain period of time at a price based on a previously established net
asset value.
Rules Relating to Variable Annuities and Separate Accounts

Start-Up Exemptions.-During
the past several years, a number
of insurance companies have established separate accounts for, and
engaged in the sale to the public of, variable annuity contracts. Such
separate accounts are investment companies within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act, and many have registered as such under the
Act. The securities issued by these separate accounts and the circumstances surrounding and conditions attached to their issuance have
created unique problems requiring the filing of applications on behalf
of such accounts for exemptions from various provisions of the Act.
As a result of experience gained in processing a number of such
applications for exemptions, the Commission concluded that it would
be appropriate to provide, through the promulgation of rules under
the Investment Company Act, certain limited exemptions which had
been previously granted by individual exemptive orders. Accordingly,
on January 24, 1969, the Commission published for comment 10 proposed rules for the purpose of eliminating the need for preparing,
filing, and processing applications of a routine nature in connection
with the organization and operation of separate accounts.
Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the Commission adopted
new rules 14a-2, 15a-3, 16a-1, 32a-2, 228-1, 27c-1, 27a-1, 27a-2, 27a-3
and 0-1 (e) .32 Additional proposed rules relating to separate accounts
are presently under consideration which, if adopted, will eliminate the
need to file individual exemptive requests in other situations.

COMMISSION

Act and an amendment to Rule 156 under the Securities Act,33which
deal with another type of insurance company separate account. Rule
6e-1 exempts from the registration requirements of the Investment
Company Act certain separate accounts established by life insurance
companies which hold assets attributable only to pension and profitsharing plans meeting the requirements for qualification under either
Section 401 or 404(a) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code. These are
commonly referred to as "qualified plans." They include plans established for self-employed persons pursuant to the provisions of the
Self-Employed Individuals Tax Retirement Act of 1962 ("SmathersKeogh plans"), as amended, since those plans also meet the requirements of Section 401 or 404(a) (2). The exemption is conditioned upon
compliance by such accounts with all but certain designated provisions
of the Investment Company Act and other requirements set forth in
the rule. Unlike Rule 3c-3 under the Investment Company Act, Rule
Ge-1 does not contain a prohibition against the allocation of employee
contributions to the separate account. Thus, separate accounts which
meet the more restrictive conditions for exemption under Rule 3c-3
will continue to enjoy the much more extensive exemption from the
Investment Company Act provided by that rule; on the other hand,
a wider variety of pension and profit-sharing plans will be a:ble
to be funded through contracts participating in separate accounts
which qualify for the narrower exemption under Rule 6e-1. In connection with its Rule 6e-1 the Commission also adopted Temporary
Form N-6E-l(T) and an amendment of Rule 156 under the Securities
Act of 1933 to exclude transactions exempted under Rule 6e-1 as well
as those exempted under Rule 3c-3 of the Investment Company Act.

REGULATION

OF PUBUC-UTIUTY

HOLDING COMPANIES

Under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Commission regulates interstate public-utility holding-company systems
engaged in the electric utility business and/or in the retail distribution
of gas. The Commission's jurisdiction also extends to natural gas pipeline companies and other nonutility companies which are subsidiary
companies of registered holding companies. There are three principal
areas of regulation under the Act. The first includes those provisions
of the Act which require the physical integration of public-utility
companies and functionally related properties of holding-company
systems and the simplification of intercorporate relationships and
financial structures of such systems. The second covers the financing
operations of registered holding companies and their subsidiary companies, the acquisition and disposition of securities and properties, and
certain accounting practices, servicing arrangements, and intercompany transactions. The third area of regulation includes the exemptive
provisions of the Act, provisions relating to the status under the Act
of persons and companies, and provisions regulating the right of
persons affiliated with a public-utility company to become affiliated
with a second such company through the acquisition of securities.
COMPOSITION OF REGISTERED HOLDING.COMPANY SYSTEMS

At the close of the 1969 fiscal year, there were 23 holding companies
registered under the Act. Of these, 20 are included in the 17 "active"
registered holding-company systems, 3 of the 20 being subholding
utility operating companies in these systems.' The remaining 3 registered holding companies, which are relatively small, are not considered
part of "active" systems," In the 17 active systems, there are 94 electric
1 The three subholding
companies are The Potomac Edison Company and Monongahela Power Company, public-utility subsidiary companies of Allegheny
Power System, Inc., and Southwestern Electric Power Company, a public-utility
subsidiary company of Central and South West Corporation.
• These holding companies are British American Utilities Corporation; Kinzua
Oil & Gas Corporation and its subholding company, Northwestern Pennsylvania
Gas Corporation; and Standard Gas & Electric Company, which is in the process
of dissolution.

SECI'ION 11 MATrERS IN REGISTERED HOLDING-COMPANY SYSTEMS

To comply with Section 11(b) (1) and the Commission's divestment
order thereunder," Penmeoil United, Inc. filed a plan under Section
11 (e) providing for the transfer of its retail gas distribution properties
to United Gas Inc., a newly-created Texas company. Inexchange Pennzoil United will receive, in addition to bonds and debentures, the outstanding common stock of the Texas company, which Pennzoil United
will offer to its own stockholders through an underwritten rights
offering. The plan was approved by the Commission after the close of
the fiscal year.'
The plan filed by Northeast Utilities under Section 11(e) proposing
the elimination of the publicly-held minority interest in the common
stock of its electric utility subsidiary company, Holyoke Water Power
Company, was approved by the Commission." The plan for eliminating
the publicly-held minority interest in the common stock of Michigan
Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary company of American Electrw PmoC1' Oompany, Ino., previously reported," was enforced by a
Federal District Court in Michigan by order of February 25, 1969.1
In Standard Gas and Electric OO'lnpany, the Commission approved,
as fair and equitable under Section 11(e), Step VI of Standard's
plan of liquidation and dissolution to comply with Section 11 (b) (2) of
the Act and the Commission's orders thereunder," This Step provides
for the distribution by Standard of its remaining assets, consisting of
cash in the amount of about $3 million, to its common stockholders. This
amount includes sums distributable to stockholders whom Standard had
not been able to locate, among them stockholders with last known addresses in N ew York. The State of New York appeared in the enforcement proceeding in the Federal District Court in Delaware, claiming
that under its Abandoned Property Law it was entitled to receive
funds due to unlocated or missing New York stockholders. On January 17, 1969, the court approved and enforced Step VI to permit an
initial distribution to the known stockholders of Standard but reserved for later determination the claim of the State of New York.

Subsequently, the court, as urged by the Commission, denied that
claim, holding that it was "fair and equitable" to distribute the unclaimed funds to the other and known stockholders of Standard," It
rejected New York's argument that such distribution would represent
a windfall, noting that Standard had spent funds to locate missing
stockholders and had incurred even more substantial costs in its overall
program of liquidation and dissolution, all of which were necessarily
absorbed by its common stockholders. The court stated that liquidation
of Standard Gas was required and ordered by the Commission pursuant to Section 11(b) (2) of the Act and that to the extent that
"some unclaimed funds have become available in the course of Standard's dissolution, the distribution thereof to the participating stockholders . . . is realistically a reduction in the cost of dissolution to
them. This is a fair and equitable application of the unclaimed funds."
An appeal by the State of New York is pending.
PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISmONS, SALES
AND OTHER MATTERS

In American Electric Power Oo'mpany, Inc.; reported previously,"
hearings were concluded on the company's application with respect
to its proposal to acquire, pursuant to an invitation for tenders, shares
of common stock of Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company,
a nonassociate electric utility company, in exchange for AEP stock,
on the basis of 1.3 shares of AEP common stock for each share of
Columbus common stock. The Commission's Division of Corporate
Regulation urged that the application should be denied, contending,
among other things, that the proposed acquisition would have serious
anti-competitive effects and tend towards a concentration of control
of a kind and to an extent detrimental to the public interest, in contravention of Section 10(b) (1) of the Act. The Cincinnati Gas and
Electric Company and Dayton Power and Light Company each filed
a brief, amicue curiae, also urging denial of AEP's application. Subsequently, AEP filed a motion, which the hearing examiner granted,
to reopen the hearing to present additional evidence relating to the
nature of competition in the electric utility industry. Notices of appearance in the reconvened proceedings have been filed by the U.S.
Department of Justice, the State of Ohio and the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio, the Cities of Danville, Virginia, and Orrille,
Ohio, and the Ohio Municipal Electric Association, Inc.

In New Enqlamd. Electric System, reported previously," the hearing
is continuing on the proposal for an affiliation, through the creation
of a new holding company, by New England Electric System and
Eastern Utilities .Associates, both registered holding companies, and
Boston Edison Company, a nonaffiliated electric utility company. In
Illinois P01veT Oompany, also reported previously," hearings were
concluded on an application by Illinois Power, an exempt holding
company, relating to a proposed offer to acquire, by an invitation for
tenders, the outstanding common stock of Central Illinois Public Service Company in exchange for Illinois Power common stock. Illinois
Power and Central Illinois are each combined electric and gas utility
companies operating in Illinois. The Division of Corporate Regulation has urged that approval of the application should be conditioned
on appropriate action by Illinois Power following the proposed acquisition to terminate common control of the electric utility system and the
gas utility system. Certain preferred stockholders of Central Illinois
appeared in opposition to the application insofar as it would permit the
Central preferred stock to remain outstanding. Oral argument was held
and the case was pending for decision by the Commission at the close of
the fiscal year.
In Kaneb Pipe Line Oompany, discussed previously," the Commission, subject to certain conditions, granted an application filed pursuant to Section 2(a) (7) of the .Act by Kaneb, a products pipeline
carrier, to be declared not to be a holding company notwithstanding its
acquisition and ownership of 19.48 percent of the voting securities of
Kanasas-Nebraska Natural Gas Company, Inc., a natural gas publicutility company.> The conditions, among other things, provide that
Kaneb must register as a holding company before seeking stockholder
approval of any merger with Kansas-Nebraska, prohibit service and
other contacts between them, prohibit further acquisitions of KansasNebraska shares by Kaneb without prior approval by the Commission, and require notice of any proposed divestments of KansasNebraska shares and of any intercorporate
affiliations through
directors, officers or otherwise, and submission of proxy material.

(a registered holding company), for permission to provide financing
to a newly-organized subsidiary which, pursuant to the National Housing Act, proposed to construct, a low and moderate income urban housing project in the Detroit inner city.
In an opinion in which Commissioner Wheat joined, Commissioner
Smith held that the proposed investment met the applicable standards
of the Act, i.e., that, under Section 10 (c) (1), the acquisition would
not be "detrimental to the carrying out" of the provisions of Section
11. The latter section among other things requires the Commission to
limit the operations of a holding-company system to a single integrated
public-utility system and such other businesses as are "reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations" of
such system. Section 11(b) (1) provides that the Commission may permit, as (i) "reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations" of the system, retention of a nonutility
interest which the Commission finds is (ii) "necessary or appropriate
in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers"
and (iii) "not detrimental to the proper functioning" of the publicutility system.
Relying on cases involving the retainability of nonutility interests
under Section 11 (b) (1), Commissioner Smith stated that under prior
court decisions, an applicant seeking to retain or acquire such interests
must affirmatively show by "exceptional facts" that the "triple test" of
that Section has been met. He took the position that an operating or
functional relationship between the utility system and the nonutility
business proposed to be acquired was not an absolute prerequisite to
the acquisition. In concluding that the necessary showing had been
made, Commissioner Smith pointed out, among other things, that in
this case Michigan C-onsolidated was making a relatively small investment meeting a critical need. within its primary service district that
did not involve any of the real problems with which Congress was concerned when it enacted the statute. He stated that there was
"no need to give this 1935 statute an inflexible, static historical reading.
Companies subject to it 'lire now presented with the Oongressionally recognized urban problems of the 1960's and 1970's that could not have been contemplated by the original enacters. The desira:bility of private capital becoming involved in the rebuilding of our cities is widely recognized and urged,
and the posture today of the utility industry is substantlally changed, at
least in terms of the weaknesses at which the Holding Company Act was
directed. Equally relevant, there has 'been evolving since the 1930's a
broader notion of corporate responsibility to the community." [Footnotes
omitted.]

In a concurring opinion, Commissioner Owens considered that the
Commission should not depart from its prior interpretation that a nonutility business can be retained or acquired only if an operating or

functional relationship exists between it and the utility system, but
that approval of the application was warranted under the exemptive
provisions of Section 9(c) (3). Chairman Budge, dissenting, was of the
view that approval of the application could not be justified on either
of the grounds relied on by the other Commissioners.
In Oonsolidated Natural Gas Oompanyr the Commission approved
the acquisition by Consolidated of the common stock of West Ohio Gas
Company, a nonassociate gas utility company, in exchange for Consolidated common stock. In Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Ina.,n the
Commission approved several proposals whereby Pennsylvania, a
subsdiary company of the Columbia Gas System, Inc., a registered
holding company, would acquire the net assets of York County Gas
Company, a nonassociate gas utility company, and assume all its liabilities. In return, York was to receive common stock of Columbia and to
distribute such stock as a liquidating dividend upon its dissolution.
Middle South Utilities, Inc., a registered holding company, filed an
application relating to a proposed. offer to acquire, through an invitation for tenders, the outstanding shares of common stock of Arkansas-Missouri Power Company, a nonassociate electric and gas utility
company, in exchange for Middle South common stock.IS Middle
South has agreed to dispose of Arkansas-Missouri's gas properties
after the acquisition. National Fuel Gas Oompany, a registered holding company, filed an application for permission to exchange shares of
its common stock for the outstanding common stock of Producers Gas
Company, a nonassociate gas utility company.> Hearings were held in
both cases, at which no one appeared in opposition. Following the close
of the fiscal year, the Commission granted the National Fuel Gas
application.w
In Municipal Eleotri<JAssociation of M assaohusette v. S.E.O./I the

thorized Maine Yankee Atomic Power Oompany to issue 100,000shares
of common stock and approved acquisitions of such stock by those 9 of
its 11 sponsor companies subject to the Act.24 The Commission in each
case denied a request for an evidentiary hearing and for imposition of
certain conditions sought by the Municipal Electric Association of
Massachusetts and certain Massachusetts municipalities and their
utility departments ("Municipals"), which urged that exclusion of the
Municipals from participation in the Vermont Yankee and Maine
Yankee projects was contrary to the Federal anti-trust policies and
that the applications could not be approved unless the Municipals were
afforded an opportunity to participate in these projects on the same or
an equivalent basis as the sponsor companies. The court of appeals held
that such exclusion was a relevant factor to be considered by the Commission in applying the standards of Section 10(b) (1) of the Act,
and accordingly remanded the two cases for reconsideration, including
an evidentiary hearing if necessary.
While the petitions for review were pending, the Commission
authorized Vermont Yankee to issue an additional 100,000 shares of
its common stock to its sponsors and approved the acquisition by the
seven sponsors subject to the Act.25 The Municipals petitioned for
review. Upon agreement of all parties the Commission's order was set
aside and the matter was remanded for reconsideration in the light
of the court's previous decision." During the pendency of the review
proceedings the Commission also issued two additional orders regarding the common stock financing of Vermont Yankee and Maine Yankee from which no review was sought. One order authorized Vermont
Yankee to sell to its sponsors 200,000 additional shares of its common
stock; 21 and the second order authorized Maine Yankee to issue an
additional 400,000 shares of its common stock to its sponsor companies." After the decision by the court of appeals these orders were
amended to provide for a reservation of jurisdiction "to impose, after
notice and opportunity for hearing, such conditions, if any, as may be
appropriate in light of the decision" rendered by the court." The
orders set aside by the court of appeals have been reinstated by the
Commission and amended to include an identical reservation of
jurisdiction."

Upon the remand, Vermont Yankee and Maine Yankee and their
respective sponsor companies filed a proposal under which electric
utility companies in the six-State New England region, including
cooperatives and municipally-owned systems, would have an opportunity to purchase part of the power output of the Vermont Yankee
and Maine Yankee plants. The Commission has issued an order for
hearing on these proposals to determine whether the offers provide
an appropriate and adequate participation in the Vermont Yankee
and Maine Yankee projects and whether it is necessary that the sponsor companies amend or modify their respective proposals in light of
the decision of the court of appeals."
The Commission had also authorized Vermont Yankee 32 and Maine
Yankee 33 to issue notes to banks in the maximum aggregate amounts
of $20 million and $30 million, respectively. The Municipals raised
the same issues as in the stock financing cases and petitioned for
review in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.34 On November 13, 1969, the court dismissed the petitions for
review without prejudice, stating that the anti-trust issues will be
resolved in the stock cases.

POLICY AS TO REFUNDABILITY OF DEBT ISSUES

The Commission's policy, which heretofore required that all longterm debt securities issued and sold by registered holding-company
systems be redeemable at any time at the option of the issuer upon reasonable notice and with reasonable redemption premiums, was initially
announced in 1953 40 and incorporated in a Statement of Policy on
February 16, 1956.41 The Statement of Policy permitted deviations
therefrom in appropriate cases, and deviations have been authorized in
cases where unusual circumstances were present, including difficult
problems affecting saleability of the securities." Informal requests
for permission to restrict refundability have also been received from
time to time, but were denied for lack of evidence that the issuer would

realize sufficient savings in interest cost to justify the loss of future
refunding flexibility."
The efficacy of the redemption policy as a device for implementing
Sections 6 and 7 of the Act has been reviewed by the staff of the Commission at frequent intervals since its adoption in 1953, and until recently was found to have worked satisfactorily.v' However, in fiscal
years 1968 and 1969, a number of interested persons formally requested
the Commission to relax its policies concerning the redemption provisions of long-term debt securities so as to permit, if desired by the
issuer, a 5-year refunding restriction. On November 20, 1968, the
Commission published an invitation to interested persons to submit
comments as to whether redemption provisions should be modified so
as to allow some form of call protection;"
On May 8, 1969, after consideration of comments received, the Commission authorized issuers subject to the Act to include in indentures
with respect to new issues of long-term debt securities a provision
prohibiting, for a period of not more than 5 years, the refunding of
such securities by the issuance of other debt securities at lower interest
costs." The Commission stated that this modification of its redemption
policy would not apply to the redemption of long-term debt securities
for sinking funds, or to redemptions in connection with mergers, sales
of properties or for other corporate purposes, and that, when the 5year period of nonrefundability expires, the general redemption price
at which the long-term debt securities may then be called for refunding purposes shall be the same as it would have been if no restriction
on refundability had been authorized. The Commission emphasized
that it will continually review the effects of its redemption policies, including specifically the foregoing modification, and based on experience
with this modification make such adjustments in these policies as may
from time to time be deemed appropriate, including a rescission of the
present modification, an extension of the 5-year nonrefunding period,
or any other change which experience would warrant.

PART VII
PARTICIPATION IN CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS
The Commission's role under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act,
which provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the
U.S. district courts, differs from that under the various other statutes
which it administers. The Commission does not initiate Chapter X
proceedings or hold its own hearings, and it has no authority to
determine any of the issues in such proceedings. The Commission
participates in proceedings under Chapter X in order to provide
independent, expert assistance to the courts, the participants, and
investors in a highly complex area of corporate law 'and finance. It
pays special attention to the interests of public security holders who
may not otherwise be represented effectively.
Where the scheduled indebtedness of a debtor corporation exceeds
$3 million, Section 172 of Chapter X requires the judge, before approving any plan of reorganization, to submit it to the Commission
for its examination and report. If the indebtedness does not exceed
$3 million, the judge may, if he deems it advisable to do so, submit
the plan to the Commission before deciding whether to approve it.
When the Commission files a report, copies or a summary must be
sent to 'all security holders and creditors when they 'are asked to vote
on the plan. The Commission has no authority to veto a plan of reorganization or to require its adoption.
The Commission has not considered it necessary or appropriate to
participate in every Chapter X case. Apart from the excessive administrative burden, many of the cases involve only trade or bank
creditors and few public investors. The Commission seeks to participate principally in those proceedings in which a substantial public
investor interest is involved. However, the Commission may also
participate because an unfair plan has been or is about to be proposed, public security holders are not represented adequately, the
reorganization proceedings are being conducted in violation of important provisions of the Act, the facts indicate that the Commission
can perform a useful service, or the judge requests the Commission's
participation.
For purposes of carrying out its functions under Chapter X, the
Commission has divided the country into frye geographic areas. The
157

158

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle regional offices of
the Commission each have responsibility for one of these areas. Each
of these officeshas lawyers, accountants and financial analysts who
are engaged actively in Chapter X cases in which the Commission
has filed its appearance. Supervision and review of the regional offices' Chapter X work is the responsibility of the Division of Corporate
Regulation of the Commission, which, through its Branch of Reorganization, also serves as a field officefor the fifth area.
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

In the fiscal year 1969, the Commission continued to maintain a
high level of activity under Chapter X. It entered its appearance in
eight new proceedings involving companies with aggregate stated
assets of approximately $181million and aggregate indebtedness of approximately $154million. The corporations involved in these proceedings were engaged in a variety of businesses, including, among others,
the manufacture of 00101' television tubes, telemetry equipment and
electrical devices; the operation of inter- and intra-state bus lines; gas
and oil development; commercial, industrial and personal loan financing; and the operation of a school.
Including the new proceedings, the Commission was a party in a
total of 101 reorganization proceedings during the year. The stated
assets of the companies involved in these proceedings totaled approximately $913 million and their indebtedness totaled approximately
$779 million. The proceedings were scattered among district courts
in 32 states and the District of Columbia as follows: 11 in New
York; 10 in California; 7 in Arizona; 6 in New Jersey; 5 each in
Louisiana, Pennsylvania and Washington; 4 each in Florida, Illinois,
Indiana and Texas; 3 each in Michigan, North Carolina and South
Dakota; 2 each in Arkansas, Colorado, District of Columbia, Hawaii,
Kansas, Minnesota, Nevada and Ohio; 1 each in Alabama, Connecticut, Idaho, Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Montana, Massachusetts,
North Dakota, Utah and West Virginia.
During the year, 14 proceedings were closed. As of the end of
the fiscal year the Commission was a party in 87 reorganization
proceedings.
JURISDICTIONAL,

PROCEDURAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE

MATTERS

In Chapter X proceedings in which it participates, the Commission seeks to have the courts apply the procedural 'and substantive
safeguards to which all parties are entitled. The Commission also
attempts to secure judicial uniformity in the construction of Chapter
X and the procedures thereunder.

TEURTY-FIFTH~AL

REPORT

159

InBankers T1'U8t/ no Chapter X petitions were filed for those affiliates of the debtor whose business operations were not expected to continue. The trustee, in a petition supported by the Commission, alleged
that the affiliateshad been operated with funds diverted from the Chapter X debtors and, therefore, petitioned the court for turnover orders
in order to obtain possession of the affiliated assets. The court granted
the motion 'and the trustee liquidated the affiliates. The Commission
assisted the trustee and the court in the evaluation of the position
of the outsider, nonaffiliated, creditors. The trustee submitted final
accounts, and the remaining assets of those affiliates were then made
part of the Chapter X debtor estates.
In General United Corporation, Irw.,2 the Commission, as reported
previously," filed a petition for a writ of mandamus with the Court of
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit seeking to require the district judge to
hear on its merits the Commission's motion to classify certain shareholders of the debtor as creditors for the purpose of participating in
a plan of reorganization, on the ground that they had been defrauded
in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. This motion had been rejected by the district judge on the ground that the Commission, although a party to the
reorganization proceeding, lacked standing to bring the motion. The
judge did note that the charge of fraud seemed "justified by the
record." The court of appeals, in denying the petition,' acknowledged
that Section 208 of Chapter X "gin~s the Commission participation
rights similar to those of other parties in a Chapter X proceeding," but
it characterized the attempt of the Commission to secure classification
of the defrauded stockholders as creditors as seeking, by indirection,
"superior rights to other parties." The court noted that no stockholder
had filed a timely claim and, since the court would not grant mandamus to a stockholder to require the district judge to consider his
claim filed out of time, it would not grant this remedy to the Commission either."

so that there would be no question that the court had made no determination
binding upon the district court with respect to the fairness of the reorganization plan's treatment of defrauded stockholders or with respect to the district court's power to enlarge the time within which such stockholders might
file claims. While the court of appeals denied the motion for clarification
(April 9, 1969), it stated that the district court "may well comply with all the
requests made in the motion so that such motion is premature" noting that the
district court had "not yet had an opportunity to consider those matters."

In TMT Trailer Ferry, Inc.,6 as previously reported,' the Supreme
Court reversed 8 the decision of the court of appeals 9 which had
affirmed an order of the district court confirming a plan of reorganization, and following remand by the court of appeals, the case was
assigned to a new judge. After a hearing on a petition of the stockholders' committee to remove the trustee, the trustee resigned and a
successor trustee was appointed by the district court. An extensive
evidentiary hearing was held before a special master on the smaller
of the two disputed claims which had been remanded for further
investigation.
In Magnolia Funds, lnc.,l° the district court appointed a receiver
pending a determination whether the Chapter X petitions were filed in
good faith under Section 146(3). At the hearing, the Commission
supported the petitions, urging that the possibility of a reorganization
'was not unreasonable in view of the receiver's operating reports and
the values that might obtain by preserving the debtor as a functioning
entity, including its tax loss carryover. The matter was pending for
decision at the close of the fiscal year.
In Oommomoealth. Financial Uorporationi" the trustees petitioned
the court to employ an attorney who was to assist the trustees in the
formulation of a plan. This attorney was not disinterested as defined
in Section 158(4) of Chapter X, but the trustees contended that under
the exception in Section 157 an attorney employed for "special purposes" need not be disinterested. The Commission argued that an
attorney who is to render services in connection with a plan of reorganization is not within the exception provided in Section 157. After a
hearing and the filing of briefs the trustees withdrew their petition.
In Riker Delaware Oorp.,12 the Commission supported, and the
court approved, a petition by the trustees for permission to sell the
remaining rental properties of the debtor at auction since these properties were being operated at a loss and were not necessary to a plan of
reorganization. The same proceeding also involved an option held by a
township to purchase all the assets of one of the debtor's subsidiaries
at their actual cost. The trustees proposed to terminate the township's
option by rejecting it as an executory contract. The Commission urged

that the option appeared to be a contract "in the public authority" and,
thus, could not be rejected pursuant to Section 116(1). Subsequently,
the township, with the approval of the district court, exercised its
option by paying a fair price to the estate.
In Federal Slwpping Way, Ine.,'a as previously reported.v an involuntary Chapter X petition alleged as the sole act of bankruptcy the
prior appointment of a receiver in an injunctive action filed by the
Commission against the debtor involving alleged fraud in the sale of
securities under the Securities Act of 1933.The Commission urged that
such appointment of a receiver satisfied the act of bankruptcy specified
in Section 131(2) of Chapter X. The district court judge agreed with
the Commission and approved the petition. Appeals to the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from the order approving the petition
have been taken by the debtor and by the Insurance Commissioner for
the State of Washington, as statutory rehabilitator of Federal Old
Line Insurance Company, a secured creditor, and were pending at the
close of the fiscal year.
In Gladstone M oumtaim. Mining Oompany/s as previously reported,"
a voluntary Chapter X petition was filed by a dormant mining company. The petition indicated that the object of the proceeding was to
increase the debtor's capital stock from 1.5 million shares to 5 million shares in order to acquire speculative assets unrelated to mining.
The company has several hundred stockholders and its stock is listed
on the Spokane Stock Exchange. The Commission moved to dismiss
the petition for lack of "good faith" under Section 146(3), on the
grounds that, as shown by tlm petition, the Chapter X proceeding
was instituted primarily to finance a new speculation rather than to
reorganize a going concern. Prior to argument on the Commission's
motion, the debtor, with the judge's approval, withdrew the Chapter X
petition.
Imperial 'f/JO' National, IneP involved the reorganization of a
debtor which operates over 100 motels in many states, most of which
are owned jointly through partnerships with individuals. In one such
motel, located in Michigan, the debtor had a 75 percent interest and
the other 25 percent was owned by a husband and wife who as
partners filed a petition in bankruptcy for this partnership pursuant
to Section 5b of the Bankruptcy Act. The court granted a motion by
the trustee, which the Commission supported, to enjoin the bankW.D. Wash., No. 61609.

ruptcy proceeding in Michigan and pursuant to Section 32a to transfer
such proceeding to the reorganization court. The court held that, having first acquired jurisdiction over the debtor and its assets wherever
located, the reorganization court had jurisdiction over the partnership
assets in which the debtor had a substantial interest, and that to permit
the bankruptcy proceeding in Michigan to go forward might jeopardize the reorganization proceeding by separate bankruptcies of the
many partnerships in which the debtor was a partner. The individual
partners have appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
TRUSTEE'S

INVESTIGATION

A complete accounting for the stewardship of corporate affairs by
the prior management is a requisite under Chapter X. One of the
primary duties of the trustee is to make a thorough study of the debtor
to assure the discovery and collection of all assets of the estate, including claims against officers, directors, or controlling persons who may
have mismanaged the debtor's affairs. The staff of the Commission
often aids the trustee in his investigation.
In Oommonwealth Financial Oorp./8 as previously reported;" the
former president of the debtor moved for a protective order staying
any attempts by the trustees to take his deposition in the course of
the trustees' Section 167 investigation. He alleged that the Commission was conducting a separate and independent investigation of the
affairs of the debtor, including his activities, and that any information obtained by the Commission might be later used against him in
a related criminal proceeding. The district court denied the motion
and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, noting that
Section 208 of Chapter X authorizes the Commission to participate
in the trustees' investigation and that the witness was free to resist
examination by the Commission or by the trustees merely by asserting
his privilege against self-incrimination, something he had not as yet
done.20
In Los Angeles Land and Investments, Ltd.,21 as previously 1'8ported," the Commission assisted the trustee in opposing the claims
filed by the three principal promoters of the debtor and supported
the trustee's counterclaim for damages against the claimants. The

at a time when the claimants were it sole officers,directors and stockholders. The referee denied the claims of the promoters to certain assets
of the debtor and granted the trustee an affirmative judgment on his
counterclaim in the amount of $230,000.On review the district court
upheld the referee, claimants have appealed, and at the close of the
fiscal year the appeal was pending.
In Continental Vending MMhine Corp.,23 as previously reported,"
the Supreme Court had granted certiorari on the issue of whether the
depositions of certain persons could be taken in the course of a civil
action against them by the trustee when those same persons had been
indicted for mail fraud and violations of the Federal securities laws
allegedly stemming from their relationship to the debtor." Prior to
argument in the Supreme Court the trustee obtained a $2.1 million
settlement from those of the defendants who had sought certiorari.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court granted the parties' motion for an
order vacating the judgments below and dismissing the case as moot."
REPORTS

ON PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

Generally, the Commission files a formal advisory report only in
a case which involves a substantial public investor interest and presents
significant problems. When no such formal report is filed, the Commission may state its view briefly by letter, or authorize its counsel
to make an oral or written presentation to amplify the Commission's
VIews.
During the fiscal year the Commission published two formal advisory reports," and supplements thereto." Its views on four other
plans were transmitted to the court by written memoranda."

and a supplement thereto on the trustee's amended plan of reorganization." The plan provided for participation by common stockholders
since the company was solvent, and for participation as a separate
class by those stockholders who had purchased their stock in the open
market in a specified period during which, as the trustee's report disclosed, major manipulations in the Westec stock had occurred. As
originally proposed, the plan provided for the issuance of stock options
to key employees and officers,the terms and conditions of which could
be determined by the board of directors without stockholder approval
unless the stock to be issued under the options should exceed 7 percent
of the outstanding stock. The Commission took the position that the
issuance of stock options pursuant to a plan of reorganization is not
in accord with the policy of Chapter X, but further stated: "Once
the reorganization is completed, and a meaure of financial success is
achieved, management, having shown its value, can submit under local
law an appropriate resolution authorizing stock options." The plan
was amended to conform with the views of the Commision. Suspension
of trading in the Westec stock was terminated and trading on the
American Stock Exchange was resumed on May 5, 1969.32
In Parksoood, lne.,33 the trustee's plan of reorganization for the
debtor and its subsidiaries, all real estate companies, provided :for
Parkwood to receive all of those properties in which there is an equity
above the first and second mortgages, and for Adams Properties, Inc.,
a subsidiary o:f Parkwood, which is to be a separate corporation, to
receive all those properties having an equity above the first mortgage
but not above the second mortgage. The Commission, in its advisory
reports, 34 concluded that the plans of reorganization were :fair and
equitable and :feasible,but recommended three amendments, which the
trustee adopted. Under the plan, one group o:fcreditors, the holders of
the second mortgage notes on properties which were turned over to
reorganized Adams, are to release their security interest and receive
in exchange shares of preferred stock in Adams. Since each series of
stock was to represent an equity in the specific property which had
secured the second mortgage notes, the Commission characterized each
series of "stock" as essentially a liquidating interest in a particular
property junior to a first mortgage. The Commission suggested that
this be reflected by issuing nonnegotiable liquidating certificates cor"Corporate Reorganization Release Nos. 282 (January 3, 1969) and 284

responding to the proposed preferred stock. Second, instead of certificates of participation in any proceeds recovered in lawsuits filed by
the trustee, the Commission recommended, as one alternative, that no
certificates be issued and that distributions of proceeds be made to
trade creditors whose names are to be recorded on a list of participants
filed with the court. The Commission also recommended that the real
properties of the reorganized companies be recorded on the balance
sheets at their historical cost, rather than at the higher valuations of
the trustee. Although such a valuation would result in Adams emerging from reorganization with a deficit in its common stock account,
the Commission stated that this was unobjectionable since reorganized
Adams was to be essentially a liquidating company. The plan as
amended was approved by the district court on August 7, 1969 and
was confirmed on November 17, 1969.
In Bankers Trust,35 the Commission recommended approval of the
trustee's plan of reorganization which provided, among other things,
for the consolidation of five debtors into one reorganized company.
Since the debtors appeared to be solvent the plan provided for the issuance of new shares of the reorganized company to certificate holders
of the five debtor trusts on the basis of the original investment of the
certificate holders, with no separate valuation of the equity in each
of the debtor trusts since the five trusts have been operated as a single
enterprise. Since the reorganized company will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the
rules promulgated thereunder, the Commission recommended that as
soon as practicable after confirmation the pro forma financial statements should be submitted to the Commission for examination and
review in the light of these statutory requirements. The court approved
a plan in accordance with the Commission's recommendations.
In Maryvale 0ommunity Hospital, I rw.,36the trustees sold the physical facilities of the debtor, a nonprofit community hospital, to the
Good Samaritan Hospital, a nonprofit corporation, for cash plus the
assumption of certain contingent lia:biIities. 'Subsequently, the trustees
proposed a plan to liquidate and to dissolve the debtor after retiring
the outstanding bonds, which were publicly held, with the proceeds
of the sale. The plan proposed payment to the bondholders of the
principal amount of the bonds, simple interest as specified in the indenture, interest on interest, and a redemption premium. Payment of
interest on interest and the premium were opposed by the State of
Arizona and certain nonprofit corporations which were beneficiaries
under the provision of the debtor's corporate charter that upon dis.. S.D. Ind., No. IP-66-B-2375 .
.. D. Ariz., No. B-9352-Phx.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

solution the assets of the debtor remaining after discharge of its valid
obligations should be turned over to certain classes of public and
private charities. The Commission supported the payment of interest
on interest as to which, the Commission stated, the bondholders had
a superior claim in equity against those who were no more than
legatees under the corporate charter. However, the Commission opposed the payment of the premium because prepayment of the bonds
was not a voluntary act but forced upon the debtor under the requirements of Chapter X. In its decision of November 3, 1969, the court
held that the bondholders were entitled both to interest on interest
and the redemption premium.
In Realeite, bW.,37 after 6 years of administration in Chapter X,
during which time the debtor was substantially liquidated, the trustee
filed a plan based on a proposal by a nonaffiliated company to transfer
to the reorganized debtor unimproved property plus some cash. The
plan provided that for this property and cash the plan proponent
would receive 820,000 shares of new common stock and 20,000 shares
of $5 par value convertible preferred stock, and the reorganized
company would assume a mortgage indebtedness of $175,000. The
presently outstanding common stock, publicly held, would be exchanged for 400,000 shares of new common stock. The Commission
opposed the plan for lack of feasibility since the debtor was substantially liquidated and liquidation was to continue by the sale of lots in
the real property to be contributed by the plan proponent. The Commission also indicated that the principal attraction of the debtor
seemed to be the possibility of utilizing its tax loss carryover and possible values generated by public trading and sharp fluctuations in prices
that often are characteristic of stock with nominal and speculative
earnings. The court denied approval of the plan, and by a subsequent
order denied a petition for reconsideration and rehearing on an
amended plan under which the proponent offered to contribute another
parcel of undeveloped land to the reorganized company. Two stockholders of the debtor as well as the plan proponent have appealed
from both orders to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and
the appeals were pending at the close of the fiscal year.
In Oanandaigua, Enterprises Oorp.,as the court approved and confirmed, as recommended by the Commission, a plan providing for
the cancellation of all issued capital stock and the issuance of newly
authorized capital stock to be auctioned at the direction of the court.
The new stock was to be offered for sale at auction with bids to be made
as a percentage of the claims of general unsecured creditors in an

amount not less than 80 percent of such claims as allowed. The plan
proponent agreed to submit a bid to pay general unsecured creditors,
other than debentureholders, 80 percent of their claims as allowed in
cash and to pay debentureholders 80 percent of the principal amount
of their debentures. Stockholders of the debtor were eliminated from
participation.
As previously reported," the court approval of an earlier plan of t.he
trustee was appealed by an unsuccessful plan proponent. Although
that plan had been effectively superseded by the auction plan discussed above, the appeal from the earlier plan was prosecuted, and in
affirming the district court the court of appeals affirmed the finding of
insolvency." Thereafter the auction plan was accepted by the requisite
number of creditors and confirmed."
ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD TO ALLOWANCES

Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem
of determining the compensation to be paid to the various parties for
services rendered and for expenses incurred in the proceeding. The
Commission, which under Section 242 of the Bankruptcy Act may not
receive any allowance for the services it renders, has sought to assist
the courts in assuring economy of administration and in allocating
compensation equitably on the basis of the claimants' contributions
to the administration of estates and the formulation of plans. During
the fiscal year 187 applications for compensation totaling about $4.3
million were received.
In A1'lington Discount 00.,42 as reported previously." the Commission's motion under Section 328 of Chapter XI was granted, whereupon the debtor amended its petition to comply with the requirements
of Chapter X. Subsequently, the attorneys for the debtor-in-possession
in the Chapter XI proceeding requested a final allowance of $40,000
for services rendered for the approximately 6-month period during
which the proceeding had been in Chapter XI. The Commission had

fi After

to the confirmed plan and feasible. The Commission opposed the vacatur on the
ground that there was an insufficient showing in support of the finding. The
indenture trnstee for the debenture holders has appealed to the Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit from the order approving the new plan and finding it
superior to the previously confirmed plan.

COMMISSION 


recommended an allowance of $15,000. The district court allowed
$7,500, finding that such an amount had been agreed to by the parties
and stating, among other things, that the use of Clmpter XI by the nttorneys had been "in complete disregard of the standards laid down
by the Supreme Court" in S e m k t i e s and E m l u n g e Cornmission v.
American Trailer Rentals Co., 379 U.S. 594 (1965). On appeal, the
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stated that the finding of the
district court of an agreement limiting the allowance to $7,500 was
not supported by substantial evidence. It further held that its review
of the services rendered revealed that not all of them were properly
compensable as beneficial to the estate, and it directed an allowance
of $11,500." The court did not discuss the issue whether the district
judge, in determining the fee to be awarded, could properly take into
account the fact that the proceeding apparently should originally have
been brought under Chapter X.
I n T M T Trailer Femy, I ~ C . attorneys
;~
for the Independent Stockholders' Protective Committee applied for an interim allowance. Wliilc
re ommending an amount less than that sought, the Commission supF
ported the application because the committee had rendered services for
over 10 years and the major services related t o the successful opposition to the confinned plan of reorganization. A hearing was held
and the district court found that the attorneys were entitled to an
interim allowance but reserved the determination of the amount.
Thereafter the court, on an ex parte motion by the successor trustee,
vacated its order. The attorneys for the committee renewed their application, which the Commission supported, and at the close of the fiscal
year it was still pending.

authorized as provided by General Order 44 of the Bankruptcy Act
(requiring ~ r i o court

which the trustee would have billed a client for professional consulting
service does not control the measure of his compensation under Chapter X. The court, further agreeing with the Commission, denied the
trustee's request for "portal-to-portal" compensation for the time
consumed in almost daily 26-mile round trips from his home to the
debtor's place of business and reimbursement for the cost of those trips.
The Commission had expressed the view that the time and money spent
for this purpose were part of the trustee's overhead and not chargeable
as an expense against the estate. The court also agreed with the Commission that the trustee was not entitled to a fee for the time that he
had devoted to preparing his application for compensation.
In Riker Delaware Corporation.» the court, as urged by the Commission, denied all reimbursement for expenses because the trustees,
their counsel, and their accountants had not kept itemized records
of disbursements. In the initial hearing before the referee as special
master on interim allowances, the Commission urged that adequate
notice was not given as required by Section 247 because the notice did
not state the name of the applicants, the capacity in which the applicants were claiming compensation, and the amounts requested. The
referee denied the Commission's request to adjourn the hearing, but
prior to the hearing before the district court on the special master's
report, proper notice was sent to creditors and stockholders.
In Webb &: Knapp, lno.,55 the counsel for the trustee, who had been
granted $120,000 as an interim allowance in the prior year, applied
for an interim allowance of $150,000 for services rendered in the current year. The Commission recommended $75,000because, among other
things, the total time spent by counsel was about 30 percent less than
in the prior year, the time spent by partners decreased from 19 percent
to approximately 16 percent, and counsel had supporting records for
only 90 percent of the total time for which compensation was sought.
The court awarded $90,000.
INTERVENTION IN CHAPfER

XI PROCEEDINGS

Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure by which
debtors can effect arrangements with respect to their unsecured debts
under court supervision. Where a proceeding is brought under that
chapter but the facts indicate that it should have been brought under
Chapter X, Section 328 of Chapter XI authorizes the Commission or
any other party in interest to make application to the court to dismiss
the Chapter XI proceeding unless the debtor's petition is amended to

comply with the requirements of Chapter X, or a creditors' petition
under Chapter X is filed.
In Time Sales Finance OO1'JJo1'ation,56the debtor proposed an arrangement providing for full payment in cash to all unsecured
creditors, except the debentureholders who 'were to receive 40 percent
of the principal amount of their claims in a preferred stock of an
unrelated corporation. The Commission moved pursuant to Section
328, urging that the proposed plan involved more than a minor adjustment of unsecured debt and that past financial activities of the
debtor warranted a disinterested investigation by a Chapter X
trustee. 51 The referee refused confirmation of the plan of arrangement
and adjudicated the debtor a bankrupt, and the Commission's motion
became moot.
In Peoples Loan & Investment
007npa:ny,58 the debtor, an industrial
loan institution, had issued over $7 million in debt securities to more
than 3,000public investors. The proposed arrangement under Chapter
XI provided that each investor could elect to receive 55 percent of his
claim in full settlement immediately or larger percentages within
a 5-year period. Under any alternative, however, the total payment
would be substantially less than the principal and interest of the
claim for which each public creditor had contracted with the debtor.
The arrangement also effected a compromise settlement of a large
claim of the debtor against an insurance company; as a result of the
settlement, control of the debtor would pass to the insurance company. The denial of the Commission's Section 328 motion by the
district court 59 was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit," which held that the extensive evidence of mismanagement
and self-dealing together with the considerable reduction in the claims
of the public creditors while the interests of the equity holders of the
debtor were not affected required "... the extensive protection provided by Chapter X ... ; namely a disinterested trustee, a plan of
arrangement formulated by the trustee (rather than the debtor) with
the S.E.C.'s analysis of the plan and its informative report to the
public creditors, an investigation of past management practices and
prosecution of any legitimate claims, and the fair and equitable requirement of strict priority of creditors' claims over equity interests." 61

In Norman Finance and Thrift Corporation." the debtor, a company engaged in the consumer finance business through its whollyowned subsidiaries, had sold to the public unsecured debt obligations
which it called "thrift savings accounts." A substantial amount of the
funds obtained from the public had been used for the personal investment purposes of the debtor's president and controlling stockholder.
Subsequently, the insurance company which had insured these accounts and which was now in control of the debtor cancelled its policy
with the debtor, claiming it had been fraudulently induced. (by the
former president of the debtor) to insure the accounts. The debtor
proposed a plan of arrangement under Chapter XI offering the 600
public investors, whose claims totaled over $1,250,000, an election between two alternatives: (1) payment of each claim in the proportion
of 40 percent in new debentures and 60 percent in new common stock
to be issued by the debtor or (2) 70 percent in debentures. Acceptance
of the arrangement was to be in complete settlement of all claims the
public investors had against the insurance company, as well as against
the debtor. After the close of the fiscal year the Court of Appeals
for the Tenth Circuit reversed 63 the order of the district court which
had denied the motion of the Commission made under Section 328.
The court of appeals stated that although courts are usually reluctant
to interfere in situations where, as here, some sort of consent has been
obtained, especially by those "whose money is at stake," it appeared
that here the consents had been solicited on a "take or leave basis,"
and with the suggestion that the alternative to acceptance would be
litigation and liquidation in bankruptcy. The court said that either
of the options presented to the investors represented 'a "drastic adjustment of their rights." The court also noted that under Chapter X
creditors were entitled to full payment of their claims before stockholders could participate and, under the arrangement, it was possible
for either the new or old management to retain control of the corporation. The court further stated: "In view of the apparent prior mismanagement of the debtor and possible claims against prior officers,
it is apparent that some independent investigation of the corporation's
financial affairs is required. This disinterested evaluation can only be
accomplished under Chapter X." 64 The cancellation of the insurance
coverage also required the need for such an independent investigation
and disinterested evaluation.

appeals indicated, as the Commission had urged in each case, that the
decision of the Supreme Court in Securities and Exchange Oommissiorc
v. American Trailer Rentals 00.,65 required that the attempted rehabilitations take place under Chapter X. The Supreme Court there
stated that "... as a general rule Chapter X is the appropriate proceeding for adjustment of publicly held debt," and indicated" ... the
narrow limits within which there are exceptions to this general rule
... ," as extending to situations "... where the public investors are
few in number and familiar with the operations of the debtor, or

PART VllI
SUPPORTING AcrnnTIES
PUBLIC INFORMATION SERVICES
Dissemination of Information

As the discussion in prior sections of this Report indicates, most
large corporations in which there is a substantial public investor interest have filed registration statements or registration applications
under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act with the Commission and are required to file annual and other periodic reports.
Widespread public dissemination of the financial and other data
included in these documents is essential if public investors generally
are to benefit by the disclosure requirements of the securities laws. This
is accomplished in part by distribution of the prospectus or offering
circular in connection with new offerings. Much of the data is also
reprinted and receives general circulation through the medium of
securities manuals and other financial publications, thus becoming
available to broker-dealer and investment adviser firms, trust departments and other financial institutions and, through them, to public
investors generally. As indicated below, it is also available for public
inspection both at the officesof the Commission and the exchanges upon
which particular securities may be listed.
Various activities of the Commission also facilitate public dissemination of information filed as well as other information. Among these
is the issuance of a daily "News Digest" which contains (1) a resume
of each proposal for the public offering of securities for which a
Securities Act registration statement is filed; (2) a list of issuers of
securities traded over-the-counter which have filed registration statements under the Securities Exchange Act; (3) a list of companies
which have filed interim reports disclosing significant corporate developments; (4) a summary of all notices of filings of applications and
declarations, and of all orders, decisions, rules and rule proposals
issued by the Commission; (5) announcements of the Commission's
participation in corporate reorganization proceedings under Chapter X
of the Bankruptcy Act and of the filing of advisory reports of the
174

TF.URTY-F~

~AL

REPORT

175

Commission on the fairness and feasibility of reorganization plans;
(6) a brief report regarding actions of courts in litigation resulting
from the Commission's law enforcement program; and (7) a brief
reference to each statistical report issued by the Commission. During
the year, the News Digest included summary reports on the 4,366 registration statements filed with the Commission (not including investment company offering proposals filed as amendments to previously
filed statements), 998 notices of filings, orders, decisions, rules and
rule proposals issued by the Commission, 304 developments in litigation under its enforcement program, 8 releases on corporate reorganization proceedings, and 80 statistical releases.
The News Digest is made immediately available to the press, and it
is also reprinted and distributed by the Government Printing Office,
on a subscription basis, to some 4,330 investors, securities firms, practicing lawyers and others. In addition, the Commission maintains mailing lists for the distribution of the full text of its orders, decisions,
rules and rule proposals.
These informational activities are supplemented by public discussions from time to time of legal, accounting and other problems arising
in the administration of the Federal securities laws. During the year,
members of the Commission and numerous staff officers made speeches
before various professional, business and other groups interested in the
Federal securities laws and their administration and participated in
panel discussions of like nature. Participation in these discussions not
only serves to keep attorneys, accountants, corporate executives and
others abreast of developments in the administration of those laws,
but it also is of considerable value to the Commission in learning about
the problems experienced. by those who seek to comply with those laws.
In order to facilitate such compliance the Commission also issues from
time to time general interpretive releases and policy statements explaining the operation of particular provisions of the Federal securities
laws and outlining policies and practices of the Commission.
Puhlications.-In addition to the daily News Digest, and releases
concerning Commission action under the Acts administered by it and
litigation involving securities violations, the Commission issues a
number of other publications, including the following:

Availability of Information for Public Inspection

The many thousands of registration statements, applications, declarations, and annual and periodic reports filed with the Commission
each year are available for public inspection at the Commission's
public reference room in its principal offices in Washington, D.C.
Also available at that location are some additional documents contained in Commission files and indexes of Commission decisions.
The categories of materials which are available for public examination are specified in the Commission's rule concerning records and
information, 17 CFR 200.80, as revised to implement the provisions
of the Public Information Amendment to Section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act which became effective July 4, 1967.
The rule also establishes a procedure to be followed in requesting
records or copies thereof, provides a method of administrative ap-

peal from the denial of access to any record, and provides for the
imposition of fees when more than one-half man-hour of work is
performed by members of the Commission's staff to locate and make
available records requested. The fee rate which has been established
is $2.50 for each one-half man-hour or fraction thereof after the first
one-half man-hour.
The Commission has special public reference facilities in the New
York and Chicago Regional Offices, and some facilities for public
use in other regional and branch offices. Each regional office has
available for public examination copies of prospectuses used in recent offerings of securities registered under the Securities Act; registration statements and recent annual reports filed pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act by companies having their principal
office in the region; broker-dealer and investment adviser applications originating in the region; letters of notification under Regulation A filed in the region; and indexes of Commission decisions.
Additional material is available in the New York, Chicago and San
Francisco regional offices.
Members of the public may make arrangements through the public
reference room at the Commission's principal offices to purchase
copies of material in the Commission's public files. The copies are produced by a commercial copying company which supplies them to the
public at prices established under a contract with the Commission.
Current prices begin at 9 cents per page for pages not exceeding
8%" x 14" in size, with a $2 minimum charge. Under the same contract, the company also makes microfilm and microfiche copies
of Commission public documents available on a subscription or
individual order basis to persons or firms who have or can obtain viewing facilities. In microfiche services, up to 60 images
of document pages are contained on 4" x 6" pieces of film,
referred to as "fiche." Annual microfiche subscriptions are offered in a variety of packages covering all public reports filed
on Forms 10-K, 9-K, 8-K, N-1Q and N-1R under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934or the Investment Company Act of 1940; annual
reports to stockholders; proxy statements; new issue registration
statements; and final prospectuses for new issues. The packages offered include various categories of these reports, including those of
companies whose securities are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, or regional stock exchanges,
or traded over-the-counter, and standard industry classifications
(S.I.C.). Arrangements also may be made to subscribe to reports of
companies of one's own selection. The subscription services system

may be extended to further groups of filings in the future if demand
warrants. The company also will supply, at reasonable prices, copies in
microfiche or microfilm form of other public records of the Commission desired by a member of the public. Microfiche readers and readerprinters will be installed in major public reference areas in the Commission's headquarters and principal regional offices,and sets of the
microfiche will be available for inspection there.
Visitors to the public reference rooms of the Commission's 1Vashington, D.C., New York and Chicago officesalso may make immediate
reproductions of material in those offices on coin-operated copying
machines at a cost of 25 cents per 8%" x 14" page. The charge for
an attestation with the Commission seal is $2. Detailed information
concerning copying services available and prices for the various types
of service 'and copies may be obtained from the Public Reference
Section of the Commission.
Each year, many thousands of requests for copies of and information from the public files of the Commission are received by the Public
Reference Section in ,Vashington, D.C. During the 1969 fiscal year,
12,345 persons examined material on file in 'Vashington and several
thousand others examined files in the New York, Chicago, and other
regional offices.More than 25,367 searches were made :for information
requested by individuals and approximately 3,400 letters were written
with respect to information requested.

During the 1969 fiscal year the Commission continued the implementation and improvement of existing and planned uses of EDP
which were described in previous annual reports.
In further expanding the use of automation for analysis of data
related to the financial structure of business and the economics and
practices of the securities industry, two new EDP systems were developed ,and are currently being implemented. One of the systems
is designed for compilation and the analysis of working capital and
long-term debt data contained in quarterly reports of nonmanufacturing companies registered with the Commission. The other system
has been designed for the analysis of statements submitted in connection with the study of "hedge funds" discussed above at page 18.
EDP applications planned for the future include a system for compiling and analyzing plant and equipment expenditure data reported
quarterly by companies registered with the Commission.

Increase in EDP Capability

During the past year the Commission increased its EDP capability
by making certain modifications and additions to existing computer
programs and hardware.
A program package supplied by the company from which the Commission had acquired its EDP equipment was adapted to existing Commission programs in order to increase the speed of processing data
through the EDP systems. Two Model 2311 disk units were leased and
the Model 40 control processing unit was modified to double its capacity. These changes have resulted in more efficient use of the Commission's EDP facilities and an opportunity to take advantage of more
advanced programming techniques. Among the advantages is the capability to process two jobs through the computer simultaneously.
Assistance to State and Federal Agencies

Through procedures developed in fiscal 1968 1 to promote the coordination of regulatory activities, the Commission, during the past
year, continued to supply certain information from its computer files
to State authorities and self-regulatory institutions. In addition, it
continued to furnish selected data from those files to several Federal
agencies. Among other things, over-the-counter market data was made
available to the Federal Reserve Board for use in its administration of
Regulation U under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (relating to
the extension of credit by banks) .
Sharing of EDP Facilities

During the past year the Commission continued its sharing arrangement with the Naval Ship Engineering Center, Department of the
Navy. Under this arrangement the Commission increased the computer time provided from about 2,000 hours to about ;3,000 hours per
year. This was done at a significant savings to the Government as
compared with the prevailing rates of outside sources. The Commission also continued its supplemental agreement with the Center for
key-punch and key-verification services. During the past fiscal year approximately 1,400,000 cards were punched and verified for the Department of the Navy.
EDP Training

During the year the Commission continued its training programs
geared to the specific needs of its computer specialists and operators.
The program is designed to enable the Commission's EDP staff to
utilize more advanced hardware and programs in the development and
implementation of new and revised computer systems.

Personnel Program

In fiscal 1969, the Commission continued its efforts to recruit outstanding college and law school students with the specialized academic
training required for its fields of work. A special recruitment brochute, entitled "Are You Unique !" was prepared jointly with 16 other
small agencies for distribution to all colleges and law schools in the
fall of 1969 through the facilities of the Interagency Board network
of the Civil Service Commission.
While the Commission is able to recruit highly qualified law school
graduates, the retention of attorneys who have progressed to middle
and higher grade levels continues to be a major problem. After 3 or
.J: years of service with the Commission, many of these lawyers resign
from the staff to accept attractive offers in private law practice or
industry at salary levels considerably in excess of the amount the Commission is able to pay under the Federal salary scale. Exit interviews
confirm the fact that the main reason for the departure of these attorneys is one of economics.
Public recognition is an essential factor in building and maintaining
the prestige of Federal careers, and awards granted by outside organizations improve the quality of public administration and the morale
and career service motivations of Federal employees. In fiscal 1969,
David Ferber, Solicitor of the Commission, and Irving M. Pollack,
Director, Division of Trading and Markets, were joint recipients of
a Rockefeller Public Service Award. This award of $10,000 is presented annually to five Federal career employees whose careers in five
broad fields of Government have brought singular honor to the Federal service. Messrs. Ferber and Pollack are the fifth and sixth members of the Commission's staff to receive Rockefeller Awards since the
awards were established in 1951. Arthur F. Mathews, former Deputy
Associate Director of the Division of Trading and Markets, received
one of six 1969 Younger Federal Lawyer Awards from the Federal
Bar Association for his outstanding contributions to criminal law
enforcement in the securities area.
Personnel officialsof the Commission actively participated in workshop committees sponsored by the Interagency Advisory Group of the
Civil Service Commission. Three such committees were the Committee
on Joint College Recruiting for Smaller Agencies, the Committee on
Federal Merit Promotion Policy and the Committee on Evaluation of
Personnel Programs.
In its report on employee training in the Federal service for the fiscal
year 1968, the Civil Service Commission commented favorably on the
Division of Trading and Markets' practice (continued during fiscal

THIRTY-FIFTH

year 1969) of sending teams of analysts and/or attorneys to New York
City for 3 days each for first-hand exposure to the problems of the
New York Stock Exchange and its member firms, as a good example
of up-dating "state of the art" training. Significant training programs conducted by the Commission during fiscal 1969 included (1)
a course in Basic English for stenographers, typists and clerks offered
free of charge after hours, (2) participation in the "From Nine to
Five" television secretarial course presented jointly by the Civil Service Commission and a local educational TV station and (3) various inhouse training courses offered by the Divisions of Trading and
Markets, Corporation Finance and Corporate Regulation.
As a part of the Commission's Fourteenth Annual Service and Mer-it
Awards Ceremony held in October 1968, Distinguished Service medals
were awarded by the Commission to David Ferber, Solicitor of the
Commission; ames E. Newton, Regional Administrator of the Seattle
Regional Office; Harry Pollack, Director of Personnel; Eugene H.
Rotberg, former Associate Director of the Division of Trading and
Markets; and Charles E. Shreve, Director of the Division of Corporation Finance. The Supervisory Excellence Award was presented to
James C. Foster, Special Assistant to the Director of the Division of
Trading and Markets, in recognition of his excellence in fulfilling both
his "people" and "program" responsibilities, Twenty employees were
given 30-year pins for SEC service; within-grade salary increases in
recognition of high quality performance were granted to 71 employees;
and cash awards totaling $15,723 were presented to 116 employees for
superior performance or special service.
