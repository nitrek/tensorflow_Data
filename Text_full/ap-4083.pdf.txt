ORDER POSTPONING
HEARING AND SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
on August 10, 2016, alleging that each Respondent has a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is delinquent
in its periodic filings. A hearing is currently set for August 29, 2016. On August 18, 2016, the
Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service establishing that all Respondents were
served with the OIP in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii) by August 15, 2016.
Respondents’ answers are therefore due by August 29, 2016. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(a)(b), .220(b).
Given that the due date for answers coincides with the current hearing date, I
POSTPONE the hearing and ORDER a telephonic prehearing conference at 2:00 p.m. EDT on
Thursday, September 1, 2016. Failure by any Respondent to file an answer, participate in the
prehearing conference, or otherwise defend the proceeding will result in default and revocation
of its registered securities. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f).
