Commission's activities under the various statutes which it administers. Equally significant are the many aspects of the Commission's
day to day activities which play such a large part in the carrying on of
its functions. Space does not permit an adequate presentation of such
matters, but in considering the totality of the Commission's activities
they should not be forgotten. The Commission is always ready to
give any additional information that may be sought concerning its
work, either by the Congress or by members of the public.
The year covered herein was marked by a continuation of high levels
of economic activity and of commensurate levels of Commission work.
Particularly significant was the fact that the volume of financing
during the 1947 fiscal year for new money purposes exceeded even that
of 1946-when the total volume of financing was at its highest point.
Further substantial progress has been made toward completion of
the program of integration of the nation's electric and gas public
utility holding company systems and the simplification of their corporate structures pursuant to the requirements of Section 11 of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Thus, not only are
the holding company systems being brought into conformity with the
pattern set forth by Congress in the Act, but in addition the financing
of the industry's present extensive expansion program is greatly facilitated. In the latter connection it is significant that the public utility
industry has done more new money financing during the 1947 fiscal
year than the aggregate of all such financing for the twelve preceding
years.
The continued effort of the Commission to simplify its procedures
and forms, and to avoid unnecessary duplication in its disclosure
requirements is manifest throughout the report. In this connection,
we may note the adoption of rules and forms to facilitate the operations of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development;
the promulgation of rules eliminating unnecessary hearing procedures
under the Investment Company Act; and the simplification of basic
Securities Act registration forms and the elimination of other forms.
One of the significant activities of the Commission during the past
year was its undertaking of a program of study of the operations of
the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
with a view to an ultimate recommendation to the Congress of desirable and workable amendments to these statutes. Conferences have
been held with representatives of all groups directly concerned with
the operations -of these statutes. DIscussions were had with and
comments were solicited frcm investors, large and small, and representatives of underwriters, dealers, securities exchanges, State regulatory bodies, and professional groups of attorneys and accountants.
The Commission expects that, before the close of the current fiscal
year, its offices will have been returned from Philadelphia to Washington. It is hoped that the move will facilitate contact between the
Commission and the Congress.

PART I
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE SECURITIES

ACT OF 1933

The primary purpose of the Securities Act of 1933is to prevent fraud
in the sale of securities. To accomplish this purpose the act requires
the fair disclosure of information about securities by means of the
registration statement and prospectus before the securities are publicly
offered for sale to the investor. In addition, certain practices in connection with the sale of securities are defined as fraudulent and made
unlawful. The requirements as to the registration of a security and
the use of a prospectus are designed to provide the investor with sufficient facts about the security to enable him to make an informed
judgment of the merits of the investment before he buys the security
offered to him. The provisions defining and prohibiting certain
fraudulent practices are aimed at the prevention and punishment
of active fraud, misrepresentation, and deceit. The Commission
neither makes any determinations as to the merits of any security
nor passes upon the value of any investment. The act does not aim
at the elimination of risk in investment, but only at the disclosure
of sufficient information to enable the investor to measure the risk.
THE REGISTRATION
The Registration

PROCESS

Statement and Prospectus

The principle of full and fair disclosure of material facts about
a security is applied in practice by means of the registration statement and the prospectus. The registration statement is filed with the
Commission and must become effective before the security being
registered may be publicly offered for sale in interstate commerce or
by use of the mails. The registration statement becomes a public
document when filed (except where the act provides for confidential .
treatment) and is available for inspection by the public. Financial
houses, financial writers, the investment services, and newspapers
make major use of the registration statement as a source of information and publicize the facts which it contains.
The prospectus serves to bring pertinent information contained in
the registration statement directly to the attention of the investor.
It is unlawful to offer a registered security for sale by means of a
prospectus unless the prospectus contains the information required
by the act.
The act sets forth the information required to be contained in
the registration statement and prospectus. This includes, for example, information about officers and directors of the issuer of the
security; the nature, size, and degree of success of the business; the
issuer's capitalization; the purpose of the financing and the use to
which the proceeds will be put; the compensation which the under1

2

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

writer is to receive; options outstanding against securities of the
issuer; bonus and profit-sharing agreements; and :pending or threatened legal proceedings against the issuer. In addition, certified financial statements are a part of every registration statement.
Effective Date of Registration Statement

In order to permit the information contained in a registration
statement to become known to the investing public, the act provides
a 20-day waiting period after the filing of the registration statement
before the registration statement becomes effective and the security
may be offered for sale. If the registration statement is amended
after it is filed but before it has become effective, the 20-day waiting
period starts anew from the time of the amendment, unless the amendment is filed with the consent of or by order of the Commission.
The Commission is empowered at its discretion to accelerate the
effective date of a registration statement, in cases where the facts
justify such acceleration, so that the full 20-day period need not
expire before the securities may be offered for sale. The act directs
that, in the exercise of this power, the Commission must give due regard to the adequacy of the information about the security already
available to the public, to the complexity of the particular financing,
and to the public interest and the protection of investors.'
One of the main functions of the Commission under the act is the
examination of registration statements to determine compliance with
the requirements of the act and its standards of full and fair disclosure. In view of the fact that a registration statement may become
effective on the twentieth day after filing, the examination by the
staff must be completed with a maximum speed consistent with
thoroughness and a full consideration of all the facts. Neither the
Commission, the issuer, nor the underwriter desires a statement to become effective unless it fully complies with the act. It is often the
case that the staff will ascertain that deficiencies exist in the registration statement, or the issuer or underwriter may wish to amend the
statement or delay its effectiveness for business reasons. In such
cases, if there is a danger that the registration statement may become
effective in defective form or prematurely for the purposes of the
issuer or underwriter, it is customary for the issuer to file a minor
amendment to the registration statement, thereby starting the 20-day
period running anew.
In order to speed the registration process, and at the same time to
make available to the registrant the assistance of the Commission's
staff of experts, the Commission has adopted the procedures of the
prefiling conference and the "letter of comment." The prefiling conference enables the re~istrant to discuss with the staff, prior to the
filing of the registration statement, any special problems involved
with respect to the particular registration statement. The letter of
comment is an informal device by which the registrant is informed of
any deficiencies found to exist in the registration statement as filed.
The registrant can therefore make the necessary amendments and
1 In the 1947 fiscal year, acceleration
was requested and granted with respect to 98 perclint of the registration statements which became elfective in that year.

THIRTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

thereby prevent the registration statement :frombecoming effective in
deficient form.
Time Required for Registration

The Commission, with the cooperation of persons in the securities
industry, constantly studies and adopts ways to cut down the elapsed
time from the day the registration statement is filed to the day when
it is in proper form and becomes effective. The prefiling conference
and deficiency letter are two of the results of this continuous study.
The Commission's staff has by and large been able to supply the
registrant with a deficiency' letter before the 20-day waiting period
expires. It is rarely possible, however, for the registrant to make
corrections within that 'time. Further, as has been pointed out, the
registrant often desires to delay the effective date of the registration
statement, particularly in a period of a declining market.
The Commission has recently made two studies to determine the
median elapsed time for completion of the registration process. For
convenience and simplicity, the elapsed time has been broken down
into three periods: (1) the time required after filing for the staff to
prepare a deficiency letter; (2) the time consumed by the registrant
in filing necessary amendments; and (3) the elapsed time thereafter
until the statement became effective. These two studies are described
and their results tabulated below.
First Study
This study was based on 665 registration statements, involving
offerings of securities aggregating more than $6,600,000,000,which
became effective during the 1946 calendar year. The 1946 calendar
year covers a period in which there was a considerable volume of
public financing. During that year, a total of 803 registration statements were filed for proposed offerings aggregating $7,900,000,000,the
largest dollar amount of offerings for any single year since adoption
of the Securities Act. The results of the study follow:

The second study was made, in somewhat different detail, for each

covers 423 registration statements which became effective during the
period. The elapsed periods of time shown in the table below are given
in days and are for the median registration statement. In examining
the results of this study, it is to be recalled that there was a precipitous

The volume of bonds registered for cash sale for the accounts of
issuers in the 1947 fiscal year was only slightly less than the volume
for the prior year. There was a more substantial decrease in the volume of stocks registered in the 1947fiscal year for cash sale for the accounts of issuers. But this volume was half again as great as the next
highest volume of stocks registered for cash sale for the accounts of
issuers registered in the 1937 fiscal year.
From September 1934 through June 1946,new money purposes represented 20.67 percent of the net proceeds expected from the sale of
issues registered for the accounts of the issuers. In the 1947 fiscal
year, new money purposes were 54.48l?ercent of the expected net proceeds for the year-large enough to raise the 13-year average over five

E. COST OF FLOTATION OF SECURITIES REGISTERED FOR OASH SALE FOR THE
ACCOUNTS OF ISSUERS

The cost of flotation of securities registered for primary cash distribution, as reported in the registration statements for such securities,
amounted to 5.5 percent of the aggregate dollar volume of such securities. A further breakdown of this 5.5 percent indicates that 5.0
percent was to be paid as commissions and discounts and 0.5 percent
for all other expenses incidental to the flotation of the securities, including all costs relative to registration. A study of the portion of'
aggregate gross proceeds paid as commissions and discounts to investment bankers on securities registered for sale to the general public
through such bankers reveals a downward trend in recent years, as
may be noted from the table below: 5
• See appendix tables 1 through 4 for a more detailed breakdown of the dollar volume of

New Capital and Refinancing

Proceeds from corporate securities flotations, both registered and
unregistered, applicable to expansion of fixed and working capital
amounted to $3,965,000,000 compared with the peaks of $1,617,000,000
in the 1946 fiscal year and $1,196,000,000 in the 1937 fiscal year.
While entirely comparable figures for the years prior to 1934, the date
when this statistical series began, are not available, it appears that the
new money volume in the 1947 fiscal year was as large as the high levels
reached in the twenties. Industrial and miscellaneous firms accounted
for 58 percent of the new money financing, public utility companies
(including telephone companies) for 37 percent and railroad companies for 5 percent. The volume of refinancing through new issues
of securities declined to $2,011,000,000 compared with the 1946 record
high of $5,297,000,000.11
STATISTICS OF SECURITIES REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT

The aggregate dollar amount involved in registration statements
filed in the 1947 fiscal year exceeds that for any fiscal year except the
preceding year 1946. As shown in the table below there were 567
statements filed in the 1947 fiscal year covering proposed offerings in
the aggregate amount of $6,934,388,303, as compared with the amount
of $7,401,260,809 for the 1946 fiscal year.

EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT

The Commission is empowered under section 3 (b) of the act to
exempt from registration, subject to such terms and conditions as it
might prescribe by rule and regulation, issues of securities not exceeding an aggregate offering price to the public of $300,000. Five regulations have been adopted pursuant to this authority: regulation A,
a general exemption for small issues; regulation A-R, a special exemption for notes and bonds secured by first liens on family dwellings; 12
regulation A-M, a special exemption for assessable shares of stock
of mining companies; regulation B, an exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights, and regulation B-T, an exemption for interests in oil royalty trusts or similar types of trusts or unincorporated associations.
The availability of an exemption under anl of these regulations
does not include any exemption £rom civil Iiabilities under section 12
or from criminal liabilities for fraud under secton 17. In order to
insure the proper enforcement of these sections, the conditions for the
availability of the exemptions provided by these regulations, with
the exception of regulation A-R, mclude the requirements that certain
minimum information be filed with the Commission and that disclosure of certain information be made in sales literature.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A

In the 1947 fiscal year business made greater use of public offerings
under the general exemption provided by regulation A than in the
prior year. Thus~ the number of letters of notification received and
examined thereunder rose £rom a total of 1,348 in the 1946 fiscal year
to 1,513 in the 1947 fiscal year; and the aggregate offering price increased at the same time from $181,600,155 to $210,791,114. Included
in the 1947 fiscal year's offerings were 68 letters of notification relating
to oil and gas leases. Securities of companies engaged in various
phases of the oil and gas business totaled an aggregate offering price of
$8,660,26l.
The distribution of the 1,513 letters of notification by size of offering
show:s that 761 covered proposed offerings of $100,000 or less; 298
offerings of more than $100,000 but less than $200,000; and 454 inU Inasmuch
as no reports or filings are required under this regulation, no statistical
data as to its application and use are available.

10

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

volved offerings in excess of $200,000 but not more than the statutory
maximum of $300,000.
The regulation makes provision for the filing of the requisite letter
of notification at the appropriate regional officeof the Commission for
the greater convenience of small businesses making use of this regulation. The letters of notification and the related sales literature are
examined in the regional officewhere filed and then reviewed by a staff
of experts at the Commission's central office. This review involves
a search for pertinent information in the Commission's extensive files
and an examination to determine whether the exemption of the regulation is applicable in the particular case and whether the information
filed discloses any violations of any of the acts administered by the
Commission. The results of this review are made available promptly
to the regional officeinvolved. 1,800 letters were written in this con-:
nection during the fiscal year. In addition, the Commission cooperates with the proper authorities in the States in which the securities are proposed to be offered by informing them of the fact that
the offering is to be made and giving them a summary of pertinent
data concerning the proposed offer.
It should be emphasized that, as suggested above, the exemption
from registration provided by regulation A, as well as by the other
exemptions granted under section 3 (b), does not constitute complete
exemption from all provisions of the act. Thus these exemptions are subject to the express provisions of section 12 imposing
civil liability on persons who sell securities in interstate commerce or
through the mails by means of untrue statements or misleading omissions, and to the provisions of section 17, which makes it unlawful
to sell securities by such means or by other types of fraud. By their
express terms, each of these sections is applicable whether or not the
transactions involve securities which have been exempted under section 3 (b). Accordingly, the principal effect of a section 3 (b) exemption is to permit the sale of securities on the basis of a less complete
formal filing than that required by the act in the case of a registered
security.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A-M

The Commission received and examined during the year a total
of three prospectuses covering an aggregate offering price of $150,000
for assessable shares of stock of mining corporations conditionally
exempt from registration pursuant to rule 240 of regulation A-M.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B

Pursuant to regulation B, which provides for the conditional
exemption from registration of fractional undivided interests in oil
or gas rights where the aggregate offering price does not exceed
$100,000,the Commission last year received and examined 135 offering
sheets, and 161 amendments to such offering sheets, with respect to
which the following actions were taken:

Oonfidential written reports of sales under regulation B.-The
Commission also received and examined during the year 2,698 confidential written reports required pursuant to rules 320 (a) and 322
(c) and (d) of regulation B concerning sales made by broker-dealers
or offerors to investors and by dealers to other dealers. This total
consisted of 1,100 reports on Form I-G and 148 on Form 2-G representing sales in the aggregate of $897,573 and $738,798, respectively.
If examination of these reports indicates that a violation of the law
may have occurred, the Commission makes appropriate investigations,
and, in instances where the facts are deemed to warrant it, appropriate
action is taken.
Oil and gaB investigations.-Twenty-two
investigations involving
oil and gas securities were instituted by the Commission during the
1947 fiscal year to determine whether there had been any violations of
sections 5 (requirin8' registration) or 17 (prohibiting fraudulent
sales) of the Securities Act or section 15 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (regulating the conduct of brokers and dealers). The
total of such investigations current during the year was 161. As part
of these investigations, some 1,500 letters were written and approximately 200 personal and telephone conferences were held during the
fiscal year by the experts of the Oil and Gas Unit of the Commission's
staff. In addition, engineer and geologist members of the staff prepared a number of technical memoranda or valuation estimates and
conducted scores of conferences in the oil and gas producing regions
and other locations in the field. Thirty-one of these investigations
were closed during the year, leaving 130 pending at the end of the
year. A summary of these investigations is tabulated below:

During the fiscal year, an investigation was undertaken with respect
to a number of letters of notification, .filed under regulation A, relating to many oil and gas properties located in the Rangely Field,
hCUfltlea

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Colorado, which was then being actively developed. The investigation
showed that practically all of the prospective acreage on the Rangely
structure was under lease to major or strong independent companies
and that the field was defined in several directions by dry holes or by
wells making a considerable quantity of water. A number of companies which had filed letters of notification under regulation A owned
leases beyond the indicated productive limits of the field, or held such
leases under option. Several of them were circulating highly misleading statements through the mails with reference to the possibilities
of finding oil. The results of this investigation have helped to prevent
the continued use of sales literature containing misleading statements
about the Rangely Field.
As a result of another investigation, George C. Reining was tried at
Tampa, Fla., for violation of the mail fraud ana conspiracy statutes
in connection with the sale of various oil and gas leases in Terrell and
Presidio Counties, Tex. He was found guilty on six counts and
sentenced to 6 years in the penitentiary.
FORMAL ACTIONS UNDER SECTION 8

The Commission makes every effort to insure that a registration
statement shall be complete and comply fully with the requirements
of the act before the statement becomes effective. As has been pointed
out, where a registration statement is found to be deficient, the registrant is informed in order that proper corrections may be made. It
is sometimes necessary, however, for the Commission to invoke its
powers under section 8 to prevent a registration statement from becoming effective or to suspend the effectiveness of a registration statement which has already become effective.
Under section 8 (b), the Commiit
may institute proceedings
to determine whether it should issue
order to prevent a registration from becoming effective. Such proceedings are authorized if
the registration statement as filed is on its face inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect. Under section 8 (d), proceedings may
be instituted to determine whether the Commission should Issue a
stop order to suspend the effectiveness of a registration' statement,
which has already become effective, if it appears to the Commission
that the registration statement includes any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
or necessary to make the statements included not misleading. Under
section 8 (e) the Commission may make an examination to determine
whether to issue a stop order under section 8 (d).
The Commission tries to avoid the use of its powers under section
8, and will institute an examination under section 8 (e) or a proceeding under section 8 (d) only where necessary for the protection of
investors and to prevent fraud. The 1947 fiscal year was unusual in
that the Commission was required to institute seven section 8 (e)
examinations and five section 8 (d) proceedings.
Examinations Under Section 8 (e)

Examinations made pursuant to section 8 (e) may be held in public.
The Commission, however, to insure that no injury shall be done to a
registrant by means of bad publicity if the examination should reveal
no violation of the law, makes it a practice to hold such preliminary

THIRTEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

13

examinations in private. Where the facts revealed by the examination
warrant the institution of proceedings under section 8 (d), such latter
proceedings are held in public. During the 1947 fiscal year, the Commission authorized the conduct of seven examinations under section 8
(e) . Six of these were held in private and one in public. Of the
six held in private, the records of examination in two cases remained
private after completion of the examination and the other four were
made public. In two of the five cases in which the records of examination are now public the Commission authorized the institution of proceedings under section 8 (d), and those cases are discussed hereinafter.
The nature of and the results in the three remaining cases are:

Oonsolidated Hotels, I'TW.-File No. ~-6668.-This registrant is engaged principally in the operation of hotels and apartment houses.
Substantially all its proposed offering covered securities owned by the
controlling stockholder, a large part of which had been acquired from
the registrant in exchange for certain properties.
It appeared from a preliminary examination of the registration
statement that there was a failure to disclose, amon~ other things:
(1) The commingling of activities of the registrant WIth those of the
controlling stockholder; (2) that the controlling stockholder was the
promoter of the registrant and an underwriter of the securities; (3)
the profits to the controlling stockholder as such promoter and underwriter; (4) the effect of a write-up in unrealized values of properties
recently acquired from the controlling stockholder; and (5) the absence of arm's length dealings between him and the company.
Since it was impossible to determine from the registration statement the cost to the controlling stockholder of properties transferred
by him to the company in return for securities which it was proposed
to offer to the public, as well as other material facts as indicated above,
it was decided that the true status of the case could be determined
only through a section 8 (e) proceeding. Before an opinion was
rendered by the Commission in respect of the proceeding, the registrant requested withdrawal of the registration statement on the basis,
in part, that "withdrawal is consistent with the public interest and the
protection of investors." The application for withdrawal was
granted.
Health Institute, Inc.-File No. ~-6864.-This registrant proposed
to build and equip hotel and health facilities and to acquire a mineral
water supply at a spa in the southwest.
It appeared from preliminary investigation that no serious effort
had been made to determine the practicability of the enterprise with
respect to cost of construction, demand for proposed facilities, cost
of operation or method of financing. In the face of this situation the
prospectus nevertheless contained no hint of the hazards involved and
implied that the enterprise would be successful and profitable .
.A. section 8 (e) examination was ordered to determine the true
status of the case. After the hearings were conducted, but before any
subsequent action was taken by the Commission, the registrant withdrew the registration statement.
Oro Yellowknife Gold Mines, Ltd.-File No. ~-6881.-The registrant, of Toronto, Canada, filed a registration statement covering
2,000,000 shares of common stock which were to be offered for an
aggregate of $1,200,000. The company was to receive a net of $900,000.

14

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The Commission authorized a private examination under section
8 (e) to determine whether a stop order should issue under section
8 (d). At the conclusion of the examination, the Commission received a request for the withdrawal of the registration statement, giving as the reason therefor that "the company desires to make further
inquiry into the geological facts affecting its properties." The Commission granted the request for withdrawal and made public the
record of the examination.
Among the matters. considered at the private examination were
the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosure in the registration statement concerning the independence of the registrant's consulting
engineer and the proposed use of the proceeds of the offering. The
engineer stated in his report that he had no direct or indirect interest
in the property, that he was "an independent consulting mining engineer," and the registrant made the same representation in the prospectus. According to evidence adduced, however, the engineer was
a son of one of the officials of the registrant, he was a brother of
another who acted as general manager of the company, and he understood that his services "will be sought" to act as an engineer on a
retainer basis for the registrant in the future. These facts were not
disclosed in the registration statement.
The registration statement showed that of the $900,000 net proceeds of the proposed offering, $115,000 were to be expended for exploratory work as recommended by the engineer. He also recommended that the financing should include "ultimate monies required to
pursue underground development through a standard shaft with
modern mining plant, and should make provision finally for construction of a treatment plant." The registration statement did not disclose either that the sampling done on the various geological structures
investigated gave gold assay values well below a commercial grade
or the bearing of these low values on the probability of requiring
jIDorethan $115,000 for exploration.
,Stop-Order Proceedings Under Section 8 (d)

Two stop-order proceedings were pending at the beginning of the
fiscal year. The Commission authorized the institution of five additional proceedings during the year. Two of these five proceedings
were instituted after the completion of examination under section
8 (e). The nature of and the results in the seven stop-order proceedings are:
Midas Yellowknife Gold Jlines Ltd.-File No. ~781.-0n
October
filed a registration statement covering 1,250,000
shares of common stock, $1 par value, to be offered to the public at $0.60
per share for an aggregate offering price of $750,000. It was stated
that the net proceeds to the registrant, estimated at $450,000, were
to be utilized in the exploration of some 68 gold-mining claims located
in the Yellowknife area of Canada.
The examination under section 8 (e) revealed the following, among
other circumstances, none of which had been disclosed in the registration statement: (1) That Gordon Jones, the promoter and dominant
stockholder of the registrant, had options on other mining claims
located in Canada which he intended to transfer to the registrant
and that approximately $790,000 over and above the estimated pro21, 1946, registrant

THIRTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

15

ceeds from the contemplated offering would be required to explore
such additional claims; (2) that under existing contractual arrangements the stockholders' equity in the various mining claims owned and
to be acquired by the registrant could be diluted up to 90 percent;
and (3) that Jones had been appointed general manager of the registrant, that he determined in general the entire conduct of its business,
and that he had received and was to receive substantial payments as
fees and expenses.
Based on the result of this examination the Commission authorized the institution of stop-order proceedings and scheduled a
hearing under section 8 (d) at which the prior section 8 (e) record was
introduced. The registrant thereupon filed a request for withdrawal
of the registration statement, stating that no sales or offering of the
securities had been made and that the financing would be undertaken
in Canada. Its request was granted by the Commission.
Tucker Oorporation.-File No. 2-7057.-The Tucker Corp. filed a
registration statement relating to a proposed public offering of
4,000,000 shares of class A common stock, par value $1 per share, to
be offered at $5 a share for a total of $20,000,000. The proceeds were
to be used to develop and produce a medium-priced automobile, to
be known as the "Tucker," featuring a rear engine and other innovations substantially departing from present day conventional
design.
Upon examination of the registration statement, the Commission
first authorized a private examination under section 8 (e), and later
instituted stop-order proceedings under section 8 (d), alleging misstatements and omissions to state material facts in regard to numerous
items of required information, financial statements, the accountants'
certificate, certain exhibits and the prospectus.
As a result of these hearings, it appeared that the prospectus and
registration statement as originally filed had failed to disclose adequately and accurately the names of all promoters and the amount of
consideration received directly or indirectly from the company by each
promoter, officer, and director; the stage of development of the mechanical features of the proposed automobile; the status of the company's
patent position; the application of the proceeds of the proposed offering, and the company's working capital requirements; the business experience of the executive officers; the nature and the extent of the interest of Preston Tucker in Ypsilanti Machine & Tool Co. ; the interests
of affiliates and other persons in property acquired by the company;
material litigation ; the scope of the audit and the auditing procedures
followed by the certifying accountants; and the failure of the accounts to reflect all liabilities of the company.
During the course of and after the close of the hearings in the section 8 (d) proceedings, the registrant filed material amendments which
appeared to correct satisfactorily all material deficiencies previously
contained in the registration statement. -
 The Commission thereupon
dismissed the proceedings and issued an opinion commenting, in the
public interest and for the protection of investors, upon certain facts
developed in the proceedings and discussing the Commission's action
in this case and the limitation of its jurisdiction."
In this opinion the
Commission also warned the prospective investor of the danger of
IS

Securities Act Release No. 3236 (1947),

16

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

relying upon past judgments based on prior literature concerning the
Tucker Corp. inasmuch as there had been grossly misleading and, in
many cases, false statements publicized as to the radical features of the
proposed automobile, the accomplishments and the performance of
such automobile, and the funds invested by the management. The
registration statement was permitted to become effective after adequate dissemination of the corrected prospectus had been made and
sufficient time had elapsed since the release of the Commission's
opinion.
Globe Aircraft Oorporation.-File No. U~4.-Globe
Aircraft
Corp. filed a registration statement covering 150,000 shares of 5% percent cumulative convertible preferred stock and sufficient common
shares for conversion purposes. The statement became effective and
the company received the entire proceeds from the sale of the securities. It was represented in the prospectus that the net proceeds of
$1,275,000 to the company would be used for the payment of a $960,000
loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, for the purchase
of a factory building and equipment for $250,000, and the remainder
for working capital and expenses of the issue.
In July 1946 the registrant filed a post-effective amendment which
stated that the company had been negotiating for a commercial loan,
and that the then outstanding RFC loan of approximately $500,000
would be increased to $960,000. The prospectus filed as a part of the
amendment stated that since the effective date of the registration
statement the company had agreed to purchase a factory from the War
Assets Administration for $276,000, and that funds for this purchase
were to be borrowed from the RFC.
On December 27, 1946, certain creditors filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy against the company and on December 31, 1946,
the company filed an answer in the form of a petition for reorganization. The latter petition was dismissed on April 15, 1947, with the
result that the petition for involuntary bankruptcy was reinstated
and receivers were appointed.
The Commission participated in the reorganization proceedings
under chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act. During these proceedings
information was secured which raised serious questions concerning
certain representations made in the registration statement. Stoporder proceedings were initiated on March 25, 1947, pursuant to section 8 (d) of the Securities Act of 1933. The hearing officer in his
recommended decision found that the registration statement included
untrue statements of material facts and omitted material facts required
to be stated therein and material facts necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in respect of: (1) The company's losses
for January 1946; (2) the mcrease in note liabilities after December
31, 1945; (3) the stated purpose of the financing, in particular the
payment of the outstanding RFC loan of $960,000 and the purchase of
the factory building and equipment; and (4) the working capital needs
of the company.
Exceptions to the recommended decision were taken by counsel for
the registrant and by certain other persons granted leave to be heard
in the proceedings. Oral argument was heard by the Commission
June 25, 1947, on the exceptions. A decision by the Commission had
not been rendered by the close of the fiscal year. Investors have

THffiTEENTH

17

manifested much interest in this case. A civil suit in the nature of a
class suit was instituted against the underwriters in April 1947, alleging misrepresentations in the registration statement.
Haye8 ManujMturing
Oorp.-File No. ~-6179.-The company filed
a registration statement covering 215,000 shares of its $2 par common
stock (later reduced to 185,000 Shares). The stock was to be issued
first to Eli I. Kleinman, Jennis M. Doroshaw, Johann S. Ackerman
and associates in exchange for all the outstanding 432,000 shares of
common stock of American Engineering Co. The Commission directed that a public examination be held under section 8 (e) and later
instituted stop-order proceedings under section 8 (d), alleging misstatements and omissions of material facts in numerous items, the
financial statements, the accountants' certificate, certain exhibits, and
the prospectus. By successive material amendments filed after institution of proceedings, the registrant corrected the existence of substantial deficiencies in the registration statement. Inasmuch as the
amendments corrected substantially all of the material deficiencies, the
Commission determined it was unnecessary to issue a stop order and
the registration statement was permitted to become effective,"
Kleinman, Doroshaw, and Ackerman and their associates planned
to sell the 185,000 shares of Hayes stock to the public and, since they
were acquiring securities of the issuer with a view to immediate distribution, they were underwriters as defined by section 2 (11) of the
Securities Act of 1933. This fact was not disclosed in the original
filing. Furthermore, the costs and profits of these individuals as
well as other pertinent items of information were not disclosed. As
a result of the proceedings instituted by the Commission, the registration statement was amended to set forth numerous transactions as
a result of which Kleinman and his associates were shown to have
acquired the 432,000 shares of capital stock of American Engineering
for a total of $17,000. Through various transactions between January 1943 and March 1946 they realized gross profits in the amount
of approximately $585,000, and the value of the Hayes stock, based
on an assigned value of $12 a share, amounted to an additional
$2;580,000, reflecting a total of $3,148,000 which they stood to profit by
the transactions.
With the reduction in the number of shares to be
received to 185,000, their total realizable profits were reduced by
approxirnately $360,000.
The registration statement as filed also failed to disclose certain
material facts with respect to Federal income tax liabilities of American Engineering and agreements with respect thereto. The original
filing moreover did not disclose that American Engineering and its
subsidiary would need approximately $1,600,000 within the ensuing
6 months to meet current obligations and provide additional working
capital, which funds were to be obtained primarily from Hayes. Information concerning remuneration payments to Clark, president of
Hayes, and certain disputes and a settlement relating thereto, as well
~s the need of Hayes for approximately $2,000,000 of additional workmg capital for its own operations before the end of 1946, were inadequately set forth in the original registration statement.
Besides,
that document did not indicate that since the date of the latest profit
and loss statements filed both Hayes and American Engineering had
14

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

been operating at a loss. It failed to reveal a possible contingent liability of Hayes for the sale of 100,000 shares of its stock in violation
of section 5 (b) of the Securities Act. Other deficiencies of lesser
importance also existed in the registration statement as originally
filed.
Kiwago Gold Mines Limited-File No. ~85~.-The
registration
statement filed by Kiwago Gold Mines Limited (a Manitoba corporation) on December 3, 1946, became effective on February 4, 1947, as
of January 7, 1947. The 1,000,000 shares of common stock covered
by the statement were offered to the public at 70 cents per share
through an underwriter (Jack Cohn Co. of New York City) acting
as agent for the registrant on a "best efforts" basis. The registrant's
capitalization as of October 1, 1946, consisted of an authorized 3,000,000 shares of no par value common stock of which 2,000,000 shares
were outstanding.
The registrant is controlled by Transcan Investors Limited (an Ontario corporation) which owns approximately 31 percent of its voting
securities. In addition, as of September 28, 1946, C. E. Hepburn
& Co. (of which Louis Cadesky is the sole owner) owned beneficially
approximately 14 percent of the registrant's voting securities.
Messrs. A. J. McLaren, Louis Cadesky, and H. T. Leslie, who comprise
a majority of the registrant's board of directors, also promoted Transcan and control it by their ownership of 57.47 percent of that corporation's voting securities, Louis Cadesky being the largest holder with
28.91 percent. Within the preceding 2 years 779,000 shares of the
registrant's common stock had been purchased by Transcan at an
average price of approximately 12lh cents per share and sold to C. E.
Hepburn & Co. at cost.
On April 16, 1947, the Commission's attention was directed to an
advertisement in The Northern Miner, a Canadian publication which
is circulated in this country, with respect to an offering of shares of
the registrant by C. E. Hepburn & Co. The advertisement contained
the statement that "1,000,000 shares of Kiwago Gold Mines, Limited
have been registered with the SEC in the United States for sale to the
American public." No statement was made as to the offering price
of the registrant's stock. At the same time the Commission was informed that it was believed that the shares were being offered in
Canada at a price substantially below the 70 cents per share offering
price in the United States.
As a result of inquiries then made by the Commission, it was ascertained that only two sales of the registered stock had been made
in the United States, each involving 1,000 shares at the stated offering
price of 70 cents per share, whereas from December 17, 1946, to May
10,1947, C. E. Hepburn & Co. had sold in Canada 178,000 shares of
the registrant's stock at prices ranging from 10 cents to 40 cents per
share. It was also noted that between December 3, 1946, the day the
statement was originally filed, and February 4, 1947, the date on
which it became effective, approximately 40 separate sales involving
70,000 of these shares were made in Canada at prices ranging from 10
cents to 35 cents per share. During this period the registrant apparently had in mind offering the shares in this country at 70 cents per
share, since this price was indicated in the original filing.

THIRTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

19

The prospectus in the registration statement as of its effective date
contains no reference to actual or proposed sales of the registrant's
stock in Canada by C. E. Hepburn & Co. or by any officer, director
or associate of the registrant.
Since it appeared that the omission
of such information was materially misleading, the Commission instituted stop-order proceedings under section 8 (d).
Red Bank Oil Oompany-File N 08. ~-5754 and 1-34J3.-A stop-order
proceeding under section 8 (d) relating to the registration statement
of Red Bank Oil Co. was consolidated with a proceeding with regard
to the termination of exchange listing under section II) (a) (2) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 because of numerous common
questions of fact involved. On January 4, 1946, the Commission
found that the auditor was not independent and the audits had not
been made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
applicable in the circumstances,"
The financial statements originally
filed were the subject of the Commission's findings and opinion dated
January 3, 1947, in which it was found that numerous inaccuracies and
omissions were present in financial statements for the years 1940-44.16
The deficiencies found were principally the failure to disclose transactions between Frank W. Bennett and interests affiliated with him on
the one hand, and Red Bank and its subsidiaries on the other j failure
to disclose the amounts owing to and from the affiliated Bennett interests j failure to disclose the materiality of l?ledges and other liens
to which assets were subject; and numerous misstatements of income,
the most outstanding example occurring for the year 1943, when various inaccuracies produced an apparent consolidated profit of $173,401)
although revised statements subsequently filed by amendment showed
a net loss of $4,436.
A stop-order was issued by the Commission on February 27, 1947,
based upon the financial statements referred to above and upon
numerous other omissions, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies in the
registration statement and prospectus,"
The findings and opinion
which accompanied the stop-order found that omissions, inaccuracies,
and inconsistencies concerned, among other things, control of the
company j the business and property of the company and its subsidiaries j the capital stock j the underwriting and distribution of the
securities sought to be registered j acquisitions of various properties j
remuneration of officers; principal holdings of securities j the interest
of affiliates in property acquired j and recent sales of securities. It
was concluded that the registration statement as a whole was materially misleading.
The stop-order was still in effect at the close
of the fiscal year.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
DISCLOSURES RESULTING
REGISTRATION

FROM EXAMINATION
STATEMENTS

OF

The following brief histories are illustrative of disclosures that
were made after the staff had examined the registration statements
and prospectuses involved.
Profitable

Inside Dealings With Aftiliated Companies

Two affiliated companies owned a controlling interest in a registrant,
a manufacturer of automobiles, and the controlling persons of such
affiliated companies were also officers and directors of the registrant.
The registration statement disclosed that the registrant had: (1)
Entered into an agreement to purchase from one of the affiliated companies all of the stock of a subsidiary of that affiliate, and (2) proposed
to purchase certain land and buildmgs from said affiliate. The staff
of the Commission requested that disclosure be made in the registration statement of the contract sale price of the stock, land, and buildings to the registrant, their cost to the affiliate, the date of acquisition by the latter, and the profits to be realized by the affiliate from the
transaction.
As a result, it was disclosed that the controlling affiliate
realized a profit of $2,893,270.17 on an investment of $770,000 allocated
cost from the sale of the stock of its wholly owned subsidiary, and
$297,082.37 from the sale of the land and buildings.
Gross Omission of Material Facts

Some months prior to the filing of a registration statement by a
mining company, the registrant had filed a letter of notification and
sales literature under the conditional exemption from registration provided by regulation A for issues of not more than $300,000. The
representations in the sales literature were of such character that an
investigation was made. The company's engineer testified that no
known tin or other ore bodies existed on the property and that a gold
assay referred to in the literature was taken from a property other
than that belonging to the registrant.
Shortly after this testimony
was given, the principal promoter of the registrant advised the Commission that he had been misled by the engineer and was discharging
him immediately. Despite the foregoing, the registration statement as
subsequently filed contained reports by the same engineer and the same
failure to make adequate disclosure of the material facts referred to
above. Among numerous other discrepancies was a statement to the
effect that a certain accountant had gone over the financial schedules
submitted. The Commission brought injunction proceedings in this
case, and the accountant in question testified that he had not reviewed
such schedules. Stop-order proceedings under section 8 (d) were
instituted and hearings commenced. The registrant thereafter requested withdrawal of its registration statement.
Importance

of Disclosure to Underwritel'8

Inone case the registrant was only in the promotional stage, having
no physical plant, no production machinery, and no established commercial acceptance for its proposed products.
After allowing 25
percent for discounts or commissions to an underwriter, it proposed
to use the funds obtained to erect a plant and equip it with the necessary machinery. The staff's letter of comment resulted in the amend-

THffiTEENTH

21

ANNUAL REPORT

ment of the prospectus to disclose, first, that governmental wartime
tests of certain of the proposed products cast considerable doubt upon
the feasibility of the venture, and, second, that the nature of the
underwriting arrangements was such that it was wholly conjectural
whether the company would obtain enough funds from the financing
to commence business properly. Although the registration statement
became effective, the underwriter on the following day informed the
Commission's staff in effect that when he became aware of hitherto
unknown facts disclosed in the company's final prospectus, he decided
to abandon the underwriting.
The registration statement was withdrawn. The underwriter stated in a letter to the Commission: ''This
incident confirms my opinion that the SEC is as much a help to the
dealer as it is to the public."
Relative Investment Positions of Public and Promoters

The significance of disclosure is often lost in lengthy and complex
presentations of adverse facts. The Commission frequently obtains
a sharpening of disclosure by requesting that information be stated
simply, summarized, or presented in tabular form. The following
table was substituted, at the request of the Commission, for lengthy
textual material which tended to conceal the information so clearly
brought out in the table:

on Stock Resales

A company manufacturing electrical J?arts registered 7,500 shares
of class A stock to be offered to the public at $101 per share. At the
same time it granted the promoters and managers the right to purchase, at $1 per share, a share of class B stock for each share of class A
outstanding, up to 20,000 shares. By amendment obtained by the
Commission it was pointed out in a prominent part of the prospectus
that
by the purchase of shares of Class B Stock under the above conditions, the members of the management of the Corporation will be given at a nominal cost the
opportnnity (1) "to maintain control of the Oorporattton, including the power to
sell, lease or exchange alI of the property and assets of the Corporation, (2) to
share equally in all profits in excess of the dividend requirements of the Class A
Stock, and (3) to share equally in all assets in excess of the Itquldattng preference of the Class A Stock.

In the same case proper prominence was required for disclosure of
the fact that the class A stock being offered to the public had a limited transferability.
A stockholder wishing to dispose of any such
shares would be required first to offer them to the corporation for a
60-day period at the involuntary liquidation value of the stock. If
such offer were not accepted, the stockholder could then sell the shares.
However, if the shares were not sold within the next 30 days the cycle
of first offering the shares to the corporation would have to be repeated. Any purchaser of the stock would become subject to the same
restrictions on transfer. The company was required to point out that

22

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the restrictions place a limitation on price appreciation of shares and
may prevent a quick sale by a stockholder needing immediate funds.
Speculative Hazards of Stock Issue

.At the request of the Commission a registrant manufacturing a food
products specialty disclosed the following information under a headmg which it labeled "Speculative Nature and Hazards of the Offering": (1) Although founded in 1943 it was seeking working capital
for what amounted to a new peacetime enterprise, since substantially
all of its sales up to the time it filed its registration statement had been
made to agencies of the Government and such sales had terminated;
(2) the business was not subject to patent protection and anyone could
employ its processes; (3) simultaneously with the offering of shares
to raise working capital for the company, its two stockholders were
selling to the public for $600,000one-third of their own holdings (with
a book value of $13,803) at a profit of $583,000, and their total profit,
including retained stock at the public offering price, would be $1,749,000; (4) solely as a result of the financing, the book value of the stock
would be increased from 14 cents a share to $2.72 a share, the increase
inuring to the benefit of the selling stockholders with respect to the
200,000shares of stock to be retained by them; and (5) the two selling
stockholders, constituting two of the four directors, also occupied the
positions of president and vice president of the company, the latter
officer was additionally the president of the underwriting firm which
was offering the issue, and the former had entered into a management
contract with the registrant.
Speculative Nature of Venture Spelled Out

Factors relating to the speculative nature of the securities of a
company proposing to produce and sell a special type of fuel were
summarily stated in the registration statement. It was brought out
at the instance of the Commission that: (1) The company was in the
development stage, that production was not possible until completion
of its plant, and that there would be no assurance of the date of completion, particularly inasmuch as the underwriter had not contracted
to purchase the entire stock issue but only to use his best efforts to
sell it for the company; (2) the company proposed to use a process
that had not been demonstrated to be feasible on a commercial basis
as applied to the raw material which it would use, and the only other
company in the United States using this process was an admitted
financial failure; (3) as to the process it would use, the company was
nothing more than a nonexclusive licensee of six patents, four of which
had expired; (4) the company would be in competition in a limited
geographical market with other fuels sold by established companies
possessing greater financial resources; (5) the company had net
tangible assets of less than $10,000 and no prospect of Income at least
until the completion of the contemplated construction program, yet
it was offering a fixed interest security as well as common stock;
(6) the promoters paid $1.25 a share Tor their common stock shortly
before the proposed offering to the public to be made at $3.75 a share;
(7) the net tangible asset value of the promoters' stock would be
increased, solely as a result of the public financing, from 20 cents per
share immediately preceding such financing to $5.09 per share Immediately thereafter; and (8) the company had entered into ali engi-

THffiTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

23

neering contract and a 5-year management contract with a firm with
which two of the promoters of the company were associated, under
which contracts the company agreed to pay $90,000 as a maximum
engineering fee and $50,000 as a minimum annual management fee.
Impact of Domestic and Foreign Law on Company's Operations

In order to clarify the more important elements of risk in a proposed offering of securities, the Commission requested a foreign airline corporation to disclose in an introductory section to the prospectus,
among other factors, that: (1) A permit to operate in the United
States would not be issued until after a determination by the Civil
Aeronautics Board that the registrant had met the required standards
as to operational ability and percentage of ownership of the registrant's shares by citizens of the foreign country; (2) failure to obtain
any of the necessary operating permits would adversely affect the
competitive position of the registrant and, in addition, that substantial competition existed or was to be expected in an important
segment of the registrant's route; and (3) based on the number of
shares being offered and already sold, it would be necessary to sell
large additional amounts of the registrant's capital stock in order that
the required percentage of its capital should be owned by citizens of
the foreign country. In the event that the required percentage was
not secured thereby, it would be necessary to curtail sales of capital
stock in the United States and Canada with the consequent curtailment of proposed operations.
Liabilities Under Employees' Retirement Plan

A leading oil refining and distributing enterprise filed a registration
statement for a public distribution of some 400,000shares owned by
certain of its controlling stockholders. The offer, to be made at the
market price, amounted to some $27,000,000. The statement failed to
show the inescapable liability already incurred by the company under
its employees' "Annuities and Benefits Plan," adopted in 1944, to
the extent of about $4,000,000on account of retired employees, and
also omitted any disclosure of an actuarial deficiency in the plan to
the even greater extent of about $40,000,000on account of employees
still working for the corporation. The $40,000,000liability of the
company could be avoided only if its employees left their jobs otherwise than by retirement, or through action by the company abolishing
the plan. As a result of questions raised by the Commission and conferences held by the staff with representatives of the registrant, it was
disclosed by amendment that, as of December 31, 1945, $44,018,153
remained unpaid on account of prior service annuities and that, if
payments were continued on the same basis followed since the inception of the plan, this amount would be paid in approximately equal
mstallments through 1953.
CHANGES IN RULES, REGULATIONS, AND FORMS

The necessity that rules, regulations, and forms adopted under the
Securities Act be flexible to meet changing business conditions had
early been recognized by the Commission. Experience has also shown
that any procedure for compliance with a regulatory statute is made

24

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

most simple and expedient for those who must comply if each type
of situation is recognized and provision made for its particular need.
The Commission, therefore, has adopted many rules under the several acts which it administers, and has adopted numerous forms for
compliance with the requirements of these acts. Although these may
seem confusing at first glance, it has been amply demonstrated that a
specific registrant under the Securities Act, for example, finds that he
encounters the least problems and is best able to comply with the registration requirements because his situation has been anticipated and
covered by the rules. No one registrant must comply with all the rules
or use all the forms. .
Rules and forms must be changed, obsolete procedures rescinded
and new ones adopted as changing conditions require. Changes may
be made as a result of recommendations by the staff, and many changes
have been made at the suggestion of persons who must comply with
the requirements of a particular statute. No material change is made
without a series of conferences with all persons interested or who
might be affected by such change. Changes made during the 1947
fiscal year in the rules, regulations, and forms under the Securities
Act are described below.
Rule I3l-The

Red-Herring Prospectus

As has been pointed out, the Securities Act provides a 20-day wait.
ing period before a registration statement becomes effective in order
to insure that the information contained in the registration statement
will become known to the investing public before the securities are
offered for sale. The degree to which this information is circulated
is of the utmost importance to the accomplishment of the purposes of
the act. It is to be recalled, too, that one of the criteria to be observed
before acceleration of the effective date may be granted by the Commission is the adequacy of the information available to the public
at the time when acceleration is requested.
This need for the adequate dissemination of information about a
security during the waitin~ period was recognized both by the Commission and the securities industry early in the history of the Securities Act, and a practice developed to make such dissemination of information. The prospectus which is to be used to offer the security
for sale is prepared and filed with the registration statement. It
cannot be used to offer the security for sale until the registration statement becomes effective, but if adequately prepared is an excellent
source of public information about the proposed issue.
The Commission approved this use of the prospectus in advance
of effectiveness as a source of information only and not as a method
of offering the security for sale. To insure that the nature of the
prospectus should not be misunderstood when used in this way, and
therefore possibly lead to a violation of the act, a legend was printed
across the facing sheet of the prospectus to the effect that the prospectus was being circulated at the time for information purposes
only and not to offer the security for sale. This legend was normally
printed in red ink, and the prospectus which was so used during the
20-day waiting period became known as the "red-herring" prospectus:
Within the recent past the use of "red-herrings" diminished substantially. Various reasons were ascribed. among others that the
liability of those who used red-herrings was doubtful, notwithstanding

THmTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

25

repeated interpretations by the Commission as to the legality of their
use.
In order to remove this obstacle the Commission availed itself of
the provisions of section 19 (a). The pertinent part of that section is:
No provision of [the Securities Act] imposing any liability shall apply
to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule or
regulation of the Commission • . .

The Commission adopted rule 131 under the Securities Act to afford
the protection of section 19 to the use of the red-herring prospectus."
In substance, the rule provides that the use of a red-herring prospectus shall not constitute an offer to sell the security under the followmg conditions:
(1) The red-herring prospectus must be a copy of the prospectus
proposed to be used to offer the security for sale and must have been
filed as part of the registration statement;
(~) The red-herring prospectus must contain substantially the information required by the Act and the rules and regulations to be
contained in a final prospectus except that it may omit certain specified
matters not ascertainable at the time the red-herring prospectus is
used;
(3) The red-herring prospectus must contain, on each page2 a
statement set forth in the rule to the effect that the red-herring
prospectus is for information purposes only, that the registration
statement has not yet become effective, and that an offer to sell the
security can and would be made only by use of the final prospectus
after the effective date of the registration statement.
In its announcement of the adoption of rule 131, the Commission
stated that the adequacy of distribution of the red-herring prospectus
would be considered in determining whether to grant a request for
acceleration of the effective date of the registration statement. At
the same time, the Commission reaffirmed its policy to refuse acceleration where a materially deficient or inadequate red-herring prospectus had been distributed until such time as corrected information
had been communicated to the persons who had received such redherring prospectuses,"
Forms 8-1, A-I, and A-2-Registration

of Securities

Form 8-1 is the form most-generally used in registering securities.
It represents a simplification of Forms A-I and A-2, the forms
most generally used prior to the adoption of Form 8-1. On January
8, 19471 a further simplified version of Form 8-1 was adopted.
Originally, Form 8-1 was divided into two parts. Part I called
for information required to be included in the prospectus and Part
II called for information
required to be included in the
registration statement but which could, for the most part, be omitted
from the prospectus.
The revision abolished this division and
eliminated from the form proper all items calling for information
not required to be set forth in the prospectus. The purpose of this
revision was, first, to eliminate a number of requirements which experience had shown did not produce information essential to the
prospective investor's appraisal of the security, and second, at the
.. SecUrities Act Release No. 3177 (1946). Originally adopted for a 6-month trial period
beginning December 6, 1946, the rnIe was continued in e«ect shortl7 after the close of the
1947 fiscal year .
.. Previously announced in Securities Act Release No. 3061 (19411).

26

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

same time to clarify the requirements of the form in certain limited
respects.
Some of the principal changes made were:
(1) Elimination of the description of capital securities other than
those being registered;
(2) Substitution of limited information as to underwriting contracts for the complete outline theretofore required;
(3) Elimination of information about patents as a separate item;
(4) Consolidation of the items as to information about security
holdings;
(5) Elimination of historical financial information from the prospectus, and from the registration statement if the information has
previously been filed with the Commission.
With this revision, Forms A-I and A-2 no longer served any useful
function ana they were rescinded.
Regulation C--Rules Governing Registration

Inthe last month of the fiscal year the Commission adopted a revised
regulation C, that portion of the General Rules and Regulations under
the Securities Act which deals with registration and the registration
procedure. This regulation is the complement of the various registration forms under that act. The revision eliminated a great deal of
material which had become obsolete and reorganized the remaining
rules in a manner intended to facilitate the registration of securities
according to the simplified procedure provided by the Commission's
recently revised Form S-1. In fact, the revised regulation extended
the simplified procedure to registration statements filed on any form
under the act, whether the form itself provides such procedure or
not. Certain rules which specify the items of information required to
be included in a prospectus were transferred from regulation C to the
respective forms to which they relate.
Rules Adopted in Connection With the International Bank

The formation of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development necessitated the adoption of special rules to facilitate
its operations and to clarify certain procedures under the several acts
administered by the Commission as they apply to the Bank. These
new rules are included in the discussion of the Bank which appears
on page 141.
Supplement S-T

During the year the Commission adopted various amendments of
a minor nature including two relating to Supplement S-T, the document containing special Items of information required in the case of
securities being registered under the Securities Act which are to be
issued under an indenture that must be qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939.
INJUNCTION ACTIONS INSTITUTED UNDER THE ACI'

Under the Securities Act the Commission's enforcement activity is
concerned generally with the obtaining of full disclosure, by means
of the registration process, of all pertinent data concerning securities

THIRTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

27

publicly offered for sale, and with the prevention of fraud in the sale
of securities. Section 5 of the act, with certain exceptions," requires
registration with the Commission of all securities publicly offered for
sale, and section 17 makes it unlawful by use of the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce to employ any fraudulent scheme or
device, to make any misrepresentation, or to omit to state any material
fact in connection with the sale of any security. During the past year
the Commission has instituted civil litigation in a number of cases to
prevent violations of the requirements of these provisions of the act.
A great part of the Commission's civil litigation has arisen through
the enforcement of these sections. In S. E. O. v. Slocaai Oharleston
Mining 00. Ltd., 21 S. E. O. v. Sterling, Inc., 22 S. E. O. v, Vindicator
Silver Lead Mining 00./3 S. E. O. v, Nevada lVabash Mining 00.,24
S. E. O. v, J. Stacy Henderson, Mid-Oontinent Development 00./" and
S. E. O. v, Bennett S. Dennison and W. W. Patty,26 the Commission obtained final judgments restraining the defendants from further violations of the registration provisions of section 5. In the cases of S. E. O.
v. Sandy Boy Mines and Lena M. Little 27 and S. E. O. v. Oarroll I,
Mitchell, Rangel,!! Petroleum, Inc.,23 the Commission obtained final
judgments restraming the defendants from further violations of the
fraud provisions of section 17.
In addition to the foregoing, in the cases of S. E. O. v. Walter J.
Porteous." S. E. O. v, Edward J. suu» and S. E. O. v. Western
Tin Mining Oorporatioa and Marion Allen,31 the Commission obtained
final judgments restraining the defendants from further violations of
both the registration provisions (section 5) and the fraud provisions
(section 17) of the Securities Act.
When consideration is given to the number and scope of the acts administered by the Commission it is not surprising to discover that
some of its civil litigation concerns itself with more than one of such
acts. For example, in the cases of S. E. O. v. Joseph J. LeDone 32 and
S. E. O. v. Standard Oil Oompany of Kansas and Oharles B. Wrigktsman,33both the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 were involved. In the LeDone case, the defendant was a
broker-dealer in securities and was duly registered with the Commission as such under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. LeDone's
principal business consisted of the sale of oil royalties. It was developed that the price to purchasers exceeded the amount of the then
current value of the estimated recoverable oil by 50 percent, so that
Secs. 3 and 4 contain the exceptions.

in no event could the purchaser reasonably expect to recover even
the amount of the purchase price. The evidence disclosed that LeDone
had represented that these investments would return a sum substantially greater than the purchase price. Based on this evidence the
Oommission sought to enjoin LeDone from further violation of the
fraud provisions of both the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act,3~inasmuch as he was a registered broker-dealer under the
latter act.
During the past year litigation was concluded in Penfield v.
8.E.0.35 and in 8.E.0. v, Vaeuum Oan 00.,36which arose out of requests
by the Commission for enforcement of its subpenas. In the Penfield
case, the defendant refused to comply with the Commission's subpena
even after a district court had directed compliance, a circuit court had
affirmed the district court's order, and the Supreme Court had denied
certiorari/"
On an appeal in contempt proceedings instituted by the
Commission, the Supreme Court held that the Commission was entitled
to such a decree holding the defendant in contempt as would coerce
the production of the records sought to be examined. In the
Vaewum Oan case the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit dismissed an appeal from a district court order directing the
production of certain books and records in compliance with a subpena
issued by the Commission. The appeal was grounded upon an asserted constitutional right in the corporate defendant to refrain from
producing certain records whose relevancy to the investigation being
conducted by the Commission was questioned. The court held that
the appeal was so clearly without merit that it must have been taken
for the purpose of delay.
The appellate courts were also petitioned in Orooker v. 8.E.0.38 to
review a so-called order of the Commission consenting to the filing of
amendments to a registration statement as of an earlier date and thus,
by the automatic operation of section 8 (a) of the Securities Act,
accelerating the effective date of the registration statement. The
Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit dismissed the petition
for review on the grounds that: (1) The petitioner was not a
"person aggrieved" since he appeared in the proceedings as attorney
for an undisclosed principal and declined to advance any substantial
basis for not revealing the name of his client; and (2) the action of
the Commission was not reviewable.

PART II
ADMINISTRATION

OF

THE SECURITIES
OF 1934

EXCHANGE

ACT

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is designed to eliminate fraud,
manipulation, and other abuses in the trading of securities both on
the organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets, which
together constitute the Nation's facilities for trading in securities;
to make available to the public information regarding the condition of
corporations whose securities are listed on any national securities
exchange; and to regulate the use of the Nation's credit in securities
trading.
The authority to issue rules on the use of credit in securities transactions is lodged in the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, but the administration of these rules and of the other
provisions of the .Act is vested in the Commission.
The act provides for the registration of national securities exchanges, brokers and dealers in securities, and associations of brokers
and dealers.
REGULATION OF EXCHANGES AND EXCHANGE TRADING
Registration

of Exchanges

Each securities exchange in the United States is required by section
5 of the act to register with the Commission as a national securities
exchange or to apply for exemption from such registration.
Under
this section, exemption from registration is available to exchanges
which have such a limited volume of transactions effected thereon that,
in the opinion of the Commission, it is unnecessary and impracticable
to require their registration.
During the fiscal year the number of
exchanges registered as national securities exchanges remained at 19
and the number of exchanges granted exemption from such registration remained at 5.
The registration or exemption statement of each exchange contains
information pertinent to its organization, rules of procedure, membership and related matters.
In order to keep this information up to
date, the 24 exchanges filed a total of 90 amendments to their statements reflecting changes which had occurred therein during the year.
Each of these amendments was reviewed ~o ascertain that t~e change
involved was not adverse to the public mterest and that It was m
compliance with the relevant regulatory provisions of the act. The
nature of the changes effected by the exchanges in their constitutions,
rules and trading practices varied considerably.
Some of the more
significant of these changes are briefly outlined below:
Philadelphia Stock Exchange adopted a more comprehensive form
of financial questionnaire to be .filedby its member firms doing business
with the public. It amended its rules to include a requirement that
,

29

30

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the answers to this questionnaire be prepared by an independent public
accountant based upon the results of an annual audit of its affairs made
by such an accountant, and that the annual audit be made on a date
selected by the accountant and without prior notice to the member firm.
At the suggestion of the Commission, Boston Stock Exchange,
Philadelphia Stock Exchange, and San Francisco Mining Exchange
each adopted a rule requiring members and member firms to report
to the exchange information regarding substantial options relating
to securities dealt in on their respective exchanges. This action
brought to a total of ten the number of exchanges which have such
a rule in effect.
New York Stock Exchange revised its requirements for listing
shares of companies organized under the laws of countries other than
the United States. The revised requirements incorporate many suggestions which had been received from investment banking, legal, and
accounting firms. This exchange also revised its schedule of listing
fees by eliminating the optional lump-sum method of paying for new
stock issues, and by a reduction of the fee for issues over 2,000,000
shares. Under the revised fee schedule, issuers are charged a small
initial fee and an annual continuing fee for 15 years. During the year
the exchange's board of governors took under consideration a proposal
to permit corporations to become members of the exchange. This was
submitted for membership vote and was rejected on November 20,
1947. The constitution of this exchange was amended to permit.
a group of members by petition to present a desired constitutional
amendment to the exchange's board of governors and whereby such
amendment, within a stated period of time, would be referred to the
membership for vote regardless of whether it had the board's approval. In connection with its efforts to keep holders of securities
and the investing public informed as to the status of listed companies,
this exchange initiated the practice of having the letter "Q" printed
preceding the ticker symbols for securities of companies reported to
the exchange as being in receivership or bankruptcy proceedings.
The recommendation of a special committee of the Association of
Stock Exchange Firms for higher rates of commission was under
consideration by the board of governors of this exchange at the close
of the fiscal year. This recommendation was contained in a report
of the results of a survey of costs and revenues of a group of New York
Stock Exchange member firms which had been prepared by the special
committee and submitted to the board of governors of the exchange
by the Association of Stock Exchange Firms.
New York Curb Exchange's committee on listing modified its policy in considering applications for the listing of stock issues from the
viewpoint of voting rights. Under this modified policy this committee
will not, in broad principle, view favorably applications for the listing of common stocks which are nonvoting or which have unduly restricted voting rights, and nonvoting preferred stocks which do not
acquire voting rights upon specified defaults in the payment of fixed
dividend requirements. This exchange also revised its requirements
for listing shares of companies organized under the laws of countries
other than the United States or the Dominion of Canada, following
similar action taken by New York Stock Exchange as mentioned
above.

THIRTEENTH

31

ANNUAL REPORT

San Francisco Stock Exchange revised its rules to permit members
to effect on the exchange principal transactions wherein the member
or member firm may buy a security from or sell a security to a ciistomer, provided the price is consistent with the exchange market and
that a member of the floor trading committee approves the transaction. Previouly, if a member were offering stock for his account or
for a partner of the firm and an order was received from one of his
customers, the exchange did not allow this transaction to be executed
and recorded on the exchange.
New York Stock Exchange and New York Curb Exchange, following consultations with the Commission, effected modifications in the
rules designed to regulate floor trading on these exchanges.
Standard Stock Exchange of Spokane changed its name to Spokane
Stock Exchange. This change did not effect its status as a registered
exchange.
Disciplinary Actions by Exchanges Against Members

Pursuant to a request of the Commission, each national securities
exchange reports to the Commission whenever it takes action of a
disciplinary nature against one of its members or an employee of a
member for violation of the Securities Exchange Act, any rule or
regulation thereunder, or of any exchange rule. Five exchanges reported having taken such action against a total of 46 members,
member firms, and partners or employees of member firms during the
year.
In a number of these cases the disciplinary action involved merely
censuring an individual or firm for an infraction of the rules and
issuing a warning that a further infraction would be dealt with more
severely. The more important of the other actions taken included
fines ranging from $25 to $2,500 in 22 cases, with total fines imposed aggregating $19,875; the cancelation of the registration of a specialist;
the cancelation of the registration of a registered representative of a
member firm; and the temporary suspension of a partner of a member
firm. These disciplinary actions resulted from violations of various
exchange rules, principally those pertaining to margin trading, floor
trading, handling of orders, partnership agreements, capital requirements, registered employees and specialists,
Market Value and Volume of Exchange Trading

The market value of total sales on national securities exchanges for
the 1947 fiscal year, as shown in appendix table 7, amounted to $14,790,928,000, a decrease of 27.4 percent from the market value of total
sales for the 1946 fiscal year. Of this total, stock sales had a market
value of $13,733,163,000 (excluding sales of rights and warrants),
a decrease of 27.5 percent from 1946, and bond sales that of $973,725,000, a decrease of 28.3 percent from 1946. The market value of
sales of rights and warrants totaled $84,040,000, involving 44,203,000
~~

The volume of stock sales, excluding right and warrant sales, for
the 1947 fiscal year totaled 552,774,000 shares, a decrease of 33.1 percent from 1946. Total principal amount of bond sales was $1,350,158,000,a decrease of 24.3 percent from 1946.

.

32

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The market value of total sales on all exempted exchanges for the
11147fiscal year amounted to $11,437,000, a decrease of 22.6 percent
from 1946. Further details are given in appendix table 7.
Special Offerin&ts on Exchanges

Under rul'e X-10B-2, special offerings of blocks of securities are
permitted to be effected on national securities exchanges pursuant
to plans filed with and declared effective by the Commission. Briefly
stated, these plans provide that a special offering may be made when
it has been determined that the auction market on the floor of the
exchange cannot absorb a particular block of a security within a
reasonable period of time without undue disturbance to the current
price of the security. A special offering of a security is made at a fixed
price consistent with the existing auction market price of the security
and members acting as brokers for public buyers are paid a special commission by the seller. Buyers are not charged a commission on their
purchases and obtain the securities at the net price of the offering.
There were no new special offering plans filed or declared effective
during the year. The plans of 7 exchanges, which had previously
been declared effective, remained in effect throughout the year.'
During the year a total of eight special offerings were effected, all
on the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange.
These offerings involved the sale of 104,814 shares of stock with an
aggregate market value of $2,852,000; $68,000 in special commissions
were paid to brokers participating in the offerings. During the precedin~ fiscal year, 49 special offerings involving 622,629 shares of
stock were effected on 4 exchanges. The aggregate market value of
offerings in the preceding year was $21,673,000 and special commissions paid totaled $340,000. Further details are given in appendix
table 8.

REGISTRATION

OF SECURITIES

Purpose and Nature of Registration

ON EXCHANGES

of Securities on Exchanges

Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act forbids trading in an,y
security on a national securities exchange unless the security is registered or exempt from registration.
The purpose of this provision is
to make available to investors reliable and comprehensive information
regarding the affairs of the issuing company by requirin~ an issuer
to file WIth the Commission and the exchange an application for
registration disclosing pertinent information regarding the issuer and
its securities. A companion provision contained in section 13 of the
act requires the filing of annual, quarterly, and other periodic reports to keep this information up-to-date. These applications and
reports must be filed on forms prescribed by the Commission as appropriate to the class of issuer or security involved.
Examination

of Applications and Reports

All applications and reports filed pursuant to sections 12 and 13
are examined by the staff to determine whether accurate and adequate
disclosure has been made of the specific types of information required
• These exchanges are: Chicago Stock Exchange, Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Detroit
Stock Exchange, New York Curb Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, Philadelphia Stock
Exchange. and San Francisco Stock Exchange.

THIRTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORll'

by the act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
The examination under the Securities Exchange Act, like that under
the Securities Act of 1933, does not involve an appraisal and is not
concerned with the merits of the registrant's securities. When examination of an application or a report discloses that material information has been omitted, or that sound principles have not been followed
in the preparation and presentation of accompanying financial data,
the examining staff follows much the same procedure as that developed
in its work under the Securities Act in sending to the registrant a
letter of comment, or in holding a conference with its attorneys or
accountants or other representatives, pointing out any inadequacies in
the information filed in order that necessary correcting amendments
may be obtained. Here again, amendments are examined in the same
manner as the original documents. Where a particular inadequacy is
not material, the registrant is notified by letter pointing out the defect
and suggesting the proper procedure to be followed in the preparation
and filing of future reports, without insistence upon the filing of an
amendment to the particular document in question.
Statistics of Securities Registered on Exchanges

At the close of the fiscal year, 2,215 issuers had 3,560 security issues
listed and registered on national securities exchanges. These securities consisted of 2,562 stock issues aggregating 2,655,064,350 shares,
and 998 bond issues aggregating $18,426,753,851 principal amount.
During the past year 88 new issuers registered securities under the
act on national securities exchanges, while the registration of all
registered securities of 61 issuers was terminated. Thus there was a
net increase of 27 in the number of issuers having securities registered
under the act during the year.

the listing and registration of securities on national securities exchanges during the past year:

TEMPORARY

EXEMPTION

OF SUBSTITUTED
SECURITIES

OR ADDITIONAL

Rule X.12A-5 provides a temporary exemption from the registration
requirements of section 12 (a) of the act to securities issued in substitution for, or in addition to, securities previously listed or admitted
to unlisted trading privileges on a national securities exchange. The
purpose of this exemption is to enable transactions to be lawfully
effected on an exchange in such substituted or additional securities
pending their registration or admission to unlisted trading privileges
on an exchange.
The exchanges filed notifications of the admission to trading under
this rule with respect to 151 issues during the year. The same issue

34

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

was admitted to trading on more than one exchange in some instances,
so that the total admissions to such trading, including duplications,
numbered 177.
Proceedings Under Section 19 (a) (2)

Section 19 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act authorizes the
Commission to deny, suspend the effective date of, suspend for a
period not exceeding 12 months, or to withdraw the registration of
a security if the Commission finds, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of such security has failed to comply
with any provision of the act or the rules and regulations thereunder.
Three proceedings were pending under this section at the beginning
of the year. During the year one additional proceeding was instituted.
The registration of the securities of one issuer was ordered suspended,
and the proceedings in three cases were dismissed during the year,
so that there were no proceedings pending at the close of the year.
UNLISTED TRADING PRIVILEGES

ON EXCHANGES

2

The early stock exchanges permitted trading in whatever securities
were available. Any member could have any security added to those
traded on the exchange merely by requesting its inclusion among the
issues which in those days were called out one at a time for bids and
offers. With the development of the exchanges as important securities
markets, the rules for adding stocks and bonds to the list became more
stringent, reaching the point where formal listing agreements and
considerable financial information were required of the corporations
whose issues were being listed. The practice continued, however, of
permitting securities to be traded at the request of exchange members
without the desire or agreement of the issuers. Such trading became
known as "unlisted trading." None of it occurs on New York Stock
Exchange. Most of the unlisted trading in issues which are nowhere
listed occurs on New York Curb Exchange. Most of the regional
exchanges confine their unlisted trading to issues listed on other
exchanges plus a few of the leading unlisted New York Curb Exchange stocks. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits the
admission of any additional securities to unlisted trading on a stock
exchange unless they are already listed on some registered exchange
or unless investors have, respecting such securities, protections equivalent for those provided for in the act regarding listed securities.
Unlisted Trading on Registered Exchanges

At the close of the fiscal year, 541 listed stock issues aggregating
1,431,484,853shares were admitted to unlisted trading on one or more
exchanges other than those on which they were listed and 366 stock
issues aggregating 362,908,213 shares, not listed on any registered
exchanges, were admitted to unlisted trading.
The number of listed stock issues traded unlisted on other exchanges
is about the same as it was 10 years ago, when it stood at 554, but the
dispersion among exchanges is considerably greater. For example,
one stock listed on 2 exchanges has been admitted to unlisted tradmg
on 10 other exchanges, 5 of them since 1937.
• For comprehensIve data with respect to the status of Issues on exchanges, see appendIx
tables 12 through 19.

THIRTEENTH

AN NUAL

REPORT

35

The number of stock issues not listed on any exchange which were
nevertheless admitted to unlisted trading has decreased over 50 percent during the decade, from the 737 shown on p. 25 of our Third
Annual Report to the current 366. The principal causes of this decrease were the listing of previously unlisted issues, retirement of
New York Real Estate Exchange and Chicago Curb Exchange, retirement of preferred stocks, expiration of warrants, and sundry liquidations of companies.
Of the 366 stock issues (including 4 warrant issues) admitted only
to unlisted trading, 291 were on New York Curb Exchange only, 13
were on that exchange and one or more exchanges outside New York,
and 62 were on the latter (or "regional") exchanges only. Domestic
corporations accounted for 271 of the issues, Canadian corporations
for 65, and 30 were American depositary receipts for shares of foreign
issues. Reported trading volume in the 366 issues for the 1946calendar
year was 53,481,177 shares, warrants, and depositary receipts. This
consisted of 29,658,957shares and 12,921,580warrants in domestic issues; 7,961,740shares in Canadian issues; and 2,938,900American depositary receipts. The 4 warrant issues and 30 American depositary
receipts were exclusively on New York Curb Exchange. Of the
2,938,900 reported trading volume in American depositary receipts,
2,360,100, or 80 percent, were of 1 issue, Burma Corp., Ltd. The
362,908,213shares comprising the 366 issues were about 12 percent of
the entire 3,031,265,525shares admitted to trading on the registered
exchanges.
The decrease in bonds admitted to unlisted trading on the exchanges
over the last decade has been from 42 to 14 issues in the "also listed"
category and from 550 to 97 issues in the "unlisted only" group. The
total of 111 current issues aggregate somewhat less than $1,500,000,000
face value, and 102 of these issues are on New York Curb Exchange.
Applications for Unlisted Trading Privileges

Section 12 (f) (2) of the act provides that, upon application to and
approval by the Commission, a national securities exchange may extend unlisted trading privileges to a security which is listed and
registered on another national securities exchange. Pursuant to this
section, and in accordance with the procedure prescribed by rule
X-12F-l, applications were granted extending unlisted trading
privileges to Boston Stock Exchange with respect to 9 stock issues;
Cincinnati Stock Exchange, 21 stock issues; Detroit Stock Exchange,
27 stock issues; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, 6 stock issues; and
San Francisco Stock Exchange, 8 stock issues and 1 bond issue. Three
of these exchanges were permitted to withdraw applications involving
five stock issues upon being advised that the applications did not meet.
the requirements prescribed by the rule. No applications were filed
durin~ the year under section 12 (f) (3).
Durmg the year the Commission put into effect a simplified procedure to eliminate hearings on applications for unlisted trading
privileges in cases where none of the interested parties or public investors desire a hearing. Upon the filing of an application the Commission now issues a notice which is served on the issuer and the exchanges concerned, published in the Federal Register, and released to
the press for the information of the public. The notice states that
767629-48--4

36

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the Commission will hold a hearing on the matter only if requested by
any interested party. The notice further provides that, if no one
requests a hearing, the application will be determined by the Commission on the basis of the facts stated in the application and on other
information contained in the Commission's files.
Changes in Securities Admitted to Unlisted Trading Privileges

During the year the exchanges filed numerous notifications pursuant
to rule X-12F-2 (a) of changes in the title, maturity, interest rate, par
value, dividend rate, or amount authorized or outstanding of securities admitted to unlisted trading privileges. Where changes of this
nature only are effected in an unlisted security, the altered security is
deemed to be the security previously admitted to unlisted trading
privileges and such privileges are automatically extended to the altered
security. However, when changes more comprehensive than these are
effected in an unlisted security, the exchange is required to file an application with the Commission, pursuant to rule X-12F-2 (b), seeking a determination that the altered security is substantially equivalent to the security previously admitted to unlisted trading privileges.
Applications filed pursuant to this rule were granted by the Commission with respect to one stock issue on Baltunore Stock Exchange,
three stock issues on Boston Stock Exchange, six stock issues on New
York Curb Exchange, and one stock issue on Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange was permitted to withdraw an application involving one stock issue upon being advised by
the Commission that the application would be denied.
DEUSTING

OF SECURITIES FROM EXCHANGES

Securities Delisted by Application

Section 12 (d) of the act provides that upon application by the issuer
or the exchange to the Commission, a security may be removed from
listing and registration on a national securities exchange in accordance with the rules of the exchange and subject to such terms as the
Commission deems necessary for the protection of investors. In accordance with the procedure prescribed by rule X-12D2-1 (b), 18
issues were removed from listing and registration on exchanges during
the year. Of these, 4 issues were removed upon application of their
issuers and the remaining 14 u'pon application of exchanges. In each
of these instances the application was granted without the imposition
of any terms by the Commission.
Of the four issues removed upon application of their issuers, one had
never been actively traded on the exchange involved and the holders
of substantially all of the outstanding shares had assented to the delisting; the issuer of one had been inactive since 1935, a large percentage of the outstanding shares was held by an officer of the company,
and no exchange transactions had occurred in the issue for over 4 years;
the remaining two issues had become verY closely J;1eldand the small
number of shares outstandmg ill public hands did not justify the
continuance of an exchange market.
The removal of the 14 issues u:{lon application of exchanges was
occasioned by various events which had the effect of practically
terminating public interest in the issues involved. These included
situations where the issuer was in the process of liquidation, where the
issue was greatly reduced in the amount outstanding, or where no

THffiTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

37

provision had been made for the issue under a plan of reorganization.
Inone instance the issue had been approved for listing by the exchange
on the condition of submission of evidence of its satisfactory distribution. However, the distribution was not effected and the exchange
never admitted the issue to trading.
Another exchange application was that of the New York Curb
Exchange to strike from listing the $1 par value capital stock of
Standard Silver-Lead Mining Co. This security had been listed and
traded on the exchange since 1911. While small dividends had been
paid as recently as 1937, the company's principal mines had been
closed down and new ventures which it had undertaken had not been
successful, with the result that the corporation had operated at a loss
for the years 1938 to 1945, inclusive. Despite the absence of any
favorable prospects for future earnings or dividends and although
the stock had sold at prices below $1 a share during all the years from
1929 to 1944, it became the subject of wide speculation in 1945 and
1946 and reached a price of $4.25 per share. Since the corporation
was practically dormant and had current liabilities greatly exceeding
its current assets, the exchange felt that it was not in the public interest
to continue the exchange market. The application to strike this
security from listing and registration was granted.
The simplified procedure on unlisted trading applications, described
in the preceding section, is being followed also in suitable delisting
cases.
Securities Delisted by Certification

Securities which have been paid at maturity, redeemed, or retired
in £Ull, or which have become exchangeable for other securities in
substitution therefor, may be removed from listing and registration
on a national securities exchange upon the exchange's filing with the
Commission a certification to the effect that such retirement has occurred. The removal of the security becomes effective automatically
after the interval of time prescribed by rule X-12D2-2 (a). The exchanges filed certifications under this rule effecting the removal of
313 separate issues. In some instances the same issue was removed
from more than one exchange, so that the total number of removals,
including duplications, was 343. Successor issues to those removed
became listed and registered on exchanges in many instances.
In accordance with the provisions of rule X -12D2-1 (d) , New York
Curb Exchange removed eight issues from listing and registration
when they became listed and registered on New York Stock Exchange.
This rule permits a national securities exchange to remove a security
from listing and registration in the event trading therein has been
terminated pursuant to a rule of the exchange which requires such
termination due to the security's becoming listed and registered and
admitted to trading on another exchange. Removal under this rule
is automatic, the exchange being required merely to notify the Commission of the removal.
Securities Removed From Listing on Exempted Exchanges

A securi~ may be removed from listing on an exempted exchange
upon the filing by such exchange of an appropriate amendment to its
exemption statement setting forth a brief statement of the reasons
for the removal.

38

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

During the year two exchanges removed five issues from listing
thereon. Three of these issues had been called for redemption and
two had become exchangeable for new securities under plans of recapitalization.
Exempted Securities Removed From Exchange Trading

During the year New York Stock Exchange removed from trading
two issues which had been temporarily exempted from the registration
requirements of section 12 (a) of the act pursuant to rule X-:f:2A-~.
One of these issues had become exchangeable for cash and other secunties under a plan of reorganization and the other issue had been paid
at maturity.
MANIPULATION

AND STABILIZATION

Manipulation

In its administration of the provisions of the Securities Exchange
Act relating to the manipulation of securities markets, the Commission's policy is to attempt to detect manipulative practices at their inception, before the public has been harmed. At the same time, it
seeks to avoid interfering with the legitimate functioning of the securities markets. In brief, the Commission's investigations in this area
take two forms. The "flying quiz," or preliminary investigation, is
designed to detect and discourage incipient manipulation by a prompt
determination of the reason for unusual market behavior. If a legitimate reason for the activity is uncovered, the case is closed. If
more extended investigation seems required, a formal order is sought
of the Commission under which members of the staff are empowered
to subpena pertinent material and take testimony under oath. These
formal investigations often cover substantial periods of time, and
trading operations involving large quantities of shares are carefully
scrutinized.
The Commission keeps confidential the fact that any security is
under investigation so that the market in the security may not be unduly affected or reflections be unfairly cast upon individuals or firms
whose activities are being investigated. As a result, the Commission
occasionally receives criticism for failing to investigate situations
when, in fact, it is actually engaged in an intensive investigation of
those very matters.

Stabilization

During the 1947 fiscal year the Commission continued the administration of rules X-17A-2 and X-9A6-1. Rule X-17A-2 requires the
filing of detailed reports of all transactions incident to offerings in
respect of which a registration statement has been filed under the
Securities Act of 1933 where any stabilizing operation is undertaken
to facilitate the offering. Rule X-9A6-1 governs stabilizing transactions in securities registered on national securities exchanges, effected to facilitate offerings of securities so registered, in which the
offering prices are represented to be "at the market" or at prices related to market prices.
Of the 567 registration statements filed during the 1947 fiscal year,
317 contained a statement of intention to stabilize to facilitate the
offerings covered by such registration statements.
Because a registration statement sometimes covers more than one class of security,
there were 362 offerings of securities in respect of which a statement
was made as required by rule 827 under the Securities Act to the effect
that a stabilizing operation was contemplated. Stabilizing operations
were actually conducted to facilitate 83 of these offerings. In the case
of bonds, public offerings of $160,942,300 principal amount were stabilized. Offerings of stock issues aggregating 11,870,892 shares and
having an estimated aggregate public offering price of $418,243,102
were also stabilized. In connection with these stabilizing operations
12,103 stabilizing reports were filed with the Commission during the
fiscal year. Each of these reports has been analyzed to determine
whether the stabilizing activities were lawful.
To facilitate compliance with the Commission's rules on stabilizing
and to assist issuers and underwriters to avoid violation of the statutory provisions dealing with manipulation and fraud, many conferences were held with representatives of such issuers and underwriters,
and many written and telephone requests were answered. A total
of 1,531 letters and memoranda of such conference and telephone requests and memoranda to the regional offices of the Commission were
written in connection with the administration and enforcement of the
stabilization and manipulation statutory provisions and regulations.
SECURITY TRANSACTIONS OF CORPORATION INSIDERS

. Sections 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 17 (a) of
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and 30 (f) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 require that corporation "insiders"
file reports of certain transactions in the securities of their companies.
These reports are required to be filed by every beneficial owner of more
than 10 percent of any equity security listed on a national securities exchange and by every officer and director of the issuer of any equity
security so listed; every officer or director of a registered public utility
holding company; and every officer, director, beneficial owner of more
than 10 percent of any class of security (other than short-term paper),
member of an advisory board, investment adviser or affiliated person
of an investment adviser of a re~stered closed-end investment company. There must be filed an initial report showing beneficial ownership, both direct and indirect, of the company's securities when one

40

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of these relationships is assumed and a report must be filed for eaeh
month thereafter in which any purchase or sale, or other change ill
such ownership occurs, setting forth in detail each such change, on or
before the tenth day following the month in which it occurs.
The staff examines all reports filed to determine whether t~ey' comply
with applicable requirements.
Where maccuracies or oIUlSSIOnsappear amended reports are requested. The reports are available f~r
public inspection from the time they are filed. However, It IS mamfestly not possible for many interested persons to inspect these re:ports
at the Commission's central office, or at the exchanges where additional
copies of section 16 (a) reports are also filed. The Commission therefor publishes. a m~mth~y officil~1sl;lmmary of security transactions and
holdings WhICh IS WIdely distributed among individual investors,
brokers and dealers, newspaper correspondents, press services and
oth-er interested persons. Files of this summary are maintained at
each of the Commission's regional offices and at the offices of the
various exchanges. The nature and value of these summaries is indicated by the fact that during the past 13 years 41,327 persons have
filed 272,450 reports with the Commission.
Preventing Unfair Use of Inside Information

For the further purpose of preventing the unfair use of information
which may have been obtained by the corporation insider by reason
of his confidential relationship to his company, section 16 (b) of the
Securities Exchange Act provides that any profit he realizes from
any purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of any equity security
of the company within any period of less than 6 months shall be recoverable by the issuer, or by any security holder acting in its behalf
if the issuer fails or refuses to bring suit for recovery within 60 days
after request or fails diligently to prosecute the suit after it is instituted.
Corresponding provisions are contained in section 17 (b)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and section 30 (f)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Commission is not
charged with the enforcement of the civil remedies created by these
various provisions, but has filed briefs as amicus curiae in several
suits brought by private persons.
Ownership reporting provisions of these acts have enabled issuers
and public stockholders in some instances to recover substantial profits
which had been realized by insiders in short-term trading.
In a number of other cases, the Commisison has been informed of the voluntary
payment to the companies of short-term profits realized by insiders.
Such repayments were often brought about by the necessity to report
short-term transactions.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES, CONSENTS, AND AUTHORIZATIONS

Under three of the acts it administers-sections
14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 12 (a) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 and 20 (a) of the Investment Company Act
of 19~the
Commission is authorized to prescribe rules and regulations concerning the solicitation of proxies, consents, and authorizations in connection with securities of the companies subject to those
acts. Pursuant to this authority, the Commission has adopted regulation X-14, which is designed to protect investors by requiring the
disclosure of certain information to them and by affording them
an opportunity for active participation in the affairs of their comfany.
Essentially, this regulation makes unlawful any solicitation 0 any
proxy, consent or authorization which is false or misleading as to
any material fact or which omits to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements already made not false or misleading. Under
the regulation it is necessary, in general, that each person solicited
be furnished such information as will enable him to act intelligently
upon each separate matter in respect of which his vote or consent is
sought. The proxy rules set forth in this regulation also contain
provisions which enable security holders who are not allied with the
management to communicate with other security holders when the
management is soliciting proxies.
During the Jlast fiscal year the Commission received and examined
under regulation X-14 both the preliminary and definitive material
required with respect to 1,677 such solicitations as well as "follow up"
material employed in 303 instances.
This proxy examination work is seasonal. Approximately 12 percent of all proxy statements filed during any year are for stockholder
meetings held in the 3-month period from March to May; about 10
percent are for meetings in the fourth week of April; and about 5
percent, or one in every 20, are for meetings held on one particular
day, the fourth Tuesday in March.

It might be helpful to describe by way of illustration the disclosure
resulting from examination of the proxy solicitation material intended
to be used in a particular case. In connection with the solicitation of
proxies by a cement producing company, the change in the position
of preferred stockholders which would result from a proposed recapitalization was not clearly set forth in the first instance. As originally drafted the proposed plan, which would have forced preferred
stockholders to give up substantial rights to the benefit of common
stockholders, including members of the management group, was not
clearly or adequately described.
Following the Commission's insistence that complete disclosure
be made in the proxy soliciting material of the effect of the planparticularly with respect to the prior position of the preferred as to
assets and earnings and as to the earnings record of the company
which would show that dividends on the preferred stock had been
earned in many years bu~ not paid, while substantial sums were being

used to purchase the preferred at depressed prices-the company
elected to modify the plan so as to offer more favorable terms to the
preferred stockholders. Hence as a result of the disclosure demanded, the preferred stockholder received a plan much more equitable to his interest.
REGULATION OF BROKERS AND DEALERS IN
OVER-mE-COUNTER MARKETS
Registration

Brokers and dealers using the mails or other instrumentalities of
interstate commerce to effect transactions in securities on over-thecounter markets are required to be registered with the Commission
pursuant to section 15 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, except for
those brokers and dealers whose business is exclusively intrastate or
exclusively in exempt securities. The following table contains pertinent data with respect to the registration of brokers and dealers
during the 1947fiscal year:

Broker-Dealer Inspections

During the 1947 fiscal year a total of 587 broker-dealer inspection
reports were received from the Commission's regional offices. These
inspections are undertaken pursuant to section 17 of the Securities
Exchange Act for the purpose of determining whether registrants
are in compliance with the requirements of law.
Ninty-four inspections reflected unsatisfactory financial conditions
requiring immediate corrective action or continued surveillance. The
high ratio of inspections in which unsatisfactory financial conditions
were revealed is due largely to the fact that a substantial number of
special inspections were undertaken to test financial condition following the September 1946 break in the market. In 131 inspections
the reports disclosed transactions at prices so different from prevailing market prices as to raise some question as to the fair treatment of

44

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

customers. In 133 inspections the reports contained information indicating noncompliance with provisions of regulation T relating to
the extension of credit. In 13 inspections questions were raised concerning improper hypothecation and commingling of customers' securities. In nine inspections it was discovered that firms took secret
profits in agency transaction by misrepresenting prices at which customers' orders had been executed.
As has been explained in previous annual reports, efforts are made
to determine whether infractions are the result of carelessness or represent a policy of indifference or willfulness on the part of responsible management.
It is the Commission's established policy to
call minor infractions to the attention of the firm at the time of the
inspection so that corrective measures may be taken immediately.
This of course necessitates a subsequent check-up in order to determine whether the promised corrections have been effected. However,
when acts and practices are discovered which represent such substantial harm to customers that action by the Commission may be appropriate, inquiry or investigation beyond the scope of the inspection is
undertaken.
During the 1947 fiscal year, 43 inspections resulted in
such inquiry or investigation.

In proceedings against Ira Haupt & Co., the Commission held that
the brokerage exemption provided by section 4 (2) of the Securities
Act of 1933 was inapplicable to a distribution on an exchange by an
underwriter acting for a controlling person," The proceeding was
instituted to determine whether the firm had willfully violated section
5 (a) of the Securities Act. The violation arose out of the firm's sale
for the account of the "Schulte interests" (consisting of David A.
Schulte, a corporation controlled by Schulte~ and the David A. Schulte
Trust) of approximately 93,000 shares of the common stock of Park
& Tilford, Inc., from November 1, 1942, to June 1, 1944. The securities
so offered were not registered under the Securities Act.
The firm contended that its transactions in the Park & Tilford
stock for the account of the Schulte interests did not constitute a
violation of section 5 (a) because of the applicability to such transactions of certain exemptions provided by sections 3 (a) (1),4 (1)
and 4 (2) of the Securities Act. In its opinion, the Commission
rejected these claims to exemption and found that the firm was an
underwriter within the meaning of section 2 (11) of the Securities
Act since, upon the stipulated facts, the firm had effected a public distribution of the common stock of Park & Tilford for the Schulte interests, which concededly controlled 90 percent of the Park & Tilford
outstanding common stock. The Commission cited the legislative
history of the act to show that it was the intention of Congress to
require registration
in connection with secondary distributions
through underwriters by controlling. stockholders.
It poirited out
that while "distribution" is not defined in the act, it has been held to
comprise "the entire process by which in the course of a public offering
a block of securities is dispersed and ultimately comes to rest in the
hands of the investing public." Having found that the firm acted
as an underwriter in connection with the distribution of the Park &
Tilford stock to the public, the Commission concluded that the distribution of a controlling block of stock is a new offering and that
the exemptions of section 3 (a) (1) and the third clause of section
4 (1) were not applicable to such transactions.
The Commission further found that the brokerage exemption provided by section 4 (2) is not available to an underwriter who effects
a distribution of an issue for the account of a controlling stockholder
through the mechanism of a stock exchange. It pointed out the distinction between "trading" and "distribution."
The opinion holds
that section 4 (2) permits individuals to sell their securities through
a broker in an ordinary brokerage transaction but that the process of
distribution itself, however carried out, is subject to section 5.
While concluding that the firm's violations were willful, the Commission did not find that revocation of registration or expulsion from
the exchange was necessary in the public interest, but held that it was
appropriate in the public interest to suspend the firm from membershiJ? in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., for a
period of 20 days.
The revocation proceedings against Behel, Johnsen & Company,
Inc., Chicago,
involved a pattern of trading which the Commission, in its opinion
findings, described as "churning.".

women customers, who opened their accounts with registrant in May
and June 1942 owned securities with an aggregate market value of
$541008. Thes~ securities and subsequent cash contributi0I?-s made
their total net investment $61,731. The pattern followed II?-.these
accounts was one of simultaneous sale and purchase of securities at
short intervals. Registrant used the proceeds fro~ the sale of the
customers' securities to purchase, purportably for Its own account,
securities which it had recommended to the customers, and then sold
such securities to the customers at a profit, confirming as a "principal"
in the transaction.
As a result of this course of dealing, from May 18, 1942, to May 7,
1945, the three women were induced to sell, in a series of 130 transactions, securities with a market value of $266,727 and to "purchase
from" the registrant, in a series of 143 transactions, securities that had
cost the firm $274,451. Approximately 61 percent of the securities
sold by the registrant to these customers were held by them for less
than 6 months and 86 percent were held for less than 1 year. Over the
course of the 3-year period, the capital in these three accounts, as
measured by the average of the market value of the opening and
closing of the portfolio plus the additional cash invested, was turned
over approximately four and one-half times. From the trading activity deliberately created in these three accounts, registrant realized
gross profits of $18,879, representing more than one-third of its total
gross profit during the period under consideration, while on the other
hand the customers benefited only to the extent of an increase of $2,400
in the aggregate market value of their security holdings at the end
of the period over the value of those held at the beginning of the
period.
Noting that the three women customers were all uninformed as to
securities, relying completely on registrant's advice in determining
the course of their transactions, and that the registrant's position was
one of trust, its undertaking and obligation being to treat these accounts as investment accounts, the Commission reprehended as a vicious
and fraudulent course of conduct registrant's practice of "Churning"
the accounts by inducing a great number of transactions and successive turn-overs of the portfolio solely for the purpose of its own gain
and to the substantial detriment of the customers. The Commission
pointed out that the registrant's practice of confirming "as principal"
where orders given by customers were filled by means of purchases
purportably made for the firm's own account facilitated perpetration
of the tyPe of fraud represented in this proceeding. By confirming
"as principal," the firm made no disclosure of either the commission or
profit derived from the operations effected in the customer's account.
The Commission found on the foregoing admitted facts that registrant
had willfully violated section 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and
sections 10 (b) and 15 (c) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act and
rules X-10B-5 and X-15Cl-2 (a) and (b) adopted thereunder. The
Commission concluded that it was in the public interest to revoke the
registration of registrant and to expel it from membership in the
NASD.
During the curr~nt yea!, the Commission instituted revocation proceedmgs agamst rune registered broker-dealers who had failed to submit yearly reports of their financial condition to the Commission as

required by ru1e X-17A-5 promulgated under section 17 (a) of the
Securities Exchange Act," These cases are of interest because they
were the first in which the Commission has sought to revoke registration solely for the violation of this rule. The Commission noted in
its opinions in these proceedings that the promulgation of rule
X-17A-5 was announced by publication in the Federal Register, by
releases to the public press, and by distribution to the persons on its
mailing list, which included these nine registrants. In addition,
letters were sent to these registrants reminding them of the necessity
for filing reports of financial condition as required by the rule.
As to whether the violation commonly involved in these proceedings
was willful, the Commission observed that had these registrants acquired knowledge of the requirement, their failure to comply with it
could hardly be otherwise than willful; that under the circumstances,
ignorance of the requirements of the rule would appear to have been
the result of deliberate indifference to obligations imposed upon them
by their status as registered broker-dealers; and that their conduct
in placing themselves out of reach of communication from the Commission amounted to such a disregard of the duty inherent in their
licensed status to keep informed of the legal requirements attached
to that status as to make their violation of rule X-17A-5 "willful"
within the meaning of that term as used in section 15 (b) of the
Securities Exchange Act.
In four of these cases, namely, Wayne Lloyd Morgan, Julius Guttag, Henry Leach, and Sylvan Perry Spies, the Commission, finding
that the public interest and the protection of investors would be adequately served by withdrawal rather than revocation, permitted such
registrants to WIthdraw their registrations.
The Commission, however, found that it was necessary in the public interest to revoke the
registrations of Ray Murphy, David Heffler, Robert Charles Johnson,
Earl P. Corley, and Charles Fletcher Baxter.
The proceedings which the Commission instituted against M. S.
Wien & Co. were based upon charges of manipulation of the market,
fraudulent misrepresentations, and nondisclosure of material facts in
connection with certain purchases and sales in the over-the-counter
market of the 5 percent income debentures of 1968 of the Phoenix Silk
Corporation,"
Under consideration of an extensive record the Commission concluded that the firm had made misrepresentations and material omissions in connection with these transactions, thereby willfully violating
sections 10 (b) and 15 (c) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act and
rules X-10B-5 and X-1501-2 thereunder. Holding that the firm must
be held responsible for the violations, the Commission found that it
was in the public interest that its broker-dealer registration be revoked and that it be expelled from membership in the NASD. The

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

opinion, however, noted that the culpability rested chiefly on Lann,
one of the partners who was personally in charge of the trading and
made all the representations respecting the debentures. Finding fur.
ther that there was nothing in the record to show that the other part.
ners knew of or acquiesced in any of the misrepresentations or omissions made by Lann in connection with the activities in the debentures,
the Commission provided in its order that the revocation of the firm's
registration should be without prejudice to the right to reapply for
registration after 30 days from the effective date of the order if by
that time Lann should have withdrawn from the firm and become disassociated from its business. Lann, as an aggrieved person, filed a
petition on December 30,1946, with the Circuit Court of A.ppeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, for review of the Commission's order,
and the review was still pending at the close of the fiscal year.
When Lawrence R. Leeby, who proposed to do business as a sole
proprietor under the name of Lawrence R. Leeby & Co., applied for
registration as an over-the-counter broker, proceedings were instituted
to determine whether it was in the public interest to deny such registration," Leeby's registration as a broker and dealer had been revoked by the Commission in 1943 for violation of section 1'7 (a) of the
Securities A.ct of 1933 upon a finding by the Commission that he had
sold numerous oil royalties to two customers at exceedingly high markups over contemporaneous wholesale costs, the sales being confirmed
to the customers as principal transactions although the evidence
showed that Looby was charged with the high fiduciary duties of an
agent. The Commission found that in these circumstances he violated
hIS fiduciary duties in taking secret profits. Moreover, viewed even as
principal transactions, the Commission found the mark-ups taken in
such transactions were excessive and fraudulent.
Leeby's application for registration stated that he intended to engage in business only as a broker and at the hearing in the denial proceedings he testified that he proposed to charge commissions previously agreed upon with his customers and comparable to those charged
in similar transactions by members of exchanges. It was the opinion
of the Commission that such proposed plan of operation afforded a
promise that there would be no repetition of the taking of excessive
profits and the failure to reveal such profits which resulted in the
earlier revocation of Leeby's registration.
Leeby further testified that
he proposed to amend his application to indicate that he would engage in transactions as a dealer in investment trust shares, which
transactions would be limited to securities registered with the Commission which he would purchase from the underwriters and sell
through the use of the prospectus filed with the Commission. In considering this amendment to his application, the Commission noted that
in such transactions Looby would be limited to the dealer discount
set forth in the prospectus and that the disclosure of such discount
would tend to prevent recurrence of the improper practices engaged
in by Leeby in the sale of oil royalties.
Upon further findings that Leeby had been employed as It salesman
by several firms since his revocation as a registered broker and dealer,

which he had been employed for a considerable period disclosed that
the dealer transactions in over-the-counter securities had been effected
by him for the firm at prices not unreasonably related to the current
market quotations, and that letters had been supplied by brokerage
firms and individuals testifying to his good reputation and standing,
the Commission concluded that it was not necessary in the public
interest to deny Leeby's application for registration as a broker and,
after appropriate amendment of his application, as a dealer in investment company shares. The Commission made it clear, however, that
it was permitting his registration to become effective subject to the
condition that his activities were limited to those in which he represented he would engage and that a finding that he had departed from
such limitations would subject his registration to revocation.
Special Financial Reports

or Broken

and Dealen

On September 30, 1946, the Commission issued a call upon registered
brokers and dealers and members of national securities exchanges to
file an abbreviated financial report as of September 30.S A total of
3,595 notices were sent out and 2,930 reports were received. An analysis of the reports disclosed that in the main the net capital of brokerage
firms appeared to be adequate and in compliance WIth rule X-15C3-1
as of September 30. Less than 3 percent disclosed financial conditions requiring prompt correction.
A number of the firms whose
financial condition was unsatisfactory reduced their inventories, reduced their indebtedness, or introduced new capital to meet the requirements of the rule. There were other circumstances in which firms
divested themselves of customers' cash lmd securities and transferred
them to other accounts in which credit was extended, thereby becoming exempt from the rule. While the staff of the Commission indicated
that the industry withstood the September market break remarkably
well, its analysis of the September 30 financial reports has raised some
question as to the adequacy of the protection which the rule in its
present form provides.
SUPERVISION OF NASD ACTIVITY
Membership

Membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
(NASD), the only national securities dealers association registered
with the Commission, increased during the year by 100 to stand at
2,614 on June 30, 1947. On that date, 25,573 individuals connected
with member firms in capacities which involved doing business directly
with the public were registered with the association as registered
representatives.
These include partners,
officers, traders
and
salesmen.
Disciplinary

Actions

The NASD reported to the Commission in the 1947 fiscal year final
action on eight disciplinary cases in which formal complaints had
been filed against members. In five of these cases the appropriate district business conduct committee found the firms in violation of the
N.ASD rules of fair practice and imposed fines, in amounts ranging

from $200 to $1,100, aggregating $2,135. .In another. case, a firm ~

ployee, who had been cited as a respondent in a complaint together w~th
his employing firm, had his registration as a registered representative
revoked on a finding that he had misappropriated customers' funds
and securities," Restitution in full was effected. The complaint was
dismissed as to the employing firm <:m.3;finding that it had l;l0. knowledge of the employee's improper actIvItI~S. In the two re~amlllg formal complaints the board of governors, 111 a review capacity, reversed
findings of violations by the district business conduct committee of
original jurisdiction and dismissed the complaints against the firms
involved.
The Commission continued its practice of referring to the NASD,
for appropriate action by the NASD, facts concerning the business
practices of members where there was some indication of a possible
violation of the NASD rules of fair practice. Seven such references
were made during the 1947 fiscal year and seven other cases were pending at the start of the year. By June 30, 1947, the NASD reported
the disposition of 13 of these 14 cases. Three resulted in formal complaint procedures, as reported above, in which violations were found
and fines imposed on the members concerned. In 9 other instances, the
district business conduct committees held informal discussions with the
members involved, but took no formal action. In the remaining case,
the firm cited retired from business at about the time the reference was
made and the NASD permitted the resignation to become effective.
Commission Review of Disciplinary Acrlon and of Denial of Membership

By the provisions of section 15 A (g) of the Securities Exchange
Act, any disciplinary action by the NASD against a member or denial
of membership to any applicant is subject to review by the Commission on application by an aggrieved party. Three such cases were
decided by the Commission during the year.
As indicated in the Twelfth Annual Report there was before the
Commission at the close of the 1946 fiscal year an appeal proceeding to
review disciplinary action by the NASD against the Washington,
D. C., office of Herrick, Waddell & Co., Inc. The NASD district business conduct committee, after the filing of a complaint and a hearing,
concluded that prices charged customers by the firm were not reasonably related to the market and that the firm's conduct in these transactions was in violation of the NASD rules of fair practice. As a
penalty, the firm was censured and directed to pay costs in the amount
of $250. This decision was appealed by the firm to the board of
governors where, by a tie vote, it was affirmed.
The issue before the Commission was whether there had been a
violation of the NASD's interpretations
governing the amount of
mark-up over market which a member firm may charge in the sale
of a security to a customer. The basic facts were not in dispute and
no claim was made that, if a violation had occurred, the penalty was
excessive. There was no charge of fraud involved in the case. The
NASD findings were based in, part on an exhibit showing that the
gross profit received by Herrick, Waddell & Co., Inc., in 39 transactions
ranged from 4.2 percent to 11.4 percent over cost price. In most pur• This is the first disciplinary case in which a complaint was directed against a registered representative under the procedure adopted e1fectlve January 15. 1946.

chases by customers, the firm purported to act as principal, executing
customers' purchase orders in so-called riskless transactions, in which
the firm purchased the security only after it had received the order from
the customer and then billed the security to the customer at a stated
mark-up over cost.
Evidence was introduced that it was general practice for the firm's
salesman to inform the customer at the time the customer's order was
accepted that the firm would act as principal and that the cost to the
customer would include a mark-up over cost to the firm stated in
points to the nearest one-eighth of a point. These disclosures, according to the evidence, were also made in writing by means of a confirmation sent to customers immediately after the firm's purchase for its
own account and its concurrent sale to the customer. The firm contended that the relevant NASD rule was no broader than a prohibition against fraud which, it claimed, was obviated by the oral and
written disclosures made to the customer.
The NASD argued and the Commission found that the NASD rules
<FO beyond fraud, but the Commission concluded that the NASD
findings were not supported by the evidence, and that the NASD had
not properly applied its interpretations governing mark-ups.> The
NASD had relied heavily upon evidence comparing the firm's mark-up
policy with the practices of other firms in the District of Columbia.
The Commission, however, held that this evidence did not provide a
standard sufficiently clear to constitute a proper basis for a finding
that the firm's mark-ups were unreasonable in their relationship to
the market. The Commission also held that the NASD had not given
proper weight to various other circumstances, including particularly
the oral and written disclosures of the firm as to its capacity and
amount of mark-up. The Commission disagreed with the NASD view
that these disclosures were immaterial and emphasized that they are
pertinent to the question of ethical conduct. The Commission remanded the record to the NASD :for reconsideration consistent with
the Commission's opinion. Subsequently the matter was reconsidered
by the board of governors, which dismissed the complaint.
A case involving the "denial of membership" was decided on the issue
whether Foelber-Patterson, Inc. was disqualified :from membership
in the NASD as a result of a Commission order issued in 194211 revoking the registration o:fa broker-dealer firm in which Foelber and Patterson were officers,directors and shareholders. The Commission had
granted Foelber-Patterson, Inc., registration as a broker-dealer in
1945,but subsequently, on application to the NASD for membership,
the NASD denied admission on the grounds that Foelber and Patterson had been causes o:fthe Commisison's order revoking the registration of Central Securities Corp., and that, notwithstanding the subsequent registration of Foelber-Patterson, Inc., the applicant was disqualified from membership and could be admitted only with the approval or at the direction of the Commission. The firm then filed
with the Commission a petition for review of that action. The Commission held that when a broker-dealer whose registration has been
revoked is subsequently permitted by the Commission to become registered, the disqualification is removed in that he is no longer subject

to an order of revocation and, looking behind the corporate veil, held
that the firm was not disqualified." The Commission ~ccord~n~ly set
aside the action of the NASD and required applicant s admission to
membership.
.
..
Another "denial of membership" case arose on a petition filed by
Republic Investment Co. requesting the Commission to review an
NASD order denying applicant's admission to membership,
The
NASD had concluded that Republic Investment Co. was disqualified
from membership because its president, A. Morris Krensky, had been
a cause of the expulsion of Lowell Niebuhr & Co., Inc., by and from
the NASD for violations of its rules of fair practice. Accordingly,
Republic Investment Co. could be admitted only with the approval or
at the direction of the Commission. The Commission, in its opinion,
declared that it was unable to find any evidence in the record to support the conclusion that Krensky had knowledge of, or in any way
participated in, the acts which led to the expulsion of Lowell NIebuhr
& Co.,Inc., or that he was a cause thereof within the meaning of section
15A (b) (4) of the Securities Exchange Act and the identical section
2 of article I of the NASD bylaws. The Commission :further stated
that "at the time those acts occurred, the record indicates that he
(Krensky) actually had withdrawn from the firm." The Commission
concluded that the applicant was not disqualified from membership
and, by order, set aside the action of the NASD and required applicant's admission to membership."
Commission Action on Petitions for Approval of or Continuation in Membership

In addition to the review of cases such as those cited above, a petition can be brought before the Commission under the provisions of
section 15A (b) (4) of the Securities Exchange Act by or on behalf
of a member of the KASD for the continuance of its membership
when it proposes to take in a partner, officer,director or an employee
who is himself disqualified from membership. In this type of action,
the question before the Commission is whether it is in the public interest, in spite of the existence of valid disqualification, to approve the
continuance of membership. Applications are directed in the first
instance to the NASD. If the NASD acts favorably to the applicant,
it so advises the Commission and becomes the petitioner. Under this
circumstance, the Commission considers "approval" of the petition
for admission to or continuance in membership. If the NASD rejects
the application, the applicant may petition the Commission for an
order "directing" the NASD to continue the petitioner in membership.
In the last year, three "approval" petitions were filed by the NASD
on behalf of members. Action was taken by the Commission as to
two of these petitions and the third, which was pending at June 30,
1947,was subsequently withdrawn.
At .tJ;teclose of the 1946fiscal year there was before the Commission
a petIt~o~ filed by the NASD on behalf of Greene & Co. applying for
Commission approval of the continuance of Greene & Co. in membership with 1V. F. Thompson acting as a partner or as an employee
of the firm. Thompson had been one of two partners of W. F.
Thompson & Co., which, in 1942, had been found by the NASD to

have violated certain of its rules and to have been guilty of conduct
inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade. The firm was
expelled from the NASD and fined $1,200. Subsequently, Thompson
was employed by Greene & Co. The NASD acted favorably on the
firm's application for continuance of membership and the petition before the Commission was filed by the NASD on behalf of the firm.
After hearings were held the Commission approved the petition." A
significant fact developed at the hearings was that, apart from the
above-mentioned NASD proceedings, Thompson had never been subject to any disciplinary action, law suit or complaint growing out of
his securities business.
As-mentioned earlier, Lowell Niebuhr & Co., Inc. had been expelled
by and from the NASD in 1942 for violation of the NASD rules in
two respects-conducting
a securities business while its liquid assets
were considerably less than its obligations and filing balance sheets
with the NASD in which its financial condition was misrepresented.
Subsequently, the Commission found willful violations of its statutes
on somewhat the same facts," but on a showing that, among other
things, the firm had met its obligations in full, the Commission permitted withdrawal of registration and dismissed the revocation
proceedings. The NASD was favorably inclined to Niebuhr's reemployment by Leason & Co., Inc., a member firm, and recommended
that the Commission approve the firm's continuation in membership.
On an independent review of the record before the NASD, the Commission concluded that it was appropriate in the public interest to
approve the application."
Edward E. Trost was under a disqualification from membership as
a result of a Commission order revoking the broker-dealer registration
of Trost & Co., Inc. and expelling the firm from membership in the
NASD.n Trost was subsequently employed by a member firm of the
NASD, which made application for continuance of membership. For
the first time, the unique procedure was employed in which the firm
making application was permitted to do so without publicly disclosing its identity. This procedure was permitted, and will be permitted
where feasible in future cases, on advice that the publicity attendant
upon a Commission proceeding had discouraged some members from
taking the necessary legal steps to obtain approval of the employment
of persons under some disqualification but who, with due regard to
the public interest, may be employed under appropriate supervision
by an NASD member.
The board of governors of the NASD found, after a review of the
Commission's opmion which gave rise to the disqualification and of
Trost's subsequent activity and general reputation, that he should
be permitted to engage in the securities business as an employee and
registered representative.
Its findings included the facts that he
was subject to supervision by responsible partners of the firm emJ?loying him and that, while so employed, there was no record of exorbitant
profits such as had formed the basis for the Commissions'.J?rior disciplinary action. Upon a review of the record the Commission con.. Securities Exchange

eluded that it was appropriate in the public interest to approve the
application."
The first case in which the Commission directed the NASD to admit an applicant to membership after the NASD had disapproved the
application arose on the petition of Lawrence R. Leeby to be admitted
to membership. Leeby was under a disqualification from membership as a result of his expulsion from and by the NASD in 1942 and the
revocation of his broker-dealer registration by the Commission in
1943.19 The Commission, in 1946, granted Leeby registration as a
broker in over-the-counter securities and as a dealer in investment
trust shares." Leeby's application for membership was thereafter approved by the appropriate district business conduct committee of the
NASD but was disapproved by the board of governors, without explanation or findings, solely because of the disability arising out of
his previous expulsion.
The Commission had to consider whether it was appropriate in the
public interest to direct Leeby's admission to membership. In its
opinion, the Commission pointed out that the limited registration as a
broker-dealer already granted to Leeby should tend to prevent a recurrence of the practices which had led to his expulsion and to the revocation of his registration as a broker-dealer. The Commission emphasized that it was incumbent upon the NASD, under the circumstances, if its action of disapproval were to be sustained, to present
adequate reasons for barring Leeby from membership and that none
had been advanced. In the absence of such findings, the Commission
was forced to make its decision without the benefit which would, and
should, be derived from a statement of the NASD views. The Commission, by order, directed the NASD to admit Leeby to membership."
CHANGES IN RULES AND FORMS
Rule X.llDI-I-Extensions

of Credit by Broker-Dealers

In general, section 11 (d) (1) of the act makes it unlawful for a
broker-dealer to extend or maintain credit on any security which was
part of a new issue in whose distribution he participated during the
preceding 6 months. By an amendment to rule X-11D1-1 adopted
during the year an exemption is afforded which permits broker-dealers
who would otherwise be subject to section 11 (d) (1) to extend credit
to their customers upon securities received on the exercise of certain
short-term rights or warrants." The exemption is available only where
the right has been issued to the customer as a stockholder of the corporation issuing the security upon which credit is to be extended, or
as a stockholder of a company distributing such security pursuant
to section 11 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
This amendment removes the absolute prohibition of section 11 (d)
(1) but does not, of course, remove the exempted transactions from the
scope of regulation T or any applicable stock exchange rules on margin.

governors of the Federal Reserve System under section 'I of the act,

had been amended to permit extensions of credit in these cases on
specified conditions.
Rule X-12D2-I-Reports

by Exchanges

By an amendment to this rule the Commission eliminated the
requirement that an exchange which had suspended a security
trom trading file a statement every 2 months setting forth the reasons
for the continuance of the suspension." The amended provision
requires an exchange merely to notify the Commission of any change
in the reasons for the suspension and of the effective date on which
the suspended security is restored to trading.
Rule X-12D2-2-Delisting

of Retired Securities

Paragraph (a) of rule X-12D2-2 permits an exchange, upon certification of certain facts to the Commission, to remove from listing and
registration securities which have been "retired." Paragraph (a) was
amended to make it clear that securities shall be deemed to be retired
within the meaning of the rule where all rights pertaining to such
securities have been extinguished."
Rule X.13A-6B-Quarterly

Reports

On July 12, 1946, the Commission announced an amendment to
rule X-13A-6B, which requires quarterly reports of sales volume from
most issuers having securities registered on a national securities exchange. The amendment exempts from the rule companies primarily
engaged in the production of raw cane sugar or other seasonal, single
crop agricultural commodities, since such producers will ordinarily
have no sales in two or more of their fiscal quarters.
Rule X-15A-2-Shares

in Cooperative Dwellings.

This new rule exempts shares of cooperative corporations, representing ownership or a right to possession and occupancy of specific
apartment units in property owned by such corporations, from the
operation of section 15 (a).25 Section 15 (a), in substance, requires
the registration of brokers or dealers who effect transactions in securities over the counter. Shares of the type covered by the rule are invariably distributed through the usual real estate channels and not
through securities brokers.
The Commission determined that the public interest did not require
that real estate brokers who are duly licensed by the appropriate
State or local authorities and subject to their supervision be subjected to the additional registration requirements of section 15, solely
by reason of their participation in the sale of such securities. The
rule is applicable, however, only if the securities are sold by or through
such duly licensed real estate brokers. The registration requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of both
the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act remain applicable,
of course, to such securities.
Rules X.16B-2 and X.16C-2-Exemption

that "short-swing" profits by certain corporate insiders shall inure
to their corporation. Section 16 (c) prohibits short sales of such
equity securities by such persons. The two rules exempt bona fide
underwriting transactions by dealers who fall within one of the three
classes of insiders specified in section 16, or by dealer firms with which
such persons are connected. However, in order to prevent such insiders or insider firms from acquiring a preferential position when
they participate in a distribution, the exemptions afforded by the two
rules are subject to the condition that noninsiders or noninsider firms
shall have participated in the distribution "on terms at least as favorable" as those on which the insiders have participated and "to an
extent at least equal to the aggregate participation" of all insiders.
The purpose of the amendments was to make it clear that the mere
receipt of a fee by an insider as manager of an underwriting syndicate
should not in itself be deemed to place the insider in a preferential
position within the meaning of the rule and thereby make the exemption unavailable.
Rule X-16B-4-Exemption

of Registered Holding Companies

This rule provides that any transactions by a holding company
registered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
or by a subsidiary of such a company, where both the purchase and
the sale have been approved or permitted by the Commission under
that act, shall be exempt from the civil liability provisions of section
16 (b) or the Securities Exchange Act.21 (These liabilities are described in the preceding subsection.)
Form 10 for Corporations

On June 19, 1947,the Commission announced an amendment to the
Instruction Book for Form 10 for Corporations. Form 10 is the basic
general form prescribed for use by corporations in filing applications
for registration of securities on a national securities exchange. The
amendment deleted from the instruction book certain temporary instructions, which had become obsolete, as to the financial statements to
be filed with an application. The amendment also deleted the instruction as to the form and content of financial statements and schedules, inasmuch as the form and content of financial statements and
schedules required to be filed with an application on Form 10 are
now governed by the provisions contained in regulation S-X, the
Commission's general accounting regulation.
Forms 10-K and I-MD-Annual

Report Forms

On January 2D, 1947,the Commission announced amendments to the
instructions for Form 10-K, the basic annual report form for most
issuers having securities listed and registered on a national securities
exchange. The amendments operate to simplify the requirements for
financial statements by permitting a registrant to file either consolidated or individual statements where registrants own assets and
re,:enues comprising more than 85 percent of those shown in the consolidated statement. Heretofore both individual and consolidated
statements were required. The amendments bring to this form certain

recently revised Form 8-1 under the Securities Act of 1933.
The amendments to the Instructions to Form 10-K operate to effect
a corresponding simplification in the requirements of Form 1-MD,
since that form requires registrants to file the same statements as those
required of registrants on Form 1Q-K. Form 1-MD is the basic annual report form for issuers which have registered securities under
the Securities Act of 1933 and are required to file annual reports by
section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act.
Forms 12-K and 12-AK-Annual

Report Forms

On AprilS, 1947,the Commission adopted minor amendments to its
annual report Forms 12-K and i2-AK. Companies which report to
the Interstate Commerce Commission on its Form A are permitted,
in connection with reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
to file certain selected schedules from Form A in lieu of the complete
Form A report. The purpose of the amendments is to revise the
list of selected schedules to conform to certain changes made in Form
A by the Interstate Commerce Commission for the year ended December 31, 1946.
UTIGATION UNDER THE SECURITmS EXCHANGE ACT

The Commission's litigation activities under the act during the 1947
fiscal year included: (1) Injunction actions in the district courts to
restrain broker-dealers and others from violating those provisions of
the act and the Commission's rules designed to protect security holders
and the customers of broker-dealers; (2) appellate court actions on
petitions to review orders of the Commission; and (3) actions between
private parties in which the Commission participated as amicus curiae.
Injunction and Appellate Proceedings Involving Broker-Dealers

The large majority of injunction actions was against brokerdealers. In 8. E. O. v. Patrick A. Trapp a permanent injunction was
entered which, for the first time in any contested civil action, judicially
established two theories of fraud advanced by the Commission in
connection with sales of oil royalties." The first is that it is fraudulent for a dealer to sell oil royalties at prices in excess of the probable
returns to purchasers, as computed on the basis of reasonable estimates
of the recoverable oil underlying the tracts covered by the royalties."
The court's holding to this effect was based on expert evidence that,
as of the purchase dates, the probable returns based on such estimates
ranged from only 65 to SOpercent of the cost of the royalties to the
buyers. The second new judicial principle, which the Commission had
followed in an earlier administrative proceeding, is that it is fraudulent
for a dealer to sell oil royalties at prices bearing no reasonable relationship to his contemporaneous cost. These fraudulent practices were
held to have violated section 15 (c) (1) of the Securities Exchange
Act, as well as section 17 (a) (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.
.. Civil No. 1288, N. Dak , June 4, 1947.
.. This theory was also the basis of the complaint In 8. E. O. v. Joseph. J. LeDone, Civil
No. 40-347, S. D. N. Y., Mar. 26, 1947, in which a permanent Injunction by consent was
entered. In this case Investors had been charged $416,078 for 011 royalties worth at the
time of the sales (on the basis of the then current value of the recoverable 011) not more
than $272,890, or approximately $143,188 less than the total paid by the investors.

58

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Trapp's registration as a dealer had been revoked by the Commission several years before and he was therefore engaged in business
as a dealer without being registered as required by section 15 (a) of
the act. The court found also that he had made false representations to purchasers about his ownership of the oil royalties being sold
to them. The defendant joined a lodge and then represented to a number of his brother members that he was liquidatmg his oil royalty
holdings in order to raise funds for a mining venture. Jn fact, his
practice was first to make sales of oil royalties which he did not own
and then to use the customers' money to acquire the royalties from
another dealer.
In S. E. O. v. Fiscal Service Oorp. and Otto F. Herald the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining
them on all counts of the Commission's complaint;" The Commission had alleged that, while unlawfully engaged in business as a broker
and dealer in securities without being registered under section 15 (a)
of the act, the defendant firm had violated the antifraud and confirmation rules of the Commission in reporting to its customers that it
was acting as agent, when in fact it was buying and selling for its
own account, and in taking secret profits in those transactions. In addition the complaint had alleged violations of the credit provisions of
regulation T (the margin rules) and of the Commission's hypothecation and bookkeeping rules. In all, the complaint alleged violations
of sections 7 (c),8 (c), 10 (b), 15 (a), 15 (c) (1),15 (c) (2),17 (a),
and 20 (b) ofthe act.
During the fiscal year the Commission was engaged in two court
actions involving broker-dealers who were charged with violating the
fraud provisions of the act by doing business while insolvent. In both
S. E. O. v. Raymond, Bliss, Inc. and S. E. O. v. York the Commission filed complaints charging that the defendants had accepted money
and securities from customers without advising them of the defendants' insolvent condition, and had hypothecated customers' securities
without their knowledge or consent. In the Raymond, Bliss case a
preliminary injunction was granted notwithstanding the facts that
the firm had ceased doing business and that Bliss' family had made an
assignment for the benefit of creditors. So long as the firm continued
to be registered, the court stated, it could not be said that there was
no risk of further violations. Because of the assignment, which was
made after the filing of the Commission's complaint, the request for the
appointment of a receiver was for the time being denied." The request for a final injunction was still pending at the close of the fiscal
year.
In the York case a temporary restraining order was entered. The
defendant then filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy and a receiver
was appointed. The defendant agreed not to engage in the securities
business pending final determination of the bankruptcy proceedings
and the Commission then stipulated to the disrnissal of its application for a preliminary injunction and the appointment of a receiver.
H<?w~ver,the d.efendant shortly thereafter was shot and killed by his
principal creditor and the court action was discontinued."

broker-dealer, which had been instituted by the Commission, was also
discontinued. sa
Three companion cases based on regulation T, the first of their kind,
were pending at the beginning of the fiscal year in the United States
District Court at Cleveland." That regulation, adopted by the board
of governors of the Federal Reserve System under section 7 (c) of
the Securities Exchange Act and enforced by the Commission, governs
the extension of credit by members of national securities exchanges
and brokers or dealers transacting a business through the medium of
such members. In these three cases the Commission charged that
Butler, Wick & Co., of Youngstown, Ohio, Hirsch & Co., of New York
and Cleveland (both members of the New York Stock Exchange),
and The S. T. Jackson & Co., Inc., an over-the-counter firm of Youngstown, had repeatedly violated regulation T by overextensions of credit
to Richard C. Brown, of Youngstown, and First Mahoning Co., an
investment company controlled by him; that A. E. Masten & Co., a
member house in PIttsburgh, had overextended credit directly to the
Jackson firm, its over-the-counter correspondent, and indirectly
through the Jackson firm to Brown and his investment company, customers of the Jackson finn; and that Brown and his investment company had aided and abetted all of these violations. For the most part,
these violations involved the "special cash account" provisions of
regulation T. During the 1945fiscal year the court had entered a final
injunction by default against the Jackson firm. During the current
year final injunctions were entered by default against Brown and
First Mahoning Co., who had been named as defendants in all three
cases.a5
The three cases were disposed of after the close of the year by the
entry of consent judgments against the remaining defendants, Hirsch
& Co., Butler, Wick & Co., and A. E. Masten & Co. Each contained
a finding that the defendant firm had violated section 7 (c) (1) of
the Securities Exchange Act and regulation T, but that the violations
had not been committed intentionally.
The Commission agreed that
this was the fact as to these defendant firms. The Commission, however, had not charged these firms with violating regulation T intentionally. It had taken the position that the presence or absence of
actual intent to violate the regulation was irrelevant in an action to
enjoin further violations, and each of the judgments specified that
the finding of lack of intent to violate was made without determining the legal question whether intent was an element of the offense
under section 7 (c) (1) of the act or regulation T. In view of the
defendants' admission and the court's adjudication that all three
firms had violated regulation T, and under all the facts and circumstances surrounding the actions (among which was the fact that these
cases were the first of their kind), the Commission agreed to their
disposition without the formal entry of injunctions.
In S. E. O. v, Schultz, another regulation T case instituted in the
same court, the Commission obtained final judgments against the
partners of L. J. Schultz & Co. (by consent) and against Josiah
Kirby (by default}."

tions of the "special cash account" provision of regulation T similar
to those in the three preceding cases. The Commission's affidavit
alleged that in a 20-month period the Schultz firm had executed 350
transactions for Kirby, 160 of which had been in violation of regulation T.
8. E. O. ~. Nevada Oil 00., pending from the preceding year, was
an action for a mandatory injunction to require the defendant, a registered dealer, to permit an examination of its books and records required under section 17 (a) and the Commission's bookkeeping rules.
The court granted a motion by the Commission for summary judgment, ordering the defendant to permit the examination. The summary judgment, however, was subject to a condition which the Commission sought to remove by a motion to amend, and at the same
time the corporation filed a motion for a rehearing. Pending action
on these motions, the corporation permitted the Commission to make
the examination, which demonstrated that it was not doing business
as a broker or dealer. The Commission therefore stipulated with the
defendant to the vacation of the summary judgment and the dismissal
of the action, and permitted the company to withdraw its registration with the Commission."
During the fiscal year the Commission was in court on two manipulation cases, both involving broker-dealers. In the first, 8. E. O. v. Bennett and the Federal Oorp., the Commission alleged the violation of
section 9 (a) (2) of the Act by the manipulation of a stock listed on
the New York Curb Exchange. The complaint alleged that Federal,
controlled by Bennett, had manipulated the market for the common
stock of Red Bank Oil Co., also controlled by Bennett, in order to
facilitate a pending offer of a substantial block of that stock which was
then in process of registration under the Securities Act of 1933. After
a preliminary injunction had been denied during the preceding fiscal
year on the ground that there was insufficient proof of a manipulation," Federal consented to the entry of a permanent injunction.
However, the complaint was dismissed with the Commission's concurrence insofar as it related to Bennett individually."
Thereafter
Federal's registration as a broker-dealer was revoked by the Commission pursuant to section 15 (b) of the Act on the basis of the court's
injunction."
The second manipulation case, Lamm. v, 8. E. 0., ~
 is a petition to
review the order of the Commission in M. S. Wien and Co., discussed
above at p. 47. This case, one of two circuit court appeals under the
act during the 1947 fiscal year, represents the first court review of a
Commission finding of manipulation in the over-the-counter market in
violation of section 10 (b) and 15 (c) (1) of the act and rules
X-10B-5 and X-15Cl-2 thereunder. Lann, a partner of Wien & Co.,
was found by the Commission to have been primarily responsible for
the manipulation and fraud upon which the order revoking the Wien
firm's registration as a broker-dealer was based. The basis of the
appeal was that the Commission, in finding that the petitioner had
violated the antifraud prOVISIOnsof the Federal securities laws, had

gone beyond ordinary standards of fraud and improperly applied to

solely to exchange markets. The appeal was pending at the close of
the fiscal year.
The final court action involving a broker-dealer is Norris & Hirsckberg, Inc. v. S. E. O. (previously discussed at pages 35-36 and 41 of the
Twelfth Annual Report) . On January 22, 1946, after prolonged proceedings, the Commission had issued Its findings and opinion in this
matter and ordered the revocation of the registration of Norris &
Hirschberg, Inc., as a broker-dealer.
The Commission had found
that in fixing prices which were unaffected by the operation of a free,
open, and competitive market without disclosing the nature of its
market, in dealing- as a principal with uninformed customers and customers who had gIven it powers of attorney, and in trading excessively
for accounts as to which it had discretionary powers, this firm had
engaged in activities which were fraudulent and illegal under section
17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and sections 10 (b) and 15 (c) (1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A petition for review of the
Commission's order was filed on April 29, 1946, in the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia. This appeal has not yet been argued on
its merits.
After the filing of the petition for review the court entered an
order on stipulation staying the Commission's order of revocation
pending further action by the court. The court conditioned this stay
upon conformance by the firm with its stipulation and agreement with
the Commission not to engage during the pendency of the review in
acts or practices violating the above-mentioned provisions of the
statutes.
On June 8, 1946, the Commission filed a transcript of the
record in the court of appeals. This transcript was attacked by
Norris & Hirshberg, Inc. on several grounds. The court has upheld
these objections in part, remanding the case to the Commission and
physically returning the certified transcript and additional material
tendered.
Injunction Actions Against Persons Other Than Broker-Dealers

The second category of injunction cases consists of actions against
persons other than broker-dealers for violations of those sections of
the act and the Commission's rules designed to protect security holders
in general. One of these is rule X-10B-5, which contains a general
prohibition against fraud in the purchase or sale of securities in interstate channels. An action based both on this rule and on section 17
of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibits fraud only in the sale
of securities, was S. E. O. v, Standard Oil OompanY of Kamas.42
The Commission's complaint charged that the corporation and its
president, Charles B. Wrightsman, by whom the corporation was
controlled, had defrauded the corporation's minority stockholders
in connection with a scheme to acquire the common stock of the corporation from them. The complaint alleged further that Wrightsman,
in connection with the purchases from minority stockholders, had
circulated to them balance sheets representing Standard's properties
to be worth less than $4,000,000 when qualified engineers had appraised

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

its oil reserves alone to be worth $16,000,000 to $20,000,000. These
appraisals had been relied upon by banks in making loans to the
company, which for the most part were used in the purchases of stock
from the minority holders.
The Commission charged also that Standard and Wrightsman, as
a result of their program of purchasing and retiring the common
stock, had controlled the market on the N ew York Stock Exchange and
over-the-counter with the result that stockholders wishing to sell had
no practical choice except to sell to the defendants at their price. The
complaint alleged in addition that the defendants had devised a
merger scheme for the company in a further attempt to acquire stock
at depressed prices and to eliminate the minority stock ownership.
The defendants filed an answer denying the allegations of the complaint but thereafter consented to the entry of a final judgment.
Two actions during the year were based on regulation X-14, which
comprises the Commission's proxy rules. The first is S. E. O. v. McQuistion. The Commission's complaint charged that the defendant
had solicited proxies of the voting security holders of Third Avenue
Transit Corp. for its annual meetmg without furnishing them with a
proxy statement containing the information specified in the proxy
rules, and had mailed proxy soliciting material prior to the expiration
of 10 days following the filing of preliminary copies of the proxy
statement and form of proxy. A preliminary injunction was entered
before the close of the fiscal year.43 The second is S. E. O. v, Transamerica Oorp., pending from, the preceding year. In that action
the Commission sought to restrain the defendants from using proxy
material obtained as a r~esult of solicitations which did not include
proposals which a minority stockholder, pursuant to rule X-14A-7,
desired to bring before the annual meeting. The district court sustained the right of the minority stockholder with respect to one of four
proposals in question, denied a defense motion to dismiss, and enjoined the defendants from violating section 14 (a) of the act and
rules X-14A-2 and X-14A-7 thereunder."
Cross appeals from this
judgment to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit were
pending at the end of the fiscal year.
S. E. O. v. Metropolitan Mines Oorp., Ltd., was instituted just before
the close of the fiscal year. The Commission charged the defendants
with violating sections 13 (a), 14 (a), 16 (a) and 20 (c) of the Securities Exchange Act and section 5 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The
complamt alleged: (1) That the defendant corporation from 1943 to
1946 had failed to file annual reports with the Spokane Stock Exchange and with the Commission as required by section 13 (a) of the
Securities Exchange Act; (2) that Roy H. Kii1gsbury, the secretarytreasurer and managing director of the corporation, had made purchases and sales of its equity securities without reporting his changes

section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act.4s
Participation by the Commission in Private Actions

The private actions in which the Commission participated as amicus
curiae during the fiscal year for the purpose of assisting the courts in
construing the act and the Commission's rules fall into three categories: (1) A number involving sections 9 and 10 (b), two of the antifraud sections of the act; (2) two based on regulation X-14, which
contains the Commission's proxy rules; and (3) several based on section 16 (b), which provides for private actions to recover "shortswing" profits by corporate insiders.
The first of the fraud cases is Kardos» v, National Gypsum 00., a
private action for damages based on section 10 (b) of the act and rule
X-10B-5 thereunder . All the stock of Western Board & Paper Co. had
been owned in equal amounts by two individuals named Kardon and
two named Slavin. While all four were officers and directors of the
company, its affairs were managed by the Slavins. The Kardons
claimed that they were defrauded because the Slavins induced them
to sell their stock to the Slavins without the latter disclosing their negotiations (1) for the sale of certain assets of Western to the defendant National Gypsum Co. and (2) for the execution of certain contracts between the Slavins and National Gypsum Co. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss which, among other things, raised the
following two questions: (1) Whether an individual right of action
exists for damages resulting from a violation of section 10 (b) and
rule X-10B-5; (2) whether section 10 (b) of the act was intended to
apply to the securities of a closely held corporation.
The Commission filed a brief as amicus curiae on these two points.
On the first it argued that an individual may maintain such an action
either (a) by application of the general common law rule that members
of a class for whose protection a statutory duty is created may sue for
injuries resulting from its breach and that the common law will supply
a remedy if the statute gives none, or (b) under section 29 (b) of the
act, which provides that contracts in violation of any provision of the
act shall be void. On the second point, the Commission argued that,
while the primary concern of Congress was undoubtedly with corporations having widely distributed securities, the statute was intended
to apply also to the securities of closely held corporations. The court
denied the defense motion to dismiss, relying on the position takeu by
the Commission on both points."
The Kardon. decision was followed in Slavin Y. Germantouni Fire
Insuranoe 0.0.,41 in Fifty Third Union Trust 00. v, Block 48 and in
Fry v, Sohumaker."
The Commission participated as amicus curiae
in all these cases.
Another fraud case is Speed v. Tramsamerioa Oorp., which was still
pending at the close of the year.50 There the Commission appeared
before the district court to urge that, when a corporate "insider" (in

holders
without disclosing to them material facts comrng to hIS attention by
virtue of his position, there is a violation of section 10 (b) of the act
and rule X-10B-5. A second point in the Commission's brief in the
Speed case was based on the principle established a .few. months before
in the Kardon case-that a private person may maintain an action on
his own behalf for damages claimed to arise from a violation of
section 10 (b) and rule X-lOB-5. A defense motion for summary
judgment was sustained on one count, but was dismissed on the counts
as to which the Commission participated.
The final two fraud actions in which the Commission participated as
amicus curiae were Acker v. David A. Schulte and Sohmolka v, David
A. Schulte. These were separate actions by individual stockholders of
Park & Tilford, Inc. against the company, its former president, and
various other individuals for damages resulting from the alleged
manipulation of the stock of the company on the New York Stock
Exchange in violation of sections 9 and 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Section 9 (e), which creates a civil right of action
for persons who suffer damages as a result of a violation of the antimanipulation provisions of section 9, provides that the court, in its
discretion, may require an undertaking for the payment of costs from
either party. The defendants filed motions demanding security for
costs on the ground that the suits had not been brought in good faith.
The Commission filed a brief in opposition to these motions, arguing
that section 9 (e) was designed to afford public investors a more
effective remedy for recovering damages than existed at common law
and that, in order to preclude the statutory provision from operating
as a barrier to suits under section 9 (e), the party seeking security
for costs should be required to show by clear evidence that the suit had
been brought in bad faith. The court, following this theory, denied
the defense motions. In view of this ruling, the court found it unnecessary to consider whether security could be ordered under section
9 (e) where the action is brought also under section 10, which does not
contain a provision authorizing the requiring of security for costs,"
The first of the proxy cases in which the Commission intervened
as amicus curiae during the year was Doyle v. Milton. This was an
action by a stockholder of the Equity Corp., a registered investment
comPll:ny, designed primarily to restrain the use of proxy soliciting
material alleged to be false and misleading and therefore in violation
of rule X-14A-5. The question presented was whether a proxy statement is false or misleading if it fails to state all possible alternatives
to a course of action for which the management seeks approval. Upon
the request of the court the Commission filed a memorandum taking
a position in the negative. This position was sustained,"
The sec0Il:dpro~y case was Tate v. Sonotone, also based on allegedly
false and misleading proxy material, The Commission was requested
by the district c~mrt for advice on whether the court had jurisdiction
to entertarn a suit by a private party under section 14 (a), upon which
the proxy rules are based. A member of the Commission's staff appeared and orally advised the court in the affirmative

Under section 16 (b) of the act, if a corporation has an equity security registered on a national securities exchange, any profit realized by
its officers, directors or principal stockholders on purchases and sales of
any of the corporation's equity securities within any 6-month period
may be recovered by the corporation or by any security holder in its
behalf. Two of these private section 16 (b) actions in which the Commission participated
as amicus curiae were Kogan v. DUI/)id A.
8chulte,54 and Park &1 Tilford, Inc. v, Arthur D. Schulte,55 both of
which arose from the same series of transactions as formed the basis
of Acker v, DUI/)idA. Schulte and Sohmolka v, David A. Sohulte, the
fraud actions discussed above. In the preceding fiscal year the district
court had held that the conversion of preferred stock into common by
a controlling stockholder within 6 months prior to a sale of common by
him was a purchase of the common within the meaning of section
16 (b).
This holding was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals in the
Park &1 Tilford case during the current year.56 The circuit court's ruling also (1) reversed the district court holding denying Kogan, a
minority stockholder, the right to intervene in the Park &1 Tilford
case, and (2) increased the measure of recovery awarded by the district court. On the intervention question, the circuit court held that
the defendants and their father were so dominant in the affairs of the
plaintiff corporation that it was proper to permit Kogan's intervention in order to assure adequate representation of the interests of the
minority stockholders.
On the question of damages, the amount recoverable by the corporation under the statute is the proceeds of the
sale of the stock minus the purchase price. The district court computed
this to be $302,145. This figure was arrived at by taking the market
value of the common into which the preferred had been converted
as the "purchase" price, and deducting that gross figure from the
proceeds of the sale. The circuit court recomputed the recoverable
profit to be $418,128 on the ground that the "purchase" price was not
the market value of the common acquired on conversion, but rather the
lower market value of the preferred on the conversion date. A petition for rehearing based solely on the increase in the amount of the
judgment was denied, one judge dissenting."
Another section 16 (b) action in which the Commission had filed
a brief as amicus curiae during the preceding fiscal year was Gratz
v, Olaughton, in which the defendant contested the venue of the action.
The Commission expressed the view that the statute should be construed to provide as many alternative choices of venue as could rea.sonably be implied from the language of the act in order to accomplish the legislative purpose. Otherwise, the Commission argued,
a stockholder might be faced with the burden of bringing his suit
in a court distant from the place where the significant acts occurred.
In line with this construction the Commission took the position that
it was proper to lay the venue in the place where the transactions
occurred. This position was sustained by the court,"

involved in the Grossman case. The first related to the 2-year limitation on actions provided in section 16 (b). The defendant had been
delinquent in filing the reports of changes in ownership of stock required by section 16 (a), and the Commission took the position that
the time during which he had failed to make these disclosures required
by the statute should not be included in the 2-year period. The second point was the construction of the provision of section 16 (b)
which gives a security holder the right to bring a suit for the recovery
of "Short-swing" profits on behalf of his corporation only if the
corporation itself fails to bring the suit within 60 days after request.
The Commission argued that, where the right of action might be
jeopardized by waiting the full60-day period or where the corporation
has indicated that it does not intend to institute the action, there is
no need for an individual security holder to wait until the expiration
of the full 60-day period before instituting the action on behalf of
the corporation."
In Berkey &: Gay Furniture 00. v. Wigmore 61 the Commission participated as amicus curiae on the question of the right of an individual
stockholder to intervene in a section 16 (b) action where the corporation itself has already instituted suit. The case was still pending
at the end of the fiscal year.
There were in addition several section 16 (b) actions over which
the Commission maintained close observation during the course of
the year, as is its practice, but in which no active participation was
necessary since no question of statutory construction arose."

ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY
HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935
The Public Utility Holding Company A.ct of 1935 was enacted for
the purpose of eliminating certain evils and abuses which the Congress
found to exist in connection with the activities of holding companies
having subsidiaries which are electric utility companies, or which are
engaged in the retail distribution of natural or manufactured gas. It
was particularly designed to eliminate holding companies serving no
useful purpose and thus to afford to the operating companies the ad.
vantages of localized management and to strengthen local regulation.
This objective finds its most direct expression in section 11 of the
act. Section 11 (b) (1) requires the operations of holding company
systems to be limited to one or more integrated systems and to such
additional businesses as are reasonably incidental or economically
necessary or appropriate to the operation of the integrated systems.
Section 11 (b) (2) requires elimination of undue complexities in
corporate structures of holding company systems and the redistribution of voting power among their security holders on a fair and equitable basis. The act provides also for the registration of holding
companies (sec. 5); regulation of security transactions of holding
companies and their subsidiaries (sees, 6 and 7) ; regulation of acquisitions of securities and utility assets by. holding companies and
their subsidiaries (sees. 9 and 10) t regulation of sales of public utility
securities or assets, payment of dividends, solicitation of proxies, intercompany loans and other intrasystem transactions (sec. 12) ; control
of services, sales, and construction contracts (sec. 13) ; and the control
of accounting practices (sec. 15).
Following the pattern of recent years, activity under the Holding
Company A.ct has centered largely around plans for integration and
reorganization filed under section 11 and the issuance of securities
under sections 6 and 7.
INTEGRATION AND CORPORATE SIMPLIFICATION UNDER SECTION 11
Litigation Arising Under the Act

In November 1946 the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality
of section 11 (b) (2) in proceedings involving Commission orders requiring the dissolution of American Power & Light Co. and Electric
Power & Light Co.' This section requires registered holding companies and their subsidiaries to eliminate unnecessary corporate complexities and any unfair or inequitable distribution of voting power
.among their security holders. The court held that section 11 (b) (2)
was a reasonable exercise of congressional power under the commerce
clause of the Constitution; that it did not embody an unconstitutional

delegation of legislative authority; that the due process clause of the
fifth amendment was not violated; and that the Commission's findings
were amply supported by the record. In March 1946 the Supreme
Court had sustained the constitutionality of section 11 (b) (1) of
the act,"
A list of all instances in which the Commission appeared in the
Federal courts during the fiscal year in connection with proceedings
under the Holding Company Act, either as a party or as amicus curiae,
and the status of these cases at the end of the year is set forth in the
appendix.
In the following cases, decided by the courts during the fiscal year,
the courts discussed various aspects of the adminstration of the Holding Company Act.
American Power & Light Oompany v, S. E. O.s-American Power
& Light Co. petitioned for review of an order of the Commission requiring Florida Power & Light Co., a subsidiary of American, to
amortize certain items classified as plant acquisition adjustments (account 100.5) aggregating approximately $10,500,000, and to classify
as plant adjustments (account 107) and charge to earned surplus
approximately $1,800,000. A.smore fully set out in the section dealing
with regulation of utility accounts, the court upheld the power of
the Commission to regulate the accounting practices of an intrastate
public utility subsidiary of a registered holding company, and held
that the Commission's order was amply supported by Its findings and
by the facts in the record.
In re Blatchley, Blatchley v, S. E. 0., and Goldfine v. S. E. 0.4_
The Commission approved a plan of New England Public Service Co.
under section 11 (e) of the act under which the company proposed to
sell certain nonutility assets, and filed an application for enforcement
in the District Court of the United States for the District of Maine.
In the district court proceedings all security holder representatives
urged approval of the plan. Enforcement was opposed by one Goldfine who desired to bid for the properties to be sold. The district court
entered an enforcement order and thereafter Goldfine and-one Blatchley, a preferred stockholder who had not appeared in the Commission
or district court proceedings, filed in the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the First Circuit petitions for review of the Commission's order under
section 24 (a) of the act, appealed from the district court enforcement
order, and filed certain other petitions and motions in the district court
and in the Circuit Court of Appeals. The Circuit Court of Appeals
dismissed the petitions to review the Commission's order for lack of
jurisdiction, in view of the enforcement proceedings in the district
court. The appeals from the district court enforcement order were
dismissed upon the ground that Goldfine, not a stockholder but a
prospective bidder, and Blatchley, a stockholder who did not appear
below, had no standing to appeal from such orders.

Delimited, in substance, to the cost of such securities. In S. E. O. v.
Ohenery Corporation; 318 U. S. 80, the Supreme Court had held that
the Commission's order could not be sustained on the judicial grounds
stated in its findings and opinion, and had directed that the case be
remanded to the Commission for further proceedings. On remand,
the Commission reexamined the problem in the light of the Supreme
Court opinion and reached the same result. The Commission's decision was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia. In June 1947 the Supreme Court reversed the
Court of Appeals and upheld the decision of the Commission. The
Supreme Court held that the Commission, which had not previously
been confronted with the problem of management trading during reorganization, had the power to deal with the problem on a case-to-case
basis. The court found that the Commission had made a thorough
examination of the problem, utilizing statutory standards and its own
accumulated experience with reorganization matters; that it had considered properly the subtle factors involved in the marketing of utility
company securities, and the dangers of abuse of corporate position, influence and access to information involved in the management purchases; and that the Commision's action had been based upon substantial evidence and was consistent with the authority granted by Congress. Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Jackson dissented in
an opinion anounced in October 1947.
In re Oommwnity Gas and Power Oompany and American Gas and
Power Oompany.6-By orders issued in February 1946 and in January
1947, the Commission approved a plan which provided, among other
things, for the reorganization of American Gas & Power Co. and for the
allocation, to the holders of its secured debentures, common stock and
warrants to purchase common stock, of shares of a new common stock
to be issued under the plan. Certain representatives of debenture holders objected to court enforcement of the plan primarily upon the
ground that the Commission had no power to approve a plan for the
satisfaction of secured debentures in common stock. Following In re
Standard Gas and Electric OO'lTl/fJany,7
the district court held that
a plan for distribution in kind to secured debenture holders may be
approved by the Commission, and that in the particular case it was an
appropriate and fair method for effecting compliance with the act.
Appeals from this decision were taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit and are ]?ending there. Consummation of the
plan was stayed by the Circuit Court of Appeals pending determination of the appeals.
In 1'6 Electric Bond and Share Oompany.8-In
September 1946 the
Commission issued an order under section 11 (e) of the act approving a
plan (plan II-A) for the retirement of the preferred stock of Electric Bond & Share Co., and an order under section 11 (b) (2) of the
act requiring Bond & Share to eliminate preferred stock from its capital structure. Enforcement proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which had been
instituted in connection with a prior plan for partial payment of the
preferred stock, were reopened on the Commission's supplemental ap'71F.Supp.171

plication. Objections to enforcement of plan II-A by common and
preferred stockholders of Bond & Share were overruled by the district
court. The exclusion of a common stockholder from personal participation in the Commission hearing was held to be supported by the
record showing obstructive conduct; since he had the right to be represented by counsel, to submit his own views in writing and to attend
the proceedings as a spectator so long as he behaved himself, the court
held that he had been accorded his full constitutional and statutory
rights to a fair hearing. The court further held that in a section 11
(e) enforcement proceeding, the district court acts as a reviewing
authority and may not add to the record made before the Commission
on the question whether the plan is fair and equitable and appropriate.
Absent a specific offer of proof, together with a showing that the new
evidence proferred is material to the issue, that reasonable grounds
exist for failure to adduce it at the Commission hearing, and that its
consideration by the Commission would be advisable, there is no basis
for referring the matter to the Commission for further consideration.
The court after considering all objections held that the plan was fair
and equitable and appropriate to effectuate the provisions of section
11 in providing for the retirement of the preferred stock, with immediate payment to preferred stockholders of their liquidation preference and issuance to them of certificates evidencing a contingent right
to receive additional amounts, and for the sale by Bond & Share of
certain portfolio securities, with rights offerings to common stockholders, in order to raise cash required for such payments.
Appeals taken and petitions for review of the Commission orders
filed by the common stockholder were dismissed by the Circuit Court
of Appeals as being without merit.
In re Engineers Publio Service Oompany.9-The Commission had
approved a plan for the liquidation of Engineers Public Service Co.,
which provided among other things for payment in cash to preferred
stockholders of amounts equal to the call price of their shares. Certain
holders of common stock of Engineers opposed court enforcement of
this aspect of the plan. The district court held that the plan was
unfair in providing for payment to the preferred stockholders of
more than their involuntary liquidation preference. The district
court made its own independent examination of the preferred stock,
with particular emphasis on its issue price and market history. Accepting the Commission's conclusions that the present investment
value of the preferred stock was at least equal to the call price, the
court held that this was not a controlling factor, but that participation
should be accorded to the various security holders in accordance with
a standard of "colloquial equity."
Except in this respect the dissolution plan was approved, and pursuant to the court order Engineers has paid to its preferred stock• 71 F. Supp, 797 (Del. 1947).

holders amounts equal to the involuntary liquidation preference of
their shares and has set aside in escrow additional amounts to cover
the maximum payable in the event that the district court's decision is
reversed. Appeals were taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit by the Commission and by certain preferred stockholders. and are now pending,
Laddv. Brickley.lo-In March 1946the Commission approved a plan
proposed by Brickley, trustee for International Hydroelectric System appointed pursuant to section 11 (d) of the Holding Company
Act, for the settlement of claims of International Hydro against International Paper Co. The settlement was approved in June 1946
by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
Certain junior security holders of International Hydro appealed on
the ground that the settlement was inadequate. The Circuit Court of
Appeals noted that the settlement had been approved by the Commission, by the district judge, and by the majority of those interested
in the company. The court's opinion reviewed the claims asserted
by International Hydro against International Paper, the defenses to
those claims, and the investigation of them by the Commission and the
trustee. The court held that the district judge was not required to
estimate separately the probable success of each claim and defense,
and that findings of ultimate fact that the compromise is for the best
interests of the estate, that the consideration payable thereunder was
fair, reasonable and adequate, and that adequate notice and opportunity to be heard had been given to all persons interested, were
adequate to support the district court's order.
Lahti v. New England Power A88ociation.Jl-Pursuant
to section 11
(e) the Commission approved, and the United States District Court for
the District of Massachusetts approved and enforced, a plan for the
reorganization of New England Power Association and its five subholding companies. A number of security holders of the companies
affected challenged on appeal the fairness and equity of the allocations proposed in the plan. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that
the findings of fairness by the Commission and the district court could
not be upset by the Circuit Court of Appeals unless they were shown
to be without rational basis in fact or to be predicated on a clear-cut
error of law. In determining the equitable equivalent of the rights
surrendered, the court stated that consideration must be given to the
entire set of rights and limitations of the security to be surrendered
in the business context of the issuer, apart from the impact of section
11, and that a comparison of earnings prospects is the primary factor
to be considered in making the determination. The court reviewed
the comparisons made and law applied by the Commission, and accepted the judgment of the Commission and the district court that the

plan accorded fair and equitable treatment to holders of the securities represented by objectants.
In re United Gas Oorp01'ation.12-InNovember 1944 the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware had approved and
enforced a plan for the reorganization of United Gas Corp., a public
utility subsidiary of Electric Bond & Share Co. and Electric Power &
Light Corp.18 A minority common stockholder of Bond & Share
appealed from the injunctive provisions of the district court's enforcement order, enjoining any action interfering with the plan, including
the prosecution of proceedings in other tribunals. The Circuit Court
of Appeals held that the injunction met the requirements of the Holding Company Act and of the judicial code, and was appropriate to
avoid a multiplicity of law suits and to permit the prompt, unimpeded
execution of the plan of reorganization, objectives plainly within the
purview of the relevant statutes.
Divestments Under Section II

During the year holding companies divested themselves of 31 subsidiaries with assets of $1,978,000,000. This brings the total of such
divestments since December 1,1935, to $8,051,000,000. Of this amount,

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The common stocks of five small utility subsidiaries were sold to
the public through underwriters.
Two additional divestments were
brought about by reorganization which removed the subsidiary from
the control of the parent. The remaining divestments were carried out
by private sales to individuals, public bodies or other utility companies.
Noteworthy progress has also been witnessed in the simplification
of corporate structures and redistribution of voting power of holding
company systems under section 11 (b) (2). Because of the fact that
in many cases dissolution of unnecessary holding companies cannot
take place until a series of involved transactions has been consummated,
it is difficult to provide a precise statistical measure of the over-all
simplification which has been achieved. The following table, however,
covering the period from June 15, 1938, to June 30, 1946, indicates the
sharp reduction which has taken place in the total number of holding
companies, and utility and non utility subsidiary companies subject to the Holding Company Act. This reflects the simplification
which has occurred as a result of compliance with both the geographic
integration requirements of section 11 (b) (1) and the corporate
simplification requirements of section 11 (b) (2).

Plan I is concerned primarily with the creation of a new water
works holding company to be known as American Water Works Co.,
Inc. Two subholding companies, Community Water Service Co. and
Ohio Cities Water Corp., will be dissolved and the new holding company will then own directly or indirectly substantially all of the
water works properties in the American system. Ten-year serial debentures of the new company- in the amount of $15,000,000are to be
sold to John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. and approximately
2,500, 000 shares of common stock are to be sold at competitive
bidding,"
,
Plan II, which is to be undertaken after the consummation of plan
I, proposes the liquidation of American. Thus, after se~egation of
the water compames in a new system, the remaining subsidiaries will
be controlled by the West Penn Electric Co., now a subholding company in the American system. Under plan II American will payoff
in cash its bank loan notes and preferred stock and will distribute
its residual assets to its common stockholders. The question as to
whether the preferred stock shall be retired at its liquidation price of
$100 per share or at some gEeater amount has not been determined.
The plan provides that certificates of contingent interest in any such
additional payment shall be distributed to preferred stockholders if
final determination of this question has not been made at the time
plan II becomes effective.
Community and Ohio Cities have outstanding preferred stocks with
substantial dividend arrearages, and the Commission has determined
that the equitable equivalent of such shares is $180 per share and
$159per share respectively, plus, in each case, an allowance for accrued
dividends from October 31, 1945 to the effective date of the plan.
Holders of these preferred stocks are to be given the option of receiving the amounts due them in cash or in new common stock of
American Water Works Co., Inc., on the basis of the initial public
offering price.
Cities Service Co.

In November 1946 Cities Service Co. (Cities) filed a plan for the
simplification of its corporate structure pursuant to section 11 (e).
Extended hearings and conferences were held and during the course
of the proceeedirigs Cities amended its plan to meet objections and
proposals for modification. On April 24, 1947, the Commission approved the amended plan 16 and on May 27, 1947, the district court ISsued an order enforcing it. The amended plan has since been consummated.
Briefly, the plan provided for the issuance by Cities of new debentures to the holders of its outstanding preferred and preference stocks
in a principal amount equivalent to their respective redemption prices
and in discharge of all the rights and claims of such security holders,
including their claim for dividend arrears. The plan also provided
for the unmediate retirement of approximately 40 percent of outstanding long-term debt and contemplated the applications of anticipated proceeds from the sale of certain subsidiary utility companies
to the retirement of the remaining outstanding long-term debt and
to the reduction of the outstanding amount of new debentures.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Pursuant to section 11 (b) (1) orders of the Commission, Cities has
made further progress in the divestment of its direct and indirect
interest in nonretainable utility companies. On August 29, 1946, the
Commission approved the liquidation and dissolution of Cities Service
Power & Light Co., a holding company subsidiary of Cities, and the
transfer of its 5 remaining subsidiaries to Cities. These subsidiaries
are expected to be divested promptly in accordance with the plan of
corporate simplification noted above. Since the original order of divestment was issued in May 1944, Cities has disposed of 5 direct and
40 indirect subsidiaries and has been engaged in a program of refinancing certain subsidiaries preparatory to divestment. Elimination of other subsidiaries is planned through a series of mergers and
consolidations.
Federal Light & Traction Co. (Federal), formerly a subsidiary
holding company of Cities Service Power & Light Co. and now a
direct subsidiary of Cities, has filed a section 11 (e) plan proposing
its liquidation and dissolution. Under the plan of liquidation presently pending before the Commission, Federal proposes, among other
things (1) the immediate cash payment to preferred stockholders of
their liquidating preferences ($100 per share plus accrued unpaid
dividends), (2) the deposit in escrow of the call premium of $10 per
share pending determination of the additional amounts, if any, to
which the preferred stockholders are entitled, and (3) the pro rata
distribution to common stockholders of its investment in its two
remaining subsidiaries plus $11 per share in cash.
In addition to the pending divestments referred to above, the disposition of three direct subsidiaries and an indirectly owned gas distribution system of Cities is required in order to comply fully with
Commission orders. However, Cities has indicated that it intends
to apply for an exemption order permitting the company to retain
its interest in these remaining companies.
The Commonwealth & Southern Corp.

During the year under review Commonwealth & Southern carried
out a number of transactions in furtherance of a general program for
compliance with section 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2) of the act. This
general program was set forth in a plan dated March 25, 1946 submitted by Commonwealth." That plan, in brief, had as its objectives:
(a) That the northern operating subsidiaries become independent
operating companies whose common stocks would be held by the
public; (b) that the common stocks of the southern operating subsidiaries be transferred to a new holding company, the Southern Co.,
which would thereafter continue to own and hold such securities; and
(c) that Commonwealth thereafter liquidate and dissolve by making
distributions of its assets to holders of its preferred stock and common
stock. Although this plan has been superseded by a new plan filed
July 30, 1947, the general objectives of Commonwealth are substantially unchanged.
.
While the plan filed in March 1946 set forth the pattern proposed
by Commonwealth for compliance with section 11, the company stated
that it proposed to carry out the various transactions incidental thereto
by filing separate plans or applications. Among the transactions

were the issuance and sale at competitive bidding of additional common stock by Ohio Edison Co. in June 1946 and bY'Consumers Power
Co. in November 1946, primarily to provide funds for construction
and also to establish public markets in these common stocks to facilitate the over-all plan. Another incidental step was the repurchase
and retirement by Commonwealth of 40,753 shares of its preferred
stock during the period October to December 1946 through use of
approximately $5,000,000 of treasury funds.
Another plan filed by Commonwealth as part of its over-all program provided for the transfer of its interests in Alabama Power
Co., Georgia Power Co., Gulf Power Co., Mississippi Power Co., and a
nonutility subsidiary, Savannah River Electric Co., to the Southern
Co. In connection with this plan Commonwealth and the Southern
Co., agreed, subject to the Commission's approval of the plan and its
finding that the electric properties of the four southern operating
companies constitute a single integrated public utility system retainable under common control: (a) That Commonwealth will dispose of
its direct or indirect interests in all subsidiaries other than the four
operating companies and Savannah River Electric Co. to be transferred
to the Southern Co.; (b) that Commonwealth and the Southern Co.
will cause the disposition of their direct or indirect interests in the gas
and transportation properties of Alabama Power, Georgia Power,
and Gulf Power; and (e) that Commonwealth will dispose of any
remaining interest in Southern as soon as possible after retiring the
Commonwealth preferred stuck.
On August 1, 1947, the Commission approved this plan subject to
certain conditions, and in its findings concluded, among other things,
that the electric properties of Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf
Power, and Mississippi Power constitute a single integrated public
utility system retainable under common control."
Still another section 11 plan was filed by Commonwealth which
provided for a voluntary exchange of a portion of the portfolio common stocks held by Commonwealth for a maximum of 400,000 shares
of its preferred stock. This plan was approved by the Commission
on April 11, 1947,tDand the common stocks of Consumers Power Co.,
Ohio Edison Co. and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Co. were
thereupon offered in exchange for preferred stock of Commonwealth.
However, Commonwealth subsequently stated that the response to this
offer had not been satisfactory and that this voluntary plan had been
abandoned.
On July 30, 1947 Commonwealth submitted a new plan under section 11 (e) which provides, in brief: (a) That the common stocks of
two northern operating companies, Consumers Power Co. and Central Illinois Li~ht Co., will be distributed in full discharge of all of
Commonwealth s preferred stock; (b) that the preferred stock will
also receive a specified cash payment on account of dividend arrearages; (c) that the common stock of the Southern Co. and Ohio Edison Co. will be distributed to holders of Commonwealth's common
stock; and (d) that Commonwealth will liquidate and dissolve. Commonwealth has stated that this new plan supersedes the plan dated
March 25, 1946, earlier mentioned.

Electric Bond & Share Co.

When the parent of this system, Electric Bond & Share Co. (Bond &
Share), registered under the act in 1938, it controlled 121 domestic
subsidiaries including 5 major subholding companies: American
Power & Light Co. (American) ; American & Foreign Power Co., Inc.
(Foreign Power); American Gas & Electric Co. (American Gas);
Electric Power & Light Corp. (Electric); and National Power &
Light Co. (National).
Of these, the American Gas system ceased
to be a subsidiary of Bond & Share during the past year, and National
disposed of substantially all of its interests in electric and gas utility
companies. By June 30, 1947 Bond & Share had divested itself of
78 direct and indirect subsidiaries having assets of $1,650,000,000and
had filed plans calling for the retirement of its preferred stocks and
the divestment of all its remaining public utility investments in the
United States 20 in order to become, prospectively, an investment
company.
Pursuant to plans approved by the Commission and by the district
court, Bond & Share has paid an aggregate of $100 per share to the
holders of its $5 and $6 preferred stocks and in addition delivered to
each of such holders a certificate evidencing his right to receive any
additional amounts which the Commission or the courts may approve
or direct," Funds for these payments were derived from a bank
loan and from disposition of all of its holdings of the common stock
of Pennsylvania Power & Light Co. and substantially all of its holdings of American Gas common stock, principally by means of rights
offered to Bond & Share's common stockholders. As a result of such
disposition Bond & Share ceased to be a holding company with respect
to both Pennsylvania and American Gas. In addition, the company
proposes to dispose of its holdings of Carolina Power & Light Co. and
Birmingham Electric Co., the proceeds from such disposition to be
used to retire its bank loan. The Commission has already authorized
the sale of Carolina Power & Light Co. common stock.22
On November 25, 1946,the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of section 11 (b) (2) of the act 23 and affirmed the Commission's
order of August 22, 1942, which directed the dissolution of American
and Electric." During the year American and its subsidiaries took
the following major steps toward compliance with section 11:
On September 6, 1946, American, joined by Bond & Share, filed a
plan providing for the retirement of American's $5 and $6 preferred
stocks either through an exchange for portfolio securities or for cash;"
The plan also provides for the compromise and settlement of certain
claims between American and its subsidiaries and Bond & Share and
certain of its subsidiaries. Under the plan American would dispose
of all of its interest in Texas Utilities Co. as required by the Commission's order permitting the creation of that company." Beginning on
October 22, 1946, hearings on the plan were held from time to time
and concluded as to all major issues on March 11, 1947. A common

a plan proposing the allocation of .American's portfolio securities
among the company's preferred and common stockholders. Briefs
were exchanged and on May 27,1947, the two plans were argued before
the Commission.
On April 24, 1947,the Commission authorized the merger of Northwestern Electric Co. into Pacific Power & Light Co. and the retirement of the two companies' preferred stocks through a new preferred stock issue by Pacific, the survivor."
Subsequently, Pacific
refunded its debt and the debt of Northwestern which has been assumed under the merger agreement."
The compromise section 11 (e) plan filed by Electric Power &
Light Corp. and Bond & Share, described in the last annual report,
was pending before the Commission at the end of the fiscal year.29
Hearings have been completed and the plan has been briefed and
argued.
American Gas has divested itself of all holdings in companies held
to be unretainable under section 11 with the exception of the common
stock of Atlantic City Electric Co. The Commission has approved
a plan for the disposition of Atlantic City whereby .American Gas
will divest itself of all interest in that company by December 31,
1948.30 The Commission also approved the acquisition by American
Gas of the common stock of Indiana Service Corp., holding that the
latter company might properly be considered. a part of the Central
System approved by the Commission during 1946.31
The plan of reorganization filed by .Foreign Power under section
11 (e) of the act on October 26, 1944, in which Bond & Share joined,"
was amended by a plan of reorganization filed on May 22, 1947, in
which Bond & Share also joined." The proceedings were reconvened
and hearings on the amended plan began on June 24,1947. On July
16, 1947, the record in the proceedings was closed on all matters except as to certain fees and expenses, and counsel for parties and participants agreed on a program for submission of briefs -and for oral
argument.
Engineers Public Service Co.

This system at the time of its registration in February 1938 had
included 20 subsidiaries with consolidated assets of $370,000,000.
Operations were conducted in 13 States. During the past year the
Commission approved a plan for the sale and distribution of nearly
all the assets of Engineers and for its dissolution. A certificate of
dissolution was filed and recorded on June 30, 1947, and Engineers'
only remaining asset consists of about 5 percent of the common stock
of Virginia Electric & Power Co.
The plan originally filed by Engineers in this matter provided for
the retirement of its preferred stocks at their voluntary liquidating
price of $100 plus accrued. dividends. Funds to retire the preferred

common stockholders of Engineers, and from a bank loan of $3,000,000. The bank loan was to be repaid over a 3-year period, and it was
proposed that the common stock of Virginia Electric & Power Co.
be retained by the liquidating trustees of Engineers as security for
such loan. The common stock of EI Paso Electric Co. (Texas) was
to be distributed to Engineers' common stockholders as a part of the
plTte Commission issued its findings and opinion regarding this plan
on December 5, 1946.34 Approval of the bank loan was WIthheld on
the grounds that funds could readily be obtained from other sources
which would not prolong for 3 years the control of the $65,000,000 assets of Virginia Electric & Power Co. The Commission also found that
the impact of section 11 was responsible for the dissolution of Engineers and that the charter provisions for retirement of its preferred
stock thus did not apply. An examination was accordingly made of
the investment value of such stock. It was found that this value was
at least equal to the respective call prices of the various series of preferred stock, and Engineers' proposal to retire these shares at $100
plus accrued dividends was denied approval.
Engineers subsequently filed an amended plan eliminating the bank
loan and providing for distribution to its common stockholders of the
common stock of Virginia as well as that of EI Paso. The amended
plan also provided for retirement of the preferred stock at the respective call prices. The plan as amended was approved oy the Commission on January 8, 194'7,35and an application was filed in the district
court to enforce and carry out, the plan. On May 15, 194'7,the court
disapproved that part of the plan calling for the payment of the full
voluntary redemption prices, but permitted consummation of the plan
by the payment of $100 plus accrued dividends to the preferred stocks
and the escrowing of an amount sufficient to cover the difference between the involuntary liquidation price and the voluntary redemption
prices in the event that it should be determined, on appeal, that the
preferred stockholders were entitled to the larger amounts. The
amount escrowed also made provision for interest on the escrowed
premiums and for fees and other expenses connected with the plan."
As indicated earlier, the Commision and others have appealed from
the decree of the court, and these appeals are now pending in the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
General Public Utilities Corp. (Formerly

Associated Gas & Electric Corp.)

At the time the Associated Gas & Electric system registered under

During the past fiscal year four former subholding companies in the
system were dissolved: Associated Utilities Co., Gas & Electric Associates, General Gas & Electric Corp. and NY P A NJ Utilities Co.
A recapitalization plan pursuant to section 11 (b) (2) was consummated by New England Gas & Electric Association (NEGAS) which
resolved complex claims and counterclaims between NEGAS and
various companies in the Associated system. As indicated in the
Twelfth Annual Report of the Commission, an amended plan was developed through discussion by all interested parties which was approved by the Commission and the appropriate district court. The
plan called for the public sale of debentures and common stock the
latter at not less than $11 per share or, at the option of GPU, whose
claims were affected by such price, at not less than $10 per share.
When it developed that even the lesser amount could not be realized
for the NEGAS common, an alternate plan was filed providing for
the issuance of collateral trust bonds, convertible preferred stock
and common stock. This alternate plan was likewise the result of
discussions among all interested parties, including protective committees. In its findings and opinion the Commission indicated that
the use of preferred stock could be considered appropriate only in
the light of the imminent maturities of the outstanding NEGAS
debentures and the fact that the earlier amended plan was no longer
. feasible. 57 The plan was consummated during April 1947. After
the close of the fiscal year GPU sold at competitive bidding its holdings of NEGAS common which had been received under the plan.

New England Power Association (NEPA) system. The order of the
district court approving this plan was affirmed on appeal 42 and the
plan was consummated in June 1947. As a result of this plan four
subholding companies were merged with NEPA to form a new holding
company, New England Electric System (NEES).
A fifth subholding company was dissolved. The securities of NEES now consist of
$85,000,000 of funded debt and 6,695,075 shares of common stock, as
compared with the 18 classes of holding company securities previously
outstanding in the system.
Prior to consummation of the above plan, IHES owned 88 percent
of the NEP A. common stock representing 51.5 percent of the voting
power. IHES interest in NEES amounts to less than 8 percent of
the total voting power as a result of the redistribution provided for
in the plan.
The Middle West Corporation

Pursuant to a section 11 (b) (1) order of the Commission, the
Middle West Corp. (Middle West) was directed to divest itself of its
interest in all companies except Central Illinois Public Service Co.,
Kentucky Utilities Co., and Public Service Co. of Indiana, Inc.43
Hearings were held from time to time regarding the retainability by
Middle West of these latter three subsidiaries and raising issues as to
the continued existence of Middle West. In May 1947 the management of Middle West deemed it advisable for the benefit of the stockholders to dissolve the corporation and is presenting an appropriate
resolution to its stockholders for approval.
If such resolution is
approved, it is Middle West's intention to distribute or sell its remaining investments and assets.
During the prior fiscal year the Commission approved and the district court ordered enforcement of a plan of merger of Central & South
West Utilities Co. and its subsidiary, American Public Service Co.,
both subsidiaries of Middle West. The plan was consummated in
February 1947 and the surviving company, Central & South West Corp.
(Central), controls a group of operating companies whose electric
properties have been held to be an integrated system. Divestment of
certain nonutility properties remains to be carried out. Central is no
longer a subsidiary of Middle West by virtue of the distribution by
Middle West to its stockholders of the stock of Central received by it
under the plan.
An amended plan under section 11 (e) was filed by North West
Utilities Co. (North West) in February 1947 proposing to distribute
to its preference stockholders the common stock of Wisconsin Power

At the close of 1946,the $7 prior lien preferred stock of NEPSCO
bad dividend arrears of $71.31 per share and the $6 prior lien stock
had arrearages of $61.12 per share. In addition, NEPSCO had $6
and $7 series of so-called "plain preferred" with respective arrearages
of $88.25 and $102.95 per share. The plan in question called for the
retirement of the prior lien shares by cash payments at the call price
plus accrued dividends. It was also proposed that the ;r;>riorlien
stockholders have the option of taking common stock of Public Service
Co. of New Hampshire in lieu of cash. NEPSCO was not bound by
the plan to provide this option, however, if market or other conditions made disposition of the New Hampshire stock seem inadvisable.
NEPSCO had realized substantial capital gains from sale of its
industrial properties, as indicated in the Twelfth Annual Report, and
was entitled to the benefits under supplement R of the Internal Revenue
Code only if such funds were used for certain specified purposes within
a 24-month period.
One of the major objectives of the above plan was the utilization
of such funds in retirement of the prior lien stock by October 30,1947,
in order that NEPSCO would not incur a capital gains tax estimated
at $3,200,000. Thus in approving the plan on June 27, 1947,44the
Commission sought to minimize the possibilities of delay in its consummation by requiring that payment to prior lien stockholders be
limited to $100 per share plus accrued dividends and that an amount
corresponding to the aggregate call premium, the payment of which
was controversial, be placed in escrow.
The North American Co.

On January 6, 1947,the North American Co. (North American) submitted new plans," designated as plans I, II, and ill, pursuant to
section 11 (e) of the act, withdrawing plans previously submitted and
proposing: (a) the settlement of all system claims and counterclaims
affecting Illinois Power Co. and the liquidation and dissolution of
North American Light & Power Co. (Light & Power) ; (b) to obtain
funds to payoff bank loans and to make advances to enable Light &
Power to complete its liquidation; and (G) to effect the divestment
by North American of its entire public utility holding compally system. The portion of plan I pertaining to the settlement of the Illinois
Power Co. claims has been approved by the Commission 46 and has
been consummated. The remaining portion of plan I, as amended,
pertaining to the dissolution of Light & Power has been approved by
the Commission 47 and is presently under consideration by a court
upon application for judicial enforcement."
During the year North American has disposed of its interests in

year. In January 1947 United proposed to offer in exchange for each
share of its preference stock, to the extent of 200,000 such shares, (a)
four shares of common stock of Columbia Gas & Electric Corp., a subsidiary of United, and (b) $2 in cash. The Commission permitted
the withdrawal of this application and in June 1947 United filed a new
plan providing for the retirement of all of its preferred stock in exchange for a package of securities and cash, the character and amount
of which were to be disclosed by further amendment. This amendment was filed in July and provided that for each share of the preference stock of United there would be exchanged (a) one share of the
common stock of Public Service Electric & Gas Co. and (b) one-tenth
of a share of the common stock of South Jersey Gas Co., provided the
amended plan in the matter of Public Service Corp. of New Jersey
and its subsidiary companies should, in the interim, have become effective; otherwise, (a) one share of the common stock of Public Service Corp. of New Jersey, (b) one share of the common stock of Columbia Gas & Electric Corp., (c) one-fourth share of the COmmonstock
of the Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co., and (d) $6 in cash. 59
The United Light & Railways Co.

Since its registration in February 1938, this system has divested
itself of 38 of its 56 subsidiary companies and has reduced its area
of operation from 13 States to 7. These subsidiaries are grouped under
two subholding companies, one of which, American Light & Traction
Co. (American), filed a plan for its dissolution in 1945. As indicated
in the Twelfth Annual Report, the Commission withheld approval of
this plan on the grounds that it inadequately compensated the holders
of American's 6 percent cumulative noncallable preferred stock. Reargument has been heard on this question.
On September 20, 1946, the COmmission approved an application
which involved the investment by American of $310,000 in the common stock of Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co., its subsidiary, to
finance that company in securing autb.ority from the Federal Power
Commission to construct a natural gas pipe line from the Hugoton
Gas fields in Oklahoma to Michigan. In approving the application,

the Commission stated that this financing should not permit any delay
in the liquidation of American."
On June 26, 1947, Railways and .American filed a plan under
section 11 (e) which, in general, provides for (1) continuance, without
change in its capital stock structure, of American as a registered holding company owning a gas utility system consisting of the propert~es
of Michigan Consolidated Gas Co., Milwaukee Gas Light Co., MIlwaukee Solvay Coke Co., Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co., Austin
Field Pipe Line Co., and such additional properties as hereafter may
be acquired by American or its subsidiaries with the approval of
State and Federal regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over such
acquisition; (2) the disposition by American through distribution to
its stockholders and/or by sale to the public of its holdings of the
common stock of the Detroit Edison Co. and Madison Gas & Electric
Co.: and (3) disposition by Railways of its interests, direct or indirect, in, and its holdings of stock of, American and its subsidiaries,
including Madison Gas and Detroit Edison, through distribution to
Railways' common stockholders in dividends and through sale to the
public.
REGULATION OF SECURITY ISSUES
Volume of Financing

The past fiscal year witnessed a continuation of the high level of
activity in security issues under sections 6 (b) and 7 of the act. The
Commission declared effective 191 such applications and declarations 61
as against 197 during the previous year, representing a level nearly
twice as high as the average for the period 1935-45. The dollar amount
of securities covered by effective applications and declarations, however, declined from $2,374,865,967 in the year ended June 30, 1946, to
$1,148,696,608in fiscal 1947.
This decline was due largely to the shift in emphasis :from refunding issues to those sold :fornew money purposes, the latter type of issue
being ordinarily smaller than a refunding operation o:f the same company. While refunding issues accounted for about half of the entire
volume of effective applications and declarations during this past
year, their volume was only a fourth as large as that :for fiscal 1946.
It was to be expected that refundings would diminish in this way,
partly because most companies had already refinanced and partiy
because of firming tendencies in money rates. Moreover, the refundmg process became more expensive with the termination of excess
profits taxes, as unamortized debt discount and expense, as well as
call premiums on the refunded issues, had been deductible in computing
such taxes.
'There is shown below the break-down by type and purpose of issue,
of the securities covered by_effective filings during each of the past
2 years and :for the period November 1, 1935 to June 30, 1947:
eoHolding Company Act release No. 6905 (1946) .
.. At the beginning of the 1947 fiscal year.t 106 applications and declarations under sections 6 and 7 were pending and 228 were nled during the year. Of these. 234 were de.
clared effective. 4 were withdrawn, leaving 96 pending at the close of the fiscal year. Of

New Financing

New financing has assumed greater importance over the past year
than in any year since the effective date of the act. The heavy construction program now under way, which by responsible estimates will
increase the generating capacity of the electric utility industry by 30 to
40 percent within the next 5 years, gives promise that new financing
will increase still further in volume over this period. During the past
fiscal year new financing under sections 6 (b) and 7 was made up as

As indicated by the above table, notes and common stock were the
vehicles principally employed to raise new money. Of the note issues,
32 were placed with banks and insurance companies in an aggregate
amount of $88,821,000. The remaining 6 issues, amounting to $20,650,000, represented loans from the parent company. With respect
to common stock money, funds of parent companies bulked even larger.

88

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Twenty-five issues of common stock amounting to $88,002,566 were
purchased by parent companies leaving only 5 issues totaling
$30,348,473for sale to the public.
Although a large part of the funds needed for construction purposes has thus far been derived from parent companies and from internal sources such as depreciation reserves, it must be anticipated
that an increasing proportion of these needs will have to be met by
public financing. Such financing can, of course, alter materially the
existing capitalization ratios of an expanding company, and the increased volume of new money issues thus places upon the Commission
an enlarged responsibility for maintaining sound capital structures
in companies under its jurisdiction.
Particularly if the market for
junior securities is dull, the combined efforts of the industry, the
Commission, and other regulatory agencies will be required to keep
the issuance of debt securities within prudent bounds.
PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS FOR SENIOR SECURITIES

During recent years the Commission has evolved comprehensive
protective provisions relating to bonds and preferred stocks. These
provisions have been written into bond indentures or corporate charters, as the case may be, with respect to issues approved under sections
6 (b) and '( and have given new and wider protection to investors.
The extensive refunding program of the last few years has accelerated
the pace at which these provisions have been put into effect. However,
because many operating companies are being removed, under section
11, from the jurisdiction of this Commission, much of the prospective
new financing for construction purposes will not contain these provisions unless they are accorded the support of other regulatory
bodies as well.
These protective provisions cannot be set down in final, definitive
form, since they must retain the elasticity necessary for successful
adaptation to many different companies. Moreover, these provisions
and particularly the technicalities of legal phrasing in which they
find expression in the indenture are subject to continuous reexamination by the Commission. In outline, however, typical provisions and
some of the purposes which they are designed to serve are as follows:
Provisions Relating to Bond Issues

Issuance of additional bonils.-The issuance of additional bonds is
limited to 60 percent of the cost or fair value of net bondable additions
to fixed property. While the Commission endeavors to limit the
amount of debt initially outstanding to 50 percent of new fixed property, the standard of 60 percent with reference to additional bonds is
designed to give the issuer sufficient flexibility to meet future exigencies
while at the same time requiring it to provide a reasonable proportion
of junior capital in meeting its growth requirements. Issuance of
additional bonds is also conditioned 'upon the adequacy of the earnings
coverage for the entire amount of bonds to be outstanding.
This
coverage is computed on the basis of earnings before income taxes and
a coverage of at least two times is usually required.
"Net additions" are carefully defined to exclude from gross property
additions any property or cash certified or delivered to the trustee in
satisfaction of any other provisions of the mortgage, such as require-

THffiTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

89

ments of the maintenance and depreciation fund or the sinking fund.
Also excluded is the amount, if any, by which retirements exceed the
depreciation requirement of the maintenance and depreciation fund.
Property previously used as a basis for the issuance of additional bonds
is likewise deducted in arriving at "net additions."
M ainienance and depreciation fwnd.- The purpose of creating a
maintenance and depreciation fund is to assure, as certainly as possible, that the net value of the property securing the mortgage will
not decrease materially.
The issuer is required to set aside for this
fund each year either a fixed precentage (frequently 15 percent) of
gross operating revenues or a percentage of its fixed property.
This
amount is annually accounted for to the trustee in terms ofCash expended for maintenance.
(11)The cost or fair value of property used to replace property retired from
service.
(c) The cost Orfair value of property additions.
(It) Bonds secured by the mortgage and surrendered for cancelation.
(e) Cash deposited with the trustee.
(a)

Property used in accounting to the trustee under (b) and (a) above
may not be used for any other purpose under the indenture.
Sinking f'lJlfUi8.-The primary function of a sinking fund is to improve the ratio between debt and net property.
Thus It is particularly
necessary where, for one reason or another, a satisfactory ratio cannot
be obtained at the time securities are issued. The Commission ordinarily requires a sinking fund of 1 percent of the largest principal
amount of the issue at any time outstanding; where the initial ratio is
unfavorable, this percentage is increased. If the issuer is faced with
heavy serial payments on unsecured debt, the operation of the sinking
fund on the bonded debt is ordinarily postponed until a date subsequent
to that of the final serial maturity.
Since most utility companies are and have been under the necessity
of increasing their facilities and thus in constant need of cash for
such purposes, the Commission has seldom required that sinking funds
be operated on a cash basis. Instead, a company may certify property
additions, which may not then be used for any other purpose under the
mortgage.
The amount of certified property necessary to meet the
sinking fund requirements is made equivalent to that necessary for the
issuance of additional bonds, i. e., under the typical 60-percent provision, $1,666.67 of property must be certified in lieu of each $1,000 in
cash or surrendered bonds.
Dividend re8triations.-Dividends
on the common stock, with the
frequent exception of 1 year's dividend requirements, may be paid only
out of earned surplus accumulated subsequent to the date of the mortgage in order to prevent dissipation of the existing equity by excessive
dividend payments.
If operating expense for a given year has been
charged with maintenance and depreciation in an amount less than a
stipulated percentage of gross revenues or of fixed property, earned
surplus is further restricted by the amount of such deficiency. In
some cases the dividend restriction is based upon the company's net
income available for dividends~. as defined in the indenture, rather
than upon earned surplus. Ordinarily, these restrictions apply only
to common-stock dividends, but may be made applicable to preferred
as well.

90

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

Provisions Relating to Preferred

COMMISSION

Stock Issues

Defa:ult in dimidend payments.-Upon defaults aggregating 1 year's
dividends, the preferred stock as a class is given the rig-ht to elect a
majority of the board of directors.
Since preferred dividend arrearages bear no interest and since the disadvantages they bring upon the
common stockholder are not always sufficiently acute to insure maximum efforts in clearing such arrearages, the transfer of control upon
default is an essential minimum protection for preferred stockholders.
This provision becomes operative no later than the annual stockholders' meeting following the default and an earlier special meeting
may be called in some instances. When all dividend arrearages on
the preferred have been paid, control is returned to the common
stockholders.
Issuance of umseoured debt.-A majority vote of the preferred stock
is required as to the issuance of unsecured debt in excess of 10 percent
of the aggregate secured debt, capital, and surplus of the company.
This limitation is designed to protect the preferred from imposition
of excessive prior ranking debt while leaving to the management
reasonable latitude in temporary financing. A vote is not required,
however, if the unsecured debt is to be used for the retirement of preferred stock. Neither is the preferred given a vote with reference to
any issuance of secured debt, since the latter is circumscribed by indenture provisions which serve to protect the stockholder as well as the
creditor.
Issuance of prior ranking preferred stock.-A two-thirds vote of
the preferred stock is required before any prior ranking preferred
may be authorized.
Issuance 01 equally rarJcing preferred stook.-A two-thirds vote
of the preferred" stock is necessary to authorize the issuance of additional preferred of equal rank unless earnings coverage and common
stock equity meet certain standards after giving effect to the proposed issuance. These standards are1. Interest on long-term debt and dividend requirements on botb the present
and the new preferred must be covered at least 1% times.
2. Common stock and surplus must at least equal the combined involuntary
llquldatlng value of the present and the new preferred.

Merger 01' consolidation.-Since the position of a preferred stockholder may be prejudiced by merger with a financially unsound
company, a majority vote of the preferred stock is required to authorize a merger or consolidation.
Restriction on common. stock divideruls.-If
common stock equity
is or becomes less than 25 percent of total capitalization and surplus,
a dividend restriction on the common stock automatically becomes
operative.
This restriction is an important protection of the preferred stockholder's equity cushion.
Dividends are restricted as
follows:
1. If common equity is at least 20 percent but less than 25 percent, common
dividends may not exceed 75 percent of net income otherwise available for such
dividends.
2. If common equity is under 20 percent, common dividends are limIted to 50
percent of net income otberwise available for such dividends.
8. Except to the extent permitted in (1) and (2) above, no common dividend
may be paid which would reduce common equity to less than 2."ipercent of total
capitalization and surplus.
.

THIRTEENTH

Amendment of the articles of incorporation.-A two-thirds vote of
the preferred stock is required to change the terms and conditions of
such stock, the above protective provisions being examples, in any
manner substantially prejudicial to the preferred stockholder.
COMPETITIVE BIDDING

The past year has seen the first extended period in which the Commission's competitive bidding rule has been called upon to function
in a falling market. It has been recognized from the outset, of course,
that the competitive bidding procedure is not necessarily adapted
to all securities and all market conditions, and exemption provisions
were thus made an integral part of rule U-50. However, it has been
necessary to grant exemptions in only a few cases even under the
relatively unfavorable market conditions of the year just past.
Although the volume of offerings under rule U-50 dropped sharply
from the previous year, the total of $466,265,349 for the 12 months
ended June 30, 1947 was exceeded only in the 1945 and 1946 fiscal
years, when refunding operations were at their height," From the
standpoint of equity securities alone, the 1947 volume was surpassed only by that of 1946.
EXEMPTIONS FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACT

During the fiscal year the commission approved five applications for
exemption from the provisions of the act pursuant to sections 2 and 3.63
In addition, five orders were issued pursuant to section 5 (d) of the
act declaring that the registrations of certain holding companies had
been terminated."
Twenty-eight holding companies filed statements during the year
claiming exemption under rule U-2 as being predominantly operating
or intrastate companies. Ten banks claimed exemption pursuant to
rule U-3, and 21 small holding companies claimed exemption under
rule U-9.
REGULATION OF UTILITY ACCOUNTS

During the past year the Commission set up an original cost section
in its Public Utilities Division. The duty of this section is to examine
and review the filings which have been made pursuant to rule U.27.
This rule states that companies not required by the Federal Power
Corinnission or a State regulatory body to conform to a classification
of accounts must keep accounts according to systems prescribed by this
Commission. Among other things the prescribed systems of accounts
require that plant, property, and equipment be set forth on an original

cost basis. Extensive field investigations and examinations have been
made of the original cost reports submitted by some of the companies
subject to rule U-27. The results are nearing completion.
Long-standing orders of the Commission involving Florida Power
& Light CO.65with respect to certain accounting requirements were
affirmed on review by the circuit court." Florida is a subsidiary of
American Power <.~ Light Co. and Electric Bond & Share Co. The
Commission had ordered that, pending final determination under rule
U-27 of the total and the disposition to be made of the amounts in
utility plant acquisition adjustment account (account 100.5), Florida
should begin to appropriate out of earned surplus to a contingency
reserve at least $700,000 per year, and should classify in account 107
and eliminate from the plant account by charge to earned surplus not
later than December 31, 1944, an amount of $1,815,655 consisting of
capitalized intra system profits paid to affiliated companies as construction and engineering fees. These orders were attacked as being
beyond the powers of the Commission, based on sections of the act
alleged to be unconstitutional, unwarranted by the evidence, and contrary to generally accepted accounting principles. The court first
disposed of the issue of constitutionality and found that the accounting
provisions of sections 15 and 20 of the act were designed to prevent the
evils set out in section 1 of the act and were constitutional. The reasoning and decisions of the Supreme Court in Electric Bona and Share
Oompany v. S. E. 0.67 and The North American Oompany v, S. E. 0.68
were cited to support the validity of the regulatory power of the Commission. The court then proceeded to find that sections 15 and 20 of
the act were sufficiently inclusive to permit the adoption by the Commission of an "original cost" system of accounts and sustained the
Commission's order requiring a contingency reserve to be accumulated
to offset probable write-offs upon completion of the original cost study
now being conducted pursuant to rule U-27.
COOPERATION

wrrn

STATE COMMISSIONS

It has been the long established policy of the Commission to work
for effective cooperation with the State commissions in all matters
where their respective jurisdictions interlock and in all additional
matters where such cooperation is desirable and appropriate in the case
under consideration. The Commission has found that the State commissions are equally interested in the interchange and harmonization
of views on mutual problems. During the past year there have been
many cases in which this cooperative approach has been helpful.
.A. number of State commissions have availed themselves of the provision of section 19 of the act which requires the admission "as a party
(of) any interested State, State commission, State securities commission, municipality, or other political subdivision of a State" in proceedings before the Commission. One example of this type of cooperation concerned the formation of the Southern. Co. to hold the
southern properties of the Commonwealth & Southern Corp. Requests
to intervene in these proceedings were made by the attorney general

of the State of Alabama. the Public Service Commission of the State
of Georgia, and the Public Service Commission of South Carolina.
A representative of the Georgia commission conferred with the staff
of this Commission and with representatives of the management and
also testified as an expert at the hearings. The South Carolina Commission requested postponement of the hearings to enable it to consider the proposal, and subsequently conferred with the staff of this
Commission and the management. As a result of these conferences
the plan was changed in certain respects and has been approved by
the Commission.
In the case of the reorganization of Kings County Lighting Co. the
opinion of the Commission differed from that of the New York Public
Service Commission. In August 1945, Kings County Lighting Co.
simultaneously filed a plan of recapitalization with the Commission
and with the New York commission and hearings were held thereon
before each commission. On February 5, 1946, the New York commission issued an opinion in which it criticized the plan in certain respects. It recommended, among other things, that (1) the proposed
capital structure be modified and that (2) all the new preferred and
new common stock be issued to the existing preferred shareholders,
except possibly for a nominal amount to the holders of the existing
common stock.
In April 1946 the company filed an amended plan with both commissions in which the proposed capital structure was changed to conform more closely to the views of the New York commission. The
amended plan provided for the issuance of all the new preferred stock
and 90 percent of the new common stock to the existing preferred
shareholders and the remaining 10 percent of the new common stock
to the existing common shareholders. The New York commission
determined that the proposed allocation to present common shareholders was excessive and that such stockholders were entitled to no
more than a nominal participation upon the basis of the book values
of the assets of the company. This Commission in a series of letters
and conferences pointed out that, under the decisions of the United
States Supreme Court which were binding upon it, primary weight
in determining the fairness of the allocation must be accorded earnings rather than book asset values. This Commission, in its findings
and opinion, adopted the view of the New York commission with respect to the capital structure of the company, but concluded that, on
the basis of indicated earnings, the existing preferred shareholders
should receive all the new preferred stock and 92% percent of the new
common stock and that the balance of the new common stock should
be allocated to the existing common shareholders. This allocation
was acceptable to all security holders, both preferred and common.
A draft of the Commission's findings and opinion was submitted to
the New York commission for comment and subsequently several conferences were held in an effort to reconcile the opposing views. The
Commission subsequently issued its findings and opiruon 69 and, as
provided by section 11 (e) of the act, applied to the district court for
enforcement of the plan. The New York commission entered its
order disapproving the plan and appeared at the hearing in the district
court to oppose enforcement of the Commission's order. The matter
was under advisement by the court at the close of the fiscal year .

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

The Commission endeavors to obtain the view of the State commissions with respect to any transactions proposed by registered
holding companies or their subsidiaries where it appears that the
local authorities may have jurisdiction over or an interest in the proposed transactions. This practice has been very helpful. It was employed in passing upon the plan of American Gas & Electric Co. to
acquire the common stock of Columbus & Southern Ohio Electric
Co. and in considering the proposal to merge Kansas City Gas Co.
and the Wyandotte County Gas Co. into the Gas Service Co. Similarly, when Iowa-Illinois Gas & Electric Co. presented a plan under
which it proposed to issue $22,000,000 of bonds to the public and to
sell $3,500,000 of additional common stock to its parent, the Commission deferred action pending disposition by the State commission.
In the application of the Central Illinois Light Co. for permission
to reclassify its common stock and transfer a portion of its earned
surplus to common capital stock account, the Illinois Commerce
Commission was requested to state its views prior to our final
determination."

PARTIOPATION
OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE
REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANK.RUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended in 1938, in setting
up appropriate machinery for the reorganization of corporations
(other than railroads) in the Federal courts provides for participation
by the Commission in proceedings thereunder at the request of or
with the approval of the court for the purpose of providing independent expert assistance to the court and to investors and for the
preparation by the Commission of formal advisory reports on plans
of reorganization submitted to it by the courts in such proceedings.
The Commission's functions in chapter X proceedings are of a purely
advisory character.
The Commission has no authority to veto or
to require adoption of a plan of reorganization or to render a decision
on any other issue in the proceedings. It has no right of appeal in
such proceedings, although it may participate in appeals taken by
others and has, as a matter of fact, participated in many appeals as
a party or as amicus curiae.
SUMMARY OF ACTMTIES

The Commission actively participated during the year in 98 reorganization proceedings involving the reorganization of 124 companies (98 principal debtor corporations and 26 subsidiary debtors).'
The aggregate stated assets of these 124 companies amounted to $1,933,599,000 and their aggregate indebtedness was $1,274,131,000.2
During the year the Commission filed its notice of appearance in nine
new proceedings under chapter X, two of which were filed at the request of the judge and the remaining seven upon approval by the
judge of the Commission's motion to participate. These nine new
proceedings involved 14 companies (9 principal and 5 subsidiary debtors) with aggregate stated assets of $15,457,000and aggregate stated
indebtedness of $13,135,000. Proceedings involving 24 principal
debtor corporations and 6 subsidiary debtors were closed during the

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

COMMISSION'S FUNCTIONS UNDER CHAPTER X

A detailed discussion of the Commission's duties and policies in
connection with its functions under chapter X appeared in the Twelfth
Annual Report (pp. 81 to 93). The Commission maintains expert
staffs of lawyers, accountants, and analysts in various regional offices
where they keep in close touch with hearings, issues, and parties and are
readily available to the courts. Some of the legal and financial questions encountered in typical bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings in which the Commission participated during the past fiscal year
are described in the following paragraphs.
Problems in the Administration of the Estate

It is recognized that the trustee has the responsibility not only to
examine into the debtors' past operations to ascertain the reasons for
its financial difficulties but also to determine whether any causes of
action exist against the old management or other :persons and, if so, to
prosecute them diligently. In view of that principle, during the past
fiscal year the Commission has on various occasions supported requests
that the trustee be authorized to bring suit on such corporate causes of
action.
Where a fair offer of compromise was made, the Commission has, of
course, supported the settlement of such suits, but not otherwise. In
one case, the trustee had proposed, several years ago, a compromise
of certain claims filed against the debtor for alleged services and advances by the promoter of the debtor." The Commission had opposed
the proposed compromise on the ground that evidence justified the
disallowance of the claims in their entirety and indicated the possibility of causes of action by the estate against the promoter. Disapproval
of the compromise was recommended by the special master. During
the past fiscal year, however, the trustee submitted the proposed compromise to the court. In the meantime, an audit of the debtor's books
urged by the Commission revealed, in the Commission's view, startling
misconduct on the part of the promoter during the time he was in
control of the debtor. The Commission thereupon, after prior notice
to the trustee, filed a petition with the court asking that the trustee
be instructed to withdraw his request for approval of the compromise
and to prosecute all causes of action against the promoter. The matter has not yet been heard by the court.
In a significant case involving a suit for $39,000,000 by chapter X
trustees against directors, officers, and the controlling stockholder of
the debtor, the Commission appeared as amicus curiae and vigorously
supported the trustees' contention that the Federal court had jurisdiction over the suit although it was not the court where the reorganization proceedings were pending and although no diversity of citizenship was alleged. The Commission urged that the Congress intended
in chapter X cases to remove the restrictions contained in the Bankruptcy Act which might otherwise bar access to the Federal courts in
suits brought by a reorganization trustee. It was the Commission's
view that the Bankruptcy Act had been purposely modified so as to
afford the reorganization trustee a wider choice of forum than the
bankruptcy trustee, having in mind the typical suit involving diversion

of assets and related wrongs by insiders in large corporations with a
national public interest. The district court did not agree with this contention and granted the defendants' motion to dismiss for want of
jurisdiction.' On appeal, however, the Circuit Court for the Second
Circuit reversed 5_and the Supreme Court affirmed this decision."
In administering the debtor's estate, it is the trustee's function to
recommend to the court the assumption or rejection of executory contracts of the debtor, including leases. In the reorganization proceedings involving Mount Gaines Mining Co., the question arose as to the
applicability of section 70 (b) of the Bankruptcy Act which provides
for a 60-day period for the assumption or rejection of the contracts of
a bankrupt, including leases. On the theory that this time limitation
is inconsistent with the provisions and purpose of chapter X, the Commission urged that it was not applicable. The difference between the
purpose of bankruptcy to liquidate the estate and of chapter X to rehabilitate and preserve the enterprise was pointed out and the impracticability of applying the short limitation period in reorganization was emphasized. The district court adopted this view and, on
appeal, the Circuit Court for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.'
Responsibilities of Fiduciaries

Trading in securities of a debtor in reorganization by trustees, directors, attorneys, committee members, or other fiduciaries is a practice which has generally been condemned by the courts and which has
always been decried by the Commission in its opinions and reports.
The access to inside information and, frequently, the control or influence over the course of reorganization which are possessed by these
"insiders" are urgent considerations for enforcing judicial sanctions
against them strictly. One such sanction which has been availed of
during the past fiscal year in several cases in which the Commission
participated is the prohibition against payment of any fees or reimbursement of any expenses where a fiduciary bought or sold securities
of the debtor. These cases will be mentioned below. Another sanction is the prevention of any profiting by such a fiduciary through
the limitation of his securities to the cost thereof or requiring him to
account for any profits from securities sold by him.
In the reorganization proceedings involving National Realty Trust
and Federal Facilities Realty Trust objections were filed to the final
accounts of a former trustee of these debtors based in part upon the
doctrine underlying limitation to cost. In these proceedings, the former trustee had permitted certain employees of his, with his knowledge and consent, to trade in the securities of the debtors and their subsidiaries. These employees, the promoter of the enterprise and his
associate, had active supervision of the affairs of the debtors and their
subsidiaries entrusted to them by the former trustee. In many instances, they purchased bonds from members of the public and sold
them to the former trustee at a profit. After extensive hearings the
matter has been presented to the special master for report. The Commission has urged that the former trustee should be surcharged to
the extent of the profits he permitted his employees to make on the

ground that he had completely ignored and breached his trust obligations and he or his associates should not profit by his culpable conduct.
Inthe proceedings in reorganization involving Pittsburgh Railways
Co., the Commission actively supported the trustee's request for authority to investigate possible grounds for subordinating or limiting
to cost various claims of the parent company, Philadelphia
Co.
Philadelphia Co., after unsuccessfully attempting to prevent the inquiry into its management of the debtor, endeavored to extend the
scope of the investigation to public security holders who may have
purchased the debtor's securities at less than par. In opposing this
contention, the Commission pointed out that, apart from special cases,
security holders are treated equally regardless of when or at what price
their securities were purchased. Unless this were the general rule reorganization securities would become unmarketable since no one would
purchase securities at a price which would be the maximum he could
obtain in distribution.
It was urged by the Commission that the
possibility of subordinating or limiting Philadelphia Co. was in no
way relevant to the treatment to be accorded security holders buying
at a discount-public
holders should not recover less merely because a
fiduciary who has committed wrongful acts recovers less. The district
court upheld the Commission's position and denied Philadelphia Co.'s
request. On appeal, the Circuit Court for the Third Circuit affirmed
the order of the district court," An application for certiorari, opposed
by the Commission, was denied by the Supreme Court on May 5, 1947.
Activities with Respect to Allowances

In a proceeding involving Midland United Co., the Commission
urged that an attorney who bought and sold preferred stocks and
bonds of subsidiaries of a public utility holding company in reorganization while representing a protective committee for debenture
holders should be barred from any compensation.
The Commission
pointed out that, as a fiduciary, the attorney owed an obligation not
to acquire interests adverse to those he purported to represent nor to
use information acquired in a trustee capacity to personal advantage.
The Commission argued that these principles applied equally to a
situation where the securities acquired, or sold, were those of a subsidiary, particularly where, as in this case, the subsidiary had substantial claims against the parent company and where other adverse
interests existed. The Commission also took the position that the
prohibition against trading by a fiduciary is equally applicable to his
near relatives and business partners.
The district court sustained the
Commission's position and denied compensation to the applicant,"
On appeal to the Circuit Court for the Third Circuit, the district court
decision was affirmed." The circuit court held that the specific prohibitions of section 249 were intended to augment and not limit the
jurisdiction of the court and that, under general equitable principles,
trading in the stock of a subsidiary where a conflict of interest existed
barred the applicant from compensation.
The court also pointed out
that since the subsidiary had claims against the parent debtor, the
attorney had in fact purchased an indirect interest in a claim against

the debtor specifically barred by section 249. The court also held that
the rule applied to the wife of the applicant who engaged in the
transactions with his approval and knowledge, even though she used
her own funds.
Another problem under section 249 with respect to allowances arose
in the proceeding involving Inland Power & Light Corp. In this case,
an investment banking house, the original underwriter of the debtor's
bonds, traded in these bonds for several years during the section 77B
reorganization proceeding, prior to the enactment of chapter X.
The investment banking house had organized a bondholders' committee
and installed an employee as secretary of the committee. Subsequently
other employees assumed the officeof secretary. The last one in office
filed an application for compensation for services rendered by himself and his predecessors but it was conceded that any award of
compensation would be turned over to the investment house. Pointing out the strategic position of secretary to a committee and his ability
to acquire inside information, the Commission urged the denial of any
indirect award to the banking house which in a real sense occupied the
secretarial office. The Commision contended that either under section
249, which was applicable to the section 77B proceeding, or under the
equitable principles it codified, compensation should be denied. Upon
the special master's recommendation, the district court disallowed the
application. The applicant sought leave to appeal from the Circuit
Court for the Seventh Circuit, which was opposed by the Commission.
After briefs and argument, the court entered an order denying the petition for leave to appeal.
INSTITUTION

OF CHAPTER X PROCEEDINGS
OF THE COURT

AND JURISDICTION

The Commission has striven for a liberal interpretation of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act so that the benefits of Chapter X may
be made fully available to security holders in accordance with the
spirit and intent of the statute. In accordance with this policy, the
Commission has participated in various cases involving the question
of "good faith" in the filing of a petition. The Commission's view
in these cases was that the pendency of a prior State court proceeding
was not a bar to a chapter X proceeding since the prior proceedings in
those cases did not contain safeguards for investors comparable with
those in chapter X. The contentions of the Commission generally have
not been upheld by the courts.
During the past fiscal year, the Commission participated in another
case involving the "good faith" of the filing of the petition, the proceeding for the reorganization of Midwest Athletic Club. Also involved in
the case was the objection to the jurisdiction of the court based 011 the
contention that the debtor was a nonprofit corporation which had been
dissolved pursuant to State law in 1938. The district court approved
the petition as having been.properly filed and in good faith. In supporting the decision on appeal, the Commission argued that the debtor
had conducted a business enterprise for many years and that while
the corporation as such had been dissolved, the remaining entity was
an "unincorporated association" under the Bankruptcy Act and, hence,
767629-48-8

100

a proper subject for reorganization. The Commission also argued that
the petition for reorgamzation met the "good faith" requirements of
chapter X. The Circuit Court for the Seventh Circuit, however, reversed the lower court, holding that the enterprise was not an "unincorporated company" within the meaning of chapter X which could be
reorganized. The court emphasized the fact that no stockholders or
members of the company had operated the enterprise after its dissolution, but that a State court receiver, as a mere custodial officer of
the court, had conducted its business and could not he considered as
continuing the corporate entity or its corporate affairs. Therefore, the
court concluded that there was no corporation to be reorganized.
PLANS OF REORGANIZATION UNDER CHAPTER X

The ultimate objective of a reorganization is the formulation and
consummation of a fair and feasible plan of reorganization. Accordingly, the most important function of the Commission under chapter X
is to aid the courts in achieving this objective.
Fairness and Feasibility

A proceeding involving the fairness of a proposed plan of reorganization based on established principles of priorities of securities and
valuation of the debtor's estate was that of Chicago Railways Co.,
Chicago City Railway Co., and Calumet & South Chicago Ry., known
collectively as the Chicago Surface Lines, in which the Commission
rendered an advisory report and supplemental advisory report during
the previous fiscal veal'. In those reports, the Commission concluded
that the proposed plan involving a minimum upset price of $75,000,000
for the Surface Lines' properties to be offered by the Chicago Transit
Authority was fair, after certain suggested amendments had been
made. Its conclusions were based primarily upon a valuation of the
properties reached by capitalizing reasonably prospective earnings.
The proposed price was considered to be within a reasonable range of
the Commission's valuation. Since the proceeds of the sale together
with excess cash were insufficient to pay in full the claims of senior
security holders, it was also concluded that certain junior security
holders could not participate in the plan. The plan as amended was
approved by the court, accepted by security holders entitled to participate, and confirmed. Appeals were taken to the Circuit Court for the
Seventh Circuit by certain junior security holders who were excluded
from sharing in the estate by the orders of approval and confirmation.
Among their contentions, the junior security holders relied upon
the rate base valuation of the properties, upon a price fixed by formula
in the original franchises of the companies in 1907, upon book values
of the companies and upon a hypothetical figure that might be awarded
in a condemnation proceeding. All of these amounts were substantially higher than the proposed purchase price and the valuation estimated by the Commission. The Commission, in its brief, replied to
these contentions, arguing that reorganization values are dependent
upon probable future earnings, and that OR the basis of the record and
the applicable priority rules, the junior securities had no right to
. such earnings and were properly denied participation in the estate.
The circuit court affirmed the lower court's approval of the plan,
holding that a valuation of the enterprise, if it is to be freed from

THIRTEENTH

101

the heavy hand of past errors, miscalculations or disaster, requires
consideration of past earnings, factors affecting earnings, probable
future earnings and an appropriate rate of capitalization.v The circuit court stated that the district court had clearly considered every
proper factor suggested by the parties and in addition had the benefit
of the expert and disinterested advice of the Commission in its advisory
report in reaching its findings. Application for certiorari, oPl?,osed
by the Commission, was demed by the Supreme Court on April 14,
1947.
In the reorganization proceedings involving Childs Co., the Commission had occasion to invoke the general equitable rule enforced in
ordinary bankruptcy that, where full payment is made, prior distributions are to be applied first to accrued interest and then to principal.
This view has been adopted by the trustee and approved by the district
court.
Following its policy of according to senior creditors all their rights
before permitting participation in the estate by junior creditors, the
Commission supported the claim of first mortgage bondholders to
interest on overdue interest as provided for under the terms of the indenture in the proceedings involving Inland Gas Corp. The Supreme
Court, however, in Vanstoa B ondhoid ers Protective Oommittee Y.
Green, 329 U. S. 156 (1946) held that interest on interest under the
CIrcumstances of the case would not be equitable. The court pointed
out that the failure to make interest payments promptly when due
was a result of judicial action and that bondholders should not receive
added compensation or a penalty, by way of interest on interest, by
reason of the court's supervision of the estate and its prohibition
against payment of interest on the due date.>
MODIFICATION

OF PLAN

In the proceedings involving Equitable Office Building, a plan of
reorganization had been confirmed under which debenture holders
were to receive new convertible debentures for ll: portion of their
claim and old common stockholders were to receive a small amount
of the new common stock. Just before this plan was to be consummated by transfer of the property to the new reorganized company
and by distribution of the new securities, two common stockholders
appeared with a financing proposal under 'which stockholders would
receive an option to buy the stock of the new company, an underwriter would buy all unsubscribed shares, and the proceeds would
be used to pay the old debentures in full, principal and interest.
Thus, under the new proposal, the stockholders would be afforded an
opportunity to payoff the debenture holders and retain their equity
in the property.
The marked improvement in the real-estate field
since the date of confirmation made possible the underwriting pro11 In re Ohicago RailwaY8 Oompany, 160 F. (2d) 59 (C. C. A. 7, 1947).
12 It may be observed that the Commission's brief before the Supreme Court contained
the following statement in a note:
"The validity, as a matter of public policy, of a covenant for interest on interest, as
applied to interest accruing since the date of a Federal equity receivership or bankruptcy
proceedings, might conceivably be regarded as a proper subject for independent decision
by the Federal court, even in the absence of direct legislation. The consequence of such
a holding would be to all'ord greater uniformity and certainty in dealing with a problem
which appears to be arising with increasing frequency in reorganization proceedings and
occasionally in the State courts. We recognize, however, that there is no precedent for
such a rule. The closest analogy would appear to be those cases holding that the equitable
status of certain claims is a matter of bankruptcy law."

102

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

posaI. Stockholders not exercising their rights to subscribe would
receive the same stock interest as in the confirmed plan and, in addition, would have the privilege of selling their rights.
The debenture holders vigorously opposed this proposal, since the
market price of the debentures had risen far above the amount of
principal and interest. This rise in price, of course, reflected the
market's appraisal of the value of the new stock to be issued under the
confirmed plan. The Commission took the position that the district
court should have a full hearing on the merits of the proposed modification, since it now appeared that there was an equity in the property
for common stockholders which they could salvage; that debenture
holders had no vested interest in the confirmed plan; and that payment to them of principal and interest in full would satisfy the debtor's
obligation to them.
The district court refused to consider the stockholders' proposal,
holding in effect that it was too late to modify the confirmed plan.
After some appellate litigation regarding a stay of proceedings. which
was finally granted, until the issue could be heard on its merits, the
Circuit Court for the Second Circuit considered the matter. In upholding the Commission's views as set forth in its brief and argument
before the court, it was held that the plan could be modified even after
confirmation, that the debenture holders had as yet no legally protected interest beyond principal and accrued interest and had no right
to rely upon sharing in an equity in the property above that amount
and deprive stockholders of whatever chance might remain of realizing upon their property." The circuit court stated that the long delay
in effectuating a plan was not a good reason, so long as the rights of
r-reditors were fully preserved, to deny stockholders a reasonable
chance to protect their own interests.
ADVISORY

REPORTS

During the fiscal year the Commission prepared a formal advisory
report and two supplemental advisory reports with respect to proposed
plans of reorganization in proceedings involving Childs Co., which
owns and operates a large chain of restaurants. The advisory report
concluded that certain aspects of the trustee's plan were unfair and
unfeasible. The plan was said to be unfair to debenture holders and
other unsecured creditors' in failing to compute their claims on a
proper basis and unfair to common stockholders in allocating too much
of the new common stock to preferred stockholders. In proposing
an all-common stock plan for the reorganized company, the trustee was
held to have provided a sound capital structure for this enterprise, but
the Commission opposed the issuance of long-term option warrants
to common stockholders and considered unnecessary a proposed bank
loan.
Plans and amendments proposed by common and preferred stockholders were also considered but the Commission found them unfair
principally because of their unfair allocation of new stock. A plan
suggested by a debenture holders' committee was viewed as unfair
because of U; proposed offering of new common stock to debenture
holders at too low a price as well as unfair in its allocation 0:£ new

stock between common and preferred stockholders and in its use of
long-term warrants.
The Commission's report dealt with the complicated questions of
valuation of the enterprise, the company's working capital position,
its rehabilitation program, the question of the need for a bank loan, the
unsoundness of issuing long-term option warrants and the treatment
of creditors and stockholders under the trustee's plan and the various
other proposals. The method of computing interest on creditors'
claims was questioned. First, the Commission was of the opinion that
all debenture holders should be treated equally on a 6 percent interest
basis in that those who had voluntarily agreed to accept new debentures
at 5 percent had done so on condition that in any judicial proceeding
they would receive no worse treatment than those who had not accepted
a reduction in interest. Second, it was felt that interest should be paid
to the date of payment on the aggregate claim of principal and accrued
interest at the time of commencement of the proceeding as in the
Realty Aseociates Securities case. Third, it was the Commission's
view, as indicated in a previous paragraph, that prior, partial payments to creditors be applied first to interest and then to principal.
Another important question dealt with in the report involved the
basis of the preferred stockholders' claim. The Commission differentiated their claim in a chapter X proceeding from the preferred
stockholders' position in a reorganization under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act and concluded that the liquidating preference
of preferred stock is the controlling factor in measuring the extent
of its claim under chapter X. In considering the allocation of new
stock to the preferred and common shareholders, the Commission
pointed out what it considered to be a reasonable range-on the basis
of all common stock and on the basis of a new preferred stock and
common stock.
In its first supplemental report, the Commission considered amendments to the trustee's plan and two plans submitted by a security
holder. While the trustee's amendments were held to cure several of
the Commission's objections, the plan was still considered deficient
in several major respects. The security holders' plans were viewed as
fair and feasible since they embodied the Commission's suggestions.
In its second supplemental report, additional plan amendments by
the trustee were reviewed by the Commission. These amendments
adopted fully the Commission's views as to the rights of creditors.
They also eliminated the long-term option warrant feature and revised the allocation of new common shares. As to such allocation, the
Commission felt it was not so far outside the range suggested by the
Commission as to require disapproval.
Subsequently the plan was approved by the court and submitted to
security holders. The preferred stockholders accepted the plan but
the required percentage of common stockholders was not obtained.
Thereafter the trustee filed a new plan which has been submitted to
the Commission for its advisory report.

•

PART V
ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939
SCOPE OF ACT

The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 outlaws the exculpatory clauses
used in the past in trust indentures underlying corporate debt seeurrties. Many of these clauses eliminated liability of the trustee for misconduct to such an extent that the word "trustee" was meaningless as
applied to indenture trustees. The act is designed to insure that the
trustee will act in the interest of the bond or debenture owners and to
insure his complete independence of the issuer and the underwriters.
To secure its objectives, the act requires that bonds, notes, debentures,
and similar debt securities publicly offered for sale, sold, or delivered
after sale through the mails or in interstate commerce, except as specifically exempted by the act, be issued under an indenture which meets
the requirements of the act and has been duly qualified with the Commission. The provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Trust
Indenture Act are so integrated that registration pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 of securities to be issued under a trust indenture
is not permitted to become effective unless the indenture conforms to
the requirements expressed in the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and
such an indenture is automatically "qualified" when registration becomes effective as to the securities themselves. An application for
qualification of an indenture covering securities not required to be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which is filed with the
Commission under the Trust Indenture Act, is processed substantially
as though such application were a registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933.

Five indentures as to which the Commission, under its authority granted by
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, applies the standards of the 'I'rust
Indenture Act of 1939 although such indentures are exempted from 'the ~rust
Indenture Act;
.
One hundred thirty-four statements of eligibility and qualification under the
Trust Indenture Act;
Twenty-one amendments to trustee statements of eligibility and qualifications;
Ninety-three Supplements SoT, covering special items of information concerning
indenture securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933 ;
Thirty-five amendments to Supplements S-T;
Twenty-srx applications for findings by the Commission relating to exemptions
rrom special provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939; and
Three hundred sixty annual reports of indenture trustees pursuant to section
313 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.

PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN ADMINISTRATION OF ACf

Although the Trust Indenture Act is designed as an adjunct to
the Securities Act of 1933, it presents problems of administration
which are peculiar to itself. These problems arise from the fact that
the primary purpose of safeguarding investors pursuant to the Trust
Indenture Act is sought by assuring that all indentures qualified
thereunder shall contain specified protective provisions and only incidentally by resort to disclosure requirements as such.
The exemptive provisions of. the act incorporate most but not all
of the exemptions contained in the Securities Act and several exemptions in addition thereto. Thus, some offerings exempt from regist ration under the Securities Act (exchanges with existing security
holders exempt under section 3 (a) (9) and securities issued in reorganizations exempt under section 3 (a) (10» must be qualified
under the Trust Indenture Act and information contained in the application for qualification must be examined to determine whether

THIRTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

107

Securities Act registration is required. Conversely, Securities Act
registration statements will include debt securities which are not
to be issued under an indenture qualified under the Trust Indenture
Act, and it is necessary then to determine whether there is an exemption from qualification under one of the exemptions specified in section 304 of the Trust Indenture Act, including:
(1) Nondebt securities;
(2) An investment contract;
(3) A mortgage insured under the National Housing Act;
(4) Foreign government issues;
(5) Any guarantee of an exempted security;
(6) An aggregate of $250,000 principal amount of security issued not under
an indenture, within a period of 12 consecutive months;
(7) An indenture limiting the amount outstanding thereunder to $1,000,000
or less ; not more than $1,000,000 to be issued thereunder in 36 consecutive months;
(8) Secondary offerings by controlling persons.
EXAMINATION

PROCEDURE

In examining a registration statement or application including an
indenture to be qualified, it is necessary to examine the document for
the purpose of determining (1) whether the indenture contains the
required provisions in proper form, that permissive provisions are
in proper form, and that there are no inconsistent provisions; (2)
that the disclosure requirements specified in section 305 (a) (2) of
the act are complied with in the prospectus or application; and (3)
that the trustee is eligible and qualified. Any inadequacies found
upon examination customarily are corrected after the staff sends the
applicant a letter of comment, or holds conferences with counsel for
the applicant, and only in rare cases has it been necessary to institute
remedial proceedings. (See sees. 305 (b), 307 (c), 321 (a), and
322 (bj ). This examination procedure may be briefly explained for
convenience in the numerical order listed above.
(1) The examination of the indenture requires a careful reading.
For example, variations in statutory language are sometimes injected.
If such variations appear to be in derogation of statutory objectives,
it is necessary to insist that the statutory language be more closely
followed. The Commission finds that as time goes on injections of
this character tend to diminish. On the other nand, because of the
great variety of provisions and purposes of indenture agreements, considerable latitude has been exercised with respect to the insertion of
some statutory language (e. g., sec. 314 (d) certificates of fair value),
althou~h such latitude is not extended to provisions relating to the
trustee s qualifications and standards of conduct. Here again experience has permitted the working out of indenture provisions which
in the ordinary case have become more or less standardized.
instances where the requirements of the act would appear to
work a hardship, the Commission may grant exemptions from onerous
provisions as to indentures having securities outstanding issued prior
to the effective date of the act and indentures of foreign issuers (sees,
304 (c) and (dj ), Applications for such exemptions generally relate
to section 316' (a) of the act, which permits the holders of not less
than a majority of outstanding bonds to direct the trustee in the exercise of his trusts or powers (many old indentures according this power
to holders of less than a majority).

In

108

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

(2) The disclosure requirements of the act relate to defaults, the
authentication of bonds, the release of property, satisfaction and discharge, and evidence of compliance with the requirements of the indenture to be furnised to the trustee. No particular problems have
arisen in the examination and analysis of material filed under these
requirements.
(3) Information with respect to the eligibility and qualifications of
the trustee, required under section 310 of the act, is provided for
primarily in the Commission's Forms T-1 and T-2, which must
be prepared and filed by the trustee or trustees. A number of difficult
problems as to conflicts of interest proscribed by section 310 (b) of
the act have arisen. However, for the most part they have heen
resolved by administrative interpretation. Section 310 (b) (1) provides for administrative proceedings by the Commission to permit
the trustee to act under more than one indenture of the same obligor.
Usually applications for such permission are of routine nature. Besides, the Commission's Rule T-IOB-3 provides machinery for a prior
determination of conflicts of interest arising from affiliations between
the trustee and an underwriter for the issuer.
Significance

of Commission's

ExaDlination

Particular care must be taken with respect to the original examination into these situations because once the indenture is qualified its
enforcement becomes a matter of contract between the parties. The
Commission may not enforce its provisions (see sec. 309 (ej ). However, trustees are required to report annually to their bondholders
as to certain matters specified in sections 313 (a) and (b) of the act
and copies of their reports are required under section 313 (d) to
be filed with the Commission, which calls the attention of the trustees
to any material discrepancies which the staff finds upon examination
thereof.

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT
OF 1940
SCOPE OF Acr

The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires the registration and
provides for the regulation of investment companies, which are, generally, companies engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities. Among other
things, the act requires disclosure of the finances and of the investment policies of these companies to afford investors full and complete
information with respect to their activities; prohibits such companies
from changing the nature of their business or their investment policies
without the approval of the stockholders; bars persons guilty of security frauds from serving as officers and directors of such companies;
prevents underwriters, investment bankers, and brokers from constituting more than a minority of the directors of such companies; requires
management contracts in the first instance to be submitted to security
holders for their approval; prohibits transactions between such companies and their officers and directors and other insiders except on the
approval of the Commission; forbids the issuance of senior securities
of such companies except in specified instances; prohibits pyramiding
of such companies and cross ownership of their securities; and requires face-amount certificate companies to maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity payments upon their certificates.
ADVISORY

REPORTS

UPON PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

One of the functions of the Commission under the Investment Company Act arises from its authority to prepare advisory reports for the
benefit of security holders upon plans of reorganization of registered
investment companies. Such reports may be rendered upon request of
the company or of the holders of 25 percent of any class of its outstanding securities. In addition, the Commission is authorized to institute
proceedings to enjoin reorganization plans if they are grossly unfair.
Last year the Commission prepared such an advisory report covering a
plan of reorganization of an investment company upon the request of
stockholders, following a refusal of the management of the company
itself to request the report at their instance. That part of the Commission's report dealing with the effect of the plan on the shareholders
called attention to the more important factors which the stockholders
should evaluate in order to form a sound investment judgment as to
whether they would assent to the plan. It included, for example, a
discussion of the pro forma earnings of a new company which was to
result from a proposed consolidation, and called particular attention to
the effect of the recent war on sales, costs of operations, and profit margins of the iron-ore producing business of the corporation with which
It was proposed to consolidate the investment company; the cyclical
nature of operations not only for the iron-ore business but also of the
steel industry in which the investment company was heavily invested;
and the element of leverage inherent in the capital structure of the new
company by virtue of its uncommonly high proportion of senior secu-

rities.
109

110

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

NEW RULES ADOPTED UNDER THE ACT

The Commission last year accomplished certain further srmplification of its rules and regulations under this act.
Rule N-5-Procedure

With Respect to Applications

On May 23, 1947, the Commission adopted rule N-5, which provided a simplified general procedure designed to expedite the disposition 'of proceedings initiated
by application
or upon the
Commission's own motion pursuant to any section of the act or any
rule or regulation thereunder.
The rule does not apply, however,
in a very limited number of cases where a more appropriate procedure
is provided.
The purpose of the rule is to provide for the expeditious
disposition of proceedings which are not contested by any interested
person. The rule makes provision for the publication in the Federal
Register of the initiation of such proceeding and affords ample opportunity for any interested persons to request a hearing.
Rule N-17A-2-Exemption

of Transactions by Banks

On December 3, 1946, the Commission adopted rule N-17A-2 to
exempt certain commercial transactions occurring in the usual course
of business between banks and persons engaged principally in the
business of installment financing. It is believed that these exemptions
are consistent with the protection of investors. Interest and discount
rates will probably be set competitively and not exceed the rate permitted locally. The adoption of the rule was intended to preclude the
multiplicity of proceedings arising from individual applications for
exemptions which were burdensome both to the parties involved and
to the Commission with no compensating public interest involved.
Rule N-17 A-3-Exemption

of Transactions With Subsidiaries

On May 23, 1947, the Commission adopted rule N-17A-3, which
provides an automatic exemption from section 17 (a) under the act
for transactions with or between fully owned subsidiaries of registered
investment companies. The rule was adopted to provide an automatic
exemption for such transaction since such subsidiaries are completely
owned by the registered investment company and there is no public or
investor interest involved in transactions WIthin the group. The rule
eliminates the necessity of filing an application with the Commission
for the exemption of such transaction.
Rule N-17D-I-Bonus,

Profit-Shardng, and Pension Plans

On May 23,1947, the Commission amended rule N-17D-1 regarding
bonus, profit-sharing, and pension plans and arrangements.
The
amendment to this rule eliminated the special procedure for the handling of applications thereunder and thereby makes the procedure
provided by the new rule N-5 applicable thereto.
STATISTICS RELATING TO REGISTEREQ

INVESTMENT COMPANIES

As of June 30,1947, there were 352 companies registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. During the fiscal year 12 companies
registered under the act, and the registration of 21 companies was terminated. The assets of the 352 registered investment companies aggregated approximately $3,600,000,000. These companies are classified
under the act as follows:

During the fiscal year 91 applications were filed under various provisions of the act, 74 of these for orders of the Commission relating
to exemptions from requirements of the act and the remaining 17 for a
determination of the Commission that the applicant has ceased to be
an investment company within the meaning of the act. At the beginning of the fiscal year, 60 applications were pending. These applications, together with the 91 filed during the year, totaled 151 applications pending before the Commission during the year; 101 of these applications were disposed of during the year and 50 were pending at
June 30,1947. The various sections of the act under which these applications were filed, and the disposition of the applications during the

ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS
ACT OF 1940
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration of
investment advisers: persons engaged for compensation in the business of advising others with respect to securities. The Commission
is empowered to deny registration to or revoke registration of such
advisers if they have been convicted or enjoined because of misconduct
in respect of security transactions or have made false statments in their
applications for registration.
The act also makes it unlawful for
investment advisers to engage in practices which constitute fraud or
deceit; requires investment advisers to disclose the nature of their
interest in transactions executed for their clients; prohibits profitsharing arrangements; and, in effect, prevents assignment of investment advisory contracts without the client's consent.

LITIGATION UNDER THE ACT

The single court action under the act during the fiscal year was

S. E. O. v. Todd, in which the Commission sought an injunction to
restrain alleged frauds on the defendant's investment advisory
clients.' The complaint alleged that the defendant had three classes
of clients: those who subscribed to his weekly investment advisory
letter, those who for an additional fee obtained more personalized
advice, and those for whom he managed discretionary accounts. It
was alleged that the defendant would first purchase some inactive security for his discretionary accounts, at the same time orally recommending its purchase to the clients receiving the personalized advice,
and then several days later would recommend its purchase to the subscribers of the weekly letter. Since the security was inactive, the
market would be raised by the subscribers' purchases and the defend1

113

114

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

ant would then sell the security in his discretionary accounts, meanwhile continuing to recomemnd its purchase in the weekly letter. The
Commission alleged that this constituted a practice or course of business which operated as a fraud or deceit upon his clients within the
meaning of section 206 (2). A final judgment was entered with the
consent of the defendant. The judgment was thereafter vacated at the
defendant's request to be permitted to proceed with a trial of the case
on the merits. The matter was pending at the close of the year.

OF THE COMMISSION UNDER THE

VARIOUS STATUTES
THE COMMISSION IN THE COURTS
Civil Proceedings

A complete list of all cases in which the Commission appeared before
a Federal or State court, either as a party or as amicus curiae, during
the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the year,
is set forth in appendix tables 24 to 35.
At the beginning of the 1947 fiscal year 22 injunctive and related
enforcement proceedings instituted by the Commission were pending
before the courts, in connection with fraudulent and other illegal
practices in the sale of securities, 24 additional proceedings were instituted during the year, and 20 cases were disposed of, so that there
remained 26 of such proceedin~ pending at the end of the year. In
addition, the Commission participated in a large number of reorganization cases; 1 in 25 proceedings in the district courts under section
11 (e) of the Holding Company Act; and in 21 miscellaneous actions,
usually as amicus curiae or intervenor, to advise the court of its
views regarding the construction of provisions of statutes administered by the Commission which were involved in private law suits.
The Commission also participated in 70 appeals. Of these, 24 came
before the courts on petition for review of an administrative order;
31 arose out of corporate reorganizations in which the Commission
had taken an active part; 7 were appeals in actions brought by or
against the Commission; 10 were appeals from orders entered pursuant to section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holdiag Company Act ;
and 4 were miscellaneous appeals.
The Commission's Tenth Annual Report included a table of all those
cases involving the statutes administered by the Commission (excluding ch, X cases) decided by the courts through June 30, 1944.
Appendix table 38 of this re'port continues that table through June
30, 1947. The only cases omitted are those in which no opinion was
rendered and which, in addition, did not involve a novel legal problem.
The civil proceedings under the different acts in which the Commission participated during the fiscal year are discussed at length
in the sections of this report covering the respective acts.
Criminal Proceedings

The statutes administered by the Commission provide for the transmission of evidence of statutory violations to the Attorney General
who, in his discretion, may institute appropriate criminal proceedings. As a matter of practice the Commission, largely through its
10 regional offices, thoroughly investigates suspected VIolations and,
• See Part IV and tables 24, 25, and 37.

767629-48-9

115

116

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

in cases where the investigation appears to disclose a foundation for
criminal proceedings, prepares detailed reports of investigation which
are forwarded to the Attorney General. When it is decided to institute criminal proceedings, the Commission may assign such of its employees as have participated in the investigation to assist in the
preparation of the case for presentation to the grand jury, in the
conduct of the trial and in preparing briefs on appeal. Parole reports on convicted offenders also are prepared by members of the Commission's staff. Where the investigation discloses violations of statutes other than those administered by the Commission, relerence is
made to the appropriate Federal or State agency.
Up to June 30, 1947, indictments had been obtained against 2,484
defendants in 399 criminal cases developed by the Commission," By
the end of the 1947 fiscalyear, 372 of these cases had been disposed of
as to one or more defendants, and convictions had been obtained in
335, or 90 percent, of such cases against a total of 1,222 defendants.
During the past year 15 indictments were returned against 35 defendants. Convictions were obtained against 20 defendants in 11
cases during the year,"
In the criminal appeals decided during the past year judgments of
conviction were affirmed as to 15 defendants.' One appeal was voluntarily withdrawn.
The status of all criminal cases pending during the past fiscal year
is set forth in appendix table 29.5
The criminal cases developed by the Commission and prosecuted
during the past fiscal year were, as in previous years, extremely varied
in nature. Some of these cases are described below. In general, they
include frauds perpetrated by brokers and dealers in securities; fraudulent schemes in connection with the sale of oil, gas, and other mineral
interests; fraud in the promotion of new businesses, inventions, and
mining ventures; and fraudulent purchases of securities by corporate
"insiders" and others.
Several of the cases prosecuted during the year involved fraud in
connection with Rurchases of securities in violation of section 10 (b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and rule X-10B-5 thereunder," The first conviction under these provisions was obtained
during the past year in U. S. v. Edgar M. Grisrwold (N. D. Ohio) in
which it was charged that the defendant defrauded various persons,
principally tavern owners, in transactions relating to the stock of
a prominent distilling company. Whisky purchase rights had been
attached to the stock. Griswold, it was alleged, represented to purchasers that the stock would be worthless after the whisky rights were
exercised and that it could not be retained by the purchasers after
such exercise. According to the indictment, Griswold, by virtue of
these false representations and his failure to disclose that the stock
had a market value of not less than $24 a share after exercise of the
whisky rights, was enabled to obtain the stock for his own use ~nd

• These appeals involved a total of four cases. Convictions were reversed only as to two
corporate defendants in a single case on jurisdictional grounds.
• Appendix table 31, pt. 2, relates to criminal contempt proceedings .
• The indictments in these cases also charged violations of the mail fraud statute (sec.
215 of the Federal Criminal Code).

in fraud of the original purchasers thereof," An indictment charging
a similar scheme to defraud with respect to stock of the same corporation was also returned in U. S. v. Oharles J. Rubrecht (W. D. Pa.),
which is still pending.
,
Another type of fraud violative of section 10 (b) and rule X-10B-5
was alleged in the indictments returned in U. S. v. Ellis R. Taylor
(N. D. m.i and U. S. v. American Oone &: Pretzel 00. (E. D. Pa.).
In these cases the fraud charged related to the allegedly deceitful
efforts of corporate insiders to acquire securities of the corporations
which they controlled. In both cases it was charged, among other
things, that defendants, Jj~:dents of their respective corporations,
purchased the stock holdi
of minority stockholders by making
false representations with respect to the value of the shares of stock,
the financial condition of the corporations, and by concealing facts
as to the true value of the shares and their identity as the actual purchasers of the stock. These cases are now pending.
Charges of fraud and unlawful conduct on the part of brokers
and dealers in securities were involved in U. S. v. Florida Bond and
Share, Inc. (S. D. Fla.) ; U. S. v. Gilbert lIf. Bates (N. D. Iowa) ; and
U. S. v. Stanley Grayson (S. D. N. Y.). In the Florida Bond and
Shares and Bates 9 cases, convictions were obtained for fraud predicated upon the sale of securities to uninformed customers at prices'
not reasonably related to the prevailing market prices without appropriate disclosure. The defendants in the Florida Bond and Share
case also were charged with employing a fraudulent "switch" scheme.
It was alleged that they intensified the losses suffered by their customers by causing them to "switch" repeatedly from one security to
another.
In the Grayson case, in which a fraudulent "switch" 'scheme was
also alleged, the fraud was based in part on the sale to investors of
various fractional undivided interests in oil, gas, and other mineral
rights, at prices substantially in excess of the maximum recoverable
returns which estimates indicated investors could possibly obtain from
the mineral assets underlying such securities. According to the indictment, investors were induced to divulge lists of their security
holdings on the pretense that the defendants would after analysis,
provide them with free investment advice. It was charged that the
defendants then induced the investors to sell such securities and to
purchase instead from the defendants the mineral securities mentioned above,"
.A. number of cases pending during the past fiscal year involved
charges of fraud in connection with the sale of various interests in oil
properties. These were U. S. v, James F. Boyer (S. D. Fla.) ; 11 U. S.
v, Thomas P. Mul/vaney (S. D. Iowa) ; 12 U. S. v. Bart Oeoil Lucas
(S. D. N. Y.); 18 and U. S. v, Aubrey M. Poynter (La.).H

COMMISSION

In the Boyer and Poynter cases the defendants were charged with
employing what is colloquially described as a "reloading" scheme.
The indictments in these cases charged, inter alia, that the defendants
induced investors to make repeated purchases of oil leases by causing
fictitious offers to be made to investors for their holdings at prices
which would have yielded them tremendous profits, which offers however were conditioned upon the investors obtaining additional leases
from the defendants.
In U. S. v, Gasomuer (Iorp, (D. Del.), in which fraud was charged
in the sale of securities, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to
three defendants."
The company was engaged in promoting an
invention to substitute the use of fuel oil for gasoline in internal
combustion engines. After the close of the fiscal year, the court set
aside this verdict and granted the motions of these defendants for
acquittal. In U. S. v. Olifford S. Johnson (Mont.), one defendant was

in which indictments were returned during the past year. Both of
these cases are now pending.
In U. S. v. Robert B. Kells (Col.), a conviction was obtained for
the fraudulent promotion of a new business," It was alleged that
the defendant organized a purportedly philanthropic and nonprofit
organization which he used as a medium through which he fraudulently sold the stock of a corporation organized by him.
Fraudulent sales of securities of an alleged fraternal association
was the basis for the indictment in U.8. v, Preston E. Douglass (N. D.
Ill.) .18 According to the indictment} Douglass, by means of various
false representations, induced investors to purchase stock purportedly
issued or to be issued by the Frederick Douglass Afro-AmerIcan Cooperative Industry Builders Association, Inc., a nonprofit Illinois
corporation (which was by statute prohibited from issuing stock),
which association had been organized by Douglass supposedly for the
purpose of improving the economic status and welfare of the Negro
race and to furnish Investors with employment in cooperative stores
and on farms which the association would develop and establish.
In U. S. v. Barry J. Mallen (N. D.
the defendant was convicted for a fraudulent promotion in connection with the sale of
stock of a gold mining corporation. It was charged, among other
things, that the defendant converted to his own use large portions of
the money received from the sale of such stock after he falsely represented to investors that the funds obtained from such sales would
be used for corporate purposes. Another allegedly fraudulent mining

things, with employing the "Ponzi" type of swindle, wherein purported "dividends" were paid to investors out of the capital funds of
the mining company which was the subject of the promotion.
In a number of cases Canadian mining company stocks were sold
to residents of the United States by persons residing in Canada who
operated from across the border without compliance with the statutes
of this country. The Commission has been cooperating with the State
Department and the Department of Justice in efforts to secure a
treaty with Canada which would permit the extradition of persons
violating the Federal and State securities laws. The treaty was ratifield by the United States Senate in April 1942, but to date it has not
been ratified by the Canadian Parliament.
Numerous cases of this
type have been the subject of investigation by the staff of the Commission. Indictments have been obtained in a number of these cases.
The criminal appeals decided during the past fiscal year were:
Baker v. U. S., 156 F. (2d) 386 (C. C. A. 5, 1946), certiorari denied,
67 S. Ct. 123 (1946), in which the convictions of 9 defendants for
fraud in the sale of various interests in oil and gas properties were
affirmed; U. S. v. Wernes, 157 F. (2d) 797 (C. C. A. 7, 1946), in which
the court sustained the convictions of the defendants for the fraudulent sale of unregistered securities of a limited partnership and its
subsidiary; Oollins v. U. S., 157 F. (2d) 409 (C. C. A. 9, 1946), wherein
judgments of conviction were affirmed for conspiracy to violate the
antifraud provisions (sec. 17 (a) (1» of the Securities Act of 1933
and the Mail Fraud Statute (sec. 215 of the Federal Criminal Code)
in connection with the manipulation in the over-the-counter market of
the stock of Union Associated Mines Co., a defunct corporation whose
shares had at one time been listed on the Salt Lake Exchange; and
Danziger v. U. S., 161 F. (2d) 299 (C. C. A. 9, 1947), in which the
court upheld the conviction of Danziger for fraud and conspiracy in
the sale of oil securities."
COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

During the 1947 fiscal year the Commission received 6,386 items of
mail concerned with alleged securities violations. These communications are classified administratively
as "complaint enforcement"
correspondence.
While they relate to complaints and alleged violations of various Jaws administered by the Commission, the bulk of
them deals with the enforcement of the Securities Act of 1933 and
the registration provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
This material constitutes an important source of information concerning possible securities violations.
Investigations made by the
Commission's staff and contacts maintained with other governmental
(Federal, State, and local) or private agencies provide additional
sources of such information.
Where it appears on the basis of any
such data that any securities violation may have occurred, the Commission conducts appropriate investigations by means of correspondence or the assignment of cases to field investigators to ascertain the
facts of the particular case.

Securities Violations File

To assist in the enforcement of the various statutes which it administers, and to provide a further means of preventing fraud in the
purchase and sale of securities, the Commission has established a
securities violations file. This file constitutes a clearing house of information concerning persons who have been charged with violations of
various Federal and State securities statutes.
It is kept up-to-date
through the cooperation of the United States Post Office Department,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, parole and probation, officials,
State securities commissions, Federal and State prosecuting attorneys,
police officials, members of the National Association of Better Business
Bureaus, Inc., and members of the United States Chamber of Commerce. By the end of the 1947 fiscal year this file contained data concerning 47,930 persons against whom Federal or, in the vast majority
of cases, State action had been taken in connection with securities violations. During the past year alone additional items of information
relating to 2,763 persons were added to these files, including information concerning 1,006 persons not previously identified therein.
Extensive use is made of this clearing house of information.
During
the past year, in connection with the maintenance of the files, the
Commission received 2,941 "securities violations" letters or reports
(apart from those mentioned above which are classified as "complaint
enforcement") and dispatched 2,423 communications in turn to cooperating agencies.
ACfIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDmNG

The several Acts administered by the Commission vest it with broad
authority in matters of accounting and auditing, including important
functions with respect to the financial statements to be furnished, requirements as to certification of the statements by independent public
accountants, and the basis, form and content of such statements. Under the Holding Company Act of 1935 it may prescribe, and has prescribed, certain uniform systems of accounts. In the exercise of its
statutory powers under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Ex-

THmTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

121

change Act of 1934, and the Investment Company Act of 1940, it has
adopted a basic accounting regulation governing the form and content of most of the financial statements filed pursuant to those acts.
This regulation is widely known as Regulation S-X.
While the Commission's requirements are comprehensive they do
not, indeed could not, establish a large body of accounting principles
or prescribe the accounting principles or methods to be followed in
any but a few basic respects. To the extent that these matters have
been dealt with by rule or regulation they have evolved for the most
part under the influence of both formal and informal decisions in
particular cases, discussions and correspondence with registrants, their
accountants and counsel, and cooperation with practicing accountants,
committees of professional societies and similar organizations, other
Government agencies, and various interested individuals.
As has been suggested, however, much of the Commission's activity
in the field of accounting lies in areas where specific rules and regulations are neither practicable nor desirable. In this, by far the largest
segment of the Commission's accounting work, the chief reliance for
the protection of investors and the public therefore rests largely in
the administrative determination of applicable accounting and auditing principles and procedures properly to be followed. In making
these determinations the Commisson draws heavily on the guides that
are found in accounting principles that have been recognized as sound
by professional accountants generally and on the advice and experience
of the persons and organizations mentioned above.
The organization of the accounting staff of the Commission is especially designed to facilitate informal consideration of accounting matters. The chief accountant acts as the Commission's chief adviser
and consulting officer on accounting matters and has general supervision over the establishment and execution of Commission policy with
respect to accounting and auditing principles or practices. He is
assisted directly by an assistant chief accountant and, in addition, an
assistant chief accountant is assigned to and directly responsible for
the examination of financial data and other accounting work in the
three operating divisions, namely, the Corporation Finance Division,
the Trading and Exchange Division, and the Public Utilities Division.
Examination of Financial Statements

The majority of accounting problems arise as a result of examination
of financial statements required to be filed with the Commission.
Where the examination of the statements reveals that the rules and
regulations of the Commission have not been complied with or that applicable accounting principles have not been followed, the examining
division directs the attention of the registrant to the deficiencies by letter. These letters of comment and the correspondence or conferences
that follow continue, as in the past, to be a most convenient and satisfactory method of effecting corrections and improvements in financial
statements, both to registrants and to the Commission's staff. It would
be difficult to express in quantitative terms the extent of the Commission's treatment of accounting questions by these administrative means.
However, a very large portion of the time of the accounting staff is
spent in the discussion of such cases by letter and in conference with
registrants and their accounting and legal advisers. There is also a
large, and in recent years growing, volume of inquiries as to the

122

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

propriety of particular accounting practices from accountants and
from companies not presently subject to any of the acts administered
by the Commission who wish to have the benefit of the Commission's
views, and thus utilize and apply the Commission's experience to the
facts of their own case.
Again this past year the Commission received a very large volume
of registration statements covering the sale of securities to the public.
As has been indicated in an earlier section of this repo~ over 560
registration statements were received during the year. Continuing
the experience of the last year, although perhaps not to the same
marked degree, many of the companies were selling securities for the
first time since the enactment of the Securities Act of 1933. The lack
of experience with Commission practice on the part of the corporate
executives, and in frequent cases on the part of independent accountants and counsel, continued to contribute to the number of problems
which ordinarily arise. In addition there continued in evidence
during jhe year, particularly in the Securities Act filings, a number
of problems of war or reconversion origin.
Revision of Regulation S-X

Mention was made in the last report of the progress that had been
made toward revision of the accounting requirements applicable to
management investment companies as prescribed in article 6 of regulation S-X. This article was first added to the regulation in January
1942 following passage of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The
restatement has been completed and was published in November 1946
as Accounting Series Release No. 57.
This restatement was undertaken after a critical review of financial
statements filed by management investment companies indicated that
such statements might be prepared in a manner which would bring
more forcefully to the attention of investors the special characteristics
of this type of company and the significant aspects of its financial
condition and results of operation. It is of special interest not only
because of the improvements accomplished but also because it codifies
many innovations or departures from conventional accounting.
Although this restatement preceded the operation of the Federal
Administrative Procedures Act of 1946, the process of its adoptionfollowing widespread discussions, a formal public conference and the
preparation of tentative drafts over the course of more than 3 yearsmore than met all of the standards of that act.
Some indication of the extensive preparation for the revision is
evident from the fact that a 1944 draft, for example, was sent out
for comment to approximately 335 persons, including 239 management
investment companies, a number of accounting and professional societies, accountants, attorneys and other interested individuals, and
the National Association of Investment Companies. Replies received
from 133 of the 335 persons circularized contained approximately
600 written comments. Of these 133 replies, 78 represented manage-.
ment investment companies. Subsequent to the public hearing, which
was held on July 9,1946, representatives of the National Association
of Investment Companies and the staff of the Commission discussed
further the remaining differences, and mutually agreeable solutions
were worked out as to most of them.

THIRTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

123

The most striking departure from convention, in the revised article
6, is a provision as to the balance sheet with respect to the carrying
of assets at market values rather than at cost. This provision is made
a requirement as to so-called open-end companies, those which agree
to redeem their capital stocks at any time. All other management
companies .!Jlayuse it if they wish. Other important changes involve
. the disclosures to. be made as to the capital and surplus accounts.
Many of the changes adopted resulted from suggestions made by the
industry. As one example, where a value balance sheet is used, a
"statement of changes in net assets" may be substituted for the orthodox surplus analyses.
As was anticipated in the announcement of the revision, the new
rules have done much to secure a reasonable degree of uniformity in
the accounting practices of these special companies and to obtain more
informative and useful financial statements.
Some Cases Before The Commission

In the last annual report mention was made of a case considered by
the Commission in which it was found that the auditor was not independent and the audits made were not in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards applicable in the circumstances. During
the past year the Commission concluded its consideration and issued
two findings and opinions with respect to the registrant, Red Bank
Oil Company.21 In the first of these the Commission indicated that
the deficiencies in the financial statements contained in the annual reports were substantially cured by amendments which disclosed in informative detail the relationships and the nature and effect of the"
numerous transactions between the registrant or its subsidiaries and
the insider interests. These statements were certified by another firm
of accountants. The opinion stated that there remained serious question whether exchange trading should be resumed until sufficient time
had elapsed for notice of the numerous material deficiencies which
had existed in the financial statements filed in the reports to reach the
investing public, and until investors had had sufficient time to assimilate the information which then was supplied for the first time in
the revised financial statements. Action by the Commission proved
unnecessary, however, in view of the action of the New York Curb
Exchange in continuing its suspension of trading in the Red Bank
common stock. In the second opinion the Commission issued a stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Red Bank registration statement filed under the Securities Act. This action was taken because of
the "numerous serious deficiencies in the earlier financial statements,
which have been on file, uncorrected, for a considerable period of time"
and the desirability of calling "to public attention the material deficiencies in the earlier statements."
I'll,the M aster of Hayes Manufacturin[l Corporation. 22 was a case involving the sale to the public of securities which had been issued for
the acquisition of another business from, primarily, a small group of
promoters. This group expected to realize large profits from the sale.
The Commission found tliat much information which was vital to a
wise investor decision was not disclosed. This failure extended both
n Securities Exchange Act Release No. 3902 (1947). and Securities Act Release No. 3197
(1947) •
.. Secnrities Act Release No. 81111 (1946).

124

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

to the financial statements and to the other numerous items of information called for in the registration statement filed. By successive material amendments filed after the institution of the Commission's proceedings, the registrant freely admitted the existence of substantial
deficiencies in the registration statement among which was the fact
that both Hayes and the acquired companies operated at a loss in the
period after the date of the last profit and loss statement originally,
filed, a fact known to the management at the time of the first filing.
Since these amendments; substantially corrected the material deficiencies proven to exist, it was determined that it was not necessary in the
public interest to issue a stop order and the registration statement
therefore became effective. It was deemed in the public interest,
however, to call attention to certain of the original deficiencies particularly with respect to the recent history of American Engineering
Co. and its subsidiaries which were acquired by Hayes through the
issue of stock thus registered, together with the history of the activities
of the promoters and their dealings with Hayes' management.
In a memorandum and order dated April 16, 1947, the Commission
discontinued proceedings against Transamerioe Oorp. as the result.
of the filing by the corporation as part of its annual report for 1946
of certain information su,Pplementing that contained in its previous
filings." The basis for this action was the Commission's belief that
the reports and amendments thereto of Transamerica now on file,
including the additional supplemental information contained in the
1946 report, meet the requirements of setting forth sufficient public
information to enable investors to appraise the presently relevant
facts, thereby making it unnecessary in the public interest and for the
protection of stockholders and investors to continue the proceedings.
Some of the items as to which questions had been raised in the
order for hearing were eliminated by Commission action prior to
the discontinuance of the proceedings. Although Transamerica has
not filed supplemental material covering all the remaining items as
to which questions had been raised, those of the remaining' items
not covered by the supplemental material are not relevant to the
present financial statements of Transamerica Corp.
The Commission's release dismissing the proceedings against Transamerica Corp. summarized the issues involved in the detailed supplemental information now included in Transamerica Corp.'s annual
report for 1946 and the Commission's conclusions thereon.
Changes in Forms for Registration

Form S-1.-0n January 8,19471 the Commission adopted a simplified revision of Form S-1, its principal form for registration of securities under the Securities Act of 1933.24 The intention to make this
revision had been announced in advance as part of a general program
of revision and simplification. A preliminary draft of the proposal
.. Securities Exchange Act release No. 3946. These proceedings were instituted on
November 22, 1938 by the Issuance of an order by the Commission for a hearing to determine whether the application of Transamerlca Corp . .filed in August 1937 jlursuant to
section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the registration of Its ,2 par value
common capital stock on the New York and Los Angeles Stock Exchanges and (by later
amendment) on the San Francisco Stock Exchange should be suspended or withdrawn under
the authority of section 19 (a) (2) of the act. On November 22~ 1940, the Commission
issued an amended order for hearing and a supplemental amended order which superseded the 1938 order. The registration became effective September 10, 1937, and has remained effective at all times .
.. Securities Act release No. 3186.

THIRTEENTH

was widely distributed for comment and a considerable number of
very helpful suggestions were received, all of which were given careful consideration by the Commission in preparing the final draft
of the form. With the adoption of this revision Form A-2, which
had quite a long and rather famous history of use by many large corporations, first as the sole principal form and later as an optional
form to the old Form 8-1, was discontinued.
The new Form 8-1 is so designed that the complete form becomes
the general prospectus, with additional information not required in
the prospectus to be filed in the form of exhibits. Of particular
accounting interest is the omission from the form, and hence from the
prospectus, of historical financial information. This information is
to be supplied as an exhibit, but may be omitted whenever the information has previously been filed with the Commission under either
the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act and has been maintained up to date by the annual reports required under the Securities
Exchange Act.
The old Form S-l provided for the omission of financial statements of subsidiaries and 50 percent-owned persons which were not
significant. Under regulation S-X, 5 percent is the test of significance.
In the revised S-l, financial statements of unconsolidated subsidiaries
and 50 percent-owned persons may be omitted if the aggregate revenues and assets of all such persons do not exceed 15 percent of the
amounts shown by the corresponding statements of the parent and its
consolidated subsidiaries. This rule conforms to the rule in Form
10-K for annual reports under the Securities Exchange Act as it
has been administered since an amendment of December 1942.
These changes, and others made in the body of the form, should
make possible a very substantial reduction in the size of filings with
the Commission and in the prospectuses to be put before investors.
Form 10-K.-Several
other fairly important changes, some of an
accounting nature, were made with respect to forms. Form 10-K,
the principal annual report form under the Securities Exchange Act
for many issuers, was amended so as to bring to the form certain of
the changes adopted in the revised Form S- J.25 The requirements for
financial statements were changed to permit a registrant to file either
consolidated or individual statements where the registrant's own assets and revenues comprise more than 85 percent of the corresponding amounts shown in the consolidated statements. Heretofore, both
individual and consolidated statements were required. The amendment effects a corresponding simplification in the requirements of
Form l-MD, since that form calls for the financial statements required of registrants on Form 10-K.
Forms 10, ..4.-1, and E-1.-Gertain
minor changes in the way of
simplification were made in Form 10, which is the general form prescribed for use by corporations in filing applications for registration
of securities on a national securities exchange," Form A-I, used for
the registration of securities where no other form was specifically
prescribed, and Form E-l, which was prescribed for the registration of securities sold or modified in the course of reorganization,
were rescinded .
.. Securities Exchange Act release No. 3908 (1947) .

126

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

F01'm S-7.-Early
in the fiscal year the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development indicated that it intended to issue
and sell its first securities. Since such securities were to be registered
with the Commission, it became necessary for the Commission to
promulgate a form which the International Bank could use. Accord.
mgly Form S-'l was devised for that purpose," Requirements as to
financial statements of the bank, together with supporting schedules,
are a part of such form. In the preparation of that portion of the
form relating to the form and content of the financial statements
several novel problems were encountered. Among the special features of the bank which were taken into consideration were the following: (1) subscriptions to capital stock of the bank are payable in
gold, United States dollars, or in members' currency; (2) capital contributions paid in in members' currency are required to be maintained
at a fixed value stated in terms of United States dollars of the weight
and fineness in effect on July 1, 1944; and (3) under certain conditions a member may substitute its demand, nonnegotiable and noninterest bearing notes for its own currency held by the Bank.
Developments In Accounting Principles and Procedures

One of the functions of the accounting staff of the Commission is
to isolate and study the many important accounting problems which
arise. Frequently, a specific and sometimes greatly detailed study is
necessary in order to consider the question presented on factual,
theoretical, and practical grounds which are comprehensive and objective. Problems of this character may develop in connection with
the financial statements of a particular company or may be suggested
by general business or economic conditions. Often there is a strong
mutual interest in the subject, both among individual professional
accountants who have the problems to deal with and within professional societies, with the result that cooperation in reaching a solution is advantageous to all concerned.
One problem which the Commission had to consider during the year
was the proper accounting- to be followed with respect to emergency
war facilities which had been fully amortized not only for tax purposes pursuant to wartime legislation but also for financial purposes.
The study of this question was undertaken last year, as was reported.
Further consideration led to the adoption of a policy to be applied
administratively.
Coincident with the Commission's consideration
of the matter, the Committee on Accounting Procedure of the American Institute of Accountants also studied the problem. In November
1946 the committee issued its Bulletin No. 27. This publication, with
respect to which frequent conversations were had between Institute
representatives and the Commission's staff, discusses the special conditions under which, and the manner in which, fully amortized emergency facilities may properly be restored to the accounts. The views
contained therein reflect substantially the policy which the Commission
had been in the process of developing through a series of particular
cases.
Another question in which the Commission was greatly interested,
and with respect to which there was a wide exchange of views with
the accounting committee of the Institute, concerns the proper acIT

counting for the use of special reserves created by many industrial
companies during the war years. The Commission was quite concerned lest the practice develoJ? of using these reserves in the postwar years for purposes not originally intended and not, except by
very broad interpretation, related to war periods with the result that
profits might be equalized as between years.
Rather strong, divergent opinions existed on this question. One
group favored a concept that the war reserves should be considered
available not only for normal termination costs, plant conversion,
and rehabilitation, etc., but also for "other expenses, costs or losses
which usually arise in a disrupted postwar situation or in the economic
dislocations which are the aftermath of a war." The Commission's
view, joined in by a large majority of those expressing themselves
on the subject, was that charges to the reserves should be restricted
to pertinent expenditures made during a relatively short period after
the termination of war production. The Commission specifically
objected to the theory that the costs of strikes occurring in years well
removed from the war might, by generous reasoning, be charged,
not against the income of the year of occurrence, but against reserves
which had been retained after the war.
The Institute's committee issued Bulletin No. 26 on this subject in
October 1946 and expressed opinions much in accordance with those
held by the Commission, including a statement disapproving of the
use of such reserves for strike costs "occurring after the resumption
of peacetime operations." The Commission does not as a practical
matter anticipate that it will object in the numerous instances in which
expenses of strikes which occurred early in 1946 were charged against
war reserves. Moreover, financial information available as to current
practices seems to indicate a disposition on the part of many companies to return the reserves to surplus, thereby eliminating the
problem.
Near the close of the last fiscal year considerable discussion was in
progress concerning the form of the balance sheet. This had been
preceded by a few years by similar interest in possible recasting of
the order or method of presentation of profit and loss data. In connection with both matters the Commission's staff had held many
conversations with members of the accounting profession and other
interested individuals. Apropos of the profit and loss statement, one
group of accountants appeared informally before the Commission
and urged that the Commission's rules be changed so as to permit wide
freedom in the form and order of casting profit and loss statements.
After further study of the matter the Commission reached the conclusion with respect to that proposal that its rules as to form and
order of statements should not be changed.
.
Three reasons were given. First, it was felt that a convincing case
had not been made in favor of the proposed new form and order.
Second, it was believed that the new ideas had not yet gained sufficient
recognition in actual practice to warrant adoption by the Commission
in the face of its own doubts. And, third, the opinion was held that
the proper place for experimentation of this kind was not in reports
required to be filed with the Commission, but rather in the annual
reports furnished by companies to their stockholders.
The Commission emphasized that it did not wish to be regarded
as opposing constructive changes, as such, that it was receptive to

128

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

proposals of this character, and that if and when the proposed form
of profit and loss statement became generally accepted its decision
would be reconsidered. The staff has applied these principles to the
current proposals as to changes in the form of the balance sheet. It
was agreed, however, as in the case of the 'profit and loss statement,
that no objection would be made to the filing with the Commission
of financial statements prepared in a form other than that required
by regulation S-X, provided that such statements were not misleading
and were furnished as supplementary data and not in lieu of the
prescribed statements.
So far as is known, members of the profession have agreed that
this solution was a reasonable one. It should be pointed out that the
stockholders' reports of most registered industrial companies are not
subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission and therefore, insofar
as the Commission is concerned, may be quite adaptable to the experimentation in question, assuming, of course, that the divergencies
between the two sets of statements are not so great as to raise questions
as to the propriety of certification of both of them by independent
accountants as fair presentations of the data involved.
A problem that has been of considerable concern to the Commission
for a number of years and with respect to which substantial study
has been undertaken concerns the proper accounting treatment of
employees' pensions. In the great majority of cases these pension
plans are voluntary on the part of the company and may be altered
or discontinued without legal consequence entirely at the will of the
management. The Commission has come to feel that serious consideration should be given to the proposition that even under voluntary plans in which there is no strict legal liability to continue pension
payments a corporate management expecting to remain in business
and enjoy good labor relations would not-if in fact it could- abandon a pension plan, and therefore a realistic approach is to recognize
the liability. However, in the absence of a clear-cut legal liability
the Commission has not as yet, as a matter of policy, insisted upon the
showing of an actuarially determined liability for the accruing pensions. Instead, a clear footnote explanation is accepted.
Where the plan provides for the purchase of annuity contracts
from an insurance company or the establishment of a trust fund, in
either case based on past service of eligible employees or former employees now on pension, considerable diversity of opinion as to the
proper accounting has been found. The funding of pension costs for
past service may be accomplished by lump sum or installment payments
to the trustee concurrent with payments covering accruals for the current year. Payments covering the current year are clearly profit and
loss charges. Payments based upon past service of employees currently
on the payroll are claimed by some to be proper charges to earned
surplus on the grounds that the payment is for service rendered in prior
years. Others, including the Commission's staff, have considered such
payments to have been made for a current benefit in the form of better
employee relations, reduced labor turn-over, and similar benefits
currently and in the future, and hence have felt that they should be
charged to profit and loss. However, where the payments were substantial and would have seriously distorted current income figures no
objection has been raised to direct charges to earned surplus, although even in this situation the preferred method would seem to

THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT

129

be to treat these items as extraordinary charges to profit and loss.
Further study is being given to all phases of the problem with a view
to obtaining consistent- and informative financial statements.
Considerable attention was given during the year to an important
problem as to inventories-the propriety of the creation from income
of reserves for future inventory price declines and losses. After carefully considering the procedure and the many arguments pro and
con it was concluded that its effect was to reduce current profits improperly and increase profits of subsequent periods. The Commission
took the position: (1) That provisions made to reserves for inventory
losses may properly be charged against income only to the extent that
the losses have actually taken place but have not been realized by use
or sale of the materials involved; (2) that any reserve so provided,
being a valuation reserve, should be deducted from the inventory on
the balance sheet; and (3) that a reserve for losses expected to occur
in the future constitutes merely a segregation of earned surplus and
should be so treated.
Developments in Auditing Practices and Professional Conduct

For the past 2 or 3 years there has grown up a practice of including
in registration statements filed under the Securities Act of 1933 and in
the applicable prospectuses summary earnings tables covering a period
usually of 10 years. These tables, which are a highly condensed form
of profit and loss statement, are not required by any rule or regulation
of the Commission but they are desirable and, it is believed, necessary
in most instances as a means of comparing the operation of a business
in the prewar, war, and postwar periods. However, there have been
unusual cases where such violent and radical 'changes in the business
of the registrant have occurred that a long summary of past earnings
might well be misleading, and in several such cases the registrant has
been requested either to delete the summary entirely or to furnish only
a brief statement of the over-all, aggregate results without a breakdown as between the several years.
These summary tables are not required by the Commission's rules
to be certified by independent accountants. It has been, nevertheless,
common practice to introduce the summary with language indicating
that it has been ''reviewed'' by independent accountants. This use of
an accountant's name in connection with the summary is designed
and tends to give added authority to the material presented. It is
important, therefore, that there be a clear understanding and disclosure of the scope of the examination made by the accountant in such
cases and the extent of the responsibility which he, as an expert accountant, assumes.
Because of the uncertainty that has existed with respect to the
nature of the accountant's "review" in such cases, the Commission
published an opinion of the Chief Accountant indicating the circumstances under which independent public accountants may properly
express an opinion, and the form of such opinion, with respect to summary earnings tables to be included in registration statements filed
under the Securities Act. The opinion, published as Accounting
Series Release No. 62, states, in brief, that
* * * it is generally improper and misleading for an accountant to permit his
name to be used in connection with any period covered by a summary earnings
table or to undertake to express his professional opinion as to the fairness of the

130

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

representations made for such period in a summary earnings table unless he has
made an examination for such period in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards applicable in the circumstances. * * * In cases where the
accountant has performed sufficientwork to make it appropriate for him to permit
the use of his name in connection with a summary earnings table * * * it
would appear that the accountant's certificate thereon should assume a comparable form [to tbe certificate required by rule 2-02 of regulation S-Xl. and should
be included with the summary or made a part of his report as to the three-year
certified statement.

During the past year the problems of accounting for registered
security broker-dealers continued to cause considerable concern. Because this is such a highly specialized field of accounting, and since all
like transactions have a uniform effect upon each broker-dealer's financial position, detailed reporting requirements and specific minimum
audit requirements have been adopted by the Commission by rule.
These are contained, respectively, in Form X-17A-5 and in rule
X-17A-5. The audit requirements include physical examination of
securities and other items on hand and the obtaining of written confirmations with respect to numerous accounts, most of which are peculiar to the securities business, including accounts with customers, partners, officers, and directors.
The fact that many of these broker-dealer establishments are small
and are audited by accountants with limited experience in Commission
requirements may partially account for the fact that this field has
produced a relatively large number of cases in which it was felt necessary to suspend the accountants involved from practice before the
Commission. Accounting Series Release No. 59, published January
23,1947, dealt with one of these cases in which it was found necessary
to deny a public accounting firm and its senior partner the privilege of
appearing or practicing III any way before the Commission for a
period of 1 y.ear.28
The case was based almost entirely on the accountants' failure to
comply with generally accepted audit requirements, including those
specifically enumerated in the instructions to Form X-17A-5.
Although a hearing was scheduled, the accountants did not appear but
admitted in writing certain failures in procedure and consented to
the issuing of an order against them. Auditing deficiencies included
the following: (1) Instead of a physical examination of all securities
on hand, only a test check of securities held for some customers was
made without sealing the safety deposits boxes during the audit;
(2) the broker's position in some but not all securities was balanced;
(3) written confirmations of customers' accounts were not obtained;
and (4) a second bank reconciliation was not made. Despite these
omissions the accountants gave an unqualified certificate including
the statement that they had complied with the audit requirements of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
From time to time accountants' certificates which accompany financial statements of public utility companies filed with the Commission contain the following qualification, or one similar thereto:

* * * Subject to the adequacy of the provision and the reserve for depreciation, as to which we are not in a position to express an opinion, the accompanying balance sheet * * * presents fairly * * *

In the Matter of Williams & Kingsolver.

THmTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

131

Ten years ago this might have been a proper reservation for an
accountant to make in his certificate covering the accounts of a publicutility company; it has been that many years since depreciation accounting has generally displaced the retirement reserve or other
methods of providing for the exhaustion of the service life of utility
property. During this period accountants have had much opportunity
to familiarize themselves with the property accounts and depreciation
problems of utilities and there seems to be no doubt that they have
taken full advantage of this opportunity.
Under these circumstances
there would appear to be little, if any, justification for accountants to
avoid the assumption of full responsibility for the adequacy of depreciation provisions or reserves of these companies except, perhaps,
in very unusual situations.
In view of this the staff of the Commission made an extensive review
of the history of present practices as to certification of utility depreciation accounts by independent accountants. A study was made to
determine the past justification of the qualification practice and the
practicability and other issues involved in the extension of auditing
responsibility to this area of general qualification.
The conclusion
reached was that past practice constituted a tacit understanding by
which speeific professional rules were waived, that reluctance to assume this final responsibility may well have been justified in past years,
but that the arguments in support of qualification of certificates no
longer are persuasive. The Commission therefore concluded that in
the future it would apply the following policy with respect to financial statements filed pursuant to its requirements: If, in the opinion
of the accountant, the depreciation reserve is inadequate he should so
state jn his certificate; the amount of inadequacy, if known, should be
stated; in any event the reader of the certificate should be left with
no doubts as to whether the depreciation reserve as shown on the balance sheet and the provisions for depreciation included in the income
statement are, within reason, adequate.
During the year two cases arose, both in connection with Form 8-1
registration statements, in each of which the audit of the accountants
was not made in accordance with generally accepted standards applicable in the circumstances, and, at least in one case if not both, the audit
did not include all the procedures deemed necessary by the accountant. Because of special circumstances in one case and in each the fact
that the withdrawal of the registration statement was permitted, it
was not believed desirable to take formal action against the accountants. As an educational as well as a disciplinary measure the deficiencies in the audits performed were discussed at length with a partner
of the accounting firm involved in each case. It is believed that these
discussions proved beneficial to the two firms and that in appropriate
cases this approach may assist in promoting the expert auditing which
is demanded by the Commission.
STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES
Saving Stud,.

The Commission continued its series of quarterly releases on the
volume and composition of saving by individuals in the United States.
These releases show the aggregate volume of individuals' saving, that
767629-48-10

132

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

is, the increase in their assets less the increase in their liabilities, exclusive of gains or losses from revaluation of assets. The figures also
show the components contributing to this total, such as changes in
securities, cash, insurance, consumers' indebtedness, and consumers'
durable goods.
Financial Position of Corporations

The series of quarterly releases on the working capital position of
all United States corporations, exclusive of banks and insurance companies, was continued. These releases show the principal components
of current assets and current liabilities and an abbreviated analysis
of the sources and uses of corporate funds. Semiannual supplementary tables were also released showing a detailed break-down of current assets and liabilities for various industry and size groups of
corporations registered with the Commission. Beginning with the
March 31, 1947, report, registered corporations have been reporting,
in addition to current assets and current liabilities, a few income accounts and the remaining balance sheet items. It is intended in subsequent reports to present more detailed data on the sources and uses
of corporate funds, thus giving an up-to-date analysis of the financial
condition of 'corporations as well as a complete picture of the volume
and composition of corporate saving.
The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce, also
continued the series of quarterly releases on the plant and equipment
expenditures by United States businesses other than agriculture.
Shortly after the close of each quarter, these releases present industry
totals on the actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated expenditures for the next two quarters. It is intended in future
reports to. present additional data showing more detailed classifications of industry groups and a size-of-company break-down. These
data provide a useful index of present and future activity in the
capital goods industries and capital markets and a valuable barometer
of business activity in general.
Survey of American Listed Corporations

During the past fiscal year, the Commission again released for
public and Government use statistical data filed with the Commission by registrants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the
Securities Act of 1933. These data are summarized in a series of
reports known as the "Survey of American Listed Corporations" showing individual data for each company as well as industry totals for
1,668 registered companies in 120 industry groups.
One of the series of reports, "Data on Profits and Operations, 1944-1945," was completed in the fiscal year. Principal items furnished
in these reports on profits and operations are annual data on sales,
costs and/or operating expenses; 0l?erating profits; net profit before
and after income taxes; depreciation, depletion, etc.; maintenance
and repairs; selling, general and administrative expenses; and return
on net worth before and after taxes. Each of these companies' reports
also shows data on renegotiation of war contracts, the amounts and
effects of "carry-backs" of taxes, data on termination of contracts
whenever reported~ and reported war costs, losses and expenses. A
summarization of data on profits and operations for the period 1936-

THIRTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

133

45, inclusive, was also publicly released. These data for registered
corporations, both on an individual company and industry basis, are
currently being carried through 1946.
Another of the reports, entitled "Registrants and Subsidiaries, 1945/'
shows the relationship between 2,095 registered companies and their
13,868subsidiaries. The report is so designed as to show the corporate
systems of which any corporation is a component part.
Investment Company Data

Data for closed-end and open-end management investment companies were compiled and released to the public quarterly showing
purchases and sales of their own stocks and bonds and changes in their
portfolios and in their principal asset items.
Brokers and Dealers

During the past fiscal year, a study was made of the financial condition of 3,276 registered brokers and dealers reporting under rule
X-17A-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The study
showed their cash, aggregate indebtedness and net capital, customers'
free credits, bank loans and firm securities, exempt and nonexempt,
from which the ratios of the firms' cash to free credit balances, the
firms' nonexempt securities to net capital, and aggregate indebtedness
to net capital can be computed. The study is being carried through
1947, and the results to date are included as appendix table 6.
Quarterly Sales Data

Data showing quarterly sales of registrants under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 have been released to the public by the Commission, covering approximately 1,400 corporations in 156 industry
groups. The data are shown for both the individual companies and
industry groups and show the trend of sales for a large segment of
national industry.
Stock Market Statistics

The Commission continued to publish indexes of weekly closing
prices of common stocks on the New York Stock Exchange; the
monthly market value and volume of sales on registered and exempted
securities exchanges; daily and w~ekly round-lot stock sales on the
two New York Exchanges, includmg short sales, weekly round-lot
stock transactions on the New York Stock Exchange for accounts
of members and nonmembers, weekly round-lot and odd-lot transactions on the New York Curb Exchange for accounts of members and
nonmembers, and daily odd-lot stock transactions on the New York
Stock Exchange for odd-lot accounts of odd-lot dealers and specialists.
A number of these series are presented in appendix tables. The Commission's staff continued its studies of various aspects of trading
in securities, including floor trading, purchases and sales of domestic
securities for foreign account, purchases and sales.of security options,
and general research on exchange rules and practices.
OPINION WRITING

OFFICE-FORMAL

OPINIONS

The Opinion Writing Office aids the Commission in the preparation of findings, opinions and orders promulgated by the Commission

in contested and other cases and controversies arising under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Holding
Company Act of 1935, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of
1940 as are assigned to it from time to time by the Commission.
Formal opinions are issued in all cases where the nature of the matter
to be decided, whether substantive or procedural, is of sufficient importance to warrant a formal expression of views. In addition, this
office has been assigned the function of joint responsibility with the
officeof the Solicitor of the Commission III dealing with the problems
arising under the Administrative Procedure Act, and has also been
assigned responsibility for the preparation of compilations of annotations of the various statutes administered by the Commission.
The Opinion Writing Office is an independent staff office of the
Commission which is directly responsible to the Commission. It receives all assignments and instructions from and makes recommendations and submits its work to the Commission directly. It is headed
by a director, who is assisted by an assistant director, supervising attorneys and a staff of drafting attorneys and a financial analyst.
While engaged in the preparation of opinions, the attorneys are
completely isolated from persons actively participating in the proceedings. It is an invariable rule that the attorney assigned to prepare an opinion must not have had any connection with any previous
phase of the case with respect to which the opinion is to be prepared.
The director or assistant director of the Opinion Writing Office,
together with the members of the staff of the officewho are assigned
to work on a particular case, attend oral argument made to the Commission in that case. Following oral argument, or if no oral argument has been held at such time as the case is ready for decision, the
Opinion Writing Office is instructed by the Commission respecting
the nature and content of the opinion and order to be prepared.
In preparing the draft of the Commission's formal opinion, the
entire record is read by a member of the Opinion Writing Office staff
and in most cases he also prepares a narrative abstract of the record
in the proceedings. Upon completion of It draft opinion and abstract
of the record, and after their review and revision within the Opinion
Writing Office, they are submitted to the Commission. If the study
of the record in the case by the Opinion Writing Office has revealed
evidence of violations warranting a reference to the Attorney General
for criminal prosecution, or has disclosed the desirability of the adoption or amendment of rules, regulations or forms or the need for any
changes in administrative procedures or techniques, appropriate recommendations are made to the Commission at the time the draft
opinion in the case is submitted.
The draft opinion as submitted may be modified, amended or completely rewritten in accordance with the Commission's final instructions. When the opinion accurately expresses the views and conclusions of the Commission, it is adopted and promulgated as the official
decision of the Commission. In some cases concurring or dissenting
opinions are issued by individual commissioners who wish to express
their separate views on matters covered by the opinion adopted by
the majority of the Commission. In such cases the Opinion Writing

THffiTEENTH

135

ANNUAL REPORT

Office is occasionally instructed to prepare drafts of such concurring
or dissenting opinions and confers respecting them with the individual Commissioners involved, submits drafts directly to them, and
makes such modifications and revisions as are directed.
The findings of fact, opinions and orders thus prepared, adopted
and promulgated by the Commission serve as an aid and guide to
the bench and bar. With minor exceptions (e. g., certain opinions
dealing with requests for confidential treatment) all are publicly released and distributed to representatives of the press and persons on
the Commission's mailing list. In addition, findings and opinions
are printed and published by the Government Printing Office in
bound volumes under the title "Securities and Exchange Commission
Decisions and Reports."
In addition to the preparation of findings, opinions and orders in
cases assigned to the Opinion Writing Office exclusively, this office
may assist the operating divisions of the Commission's staff in the
preparation of opinions in cases in which participation by the staff
of the division in the decisional process is proper (i.
cases as to
which the Administrative Procedure Act does not require separation
of functions).
The Opinion Writing Office also assists the Office of
the Solicitor in the preparation of cases on appeals taken from formal decisions prepared by the Opinion Writing Office.
Some of the more significant opinions are commented upon in this
report under. the discussion of the various statutes.

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT OF APPUCATIONS,
OR DOCUMENTS

REPORTS,

The Commission is empowered to grant confidential treatment, upon
application by registrants, to information contained in reports, applications, or documents which they are required to file under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Investment Company Act of
1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Under the Securities
Act of 1933 the Commission has adopted rule 580, which provides
that information as to material contracts, or portions thereof, will be
held confidential by the Commission if it determines that disclosure
would impair the value of the contracts and is not necessary for the
protection of investors. The other four statutes referred to are, in
general, without specific restriction in this respect and empower the
Commission to hold confidential under certain conditions any information contained in any reports required to be filed under those statutes. Disclosure of information confidentially filed under the latter
statutes is made only when the Commission determines that disclosure
is in the public interest.
The following table indicates the number of applications received
and acted upon during the past year, together with the number pending

ADVISORY

AND INTERPRETATIVE

ASSISTANCE

References are made throughout this report to the informal assistance rendered by the staff to the public in connection with the statutes
administered by the Commission. Such assistance is usually given
by the staff in connection with specific matters involving the filing
of a registration statement, proxy statement, annual report, and so
on. Mention has been made of the prefiling conference and the deficiency letter in connection with registration statements. These represent only a small part of the total of informal assistance given the
public by the staff. It is not possible to determine the exact amount
of assistance made available to the public by the staff by means of
conference and letter. At the least, such conferences run into the
thousands, and their number is more than equaled by the number of
advisory letters prepared by the staff during the 1947 fiscal year.
In addition to the above assistance rendered by the staff in connection with specific matters, a great amount of assistance was provided
the public by a special Interpretative Section in the officeof the Chief
Counsel of the.Corporation Finance Division. This section is staffed
with lawyers prepared to give expert advice as to all questions of interpretation arismg under the Securities Act of 1933, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and parts
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Upon presentation of all
pertinent facts involved in a particular problem, the section will furnish a detailed and informed opinion as to the application of a particular statute in a specific situation.

assistance, ranging from highly technical analyses of complex financial transactions at the request of lawyers and accountants to letters
from high school students requesting information for term papers.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
INTERNATIONAL

FINANCIAL

AND ECONOMIC MATTERS

The Commission participates in the formulation and execution of
the foreign economic and financial program of the Government
primarily through other agencies and through special bodies concerned with foreign economic policy. The Commission is represented
on the Staff Committee of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems and contributes to the
working groups of this committee. There is further cooperation with
agencies concerned with the development of the Government's foreign
economic program through the Executive Committee on Foreign Economic Policy and its subcommittees on foreign investment policy,
private monopolies and cartels, and on the United Nations Economic
Subcommittee. As heretofore the Commission, upon the invitation
of the United States Governor-of the International Bank and Monetary Fund, took part in the annual meeting of these institutions.
One aspect of foreign economic affairs with which the Commission
is primarily concerned arises under the Securities Act of 1933. Under
that Act it is necessary that foreign issuers of securities, both Government and private, register those securities. Preliminary negotiations
and discussions with such issuers and with other Federal agencies
are often necessary prior to the registration of the securities. During
the 1947 fiscal year 11 foreign governments or their political subdivisions filed registration statements under the Securities Act covering securities with a total offering price of $333,587,590. Among these
registrants were the Commonwealth of Australia, the Kingdom of
Norway, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In addition, 27 private
foreign issuers filed registration statements covering securities with an
aggregate offering price of $62,930,646. The Commission maintains,
through its adviser on foreign investments, facilities for liaison with
other governmental agencies which might have either jurisdiction of
or an interest in the problems involved in such registration.
As mentioned in the Twelfth Annual Report, the Commission continued its activities in connection with the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. The Bank made its first offering
of bonds in the private capital markets in July 1947. This culminated
a series of discussions and conferences which were held during the
fiscal year. These conferences, by the Commission and the staff with
representatives of the Bank and other agencies, covered a number of
problems arising under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. As a result of its consideration of the various problems involved, the Commission, in June 1947, adopted a number of rules under the Securities
Act and the Securities Exchange Act to facilitate the operation of
the Bank in the domestic markets. These rules are discussed in detail in other sections of this report.
During the fiscal year, the Commission continued to make or participate in special studies to aid other agencies concerned with foreign
economic and financial problems. These special studies involved such
matters as the debt status of foreign countries applying for credit and
the study of foreign laws with respect to securities and investment.

INTERNATIONAL

ANNUAL REPORT

BANK. FOR RECONSTRUCTION

141

AND DEVELOPMENT

The flotation of $250,000,000 of bonds by the International Bank in
July of 1947, representing the Bank's first flotation of securities in the
private capital markets, was the first experience the Commission has
had in the offering of securities by such an international organization. In anticipation of that offering, the Commission on June 25,
1947, issued a release announcing the promulgation of a number of
rules under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as well as the rendering of an interpretation under the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, with reference to the securities of the
Bank.
The Bank's request for this action was supported by the National
Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems.
The council was created by the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, pursuant to which the United States became a member of the Bank and the
International
Monetary Fund. It consists of the Secretary of the
Treasury (who is chairman), the Secretary of State, the Secretary
of Commerce, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the
Export-Iniport
Bank of Washington.
Its statutory purpose is "to
coordinate the policies and operations of the representatives of the
United States on the Fund and the Bank and of all agencies of the Government which make or participate in making foreign loans or which
engage in foreign financial, exchange or monetary transactions."
The effect of the rule adopted under the Securities Act of 1933, rule
144, is to exempt from underwriters' liabilities under section 11 of
that act any broker or dealer whose interest in the distribution of the
Bank's securities is limited to the usual and customary distributors'
or sellers' commission or concession. The term "underwriters"
is
defined in section 2 (11) of the act itself to exclude "a person whose
interest is limited to a commission from an underwriter or dealer
not in excess of the usual and customary distributors' or sellers' commission." The Commission had been informed that the Bank did not
propose to effect the distribution of its securities through underwriters
in the usual sense, but merely to allow the customary commission or
concession to a large number of brokers or dealers throughout the
country who would be in direct privity of contract with the Bank.
Although the absence of an intermediate underwriter between the
Bank and the brokers or dealers would ordinarily have brought the
brokers or dealers within the definition of "underwriter" in section
2 (11) of the act, the Commission deemed it an impelling reason for
a rule excluding them from that definition that the Bretton Woods
Agreements Act in effect immunizes the officers and directors of the
Bank from legal process with respect to acts performed by them in
their official capacities, except when the Bank waives this Immunity.
Since this provision relieves the Bank's officers and directors (although
not the Bank itself) from civil liability actions under section 11 of
the Securities Act of 1933, the Commission considered it appropriate
in the public interest to extend similar relief to the brokers or dealers
described in the Commission's rule.
A distributing broker or dealer, in order to obtain' the benefit of
the rule and be relieved. from underwriters' liabilities under section

142

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

11, must make a bona fide offer of his entire allotment or subscription,
at not more than the offering price specified in the prospectus, to persons other than partners, officers, directors or employees of the broker
or dealer, or persons in a control relationship with the broker or dealer,
or accounts in which the broker or dealer or any such person has a
beneficial interest.
If the broker or dealer or any 'such person wishes
to obtain any of the securities for his own account without the making of such an offer and without losing the benefit of the rule, he
will have to effect his purchase on the open market on the same basis
as any member of the public.
The Commission's action does not affect the civil liability of the
distributors of the Bank's securities under section 12 (2) of the Securities Act of 1933 in the event of any material misstatements or omissions in any prospectus or oral communication by means of which the
securities are sold, as well as the liability under section 17 (a) of that
act for selling securities by means of fraudulent practices or material
misstatements or omissions.
The rules adopted by the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, rules X-15A-3, X-15AM-1 and X-12D3-11
exempt the Bank's securities from three provisions of that act. The
first exemption is from section 15 (a), the section which requires the
registration with the Commission of over-the-counter brokers and
dealers who trade in nonexempted securities. The second exemption is from section 15A, the section pursuant to which the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. is registered with the Commission as a ''national securities association."
The effect of the Commission's exemptions from these two sections is to permit brokers or
dealers who otherwise deal exclusively in United States Government
or municipal securities to participate in the distribution of the bank's
securities without registering with the Commission or joining the
NASD. However, these exemptions are subject to the same condition concerning a bona fide offer of the entire allotment or subscription as the Securities Act rule. The Commission agreed with the
National Advisory Council that the interest of the United States
Government in the Bank justified treating the Bank's securities as
"exempted securities" so far as sections 15 (a) and 15A of the Securities Exchange Act are concerned.
.
The third exemption under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
is from that portion of section 12 (d) of the act which 'prohibits whenissued trading on a national securities exchange-unless Its primary purpose is to distribute the unissued security to holders of a security previously registered under the Securities Exchange Act. The Commission had been informed that the Bank would file an application to register its debentures on the New ¥ork Stock Exchange and that the
exchange intended to admit the debentures to when-issued trading
upon the effectiveness of the registration statement under the Securities Act 0:f1.933. This was done. The exemption from the when-issued
trading provisions of section 12 (d) had been requested and was
granted in order that the admission of the Bank's debentures to trading
on the New York Stock Exchange would automatically exempt them
from qualification under the "blue sky laws" of a number of States.
The three exemptive rules adopted by the Commission under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 leave the Bank's securities subject

THmTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

143

to all the other provisions of that act, whether or not those provisions

apply to securities otherwise defined as "exempted securities" by section 3 (a) (12). That section authorizes the Commission by rule to
exempt any security "from the operation of anyone or more provisions" of that act "which by their terms do not apply to an 'exempted security'," and the Commission has designated the Bank's
securities as "exempted securities" only for the purpose of section 15
(a), section 15.A, and the when-issued trading provisions of section
12 (d). The Bank's request for a general exemption from all the provisions of the Securities Exchange .Act was not supported by the
council and was rejected by the Commission.
So far as the Trust Indenture .Act of 1939 is concerned, the Commission concurred in the opinion of counsel for the Bank that an exemption was available under the statute.

the various bases for the admission of seeurrties to dealing under the act. (Issuers whose securities are
exempted under sec. 3 (a) (12) of the act. such as the United States, States, elties, counties, and United
States-owned corporations, are not shown in this table.) Each Issuer is counted once under each basis for

ANNUAL REPORT

SPECIAL TABLES

The nine tables following were prepared for and submitted to the
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of
Representatives. They include over-all data as to securities registered
under the Securities Act of 1933 (table 39), new securities offered for
cash sale in the United States (table 40), corporate bonds publicly, or
privately placed (table 41), divestments under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 (table 42), and administrative,
criminal, and injunction proceedings instituted by the Commission
under the various acts which it administers (tables 43-47).
The tables are all condensed summaries, in statistical form, covering
12- to 14-year periods of Commission activity. They have been included in this report because the information which they contain is not
otherwise available in similar form and because some of the data has
never before been compiled.
