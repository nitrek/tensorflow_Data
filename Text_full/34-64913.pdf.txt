SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
17 CFR PART 240
[RELEASE NO. 34-64913]
Technical Amendment to Commission Procedures for Filing Applications for Orders for
Exemptive Relief under Section 36 of the Exchange Act
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Final rule; technical amendment.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) is making
technical amendments to the rule by which applications for exemptive relief under section 36 of
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) may be submitted electronically. The
amendments are intended only to clarify and update references to an SEC website address and to
eliminate certain formatting requirements.
DATES: EFFECTIVE DATE: [insert date of publication in the Federal Register].
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Linda Stamp Sundberg, Senior Special
Counsel, at (202) 551-5550, Office of the Chief Counsel, Division of Trading and Markets,
Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549.
I. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The Commission is amending § 240.0-12(b) to update references to an SEC website
address to be used in submitting applications for exemptive relief under section 36 of the
Exchange Act and to eliminate certain formatting requirements.
II. CERTAIN FINDINGS
Under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), notice of proposed rulemaking is not
required when an agency, for good cause, finds “that notice and public procedure thereon are

impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” 1 The Commission is making
technical changes to update the instructions and method for submitting a petition. The
Commission finds that because the amendment is technical in nature and is being made solely to
reflect the changes in way a person would submit and the Commission would receive a petition,
2

publishing the amendment for comment is unnecessary.
The APA also requires publication of a rule at least 30 days before its effective date
unless the agency finds otherwise for good cause. 3 For the same reasons described above with
respect to notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission finds that there is good cause for
these technical amendments to take effect on [insert date of publication in Federal Register].
III. CONSIDERATION OF COMPETITIVE EFFECTS OF AMENDMENT
Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act, 4 provides that whenever the Commission is engaged in
rulemaking and is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, the Commission shall consider, in addition to the protection of
investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Section
23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Exchange
1

5 U.S.C. 553(b).

2

For similar reasons, the amendments do not require analysis under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (“RFA”) or analysis of major rule status under the Small Business
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. See 5 U.S.C. 601(2) (for purposes of RFA
analysis, the term “rule” means any rule for which the agency publishes a general notice
of proposed rulemaking); and 5 U.S.C. 804(3)(C) (for purposes of Congressional review
of agency rulemaking, the term “rule” does not include any rule of agency organization,
procedure or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of nonagency parties).

See 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

15 U.S.C. 78c(f).
2

Act, to consider the competitive effects of such rules, if any, and to refrain from adopting a rule
that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in the furtherance of the
purposes of the Exchange Act. 5
Because these procedural amendments are technical in nature, and do not impose any
additional requirements beyond those already required, we do not anticipate that the amendments
would have a significant effect on efficiency, competition, or capital formation, and we do not
anticipate that any competitive advantages or disadvantages would be created.
IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND TEXT OF AMENDMENT:
We are adopting these technical amendments pursuant to the authority set forth in the
Exchange Act and particularly Sections 23(a) and 36(a) (15 U.S.C. 78w(a), and 78mm(a),
respectively).
