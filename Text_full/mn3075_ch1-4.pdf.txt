Introduction

Introduction
This subject guide is about human resource management (HRM). This is the
management activity taken by commercial firms, state owned enterprises
and other organisations to recruit, retain and motivate their employees. In
other words HRM is the bundle of policies, programmes and plans which
organisations adopt with the objective of making full use of the people they
employ. These include everything from recruitment and selection techniques
(which initiate the relationship between firm and employee), to the mass of
rules that determine how people are treated as current employees, and all
the way to policies on separation (which determine whether, and in what
circumstances, an employee is to be let go).
This guide takes, as its organising framework, a model of strategic
HRM advanced by Boxall and Purcell in their book Strategy and human
resource management (Palgrave Macmillan, third edition, 2011). They
conceptualise workforce performance as a function of capabilities (the
knowledge, skills and aptitudes which employees need to carry out their
work), motivation (the incentives which employees require to encourage
them to perform to the best of their abilities) and work organisation
(the way that work and organisations are structured so as to allow
employees to perform well). To this we add employment relations (the
policies, programmes and practices which govern the relationship between
employees and employers) on the basis that employee relationship
management is a key responsibility of the HRM function. See Figure 1.
The guide follows the perspective adopted in most HRM textbooks and
looks at the subject from an organisational point of view, but it also
acknowledges that a range of other factors shape the use of HRM policies
and practices, including government and regulatory frameworks.

Structure of the guide
The guide is divided into 14 chapters, each focusing on a different topic.
Every chapter includes a number of features:
• the Learning outcomes for the chapter
• the Essential and Further reading lists
• a list of References cited in the chapter
• an Introduction to the topic of the chapter
• a chapter Summary or Conclusion section at the end of each chapter
• a range of Sample examination questions to help you to test what you
have learnt. (See Appendix 3 for feedback).

Activities
In addition to these key features of every chapter, Activities have been
provided throughout the guide to help you engage and interact with the
material you are studying. Although these are not assessed, it is strongly
recommended that you complete these Activities as you work through
the course. Taking an active role from the beginning of this course and
developing this throughout, will give you confidence in your knowledge,
ability and opinions.

Style of the guide
The study of HRM is multidisciplinary drawing upon ideas from business
strategy, economics, psychology, sociology and industrial relations. What
this means is that you will receive a range of viewpoints on the subject
as a whole. You may also notice a difference in approach from chapter to
chapter.

Aims
The aims of this course are to:
• give students an introduction to the key elements of human resource
management
• demonstrate how the social sciences can assist in understanding the
management of human resources; and to examine and evaluate human
resource policies and practices of organisations
• help students to examine the different theories which try to explain the
relationship between HRM and organisational performance
• develop students’ ability to analyse and critically evaluate HR policies
and practices.

Learning outcomes
By the end of this course, and having completed the Essential reading and
Activities, you should be able to:
• describe the relationship between HRM and organisational
performance and be able to critically evaluate the empirical evidence
• critically evaluate alternative perspectives on HR practices
• analyse the relationship between HR practices and their outcomes for
the individual and the organisation
2

Introduction

• evaluate the effectiveness of different HR practices
• comment upon the limitations of the theories covered.

Syllabus
The syllabus uses as its organising framework a model of HRM built
around four areas of activity: capabilities, motivation, employment
relations and work organisation.
‘Capabilities’ include recruitment and selection, as well as learning
and development. ‘Motivation’ covers individual performance and the
psychological contract, reward systems, performance management
and job design. ‘Employment relations’ include employee involvement
and participation, organisational justice and diversity. Finally, ‘work
organisation’ covers labour markets, high performance work systems and
the state of HRM in contemporary organisations.
The syllabus examines current theoretical perspectives on the relationship
between human resource practices and organisational performance.
These include strategic HRM, organisational behaviour and employment
relations frameworks, which offer different explanations of how HRM
practices impact on organisational performance. The relationship between
motivation, organisational commitment (defined as an individual’s
emotional attachment to an organisation) and both individual and
corporate performance is central to understanding the effects of HRM
practices on employees.
The skills demonstrated by students are expected to go beyond knowledge
and comprehension. As well as demonstrating that they know and
understand the major HRM policies and practices, theoretical frameworks
and supporting empirical evidence, students are expected to be able to
explain the relationship between different human resource policies and
practices and the underlying theoretical frameworks (for example, by
describing the relationship between performance management and goal
setting theory, or pay strategy and different theories of motivation). These
theoretical frameworks will then provide the basis for analysing and
evaluating whether HRM practices are more or less likely to achieve their
hypothesized outcomes. The potential limitations of each theory and the
subsequent implications for organisational practice will also be considered.

Using this subject guide
This subject guide presents a basic introduction to the main topics in the
study of human resource management. As with any guidebook, this subject
guide is designed to help you find your way around the subject matter. It
seeks to outline, explain and clarify the central concerns of the study as
well as provide information about studying for your examinations.
On the other hand, because it is a guide, it cannot go into detail and there
are bound to be omissions and over simplifications. Wider reading is,
therefore, essential. You should not just treat this subject guide as your
textbook. If you place too much emphasis on the subject guide without
doing additional reading, you will find it exceedingly difficult to pass the
examination.
You should also develop your own set of notes as you work through the
subjects, which will help you engage with the material in a critical way.

How the reading is listed
The reading for each of the chapters in this subject guide is divided into
Essential reading, Further reading and References cited.

Essential reading
For each chapter you are required to do some reading that is essential. This
Essential reading is listed at the start of each chapter. It is also listed in this
Introduction. It is from this material that the majority of your knowledge
will be gained, so it is important that you read as much of it as you can.
Most of the time, you should read the subject guide chapter first, then move
on to the Essential reading. However, please note that in some chapters you
will be advised to do the reading at certain points in the chapter.

Further reading
At the beginning of each chapter, a list of possible Further readings will
be offered. A selection is always offered, but none of them is compulsory.
You can select from the list for each chapter if you wish to. Therefore, you
should not be worried about the length of this list as this is only to give
you a choice should you want one! You may find it helpful to look at the
Further readings if you are particularly interested in a specific subject.
However, we do encourage you to do as much reading as possible.

Introduction

References cited
Books and journals that have been referred to in this subject guide are
listed at the start of each chapter. You do not need to read these materials
unless you wish to; they are there for reference purposes only.

Examination advice
Examination format
Important: the information and advice given in the following section
are based on the examination structure used at the time this subject guide
was written. Please note that subject guides may be used for several
years. Because of this we strongly advise you to check both the current
Regulations for relevant information about the examination, and the VLE
where you should be advised of any forthcoming changes. You should also
carefully check the rubric/instructions on the paper you actually sit and
follow those instructions.
The assessment for this course is through a three-hour unseen written
examination. You will be expected to answer four questions from a choice
of eight questions. Questions are generally structured in three parts. The
first part (‘Define’) asks for the definition or explanation of a concept or
construct and is primarily a test of knowledge. The second part (‘Describe’)
asks for applications of the concept or construct and is primarily a test of
understanding and application. The third part (‘Discuss’) is a short essay
in which you will be expected to analyse and critically evaluate an issue
related to the concept or construct which is the subject of the previous two
parts of the question. These shorts essays need to present an argument
that expresses a view on the subject. They should not repeat the notes
written in this subject guide. Instead the essays should show independent,
reflective and critical thought about the issues involved.
Remember, it is important to check the VLE for:
• up-to-date information on examination and assessment arrangements
for this course
• where available, past examination papers and Examiners’
commentaries for the course which give advice on how each question
might best be answered.

Examiners’ commentaries
The Examiners’ commentaries, which are provided annually, are a very
good resource. The reports provide you with two sources of information:
• how students have performed in the previous year’s examination
• what the Examiners are looking for in the answers.
A consistent comment in the last few Examiners’ commentaries, is that
answers to examination questions were generally far too descriptive. The
analysis, if any, was left to the last paragraph, but more commonly the
argument was only stated in the last sentence.
A significant proportion of candidates tend to reproduce theories relating
to the topic of the question regardless of what the question is asking.
Some candidates, on seeing a familiar word or concept, write everything
they know about that word or concept and do not address the terms
of the question asked. Overall, too many candidates are trying to fit a
revised ‘standard’ answer into the question asked. The consequences are
that candidates are giving strong signals to Examiners that they do not
7

MN3075 Human resource management

know what the question is asking for. A critical learning point from the
Examiners’ commentaries is that describing particular theories is not what
the question is looking for – the key is to use the theories, recognising their
strengths and limitations to help address the issues raised by the question.
Ensure that you refer to the Examiners’ commentaries frequently
throughout your study. As you cover topics, you should attempt to answer
previous examination questions and understand the Examiners’ comments
on those particular examination answers. Take time to attempt to fully
understand the Examiners’ comments and the mistakes made by previous
students. This should be done topic by topic, and you should not progress
from one topic to the next until you have:
a. attempted to answer a previous examination question on that topic
b. read the Examiners’ comments on that question
c. thought about ways in which you could improve your own answer.

resource management.

1.1.2 Learning outcomes
By the end of this chapter, and having completed the Essential reading and
Activities, you should be able to:

1.1.6 Synopsis of chapter content
In this chapter we define what is meant by HR management, explain why
HR policies programmes and plans are so important, and consider the
relationship between HR management and productivity. We examine the
difference between the academic study of HR management and practice,
and explain why theory is important.

1.2 What is HR management?
In 1937 Ronald Coase, a Noble Prize winning economist, explained how
some economic activities are most efficiently coordinated within firms,
while others are most efficiently coordinated by markets. ‘Management’
can therefore be defined as the art and science of coordinating activities
within a firm, via a process of managerial decision-making, including areas
such as finance, operations, sales and marketing, and human resources.
HR management can in turn be defined as:
‘The process of analysing and managing an organisation’s human
resource needs to ensure satisfaction of its strategic objectives’
(Hellriegel, Jackson, Slocum and Staude, 2009)

and
‘The policies and practices involved in carrying out the “people”
or human resources aspects of a management position, including
recruitment, screening, training and appraising’ (Dessler, 2007).

Important themes to note in these definitions, which will be picked up
again during the course of the subject guide, are:
• the role of analysis as well as management
• the connection between HRM and achieving an organisation’s strategic
goals
• the importance of HR policies and practices; and specific HR activities
such as recruitment, selection, learning and education, and
• performance management
to which we might add other things, such as reward, job design,
employment (or ‘manpower’) planning, diversity management, equal
opportunities and employment relations.
The history of HR management can be dated back to the 19th century,
when some enlightened industrial companies in the US and Europe
employed welfare officers to look after the wellbeing of workers, especially
women and children. In the 1920s and 1930s companies employed labour
managers to handle pay, absence, recruitment and dismissal. By the late
1940s labour management and welfare work had been integrated under
the banner of ‘personnel administration’. As the importance of people to
the success of firms was increasingly recognised throughout the 1970s
and 1980s, personnel administration became ‘personnel management’ and
eventually ‘human resource management’. Today some companies refer
simply to the ‘people’ function and call their most senior HR executive the
‘chief people officer’.

1.3 Why are HR policies, programmes and plans so
important?
The effective management of an organisation’s employees (i.e. its human
resources) is arguably the single most difficult, most complex, most
ambiguous, yet most important task that managers face. It is an area of
management policy-making that is not characterised by rigorous globally
accepted professional standards. This is true for at least four reasons:
• HR policies refer to human behaviour, which is complex, often conflictridden, and culturally dependent.
• There are many different HR policy instruments and practices.
• The success or otherwise of different HR policies, programmes and
plans is difficult to evaluate.
• Many managers believe that people management is just common sense.

1.3.1 HR policies refer to human behaviour
Because HR policy deals with managing people, it involves human
behaviour and relationships that are inherently complex, potentially
conflictual and sometimes problematic. Machines or money markets are so
much easier to deal with than people, so that (contrary to much popular
opinion) being a production engineer or a finance officer is arguably
far easier and more straightforward than being responsible for ‘people
management’.
In order to understand HR policy properly, whether as an analyst or as a
practitioner, you need to acquire many skills. You need to know how and
why organisations make the choices they do and behave the way they do;
this means you need a theory of the firm.1 But you also need to know how
and why workers behave and react in the ways they do, whether as
individuals or in groups; and you need to be able to judge how they might
behave and react if circumstances (e.g. the HR policies) were to alter; this
means, among other things, that you need effective theories of motivation.

1
In this guide we
will use the terms
‘firm’ and ‘company’
interchangeably,
reflecting American and
British usage.

These are formidable requirements, and they imply that you need to blend
together the different social science disciplines, for example, economics,
industrial relations and organisational behaviour. HR policy is therefore
inherently multidisciplinary, which might make it more interesting for
some but definitely makes it more difficult for everyone.
You also need to know more than just the theory; you need to know the
empirical work too. This requires a grasp of research design, a store of
complex information, and the ability to manipulate and interpret that
information, which is why statistical expertise is becoming part of the HR
professional’s job description. So, to understand and design HR policies
properly is not a trivial intellectual task.

1.3.2 Many HR policy instruments and practices
A second reason why HR policy is hard to get right comes from its
multiplicity of policy instruments. Policy-makers in all fields have policy
instruments. One problem for HR policy-makers is that there are so many
HR instruments available to them: hiring policy, induction policy, training
policy, employee development policy, pay and rewards policy, job design
decisions, career or promotion policies, and so on.
13

MN3075 Human resource management

Adding to the complexity, each area of HR policy is likely to have some
impact on the others. This means that it is unwise to analyse any single
policy in isolation from the others. One should instead see it in the context
of the whole, which means having a sense of possible ‘HR strategies’, or
groups of policies. The very multiplicity of policies makes the whole subject
ambiguous.

1.3.3 HR policies, programmes and plans are difficult to evaluate
A third reason why HR policy is so difficult is that HR policies,
programmes and plans are very hard to evaluate properly, so that
managers cannot easily establish whether their policy choices are wise.
Neither can outside analysts easily find out whether a firm’s policies, or
those of a set of firms, are working optimally.
HR managers often distinguish between policies (local sets of rules or
codes established help coordinate people management activities within
an organisation), programmes (interventions designed by HR managers
to achieve specific objectives such as a change programme following a
merger or redundancy programme resulting from a prolonged decline
in sales) and plans (specific instruments or tools such as an incentive
plan). These three active forms of intervention can be contrasted with HR
practices, which are informal rules or codes – ‘the way things are done
around here’. These are helpful distinctions to use when evaluating HR
activities.
Natural scientists can conduct controlled experiments to assess the full
consequences of a course of action. Social scientists cannot usually do this,
and when they can it is normally possible only in the artificial environment
of the social science laboratory. Running controlled experiments in the real
world of work is exceedingly hard, and very rare. So HR policy evaluations
have to be done indirectly, and with much less precision. The result is that
no one can be at all confident that managers are in fact doing the right
thing, even if their HR policy choices look plausible by the standards of
common sense or some theory.

1.3.4 ‘People management is just common sense’
The fourth reason why HR is so hard to get right is the prejudice shared
by so many managers that people management can be done by almost
anyone, and requires common sense rather than special training. It seems
that everyone has an opinion on HR issues. HR is sometimes seen as an
area of management that should be done by those who are not quite good
enough to do other more demanding management tasks.

1.3.5 The important of getting HR policies, programmes and plans
right
Having suggested some reasons why HR management is complex, we now
want to explain why it is nevertheless very important to get it right, and
from there to consider the principal objectives or purposes of HR policy.
We need to consider three linked questions:
• What leads to organisational success?
• What is the role of HR?
• What is the underlying objective of HR policy?

1.3.6 What leads to organisational success?
Commercial success depends on many things, central among which is
that a firm must offer to the market the right products on the right terms.
14

Chapter 1: Human resource management: theories, models, policies and practices

This requires a range of competencies, for example, sensible product
development, the right choice of production technology and shrewd
marketing. But it also requires the right cost structure. Firms that do not
control their costs in the long run tend to fail.
Cost control is obviously necessary in highly competitive activities.
Globalisation and more extensive international trade have almost certainly
increased competitive pressures, so cost control is arguably becoming ever
more important. International competition confined to manufacturing
industries. There is intense international rivalry in services too, for
example in banking, professional services, consultancies and tourism. Nor,
with the coming of privatisation and the reality of widespread pressures on
public sector budgets, is cost consciousness confined to the private sector.
If a government agency has its budget squeezed, it is put under greater
pressure to meet its statutory obligations by increasing its efficiency. This
is just another way of saying that it must control its cost base ever more
stringently.

1.3.7 The special role of labour costs
So far we have emphasised the importance of controlling costs, but which
costs are central? There are many sources of costs, for example the costs of
labour, the costs of capital, and the costs of components or supplies. All of
these are worth controlling, but labour costs are worth special attention,
for at least two main reasons.
First, for many firms, they are the largest single element of costs. This is
most obviously true for many firms in the service sector, where labour
costs can comprise 80 per cent or more of total costs.
Second, even where labour costs are not the largest cost element, they are
often the largest element over which the firm has much potential control.
So, for example, a manufacturing firm may spend a lot of money on
buying in components, but so too will most of its competitors and all will
generally face more or less the same component prices. The implication
is that the costs of components will be surprisingly similar across the rival
firms and be something over which they have only limited control. The
situation is often different with respect to labour costs. It is here that each
firm can institute distinctive policies which reduce its costs and give it a
durable competitive advantage.

1.3.8 Labour costs and productivity
The meaning of the term labour costs can best be seen by an example.
Assume a firm has the following situation:
• It produces a total output of 10,000 units per week.
• It employs 100 workers.
• It pays each worker $400 per week.
In this firm, therefore
• Labour productivity (or output per worker) is 100 units per week,
(10,000/100).
• Total labour costs are $40,000 per week ($400 100), and most
interestingly,
• Unit labour costs are $4.00 ($400/100).
It is this last notion of unit labour costs that we mean when we talk
about controlling labour costs. Fundamentally, the firm is interested in
minimising its unit labour costs for each level of output, so the focus is on
15

MN3075 Human resource management

both costs and productivity. Managing long term unit labour costs is one of
the main underlying objectives of HR policy.
Activity
Are there any other objectives of HR policy apart from controlling unit labour costs?
Make notes on your own thoughts before reading further.

Answer
Some commentators focus on other aspects of commercial success, for
example innovation, and see one of the HR function’s key roles as helping
to foster a culture of creativity and innovation within an organisation.
There is certainly something in this, and a school of strategic thinking
based around the resource-based view of the firm has developed alongside
strategies which focus on cost advantages. Nevertheless, in the long run
cost control remains of great importance.
There may also be other general societal objectives for HRM. For example,
some organisations feel that it is important to be, in some sense, ‘a good
employer’. This means that they choose to act to a degree in the interests
of their employees even if this does not minimise labour costs. Some
organisations choose to act paternalistically. In principle, this might be
seen by the corporations themselves as a way to reduce unit labour costs;
in practice, they surely also reflect some degree of ethical concern over
the interests of the employees. No one can deny that such concerns exist
and influence many aspects of HR policy. It is true, however, that in the
long run they are nearly always subordinate to sustaining commercial
success.

1.4 How do HR policies, programmes and plans work?
If the core HR policy objective is to control unit labour costs in the long
run, how can this be achieved? To answer this we will recall the definition
of unit labour costs and contrast attempts to reduce wages and to enhance
productivity. We shall then look at how productivity can be enhanced.

1.4.1 Controlling wages
For many people, the obvious way to control unit labour costs is to keep
wages down; as an alternative the firm can also attack fringe benefits
(like holiday entitlements or private pension arrangements). In fact,
wage cutting is rarely central to HR policy in reality. This is not to suggest
that firms are indifferent about wage levels, nor to deny that some firms
choose to locate their activities in places where they think wages are low.
But most firms realise that their success is not generally based on driving
wages down.
All firms operate in labour markets which generate typical wage rates for
the different kinds of labour they might want to hire. Within any local
or occupational labour market there is normally a range of wage rates
for any grade of labour and that range is often relatively narrow. A firm
offers a wage from within that range but it faces certain consequences
of its choice. If it chooses to pay, say, in the top 25 per cent of the wage
distribution it will tend to attract somewhat better applicants (i.e. people
who will normally be more productive on the job). Similarly, if it chooses
to offer a wage from the lower part of the distribution it will tend to
attract rather poorer quality labour.

16

Chapter 1: Human resource management: theories, models, policies and practices

So any cost gain from the choice of paying lower wages will have to be
balanced against the resulting loss of performance from the less effective
labour; and a cost burden from the high wage choice will produce an
offset from the better performance of the better quality labour. It is an
empirical question as to where the best choice lies (and it may depend
on how important labour quality is to the firm’s more general business
strategy), but choosing the lowest wage is not always beneficial. More
generally, firms have limited room for manoeuvre on the wage front.

1.4.2 Raising productivity
If wages were all that mattered, all the world’s production would gravitate
to low-wage countries in the developing or underdeveloped world. This
is not what we observe, which means that their low-wage advantage is
offset by something else. The obvious offset is their low level of labour
productivity.
This takes us on to the second and much more important route by which
low-unit labour costs might be secured, that of raising output per worker.
The higher the output per worker, the lower the unit labour costs. Most
HR policies can be understood as ways of trying to reduce labour costs by
raising output per worker.
Thus, better hiring policies offer the prospect of finding more suitable,
more productive workers; effective appraisal schemes can raise
productivity by providing better feedback; performance-related pay can
improve performance through better incentives; and so on. Another way to
express this is to say that value-for-money HR policies result in lower unit
labour costs.
This interpretation, that HR policy is basically about controlling unit
labour costs by raising labour performance, is controversial. Many think it
is out of date and that we should pay more attention to newer emphases,
say, on innovation or learning. In our view, that is to misunderstand what
is being said. Innovation and learning are, of course, important. From the
firm’s point of view their prime importance is that they make the employee
more productive (and hence reduce labour costs and improve the firm’s
competitive position). They can also raise the quality of the product,
whether it is a tangible product or a service. Expressed another way, this
means that the firm can produce higher quality at a lower cost. So these
other ways of looking at the task of HR policy are not in conflict with our
view – rather, they are particular ways by which the fundamental objective
can be reached.

1.4.3 How can productivity be raised?
Most studies of productivity growth at the level of the overall economy
conclude that it stems mainly from ‘technical change’ and accumulations
of ‘human capital’. This seems to leave little role for HR policy. That may
be deceptive, but let us start with these two arguments.
Technical progress means that new inventions and new technology are
embodied in new capital equipment and are beginning to be used in
production processes. The obvious example from the past 20 years is the
growing use of computers throughout most economies. Human resource
issues are rarely the cause of new technology, but new technology
often carries implications for HR policy. For example, new processes
will frequently change the kind of labour a firm wants to hire, or the
amount of training it wishes to provide, or the way in which it organises
its production. HR policy is therefore affected by and responds to
17

MN3075 Human resource management

technological choices, and for new technology to work as it should HR
policies have to be properly integrated into production decisions.
Accumulations of ‘human capital’ refer to the fact that, over time, people
generally have more and more resources invested in them. This is most
obviously true for training and education investments, but it might also
refer to such things as better health levels. These investments clearly raise
people’s average productivity levels and contribute to economic growth.
Some part of it may reflect firms’ HR policy decisions but most of it results
from the choices made by governments or parents or the individuals
themselves.
If these two factors explained all of the growth in labour productivity there
would be much less reason for you to study HR policy. But they don’t.
A neat way to show this comes from the fact that, in the real world, we
observe large differences in productivity even amongst similar workers
employed in a given firm. A common finding is that the best worker on
any given task in a firm is more than twice as productive as the worst. Very
little of this variation is likely to be due to different technology, because all
the firm’s workers will be using the same technology.
We therefore have to consider two other parts of the productivity story,
both of which relate centrally to HR policy:
• the way in which production is organised, which we may call ‘job
design’, and
• policies designed to secure the competence and generate the
motivation of the workforce.

1.4.4 Job design
Every firm has a range of products, and each must choose between
available technologies when producing those products. This involves
combining different types of capital and different types of labour.
Over time, firms have tended to adopt increasingly capital-intensive
technologies, a fact which has complex implications for the firm’s typical
skill mix. Newer, more capital-intensive technologies are often believed to
reduce the demands for some skills and increase the demand for others.
The choice of technology leads on to an equally important one, which
may be called ‘job design’, ‘task specification’ or ‘work organisation’. It is
important to see that, even with a given technology, every firm still has
some choice of job design.
Consider what happens in a university or college. The ‘product range’ is
teaching plus research, the production of which requires the intermediate
output of ‘administration’. The most important ‘input’ into this complex
production process is high-quality labour; our job design issue, therefore,
involves the choice between:
a. specialised researchers plus specialised teachers plus specialised
administrators and
b. staff who each do all three tasks.
In other words, in designing the jobs, or specifying the tasks which the
labour force is expected to do, a decision has to be made on how wide a
range of duties each employee is expected to perform; in HR jargon, we
have to decide on the appropriate degree of functional flexibility. This
decision is likely to affect productivity levels, and the bias in recent years
in many countries and in many industries seems to have been to go for
greater functional flexibility (which means a wider range of tasks and,
therefore, diminished specialisation).
18

Chapter 1: Human resource management: theories, models, policies and practices

Not only does the decision affect productivity, but it also has implications
for the content of a firm’s HR policy. For example, emphasising functional
flexibility will generally change the firm’s hiring decisions because it
means that the firm now wants to hire more able and better educated
workers; and it will usually affect the firm’s training policy, in that the firm
will probably need to organise more training to make functional flexibility
succeed.
The choice of production process and the details of the design of jobs
are therefore important for us, both because they affect productivity and
because they are at the heart of a whole set of HR policies.

1.4.5 Achieving productive potential by harnessing competence
and motivation
Whatever the decision on the production process, it is obviously in the
interests of the firm to capitalise fully on the productive potential of its
workforce. This means that its employees should be both able and willing.
‘Able’ means that they are both competent and aware of what is required of
them. These two requirements have messages for HR policy. Competence
says something about, for example, hiring decisions and training policy;
awareness of what is required says something about policies towards, for
example, supervision, performance monitoring, appraisal, feedback and
goal setting.
Employee ‘willingness’ is even more complex and takes us on to the
critical and mysterious area of motivation. Workers are not automata. The
workplace is a locus of complex psychological and sociological factors
which operate at both the individual and the group level. Even when we
have a situation where a superior can give orders which more or less have
to be obeyed (in the military or police forces, for example), the problem
of ‘morale’ (and with it ‘performance’) remains a real one. For more
typical workplace situations, workers individually or collectively always
have a ‘zone of discretion’, where they can choose to supply more or less
‘effort’, and therefore to be more or less productive. The larger that zone
of discretion the more the firm’s policies should be geared to induce their
willingness to give effort and improve performance.
Managers can adopt a whole range of policies in an attempt to induce
this willingness, or to ‘motivate’ their workforce, and the sensible specific
things to do depend on the context. Broadly, however, the firm can
emphasise:
• ‘extrinsic satisfaction’ and extrinsic rewards
• ‘intrinsic satisfaction’ and intrinsic rewards.
If the firm emphasises extrinsic rewards it will place great weight on its
payment system so as to offer its people appropriate incentives. This is
motivation via money and it rests on the widespread view that money
is a highly effective motivator. Many people believe this. But before you
accept it as the complete solution to the problem of motivation, you might
wonder why so few employees have a large part of their total salary tied to
their immediate and individual performance level. We are not suggesting
that payment systems are unimportant; we are arguing instead that
motivation is much more complicated than many people believe.
It seems clear that many workers are not motivated as powerfully or as
exclusively by material rewards as some think. They might, for example,
have strong professional or occupational standards and values (think of
nurses) or strong personal standards (some people always like to do a
19

MN3075 Human resource management

good job whatever the situation). For such people the intrinsic satisfaction
of the job is very important and the employer is wise to attend to it
carefully. This leads to the philosophy that the organisation should seek
to secure a more complex relationship with its workforce than just the
money one. This has many possible ramifications. For example, the firm
might design jobs with an eye to improving job satisfaction; or it might
introduce policies seeking to develop a sense of trust, obligation, loyalty
or commitment amongst its workforce. The underlying belief would be
that such feelings would reflect intrinsic satisfaction and, in one way or
another, lead to higher performance levels and greater organisational
success.
We may explore these ideas further by using Walton’s contrast between
‘control’ and ‘commitment’. This refers to the degree to which a firm gives
its employees discretion and power over how things at the workplace are
done. Managers may wish to retain tight control and direct workers (i.e.
‘control’). Alternatively, they might believe that it makes sense to give
employees considerable leeway, because they believe that doing this will
motivate employees to perform better; to this end they might therefore
seek to engender a sense of commitment or loyalty to the firm. In policy
terms, this might lead them to stress the importance of such things as
retaining workers in lean times, engaging in conscious communication
policies, and attempting to generate a particular ‘climate’ or ‘culture’
within the firm. All this would be designed to build up ‘trust’ relations,
which has fundamental implications for HR policy.

1.5 The difference between academic study and the
practice of HR management
We are often asked about the relationship between the academic study
and the practice of HR management. Studying management is not like
studying medicine or law, which require academic credentials as a ‘licence
to practise’. Nor, at the end of your studies of HR management, will you be
able to walk into a company and manage the HR function – practical skills
and experience are also required. Nevertheless, studying HR management
as an academic subject is of immense value to anyone hoping to work
in an executive role in an organisation, as an entrepreneur in their own
business, or in a worker representation role (e.g. in a trade union). By
studying HR management you will acquire knowledge – of the context in
which HR management happens, as well as of specific policy interventions,
employment practices, HR programmes and plans. You will develop a
critical perspective – to help you evaluate and make decisions about issues
which may be presented to you in future in a work situation. And you will
develop an ability to communicate – particularly in writing – which will be
important for your future careers.
This chapter has discussed what is meant by HR policies, programmes,
plans and practices, which categorise different areas of practical activity
for the HR function. In the following chapters we will be introducing a
number of theories and models, which are academic frameworks used to
analyse and evaluate HR activities. Theories and models are key to our
understanding of the world and are therefore of immense practical value
(the famous social psychologist Kurt Lewin once said ‘there is nothing so
practical as a good theory’). Don’t be fooled by people who say that they
don’t want to learn theory, they just want to know how to do HRM.
We hope you will also come to enjoy studying HR management in its
own right. As we said earlier, HR management draws on many different
20

Chapter 1: Human resource management: theories, models, policies and practices

academic disciplines, including economics, sociology, industrial relations
and organisational behaviour, which make it a fascinating area of enquiry.

1.6 A reminder of your learning outcomes
Having completed this chapter, and the Essential reading and Activities,
you should be able to:
• describe what is meant by HR management
• explain why HR policies, programmes and plans are key to an
organisation’s success
• discuss the difference between academic study and the practice of HR
management.

Chapter 2: Recruitment and selection
2.1 Introduction
Recruitment and selection is an important issue within human resource
management. In any organisation that views the human resource as a
major source of competitive advantage, attracting, selecting and retaining
the right people to the organisation will be of great importance.
The aim of the following sections is to look systematically at the key areas
of the overall process, these being:
• recruitment
• shortlisting
• final selection.

2.1.1 Aims of the chapter
• The aim of this chapter is to describe and explain the processes of
recruitment and selection, drawing a clear distinction between the
two, to compare and evaluate different methods of recruitment and
selection, and to consider whether there is one universal best-practice
approach.

2.1.2 Learning outcomes
By the end of this chapter, and having completed the Essential reading and
Activities, you should be able to:
• explain why recruitment and selection is an important issue,
particularly in relation to issues concerning commitment and attitude
and workforce heterogeneity
• describe the recruitment process, from the point of view of the need
to avoid ‘automatic replacement syndrome’ and the need to compile a
systematic job and person specification
• compare the different methods of recruitment, and ways of evaluating
them
• compare the effectiveness of different methods of selection and make
recommendations as to when they should be used
• outline the key arguments in the debate as to whether there is a ‘onebest way’ for recruitment and selection.

2.1.6 Synopsis of chapter content
In this chapter we look at how, why and when organisations decide to
employ additional people. We look in detail at why organisations choose to
use specific recruitment methods and selection methods.

2.2 The importance of recruitment and selection
Recruitment and selection is not just important where recruitment to
management or professional positions is concerned. The same principle
holds true for all the jobs in an organisation. For companies that value
the commitment and motivation of all their staff, it makes sense to
recruit each person extremely carefully to make sure they are getting
people with exactly the skills, qualities and attitudes for which they are
looking. If the ‘wrong’ people are recruited, it could prove expensive for
an organisation. First, they might not be able to do the job, so they will add
26

Chapter 2: Recruitment and selection

cost to the organisation, second, they may leave and so the whole process of
recruitment and selection will have to be repeated, with the implications for
cost and time. Third, they may have an adverse effect on existing workers.
There are further reasons why recruitment and selection is assuming
greater importance. First, the workforce is becoming increasingly
heterogeneous. This is partly due to globalisation, partly to the willingness
of workers to become ‘expat’ workers and leave their home country to
work abroad, partly the fact that some countries (e.g. Canada), are still
net importers of labour, partly due to more women coming into the labour
force, the increase in flexible working (part-time and tele-working),
aging populations (e.g. in Japan and the UK) and partly due to peoples’
changing attitudes (e.g. towards disabled colleagues). A second reason is
that governments are showing an increasing tendency to intervene in the
labour market by passing legislation. An organisation that failed to keep to
the law could find itself with added costs (e.g. fines) and a reputation that
it treated people unfairly. It may find it difficult to recruit in the future.
Activity
Think about recruitment in your country. What changes have you noticed that are due
to social and political change and what changes have come about because of changes
in the law? If you need help with this, use the website of your government. They usually
have lots of useful information. In addition, you might want to talk to relatives and
friends who are already at work. What changes have they noticed in the last five years?

2.2.1 Factors that should be taken into account when you are
recruiting and selecting
Recruitment is the process of finding and attracting a pool of suitable
candidates for the vacancy. Letting people know there is a vacancy is
essential. Advertising is important here, in terms of selling the company
to the sort of people outside the company that they would ideally wish
to recruit. Advertising can also apply to jobs which are only available
to candidates who already work for the firm (internal labour market.)
Obviously, the advert would be kept internal to the organisation (e.g. on
the company intranet).
Once a pool of candidates has been created, the next phase concerns
shortlisting. The aim at this stage is to either reduce the number of
applicants to manageable proportions or to ensure that all the candidates
have the necessary skill and ability to do the job. This process is carried
out before the more detailed assessment of candidates within the final
selection phase. It is another way of saving time and money.
Before we look more closely at the recruitment and selection processes, it
is worth thinking about what is meant by ‘effectiveness’ from the point of
view of the recruitment and selection process. Recruitment and selection
processes are typically assessed on the following criteria:
1. Cost and budget. As a manager, you will need to keep control of
your costs and keep within a budget. Jobs that are easier to fill and
which have a low impact on the success of an organisation should
not cost as much to recruit as higher level jobs that will have a high
impact on organisational success and may in addition need skills and
knowledge that are scarce in the labour market. Selection methods for
the low-skill, low-impact jobs should be cheaper and less sophisticated
than the high level jobs.
2. Validity. This refers to the extent to which a particular recruitment
27

MN3075 Human resource management

or selection technique is an accurate or valid predictor of actual
future job performance. Validity is expressed on a scale of 0-1, where
0 means a particular technique has zero predictive validity, and 1
means a technique has perfect predictive validity. Some techniques fall
into the zero category. Most techniques fall in the 0.2 to 0.6 validity
range (in other words, they provide a valid predictor of actual future
job performance between 20 per cent and 60 per cent of the time).
An associated criteria concerns reliability, which concerns how
consistently a particular technique measures what it is supposed to
measure.
3. Fairness. Does any part of the recruitment, initial screening and
final selection process introduce the possibility of bias in terms of age,
gender, race, disability, etc.? You will need to keep records to show that
you have conducted the recruitment and the selection in a fair way.
Your country may have legislation that says you must treat people,
regardless of their personal characteristics (e.g. gender or age) in the
same way.

2.3 Recruitment
2.3.1 Does a vacancy exist?
The first issue to be addressed within the process is to consider whether
or not a vacancy exists. Companies should avoid so-called ‘automatic
replacement syndrome’, by considering, when a member of staff leaves
the organisation, whether it is really necessary to recruit a replacement, or
whether work can be reorganised or rescheduled amongst existing staff.
In addition, a decision must be taken as to whether the vacancy should
be sourced internally, or whether it should be sourced externally. This is a
particularly important issue in instances where companies are looking to
provide their staff with opportunities for career advancement or where it
is the organisation’s policy to operate an internal labour market. This often
applies in the public sector.
If the company decides a vacancy does exist, the recruitment process
then starts. The first step is to determine the type of person or people
the company ideally wishes to fill the job, and how these people can be
encouraged to apply for the vacancy.

2.3.2 Conduct a job analysis
There is some debate over this stage. Traditionally, once the decision
has been made that a job needs filling, the first step is to undertake a
job analysis of the vacancy. The results of this analysis will enable two
documents to be produced:
• a job specification and
• a person specification.
A job specification is, in effect, a description of the job activities, task
components and task elements of the job on offer. The aim of this is to
enable the company to find out exactly what the job entails. They will then
be in a position to develop a person specification, in terms of the skills,
attitudes and knowledge that are needed to be able to perform the job
effectively. The job and person specifications are traditionally the basis of
successful recruitment and selection, as they provide the company with
exact information concerning the type of person required to fulfil the
vacancy on offer.
28

Chapter 2: Recruitment and selection

Nowadays, however, companies increasingly emphasise the importance of
flexibility, and as such, they expect their employees to be able to perform a
wide range of job tasks, as and when the workload requires. This is called
functional flexibility. In other companies, particularly those operating
in rapidly changing environments, the nature of the jobs performed by
individual employees can change extremely quickly. Given this, it becomes
impossible to undertake a job analysis, or evaluate the necessary skills to
perform a particular job, as the successful candidate might be expected to
be performing a completely different role in the near future.
As a result, it could be suggested that rather than undertake a traditional
job analysis or person specification, it is better to focus recruitment criteria
on the identification of candidates who are willing to be flexible, and who
have the right attitudes, motivational qualities and level of education,
rather than searching for candidates who have a specific set of skills. Many
employers now seek to employ graduates, but do not specify what subjects
the graduate should have studied.
Whichever approach is adopted, once the decision has been made as to the
type of person or people the organisation wishes to recruit, the next stage
is to plan how to attract sufficient well-qualified candidates who are able
and willing to do the job.

2.3.3 The recruitment strategy
Once the decision has been taken that a company wants to advertise a job
vacancy a decision must be taken as to how the advert will be worded and
where it will be placed. The first decision will be dictated by HR policy.
Will the job be advertised to existing employees only (an internal labour
market) or will the company advertise outside to the external labour
market? If the company decides to keep the advert internet, then they can
use the company intranet, staff magazine or the company noticeboard. The
choice of method depends on the type of vacancy, the extent of the labour
market and the availability of communication methods in the organisation.
As an example, a taxi firm will probably choose a noticeboard in the
‘signing-on room’, so that all the drivers will be able to see the advert.
If, as happens in Singapore, all the drivers have got computers in their
cab, then the firm could safely use email, even though the drivers are
permanently out on the road. If the choice is for an external advert, then
there is a range of recruitment methods that companies can choose from
advertisements in local newspapers or national papers, adverts in specialist
technical journals, recruitment agencies, executive search agencies, or
encouraging current employees to ask friends and relatives to apply (socalled ‘grapevine’ recruitment). The latest way of advertising is to use
social media sites such as Facebook, and, of course, the internet. Some
newspapers now have associated websites, where jobs are advertised, the
moment that they come in and employers can often pay to advertise in the
newspaper and get the web advert free. A number of dedicated job sites
have also developed such as Monster.com. Any company that does not use
its own website is wasting money. Adverts on the internet are cheap, easy
to arrange, and easy to remove once enough candidates have applied.
Whichever way you decide to advertise you will be influencing how
potential employees see your organisation and more particularly what
they expect of you as an employer. You have begun to influence the
‘psychological contract’. The recruitment process is a marketing exercise,
with the company selling itself to the labour market in order to attract
the candidates it would ideally like to recruit. Companies are increasingly
using the strength of their brands and their reputations in order to
29

MN3075 Human resource management

broaden their appeal to prospective new employees This process is called
‘employer branding’ (Dell et al. 2001).
Activity
Make a list of five organisations that you would like to work for, and then make a list of five
organisations that you would not like to work for. Why do you think you would like to work
for one company rather than another? Where have your expectations come from?

2.3.4 Which recruitment techniques should a company use?
Torrington et al. (2011, p.166) has a useful list of recruitment methods with
their advantages and disadvantages. In effect they are saying that with all
the possible recruitment techniques available, the company must decide
which technique is going to be most effective for the specific post or posts it
is trying to fill. The approach adopted will depend a great deal on the type
and level of vacancy. For example, internet recruitment will be of particular
interest to new economy and e-commerce companies and those companies
that want to recruit graduates. In terms of the level of the vacancy, different
techniques will be used depending upon whether the company is recruiting
to a managerial or executive job as opposed to a semi-skilled manual job.
The company will also need to consider time constraints, in terms of how
quickly it wants the vacancy to be filled, as some recruitment techniques take
longer to gather together a suitable number of candidates than do others.
Finally, the company will need to take into account cost limitations. Usually,
a company will be willing to invest greater financial resources in terms of
recruiting to vacancies at managerial or professional levels, but may be
more willing to exert greater cost control when recruiting to a semi-skilled
or unskilled post. The greatest cost is likely to be incurred where a company
needs skills and knowledge that are in short supply in the labour market.
Small and medium-sized companies often do not have a specialised HR
team of their own, or where they do the HR team may be only one or two
people. When these organisations want to recruit, they often outsource
the activity to a specialised agency. These recruitment agencies are known
as labour market intermediaries and have been growing in prominence
over the last 10 years. They are used to carry out initial recruitment or
the attraction of candidates who want to work in a particular kind of job.
Frequently the agencies specialise in particular segments of the labour
market (e.g. finance jobs or jobs in the care sector such as nursing home
assistants). Another function carried out by the agency is the shortlisting of
the candidates into a suitable number for the selection process. One criticism
of recruitment agencies is that they rely on commission for payment and
they are in a competitive market. The more candidates that are placed, the
greater the commission. It is possible, therefore that some agencies do not
carry out a very thorough vetting of the shortlisted candidates, and that
they put forward potential staff who are not suitable for selection. The
result is that the employing organisation may waste time and money in
considering candidates who do not have the required competences (skill,
knowledge, attitude). To overcome this shortcoming some organisations set
up an exclusive contract with particular agencies. This enables the agency
to develop an understanding of the employer’s business and the detailed
requirements of the staff that they need. It also saves time in the long run
as the manager responsible for the recruitment can just ask the agency
to send along a suitable shortlist of candidates, without having to spend
time explaining his or her detailed requirements. The advantage of using
agencies is, therefore, to save time in recruitment. The agency probably has
candidates waiting for jobs on its books. This is especially so for specialist
30

Chapter 2: Recruitment and selection

agencies as people who want these jobs get to know which agencies to
contact to find a job. Even large firms such as some banks use agencies.
They have downsized their own administration functions, such as Human
Resources, and no longer have the time or expertise to do all the HR
functions themselves. It is also possible that, because of their specialist
nature, recruitment agencies do the job better. Another advantage is that
they enable line managers to do their own recruitment, without needing
the specialist knowledge of an HR professional. In international firms, the
use of a local recruitment agency is a distinct advantage. The central HR
department may not be aware of the labour market in all the countries
where they have staff. They would need help, especially with local
legislation and local customs. The use of an agency in this instance would
be invaluable.
We will now look more closely at e-recruitment. This includes everything
from sourcing or finding candidates to an initial assessment of candidates
over the web through online application forms and online assessment
tests. Companies are increasingly looking at whether e-recruitment has
the potential to become more viable or more effective than traditional
recruitment methods, and whether they will be able to replace their
traditional methods with e-recruitment. Many professional business
service companies such as McKinseys, Bain, PriceWaterhouseCoopers
and Accenture have designed their websites with the deliberate aim of
attracting talented candidates, with hyperlinks to job postings featuring
prominently on their home pages. According to the IPD’s annual
recruitment survey (Institute of Personnel and Development, 1999), 32
per cent of UK employers were recruiting through the internet in 1999 (up
from 14 per cent in 1997), though most companies only use it to recruit
to a limited number of posts. Ninety per cent of large US employers were
already using e-recruitment at the beginning of the century. (Capelli, 2001).
What are the benefits of e-recruitment? They can be enormous. On a typical
Monday (the peak day in the US for job-hunting on the internet) four
million people look for work on Monster.com, the leading US online talent
site. Monster.com also has 18 million employee profiles and CVs available
online (Capelli, 2001). This constitutes a massive resource that HR
departments can utilise in their search for suitable applicants. No company
can afford to ignore this resource in its quest to seek out the best available
talent.
Some companies have also established internet alumni networks. The aim
of these networks is to re-establish contacts with former employees that
have left the company to work for competitor organisations, and potentially
to instigate a rehiring process.
Online recruitment has also been demonstrated to be a quicker method of
recruitment than more traditional techniques. One study (Capelli, 2001)
found that companies took, on average, 43 days to recruit a new member of
staff using traditional techniques. This could be cut by six days by posting
jobs online, by another four days if online application forms were used and
a further seven days if applications were screened electronically. There are
also cost benefits to e-recruitment. Recruitment advertisements in national
newspapers are expensive. These costs can be avoided by advertising
online.
Companies have also found that the quality of applicants recruited online is
higher, as many would-be applicants who would not be successful anyway
are deterred by online application forms (see e-recruitment at British
Airways below).
31

MN3075 Human resource management

e-recruitment at British Airways
As of 2001, British Airways told graduates hoping to join its ‘Leaders for Business’
management training programme that they could apply via email only. When BA received
5,000 applications instead of the usual 12,000, managers were initially concerned
that the move might have been a mistake. But it soon emerged that the online process
had helped filter out many of the applicants that would probably have been rejected
anyway. ‘We were dealing with a high-quality base,’ says Peter Holloway, BA’s head of
recruitment. ‘We had no trouble filling our places.’
The decision to accept only online applications coincided with the launch of BA’s jobs
website (www.britishairwaysjobs.com). All of its vacancies are posted on these pages
now, although most are also advertised in the more traditional media.
‘The moment people walk through our door they need to use the web,’ Holloway says. ‘So
in the graduate market that is a valid way to screen out people who are not conversant
with web technology.’
(Adapted from: Merrick, N. ‘Wel.com aboard’, People Management, 17 May 2001.)

Advantages of online recruitment
• Quicker. The web operates 24 hours a day, and no one has to wait for
the post.
• Easier administration especially for large numbers. The computer can
be programmed to carry out tasks such as sending acknowledgements
to everyone who applies.
• Cost reduction. See example above, the organisation does not need to
employ someone to write letters and post them.
• Is seen by many potential applicants. Sometimes people search out of
curiosity and not because they are actively looking for a job.
• Gives impression the company is up to date. Imagine if a company did
not use the web. What would you think of them?
• Enables internal vacancies to be advertised regardless of geography and
time zone.
• Advert can be tailored to the specific vacancy and adjusted quickly if
not effective.
• Can include pre-screening assessment. The computer can be
programmed to ‘weed out’ applicants who are not qualified or the
computer can invite all applicants to sit a test before the application is
accepted.

Disadvantages of online recruitment
• Will limit applicants to those people with access to a computer. This
is becoming less of a problem, but may still apply in different labour
markets in different parts of the world.
• Might attract too many applicants. Potential candidates may only need
to post their CV or résumé once on a website, but this may result in a
large number of employers receiving the information. This is good for
candidates, but expensive in admin terms for organisations.
• Ease of application may encourage non-qualified applicants. See above.
• May be discriminatory. Some jobs do not require knowledge and skill
with computers, why then filter all the applicants through the web?
• Gives an impersonal feel to an organisation which may stop some
applicants from applying. How would you feel if you applied for a job
32

Chapter 2: Recruitment and selection

online after you had taken ages filling in the application form and the
computer rejected you immediately?
• Technical problems can give a bad impression to candidates or stop
them from applying at all. If an organisation relies on a computer as
the only means of applying and the computer fails…!
• Search engine management needed to make sure that the organisation
is on the ‘first page’. When you search for something, the search
engine decides which information comes first. How many of us look at
information on the fourth or fifth page of results?
The above lists are based on Beardwell and Claydon (2010 pp.171–72).
Measurement
There are several techniques that companies can use when deciding
whether a recruitment method is effective and efficient. These are called
‘source analysis’ (i.e. they analyse the sources of applicants for the job to see
if they are effective). There are essentially three types of source analysis:
• Yield analysis: By examining the records of previous recruitment
campaigns, companies can identify the recruitment methods that in
the past yielded the greatest number of applicants, and the methods
that yielded the highest quality applicants. They can then determine
which method of recruitment is most effective for the particular type of
vacancy it is looking to fill. A systematic yield analysis can also assist in
ensuring fairness, in that it enables the company to calculate whether
certain recruitment methods discriminate against minority groups.
• Time-lapse analysis: By looking at records of previous recruitment
campaigns, the company can evaluate the length of time it took from
the start of a recruitment campaign to a job offer being made. The
company may well find that certain recruitment techniques take much
longer to yield successful applicants than do others. For example,
executive search agencies tend to take a long time, whereas employee
referrals can be very quick (Cascio, 1998). As discussed earlier, some
companies have found that the recruitment process can be speeded up
by advertising online. It is important to take this into account when
considering how quickly the vacancy needs to be filled.
• Cost-per-hire: Where an employer finds out which recruitment
method is most expensive. Executive search agencies tend to be
extremely expensive as the process is very labour intensive and relies
on the recruitment consultant building up networks of potential
employees even when no active searching is being done. ‘Walk-ins’,
where a potential employee phones or goes to the employer’s premises
and asks if there are any jobs are much cheaper. Another cheap way
to attract potential job applicants is to ask existing employees to ask
their friends and family if they want a job. The advantage is that this is
a reasonably quick (and cheap) method, but the disadvantage is that
people tend to recommend people ‘similar to them’ and so there may
be equal opportunity issues. The company may decide that it will utilise
the more expensive techniques only when recruiting to higher level
managerial or professional vacancies.
These techniques enable the recruitment process to be planned
systematically, rather than being based on hunch or intuition. But
remember that technology keeps changing so sometimes you may need to
try something new and not rely only on what you have used in the past.

33

MN3075 Human resource management

2.3.5 Shortlisting
Once the company has received the applications for the job, it is then in
a position to begin the shortlisting process. The aim here is to reduce the
pool of candidates either because the advert attracted too many applicants
or to ensure that the candidates have the skill and knowledge required to
do the job.

2.3.6 Application form
This is the most popular method of obtaining initial information on
candidates. Often, companies screen candidates using a number of set
criteria, in terms of whether they have the qualifications, skills and
experience required. Some graduate recruiters use a points system. For
example, they will give a candidate an extra five points for each foreign
language spoken, or an extra five points for achieving a first-class honours
degree. If the candidate is successful in achieving a certain point tally,
they are invited to interview. Some application forms simply aim to find
out a candidate’s qualifications, skills and experience. Others are more
ambitious, in that they attempt to evaluate applicants’ likely degree
of loyalty, the extent to which they will be prepared to work unusual
hours, whether they are likely to be disciplined, or whether they possess
leadership skills,. The advantage of application forms is that all candidates
provide the same information so that one candidate can be compared to
another.
Many countries have regulations controlling what can and cannot be
included in application forms. Recent anti-discrimination legislation, for
example, in the UK has resulted in the withdrawal of questions on race,
national origin, and age. A separate sheet can be used for monitoring
purposes. But it must not be sent to the same person as the application
form. Often it is returned in a separate sealed envelope.
Activity
Ask your local lecturer what the law says about recruitment and selection in your country.
Do you think that it is easier or more difficult to select people if you have less information
about them? Why should this be? How do you think that discrimination can be avoided?

2.3.7 Biodata inventories
Candidates are requested to complete a series of multiple-choice
questions relating to biographical data, behaviour and attitudes. Using
psychometric techniques, the answers received can then be compared with
an ideal profile, and candidates displaying the attitudes and behavioural
characteristics that correspond closely with the ideal profile will be
considered for interview. The ‘ideal candidate’ is usually an amalgam of
the characteristics of successful existing employees. The disadvantage
therefore is that an employer will be recruiting similar people to those he
has already. This may not be the best thing to do long term as it may not
stimulate new ideas and innovations.

2.3.8 Job previews
There are a variety of methods that can be used to give candidates
information about the job for which they have applied. The aim is to
set expectations (influencing the psychological contract). Realistic job
previews can be included in interviews, ‘shadowing’ someone at work,
(especially for internal applicants) case studies, job sampling, YouTube
clips or DVD. The aim is to demonstrate to the candidate the tasks
34

Chapter 2: Recruitment and selection

involved and the skills required in performing the job they are applying
for, and then to encourage candidates to assess their own suitability for
the job and to self-select themselves out of the process if they feel that
the job is not suitable for them. The evidence suggests that realistic job
previews are successful in lowering candidates’ naïve expectations to
match organisational reality; they are effective in encouraging unsuitable
candidates to self-select themselves out of the process. The research also
shows that successful candidates have higher levels of organisational
commitment, job satisfaction, performance and tenure in instances where
effective realistic job previews have been used (Premack and Wanous,
1985). It is only job preview that enables the applicant to ‘opt out’ of the
job application process. All other shortlisting or pre-screening methods
involve a decision on the part of the employer to reject a candidate.

2.3.9 Drug screening
Approximately 20 per cent of US private sector firms now drug-screen
their applicants (Cascio, 1991). This is considered especially important
when recruiting to jobs for which public safety is an issue. There is
evidence to suggest that drug use predicts poorer job performance. For
example, in the largest study of its kind, the US Postal Service took urine
samples from 5,465 job applicants. When the data were examined six
months to a year later, workers who had tested positively were absent 41
per cent more often and were 38 per cent more likely to be fired. As a
result of the findings of the study, the US Postal service took the decision
to implement pre-employment drug screening nationwide (Cascio, 1998).

2.3.10 Graphology
Handwriting tests are not particularly popular in the UK. It is argued that
their accuracy is unproven, and experts argue that the tests can be ‘beaten’
(Saxe, Dougherty and Cross, 1985). They are, however, popular in France
and so may be used in French companies around the world.

2.3.11 Online tests
Some companies have highly sophisticated psychometric instruments and
tests to screen applicants online. For example, the website at JP Morgan
Chase contains a clever online application for college students: a game
based on job hunting and investment decisions, which elicits information
about applicants’ interests, attitudes and abilities (Capelli, 2001). Online
testing has obvious cost and time-saving benefits, and it is convenient
for applicants as anyone, anywhere in the world, can take the tests from
their own PC. There are several potential problems however, not least the
fact that people complete such tests unsupervised and can therefore quite
easily seek assistance in completing them. Concerns have been raised,
therefore, that tests conducted in a non-controlled and non-supervised
environment, may well be less than rigorous. To counteract this problem,
some companies retest candidates when they attend an interview.

2.3.12 Curriculum vitae or résumé
These are used in similar ways to application forms. An employer can
see whether the candidate has relevant qualifications and what their
job history is like. The disadvantage compared to an application form is
that these documents are designed and written by the applicant who can
include only the information that they want the potential employer to
have. On the other hand if an employer is recruiting for a job that needs
new ideas and innovative thinking, the design, layout and content of the
CV/résumé could provide useful information. Some candidates who are
35

MN3075 Human resource management

seeking work in the media have been very innovative when it comes to
their CV or résumé. Some have designed video clips, some have paid for
bill board advertising and some have made films about themselves. In an
industry that requires fresh thinking and ideas, it helps if you can show
that you already have this talent.
Activity
Go on the web and search for a job that asks you to do a test before you apply. What
kind of test was it? How do you think that the test would help the employer to shortlist
candidates who are likely to be able to do the job? What was the test testing?

2.4 Selection
Having completed the process of shortlisting in order to narrow down
the pool of candidates, companies are now in a position to carry out final
selection. The objective of any selection method is to obtain evidence
on which to base a decision. The decision is whether the candidate is
likely to be able to do the job. The selection method chosen, therefore,
should be capable of generating evidence that is relevant and reliable.
The only guaranteed way of seeing if someone can do the job is to let
them do it! The next best thing is to give them the opportunity to do some
work sampling. If you want to see a list of selection methods with their
‘predictive accuracy’, then look at the book by Anderson and Shackleton
(1993 p.30). You can also see reference to their work in a variety of text
books such as, for example, Beardwell and Claydon (2010, p.178).
Examples of the final selection techniques available to companies include
interviews, assessment centres, tests and work samples. The techniques the
company decides to use may well depend on the level of vacancy, not least
because many of the techniques, such as assessment centres, are expensive
to administer. The criteria for choosing selection methods varies but will
include:
• the selection criteria for the job to be filled
• acceptability and appropriateness of the methods to the candidates
• qualifications of the staff involved in the selection (e.g. only qualified
staff can administer psychological tests).
This section examines in detail some of the debates and dilemmas
surrounding final selection processes. The first selection method and
the one that will be considered in most detail is interviewing. This is the
most popular method used across the world and, because of its popularity
‘interview’ is often used to mean selection. In this course, however, we
should ensure that there is no confusion. There are a variety of selection
methods and interviewing is just one of them.

2.4.1 Interviewing
Interviews can take a number of different forms. For example:
• Focused interviews: these are interviews within which the discussion
is focused on a pre-planned set of topics or subject areas but the
interviewer has the scope for flexibility to delve into certain issues in
greater depth.
• Structured interviews: these are focused on specific topic areas, with a
standard set of questions being asked to each interviewee. Candidates’
responses to the same questions can then be directly and systematically
compared with each other.
36

Chapter 2: Recruitment and selection

• Unstructured interviews: no plans are laid down concerning the topics
to be discussed or the questions asked and no attempt is made to elicit
comparable responses from different interviewees.
Activity
Before reading the next section make a list of what information you think can be obtained
by an interviewer. Then mark with a tick all those bits of information you can guarantee to
be true.

2.4.2 Effectiveness of interviews
There is a lot of controversy over the effectiveness of interviews as a final
selection technique, and a lot of evidence to suggest that their effectiveness
is poor, which is worrying and perhaps surprising, given how widely they
are used and the extent to which companies rely on them.
A great deal depends on the structure of the interview. In particular, the
research suggests that it is only structured interviews that are effective
as predictors of future job performance. Indeed, they rank amongst the
most effective selection techniques with a validity of 0.62. Unstructured
interviews, by contrast, have a much lower validity rating of 0.31 (Anderson
and Shackleton, 1993).
Why are structured interviews so much more effective than unstructured
interviews? A great deal comes down to the fact that it is easier to
objectively compare the responses from a range of candidates when
interviews are structured – they are all asked to respond to the same set of
questions and their responses can all be rated on a standard scale. Where
unstructured interviews are concerned, candidates are not necessarily asked
the same set of questions. Comparing the quality of responses from one
candidate to the next therefore becomes extremely difficult.
Structured interviews are seen as particularly effective when they are
conducted as a behavioural interview (asking, for example, how in the past,
the candidate displayed leadership skills, showed initiative or persuasiveness,
for example) rather than as a situational interview (how the candidate says
they would respond in a certain hypothetical situation) (Barclay, 2001).
The argument here is that it is difficult for a candidate to fake a response
in relation to something they actually did in the past. In the extreme, the
interviewer could verify candidates’ responses with former employers.
By contrast, when interviews are unstructured, it is difficult to assess the
responses given by candidates in any systematic manner. The process
becomes highly subjective, and it is this subjectivity that reduces the validity
of the process. Researchers have found that the subjectivity within the
unstructured interview process takes a number of forms:
• Expectancy effect: interviewers develop an expectancy of the
candidate based on prior information, for example from their application
form. This expectancy, which can either be positive or negative, can
cloud the interviewer’s judgement of the candidate during the interview.
This in turn can introduce ‘confirmatory information-seeking bias’, where
the interviewer deliberately sets out to use the interview to confirm their
prejudgement of the candidate.
• Primacy effect: interviewers tend to be much more strongly influenced
by what the candidate says at the start of the interview than later
on, and they will make decisions on candidates within the first few
minutes of the interview. One study conducted over a 10-year period at
McGill University suggested that interviewers make up their minds on
37

MN3075 Human resource management

candidates, on average, within the first four minutes of the interview
(Webster, 1982). Interviewers then use the rest of the interview to
confirm the snap judgements made early on.
• Contrast effect: where the previous candidate was exceptional, this
can lead to the following candidate being rated poorly. Conversely,
where the previous candidate was exceptionally poor, this can lead to
the following candidate being given a high rating.
• Quota effect: in some instances, interviewers have to fill a quota
of successful candidates. If this quota is filled early on, candidates
interviewed later on in the process are less likely to be successful,
irrespective of their performance relative to earlier candidates.
• Similar-to-me effect: this refers to the phenomenon of interviewers
preferring candidates who have similar biographical background and
attitudes to themselves. Such a situation leads to the potential for race,
age and gender bias. It can also lead to a situation in which there are
too many like-minded people in an organisation, which in itself can
have negative performance consequences (see ‘Managing diversity at
Marks and Spencer, and British Telecom’ on p.42.)
• Personal liking bias: where an interviewer develops a personal
liking for a candidate on the basis of non-relevant common ground
(sporting interests, for example) irrespective of the candidate’s
suitability for the job.
• Physical cues: for example, wearing glasses is often equated with
intelligence.
• Ability to recall information: in an unstructured interview
situation, interviewers are in the position of having to think up the next
question, while simultaneously attempting to commit to memory the
answer the candidate is giving to their previous question. As a result,
it becomes extremely difficult for interviewers to recall information
once the interview has been completed, particularly in instances where
the interview is conducted on a one-to-one basis. The result of this
information recall problem is that the interviewer will end up making
decisions on candidates on only a fraction of the information imparted.
In sum, unstructured interviewing is seen by recruitment and selection
experts as the hallmark of an incompetent interviewer, and many experts
argue that they should not be used to make final selection decisions.
However, the majority of companies continue to use unstructured oneto-one interviews as a basis for assessment, despite the fact that they are
so poor a predictor of future job performance. While the vast majority of
companies use interviews of one sort or another, estimates from the US
suggest that only about 35 per cent of companies use structured interviews
(Cascio, 1991) – the implication being that the remaining 65 per cent
of companies rely on unstructured interviewing. It would seem that
recruitment and selection in many companies continues to be carried out
by recruiters who remain unaware of the problems and complexities that
exist within the interview process. This may be because small companies
do not often have HR experts and in any case many line managers are
responsible for selecting their own staff. The continuing use of interviews
may also have something to do with the expectations of candidates. Would
you take a job if an interview were not part of the selection methods?
Interviews enable two-way communication, and candidates can ask
questions as well as answer them.

38

Chapter 2: Recruitment and selection

Activity
Consider a formal interview process that you have experienced (or discuss one with a
friend).
a. Do you think the interview was a structured, unstructured or semi-structured
interview?
b. Do you think the interview may have incorporated any of the types of bias outlined
above?
c. What evidence have you to support your views?

2.4.3 Selection tests
As well as interviews, there is a range of selection tests at the company’s
disposal. These include the following:
• Cognitive ability tests: these include numerical and verbal reasoning
tests. Ability tests fall into two categories: first, attainment tests (which
assess the skills a candidate already possesses, such as typing skills),
and second, aptitude tests (which assess the likely ability of candidates
to acquire new skills).
• Work sample tests/job simulation tests: these attempt to evaluate a
candidate’s practical ability. In these tests, the candidate is placed in a
situation they are likely to face in the job itself. For example, they might
be given an in-tray exercise and asked to prioritise the hypothetical
workload in a logical manner, or they might undergo a role-play
exercise where the candidate plays the role of a customer service agent
and the assessor plays the role of a difficult customer. Tests such as this
often assess the methods and processes the candidate utilises rather
than the results they achieve.
• Personality tests: these allow for the quantification of characteristics
that are considered by the company to be important to job performance
and difficult to measure by other methods.
There has been an increase in the use of these techniques. Indeed, it is
estimated that as many as 100,000 psychometric tests are taken every day
in Western countries (Wilson, 1995, p.30). Ability, aptitude and personality
questionnaires are used mainly for managerial posts, while literacy and
numeracy tests are more popular for clerical and secretarial positions
(Beardwell and Holden, 2000). Tests such as these should really be seen as
complementary to interviews, rather than replacing them. The important
question, however, is how and when should these techniques be used, and
just how effective are they?

2.4.4 Effectiveness of tests
Ability, attainment and aptitude tests
Typically, these types of test have been rated as highly valid predictors
of future job performance. Ability tests have been estimated to have a
validity rating of 0.54, while work sample tests have been estimated to
have a rating of 0.55, for example (Anderson and Shackleton, 1993).
However, they have met with criticism from Robert Sternberg, professor
of psychology and education at Yale University in the US (People
Management, 1998). He argues that successful people in the workplace
achieve their success through the balance of three kinds of abilities.

39

MN3075 Human resource management

These include, first, analytical abilities (which involve the ability to
analyse abstract data problems); second, creative abilities (the ability
to find novel or original solutions to problems); and third, practical
abilities (the solution of real, everyday problems). These abilities do not
necessarily coincide, and a person who is strong in one of these areas will
not necessarily be strong in the others. Therefore, if selection tests are
to be effective, it is necessary that they test for each of these three areas.
However, Professor Sternberg argues that conventional ability tests tend
to focus primarily on the measurement of analytical or abstract skills.
This tends to be the result of the way in which tests have developed over
time. In particular, they derive from tests that were originally designed
to predict academic performance, and as such, they tend, unsurprisingly,
to reflect the kinds of attributes that academics value (for example, the
ability to apply logical thought to narrow and abstract problems). This
means that conventional tests of ability tell us little about a candidate’s
creative and practical abilities. There is a need, therefore, to develop
new measures or tests that evaluate these abilities also. This is not
happening, according to Professor Sternberg, because the organisations
that are responsible for devising such tests – recruitment and selection
consultancies in particular – are worried that if they begin to devise
new tests, this will be tantamount to admitting that their current tests
are flawed, and that this will in turn will impact on the sales of existing
products. As such, recruitment consultancies continue to spend very little
in terms of the research and development of new forms of ability tests.
There does not seem to be a demand from employers to develop different
kinds of tests and employers continue to buy the old style tests.

2.4.5 Personality tests
There is a fairly vociferous debate about the value of personality tests
and whether or not personality can be measured (Beardwell and Holden,
2000). The debate centres around a lack of agreement on four key issues.
These are first, the extent to which personality is measurable; second, the
extent to which personality remains stable over time; third, the extent to
which personality traits can be identified as being necessary or desirable
for a particular job; and fourth, the extent to which the completion of a
questionnaire can provide sufficient information about an individual’s
personality. Personality tests can also suffer from problems relating to
cultural bias. One study found that candidates from different European
countries answered test questions in very diverse ways. For example,
candidates from Sweden tended to score very poorly on questions relating
to need for achievement (which are popular questions when assessing
sales drive), as they prefer to bury any desire to achieve beneath a socially
conscious exterior (Financial Times, 1998). The issue here is that all good
quality personality testing must take these types of cultural differences
into account. The leading HR consultancy firms that deal with personality
testing, such as PA Consulting or SHL for example, have gone to great
lengths to iron out cultural inconsistencies of this type.
Activity
Go on the internet and find a site such as shldirect.com. Try out some of the tests.

2.4.6 Assessment centres
The types of selection tests discussed above are often administered in
assessment centre situations. Participants undertake a variety of tests,
group exercises and interviews, while being observed by a team of
40

Chapter 2: Recruitment and selection

multiple assessors who reach a final decision based on pooled information.
They can take several days to complete, and are therefore quite a costly
process, though predictive accuracy is high if they are conducted properly.
Due to their high cost, their use tends to be reserved for management and
graduate selection.

2.4.7 Reference checks
As a final stage within the recruitment and selection process, a reference
request is normally sent to previous or current employers. The information
received rarely adds anything, as most references are written in a
positive light and it is debatable as to how much a referee knows about
the candidate’s on-the-job performance anyway. The principal value of
reference checking lies in the fact that it provides a factual check relating
to the candidate’s qualifications and prior experience.

2.5 Is there an ideal, or ‘one best way’ approach to final
selection?
In this chapter, a range of different recruitment and final selection
techniques have been examined, some of which are more effective than
others. How do we bring all of this information together? Is there a
combination of approaches that constitutes an ‘ideal type’?
It is inevitably the case that the approach taken to recruitment, shortlisting
and final selection will vary depending upon the position being recruited
to (such as whether managerial/professional as opposed to nonmanagerial). For example, companies are unlikely to use assessment
centres for lower-level vacancies given the costs involved in carrying
them out. It is clear, however, that, irrespective of the level of the vacancy
being recruited to, companies must carry out the processes of recruitment,
shortlisting and final selection in a thorough, systematic manner. Unless
the company has compiled a person analysis of some form, and has
conducted a source analysis to ensure the right recruitment techniques
are adopted, there will be no guarantee that the pool of candidates
generated will possess the qualities and competencies the company is
looking for.
In terms of final selection, it is certainly the case that tests can be highly
accurate predictors of future job performance, if they are properly
managed and selected appropriately. In fact, they can be extremely
useful in bolstering the accuracy of selection decisions. They are better
measures of ability and personality than interviews, so the argument here
is that tests should be used to assess these qualities, while interviews
should be freed up to assess other issues (speech, poise and appearance,
for example) which can only be evaluated in an interview situation. In
addition, the evidence suggests that interviews are particularly effective
at rating a person’s level of friendliness – ratings in interviews of a
candidate’s friendliness frequently match supervisor assessments of
friendliness in later appraisals. Interviews are also important from a public
relations perspective, or from the point of view of company image, as
it can be disheartening for applicants to be rejected on the basis of test
results alone if they have not been interviewed also. A candidate rejected
today may well be a potential customer in the future, so it makes good
business sense to treat them with courtesy and respect. Do not forget that
interviews also provide an opportunity for the applicant to ask questions
as well as to answer them. It can help the candidate to get enough
information to decide if they want the job after all.
41

MN3075 Human resource management

As a final point with regard to interviews, however, it is essential that
interviews are structured if they are to prove effective. All of the available
evidence suggests that it is only where interviews are structured, that it
is possible to systematically compare the quality of candidates’ responses
across a range of issues, in a meaningful way.
While on the one hand, however, there are many reasons why recruitment
and selection should have become increasingly important, there is much
evidence to suggest that recruitment practices within many companies
remain highly unsophisticated. There have only been limited advances
in the level of sophistication, and these advances tend to be restricted
to larger companies where specialist human resource staff are available.
Recruitment and selection in many companies often remains haphazard.
Another explanation is that pressures on organisations, such as cost or
legislation, have an effect on the choice of selection techniques. For a more
detailed explanation see U-C. Klehe (2004).
The opposite of recruiting is downsizing or making people redundant. Both
activities are to do with ensuring that an organisation has the ‘right’ number
of people working for it, so that the organisation can meet its objectives
at minimal cost. Making people redundant is not a decision to be taken
lightly. In addition to the costs that will be incurred, there will be human
costs associated and people may well react adversely to being given the
news that they no longer have a job. There are many things to take into
consideration before beginning the process. One of the major factors will be
local legislation and what it says about an employer’s ability to shed staff.
It has been said that one of the reasons that the UK economy fared better
than that in Europe prior to the recession of 2008, is that it was easier to
make staff redundant in Britain compared to the rest of Europe. This lead
to a more flexible workforce in the UK, which made them cheaper to run.
Compared to the United States, however, even the British labour market
is inflexible. In the US, the employment contract is an ‘at will’ contract,
and staff are not covered by redundancy legislation. Another factor that
may influence a decision to make staff redundant is the power of the trade
unions. If the majority of staff are members of a trade union and the union
threatens strike action, then an employer needs to weigh up the cost of
losing all or some production compared to the cost saving of making some
workers redundant. Finally, an employer needs to take time into account
before reaching a decision. If the need to cut cost is short term and an
upturn in business is expected in the near future, then rather than making
staff redundant and losing their skills forever, an employer may decide to
offer part-time working or unpaid leave for a fixed period of time. Some
staff may welcome the opportunity to take time off from a busy job and do
other things (e.g. travel the world). Some may return, but others may not.
An unintended consequence of offering unpaid leave may be a permanent
reduction in head count. Unpaid leave or part-time working may also be the
preferred option for organisations who employ specialist staff, and where
the skills and knowledge are in short supply in the labour market (e.g.
specialist software firms such as the producers of games).
Example of practice: managing diversity at Marks and Spencer, and British
Telecom
Many of the UK’s more progressive organisations are, for good business reasons, consciously
attempting to increase the proportion of their workforces that originate from minority
ethnic backgrounds. The basis of the so-called ‘managing diversity’ argument is that if
companies employ staff from a wide range of backgrounds this will provide them with the
competencies and knowledge to develop products or services that are better suited, or
42

Chapter 2: Recruitment and selection

more closely tailored to the needs and tastes of different ethnic groups, which in turn will
enable wider markets to be tapped into. This would especially be the case for companies
operating internationally, where staff possessing a diverse knowledge of different countries
and national cultures will enable products and services to be developed and marketed in a
manner that is sensitive to cultural differences around the globe.
Arguments such as these have been taken on board by Marks and Spencer, the UK
retailing chain, perhaps not surprisingly since the minority ethnic community in the UK is
estimated to have a spending power of £14.9 billion. Marks and Spencer has deliberately
targeted minority ethnic groups in its recruitment campaigns, in an attempt to shed its
white, middle-class image and to attract a more diverse range of customers from all
segments of society (Whitehead, 1999).
British Telecom is another example. Minority ethnic employees are seen as capable
of making a distinctive contribution to the business through their ability to interact
sensitively with customers from their own ethnic background. In addition, they are seen
as better able to identify new marketing opportunities and approaches in terms of the
way in which services are marketed to ethnic minority communities.

Chapter 3: Training and development

Chapter 3: Training and development
3.1 Introduction
This chapter starts with some definitions of what the terms relating to
training and development means. It goes on to introduce you to ideas as to
why learning at work is important, and asks you to consider who might be
involved in the processes in an organisation. We then look at some of the
theories that influence adult learning, then consider Kolb’s learning cycle
and finally think about what factors influence training and development
activity and what might do so in the future. When you have looked at
training and development in general, you should then find out what
vocational education is and how it is organised in your own country.

3.1.1 Aims of the chapter
• This chapter explains why training and development is such an
important part of organisational activity and the role played by the
human resources function.

3.1.2 Learning outcomes
By the end of this chapter, and having completed the Essential reading and
Activities, you should be able to:
• explain the effect that training and development has on workforce
flexibility, customer service and quality, and workforce commitment
• explain how de-layering, new technology, and labour and skills
shortages in the labour market have an influence on training and
development activity
• describe the training cycle and outline the issues that need to be taken
into account concerning the implementation of training programmes
• outline the main theories that influence adult learning
• describe what is meant by vocational education and be able to explain
how it works in your own country.

3.1.6 Synopsis of chapter content
This chapter defines what is meant by training and development, explains
why it is important to organisations, describes the stages in designing
training and development ‘events’, and looks at different training methods.
It considers barriers to learning and theories about learning.

3.2 Definitions of training and development
A willingness to learn at work and acquire new skills and knowledge is a
form of discretionary behaviour on the part of employees. The willingness
of the employees to learn and the effectiveness of the training and
development can make a difference to the effectiveness and profitability
of organisations. It would be a useful beginning to distinguish between
education, training and learning. Mayo and Lank (1994 as cited in Gold et
al. 2010) have given the following definitions:
• Education is the exposure to new knowledge, concepts and ideas
in a relatively programmed way. It is normally aimed at increasing
knowledge, or modifying attitudes and beliefs.
• Training includes those solutions to a learning need that involve being
taught or shown a way of doing things. It is essentially skill related.
• Learning is employee need centred and starts with the individual as
beneficiary.
Kolb (1984) argues that learning is a knowledge-creating process through
transforming experience and Honey and Mumford (1992) say that you can
tell when learning has taken place when people can demonstrate that they
know something that they did not know before and/or when they can do
something they could not do before. From the above, therefore, you can
see that learning relates to knowledge, skill and attitudes. These three are
47

MN3075 Human resource management

sometimes referred to as competences.
Training and development can take a variety of forms. Below is a flavour
of some different training and development activities:
• Induction training is undertaken when a new employee joins an
organisation. It is partly an information giving exercise (explaining
how the firm is organised and who works for whom) but it is also part
of the socialisation process, so that new staff begin to learn the rules
and understand ‘how we do things around here’. In other words people
begin to learn the culture of an organisation. The lack of induction
training can encourage employees to leave their new job in the first few
weeks.
• Remedial skills training: this occurs to fill ‘skill gaps’ when an employee
or group of employees lack the skills necessary to perform their
current job task effectively. It is especially important as the pace of
technological change is increasing. It would be pointless to invest in
new machinery and software if the existing workforce could not use it.
• Developmental training: this concerns the acquisition of competencies
(skills, knowledge and attitudes) that the company will find necessary
in the future. This type of training is designed to meet long-term
corporate needs rather than providing training in specific skills required
currently. Developmental training also refers to the preparation given
to employees for promotion or for managerial succession, in which
case it is called management development and is often linked to Talent
Management schemes.
It is also important to bear in mind that skills training can be either:
1. ‘firm specific’, referring to training in skills that will only be of value
within the employee’s particular organisation (e.g. learning how to
drive a train if you work for a mass transit or railway company)
2. ‘transferable’; referring to training in skills that will be of value in
a wide range of employment situations; it might be the case that
employers are less willing to train in ‘transferable’ skills, as they may
fear that other firms will poach their trained staff from them, and as
such, they will then lose investment they have made in their staff (e.g.
bookkeeping or accountancy).
Activity
Before reading the next section, write down all the reasons you can think of as to why
training and development is important for organisations and their success.

3.3 Why is training and development important?
Training has always been an important issue within organisations.
However well a company carries out its recruitment activities, it will
usually be necessary to equip individual employees with the skills
necessary to be able to function fully within the organisation. Also, as
mentioned above, if a company invests in new technology, it will need
to train existing employees. As companies change, individuals have to
be trained and developed in order that they can continue to function
efficiently. There is nothing new in this. However, for a number of reasons,
training has recently become an issue of central concern. Many of the
reasons relate to globalisation and increasing worldwide competition and
the need to control costs.

48

Chapter 3: Training and development

3.3.1 Increasing importance of product and service quality
To try to differentiate their product from that of their competitors many
companies are increasingly focusing on quality of product and service.
Striving for quality generates considerable training needs. For example,
shopfloor employees need to be trained in techniques such as statistical
process control, ‘zero defect’ and ‘right first time’ techniques. If employees
are to become responsible for their own quality, they need the skills
necessary to be able to correct faults, to be trained in problem solving
techniques such as cause-and-effect analysis, for example, Collin (2001).
Equipping employees with the requisite skills to be able to operate in
a quality-oriented environment is important, but so too is ‘attitudinal’
training. Employee commitment to quality and to the ethos of continuous
improvement requires extensive training in corporate values and corporate
culture, in order to instil within the workforce the importance of customer
care, service and product quality. Developing a philosophy of quality,
or a ‘quality culture’, therefore represents a considerable training and
development issue (Mabey and Salaman, 1995).

3.3.2 Flexibility
The environment within which companies are operating is becoming
increasingly turbulent. If organisations are to be able to adapt to their
changing environments, there is a need for employees within the
organisation to be adaptable also. An organisation is only able to take
advantage of an emerging market or move into a new market niche if
its employees possess the skills to be able to operate effectively within
the new market or niche (Crofts, 1995). As such, there is an increasing
emphasis on ‘emergent skills’ that might not be necessary at the current
point in time, but may well be essential in the future. In such a situation,
recruiting employees who are ‘trainable’, and will be willing and able to
learn new skills as the organisation requires, also becomes important. If
the existing workforce is not willing to learn new skills, it may be that
the first step would be to train them to accept change and to change their
attitude to training.
Also, a workforce will be more effective where employees do not just
perform a single job task, but where they are able to move between
different job tasks. This requires employees to be ‘multi-skilled’ (i.e. to be
trained in a wide range of skills). Employees who are fully trained to carry
out all aspects of production can then be moved around as the workload
requires (Hyman, 1996).

3.3.3 New technology
With the growth in advanced technologies, there is a demand for labour
that possesses the requisite knowledge and skill to use the technology
effectively. It will be impossible for companies to take advantage of new
technological developments, or to adapt to new technology, unless the
workforce possesses the relevant skills. It is important for managers to
receive training in new technology also, if they are to be in a position to be
able to disseminate knowledge to their subordinates (Hyman, 1996).

3.3.4 Downsizing and de-layering in lean organisations
In recent times, companies have sought ways to control costs. Sometimes
initiatives include stripping out middle-management layers. For the
remaining managers and supervisors, their ‘span of control’ has increased.
They have become responsible for a wider range of functions and a larger
number of staff. As spans of control increase, managers and supervisors
49

MN3075 Human resource management

are no longer able to exercise direct control over their subordinates.
Instead, the expectation is that the managers will delegate more and
trust their staff. Equipping managers with the interpersonal and coaching
skills necessary to be able to adopt this style of management is therefore
increasingly important (Hyman, 1996). The most difficult challenge is to
change the attitude of managers so that they do trust their staff.

3.3.5 Employee commitment
There is an increasing realisation that the provision of training, employee
development and long-term education is central in terms of the generation
of employee commitment (Holden, 2001). Studies (Wiley 2010)
have shown that training and development play a part in influencing
the engagement of workers in organisations. This is highlighted in
particular where graduate recruits are concerned. There is an increasing
acknowledgement that new graduates will be unwilling to work for
companies that do not provide them with opportunities to learn new skills
or opportunities for systematic management development (Tulgan 2009).
Employees may view the willingness of the organisation to train them and
to invest in their development as setting up an obligation that needs to be
reciprocated. The employee may then work harder or be prepared to stay
in the organisation. See more on this in 4.8 Commitment.

3.3.6 ‘Spillover effect’
The training of an individual employee may also have a beneficial effect
on all the other employees in that team or section. Better performance
or more skilled working practice may be transferred from the person
who was trained to their co-workers through collaboration and daily
interaction. The organisation benefits by more than the money spent on
one training course. Sometimes managers take a deliberate decision to
send only one worker on the course to learn new skills and expects that
worker to train the others. This is called cascade training. The advantage
is that it is cheaper as only one worker goes on a course. The disadvantage
is that if the trained worker has not fully understood the training, then all
the workers in that section will not be fully trained as a consequence.

3.3.7 Skills and labour shortages
In times when unemployment is low companies cannot expect to find
skilled workers amongst the shrinking pool of unemployed. In such
a situation, if companies need specific skills, it becomes increasingly
necessary to develop them in-house. However the reverse is not true,
that organisations do not need to train when there are large numbers
of unemployed. Most labour markets suffer from skills shortages and so
although there may be many people seeking work, they may not have the
skills and knowledge required by an employer.
If you want to read a case study of how human resource development
(HRD) fits into an organisation and benefits the people and the
organisation, then look at Stephen Gibb’s book Human resource
development (2008 pp.155–59). In this case he sets out how HRD is used
to support the strategy of a bank and how HRD techniques are used in
practice.

Chapter 3: Training and development

3.4 Considerations in the design of training programmes.
What are the major stages involved in designing a
training programme?
3.4.1 Determining training needs
The first stage in developing any training programme is to identify the
skills deficiencies that exist within the company and determine which
employees need to undergo training. This stage is the foundation of the
whole process. Unless training needs are properly assessed, the training
programme introduced may be quite different from what is actually
needed. Indeed, one study in the US suggested that vast sums of money
are wasted as a result of the failure of firms to analyse training needs
effectively (Bernhard and Ingolis, 1988). Companies therefore need to
understand the training cycle, which begins with a systematic training
needs analysis. Most studies of training look at a systematic approach to

the opportunity

training. These days it is recognised that not all learning is as the result of
training and people learn while they are working on the job. A systematic
approach to learning and training is outlined by Torrington et al. (2011,
p.398):
• identify learning needed
• design appropriate learning opportunity
• enable learner to undertake the opportunity
• evaluate if learning has taken place.
A training needs analysis comprises a sequential approach – see Figure 3.2
overleaf.

3.4.2 Organisational analysis
The first issue to consider is whether certain parts of the organisation are
experiencing inefficiencies, and if so, whether this inefficiency is the result
of a lack of training.
51

MN3075 Human resource management

If you want a more detailed model, which outlines the way in which a
Training Needs Analysis (TNA) is built up, then look at the work of Cascio
(1998). He also outlines a systematic approach to TNA, but includes more
detailed factors and highlights where there may be a need for solutions
to problems that provide alternatives to training and development. Here,
as an example, you would find the need to look at the recruitment and
selection processes in an organisation. If the ‘right’ recruits are not being
attracted to the organisation, then no amount of training will solve the
organisation’s problems. Cascio lists the alternative considerations under
the headings: organisational analysis (e.g. are the issues training issues
or something else); demographic analysis (e.g. is it a particular group of
workers who are causing problems, such as managers) task/knowledge,
skills and attitudes analysis (e.g. what particular competencies are the
managers lacking); and person analysis, where individual workers can be
compared to the ideal set of competencies needed for their particular job,
and training used to fill the gap between the ideal and reality.

3.5 Implementing training
Once the training needs analysis has been undertaken, and the company
has identified who needs to be trained, and what they need to be trained
in, it is then necessary to determine how the training programme is to
be implemented. Given that training initiatives can be implemented in a
number of ways, there are several issues that are worthy of consideration
here.

3.5.1 On or off the job?
Training can be either ‘on the job’ or ‘off the job’. A great deal depends
upon what is being taught, for example, whether the training is focusing
on technical as opposed to problem-solving skills or attitudinal training.
Nevertheless, there are advantages and disadvantages in relation to each
approach. ‘On-the-job’ training can be highly effective, and it is argued
that staff learn and retain more of the knowledge imparted by performing
the actual process at the place of work. However, problems emerge if the
trainer has not been trained themselves in training methods. Additionally,
there is the risk that bad or even dangerous working practices can be
passed on (Cannell, 1997). ‘Off the job’ training is important in terms
of theoretical study or in terms of introducing employees to new and
innovative ideas. Problems arise, however, when those ideas do not appear
to relate to the work situation. In summary, ‘on the job training’ is any
activity designed to teach new skills or knowledge that takes place while
the worker is in their normal place of work. An example might be that
when a new telephone system was installed, all the workers who need
to use it would be shown what they needed to do while answering and
making live calls. ‘Off the job’ training is any activity designed to enable a
worker to learn new knowledge, change their attitude or teach them a new
skill which takes place away from the workplace (for example, in a class
room, in a hotel conference room, or in a specialist training situation such
as a simulation of an event that could take place at work). One example of
this is a specialist college for Fire and Rescue staff. This facility will have
buildings (e.g. a shopping mall, an aircraft, houses, oil tanks, etc.) which
are regularly set on fire. The trainees can learn how to put the fires out
safely and prove they have the required skill and attitude to safety before
beginning work in reality.

52

Chapter 3: Training and development

3.5.2 Active versus passive learning
It is generally accepted that active learning (where the learner is actively
involved in the learning process, in activities such as group discussions,
work simulations or role-play exercises), is more effective than passive
learning (where the trainer imparts information and the trainee passively
receives it, as in a class room situation, for example) (Holden, 2001).

3.5.3 The sequencing of learning
The argument here is that the order in which tasks are learned is critical.
If a job involves a logical sequence of tasks, it makes sense for those tasks
to be learned in that order (Campbell, 1971). This then makes it easier to
transfer the learning to the job.

3.5.4 Individual differences – learning styles
Different people have different preferred learning styles. For example,
some people prefer hands-on learning, others prefer a trial by error
approach, while others prefer verbal learning or book learning. As such, it
is important to introduce a range of learning techniques into the training
programme in order for the programme to appeal to as wide an audience
as possible (Cascio, 1998). There is also the opposite view that if people
find learning something more difficult, then when they do learn it, they
are more likely to remember it. A study of work by Honey and Mumford
will give more information about learning styles (Honey and Mumford,
1992).

3.5.5 Group versus individually-based training initiatives
Given that people work in teams, it is increasingly argued that it makes
sense to also train them in teams. As such, not only does the training
initiative teach the participant a new skill, but it also assists in the
development of teamworking skills (such as presentation and coaching
skills) and the interpersonal and communication skills necessary to
interact effectively as a team member (Cannon-Bowers, Tannenbaum,
Salas and Volpe, 1995).

3.5.6 Transfer to the job situation
Very often employees return to their normal work situation after attending
a training course and revert to ‘business as usual’. If skills learned on a
training programme are not applied on a day-to-day basis, they can be
very quickly forgotten. It is necessary, therefore, that training courses
are designed in such a way that the similarity between the training
situation and the job situation is maximised, that jobs are designed so that
individuals have the opportunity to apply their new skills on returning
to work, that individuals have the information necessary to utilise their
skills, or that pay systems are set up to reward workers for putting into
practice the skills learned (Cascio, 1998). Line managers can play a key
role in transferring the learning from the training to the work. If they are
supportive, then the learning is reinforced, but if they begin to ridicule the
training experience, then the learner is less likely to put their learning into
practice.

3.5.7 Evaluating the effectiveness of the training process
Companies spend lots of money every year in training, but very few
engage in a systematic analysis of the effectiveness of their training
programmes, in terms of gauging what has been learned, whether workers
have been able to apply their new skills in their jobs, whether work
53

MN3075 Human resource management

processes have become more effective, or whether levels of service have
improved as a result of training. If these sorts of issues are left to chance,
as is the case in many organisations, there is no way of knowing whether
the training provided has contributed to organisational effectiveness in
any way, or whether the money spent on training programmes has been
well spent. As such, finding a way to evaluate training programmes is very
important. This could be conducted by eliciting feedback from employees,
either through questionnaires or interviews, through observation (whereby
the employee is observed before and after the training course to evaluate
whether it has had any impact on the way they do their job), or by
using the formal employee appraisal process to consider the value of the
training undergone (Holden, 2001). The most well-known method of
training evaluation was developed by Kirkpatrick in 1959. He continued
to develop it and wrote a whole book (1988) on it. From this you can see
that evaluation is a very important area of training and development. His
original model had four levels of evaluation:
1. initial reaction to the training
2. were the learning objectives met?
3. the immediate change to the trainees’ behaviour on going back to the job
4. the impact of the training on the performance of the organisation.
Hamblin (1974) developed a more detailed model with five levels of
evaluation, including:
1. Evaluating the training by using the post course questionnaire
(sometimes called the ‘happy sheet’ as trainees tend to voice their
opinion on such things as the trainer’s expertise and the quantity of
food served in breaks!) This is not a very useful stage of evaluation, but
it does at least indicate if there were any reasons that stopped a trainee
from learning such as a noisy environment.
2. Evaluating the learning in terms of the immediate impact on the
trainees’ behaviour.
3. Evaluating changes in the performance of the job.
4. Evaluating changes in organisational performance. This is a very
difficult thing to do. How do you know that it was the training that
affected the firm’s performance and not, for example, an upturn in the
economy.
5. Evaluating changes in the wider contribution that the organisation now
makes.
You can see from the description of the models that the evaluation of
training is quite difficult as there are so many other influences in the
environment, both inside and outside the company. Perhaps we should
take the advice of Lingham et al. (2006) and build in evaluation measures
at all stages of the design and delivery of the training. Their research
outlined a system based on agreeing measures that would indicate
whether the training had been successful and building in feedback loops so
that if the training was not successful, it could be changed for subsequent
training courses.
We have talked about finding out what training and development is
needed by an organisation, and we have discussed the importance of
designing evaluation into the learning opportunities, but here we will talk
about what methods are used in training and development. We will then
look at what stops learning from happening. Finally in this section we will
look at some of the more useful theories about how adults learn.
54

Chapter 3: Training and development

3.6 Learning methods
As pointed out by Gold et al. (2010) learning methods are not the same
as training methods. It is hoped that people will learn after attending
training, but that learning can take place by using methods other than
training. In the discussion above we saw that the first part of the learning
cycle is to identify what needs to be learnt (sometimes shortened to TNA
for training needs analysis), then consideration of such things as budgets,
the characteristics of the potential trainees and where the training will
take place comes into play. The next stage is to design the training
(keeping in mind how the training/learning will be evaluated), and finally
the learning experience will be delivered.
We will again draw on Gold et al. (2010) for advice about designing
learning opportunities. They say that:
1. Clear objectives for the learning must be established i.e. the person
designing the learning must say to themselves ‘what will the learner be
able to do, or to know, or how will their behaviour have changed, when
they have had the learning experience?’
2. The learning must be carefully sequenced and structured. Simple
concepts could be taught before more complex ones (e.g. a dancing
teacher teaches the steps first and then puts them into a longer
sequence and then into a whole dance). If the learning sequence
follows that of the activity in the workplace, then the learner will be
able to transfer their learning to the job more easily.
3. There must be feedback to the learners so that they know what they
are doing right and what they need to change. If you have never done
something, then you have no knowledge about it. Feedback begins to
build up your knowledge. Without feedback there is no learning.
4. Rewards and reinforcement help learners to change their behaviour
and to learn. There will be more on this in the section on theory when
we look at the work of Skinner.
5. Learners should be actively involved in their own learning. The use of
all five of our senses gives our brains a better chance of remembering
what we are trying to learn. People learn in different ways, some like
to read, some like to listen, some like to watch a demonstration or a
teacher, some like to try things out for themselves. The sense of taste
is essential for chefs. The sense of smell is also essential for chefs, but
also wine waiters, detectives and custom officers. Any training for them
would therefore have to include the opportunity to use their noses.
6. Understanding is key to learning. Remember back to when you were
small and you were trying to learn something for school. Sometimes
the words or the numbers just didn’t make sense and it was very
difficult to learn. When you had been studying a subject for a time, you
realised that you did understand and that the subject became much
easier because you could understand. From the topics that you did
understand, you were able to build on other topics more easily.
7. Finally learning must be meaningful to people in terms of their jobs.
Think about training people to use a piece of machinery. If the training
involved throwing a ball so that you could hit a target, you might begin
to wonder what you were doing. If, however, it was explained that
the machine needed you to have excellent hand-eye coordination you
might be persuaded that the training was relevant, better still would
be to practice on the machine itself so that you could directly see the
55

MN3075 Human resource management

usefulness of the training and be able to transfer the learning directly
to the job. We could say then that learning is most likely to happen
if the learners think that what they are doing is relevant, useful and
interesting.
8. Learners should be given respect and treated as equals.
The next decision to take in designing the learning opportunity is to decide
if the appropriate method will be away from the workplace or if it will use
the experience of being at work to enable learning to take place. In the
words of Gold et al. (2010): ‘off-the-job learning options’ and ‘integrated
learning methods’. In their list of learning methods ‘off-the-job’, they include
lectures, discussions, role plays, case studies, e-learning and learning skills
by demonstration and practice. The ‘integrated learning methods’ include
coaching, shadowing, mentoring, ‘sitting with Nellie’, action learning and
job rotation. Each learning method has advantages and disadvantages that
make it more or less suitable for learning different things.
Activity
Make a table containing all the different learning methods you can think of. Put in a
column for advantages and one for disadvantages. Add in a final column for when you
would use each method. Now get together with a friend and fill in the columns. If you
want help, then go to pp.144–48 in Gold et al. (2010) or any textbook that includes
learning methods. If you go straight to the list in the book, remember that learning needs
understanding, so discuss the advantages and disadvantages with your friend. What do
you think? Finally discuss the applications of the methods and try to think of examples of
when you would expect the method to be used.

3.7 Barriers to learning
These can be divided under three main headings: people, resources and the
organisation.
People
1. They can lack motivation to learn.
2. They can be unable to learn (they lack the skills or knowledge).
3. They can react poorly if the learning is given in a way that does not suit
their learning style.
4. They may be better learning in a group than individually.
5. They may not be available at the time the training is being run (i.e.
part-time staff who only work in the evenings).
6. The training method is not appropriate for the subject.
7. The manager forgot to plan in training time for the new system.
8. The learning may not be relevant to the job.
Resources
1. There is insufficient budget to fund the learning.
2. There is no suitable place to learn e.g. the training area may be noisy if
it exists at all.
3. There is no suitable trainer.
4. Additional machinery or software for training may be too expensive.
Organisation
1. The culture of the organisation does not support learning.
2. The culture of the organisation does not encourage change.
56

Chapter 3: Training and development

3. The learning is not integrated into the company strategy.
4. The performance management system does not support learning.
5. Learning is not rewarded or recognised.
Looking at learning from a positive perspective, we can say that people
learn when:
• They have a reason to learn or sense of purpose.
• The learning is relevant to their interests and they are choosing to
learn.
• They are actively involved in doing something.
• They can make mistakes with no consequences, and they will learn
from their mistakes.
• They receive feedback.
• They learn at their own pace. Some people take longer than others.
As can be seen from the above getting anyone to learn is a difficult thing
to achieve. It may be worth mentioning some theories behind learning and
try to answer the question ‘how do adults learn?’

3.8 Learning theories
There are many theories of learning, indeed they range from physiological
(chemical changes in the brain), psychological (behaviourist, cognitive),
sociological (group dynamics, transformative) and just in case a theory
cannot be categorised by the previous models, a category called multidisciplinary.
A simple way of looking at learning theories is to be found in Armstrong
(2001 p.532). He says that learning theories can be divided into the
following:
Reinforcement
If learners receive feedback when they are learning and are rewarded
when they demonstrate the ‘correct’ behaviour then they are more likely
to learn. These ideas are based on the work of Watson (1913) and B.F.
Skinner (1974). This theory is sometimes called behaviourism and has
been criticised as being very manipulative and not taking the learner
into account. Nevertheless the theory is used extensively in training and
development.
Cognitive theory
This is based on self-managed learning. It argues that if people have to
find things out for themselves, then they are more likely to learn and
retain that learning. It is used as the basis for participative and case studytype training. It works if the learner wants to learn and if time is not an
issue. The drawbacks are that it needs a good trainer who is skilled at
giving guidance without seeming to do so. If learners come to the ‘wrong’
conclusion too early, they are reluctant to change.
Experiential learning
This is one of the deepest forms of learning and needs learners to reflect
on their experience, so they can learn what went wrong and why, and as
importantly, learn what went right and why. Managers are especially key
in helping their staff to do this.

Stimulus-response
This theory was further developed by Gagné in 1977. He based it on a
combination of factors, including a need to learn (drive), the stimulation
provided by the learning process (stimulus), the development of
appropriate responses by the learner (response) and the use of feedback to
reinforce the learning until the learner gets it right (reinforcement).
Self-efficacy
This relates to Bandura’s theory (again developed in 1977), who said that
people themselves have a belief in their ability to learn and to perform
a task. Guest (1992) noted that a strong feeling of self-sufficiency is
positively related to becoming a better learner.

3.8.1 Kolb’s learning cycle
We have already covered this earlier in the chapter, but it is worth
spending a few moments reflecting on what he said. His ideas revolved
around a circle of learning. Kolb theorised that in order to learn people
must be actively involved in what they are doing. They should not
just passively accept their experiences but actively think about what is
happening and why. The learning cycle goes through the four stages
we noted above, concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract
conceptualising and then to active experimentation. The latter, active
experimentation gives rise to new experiences and the cycle begins again.
Leading on from the learning cycle, Kolb said that learners prefer to learn
in different ways. These ways are based on the learning cycle. People have
an experience, they positively think about the experience (what worked,
what didn’t), they theorise as to why things worked and why they didn’t,
they test out the new ideas to see if they work.
Activity
Draw Kolb’s learning cycle but instead of putting in the theory think of an experience you
have had recently and then fill in the cycle to see what you have learnt.

3.9 Vocational education
One of the most powerful influences on learning in a country is the
government. It is the government which decides on policies for education.
It decides at what age formal education starts and finishes. It decides if the
education is free to citizens and at what level of education the provision of
free education should cease. Once children grow up and join the world of
work (the precise age at which this takes place of course varies across the
world), they need to learn how to do their jobs. Some jobs (e.g. a doctor or
lawyer) will need years of learning and high levels of skill and knowledge.
Often people train for these jobs or professions before they begin to work by
taking qualifications at college and university. Other jobs do not require so
much learning before the employee begins work. A computer programmer
is a very skilled job; it is possible learn while working by taking a series of
courses over several years (although some people do learn how to do the
job by studying at university).
The area of learning that is directly related to jobs is called vocational
education. The attitude of governments across the world varies as to
who should pay for the potential workers to learn the skills, attitudes
and knowledge necessary to do jobs effectively. The discussion seems to
centre on whether employers should pay for the training, whether people
who want to do the work should pay or whether everyone in a country
58

Chapter 3: Training and development

(through the taxation system) should pay. In the first instance it seems
clear that as the employers benefit from having skilled and qualified
people to do the job, then they should pay. However, think about how
an employer would feel if they paid for someone to be trained as a chef,
and that person then left to work for a rival restaurant. In the second
instance, you could argue that the person who wants the work should
pay for the training as they would benefit all their working lives from
the ability to do the job. Think, though about someone who may have
the capacity to be a brilliant surgeon but who cannot afford the years of
training. Think also that potential workers may be put off doing any job
that entailed doing years of unpaid study. After all a junior doctor and a
junior manager earn about the same early on in their career. What about
the third suggestion, that everyone in a society should pay through the tax
system? After all, everyone benefits from having a good medical service
with skilled and knowledgeable doctors. Everyone benefits from having
skilled and knowledgeable nurses when they have to go to hospital. When
you (eventually) want to buy a property, or need to consult a lawyer about
your will, you expect them to be highly skilled and very knowledgeable
about the law. If we can agree that there is some merit in everyone paying
towards the education and training of doctors, then what do we consider
about bus drivers, car mechanics, plumbers or electricians. What about
managers?
Life is not simple. Find out what the position is on vocational education in
your country. There is a useful chapter on public policy on human resource
development in Gibb (2008). In it he discusses the different perspectives
on national HRD and why they might have arisen. He uses the UK as
an example but acknowledges that different countries have different
perspectives.
