PREHEARING ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding on December 14, 2015,
pursuant to Sections 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 203(f) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. The proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on SEC v. Aletheia
Research and Mgmt., Inc., No. 12-cv-10692 (C.D. Cal. May 11, 2015), appeal pending, No. 1555887 (9th Cir.), in which Respondent Peter J. Eichler, Jr., was enjoined against violations of the
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.
In accordance with leave granted, the Division of Enforcement filed a motion for summary
disposition, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a). Peter J. Eichler, Jr., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release
No. 3553, 2016 SEC LEXIS 317 (A.L.J. Jan. 29, 2016). The due dates for the motion for summary
disposition, opposition, and reply were February 15, March 16, and March 30, 2016, respectively.
Id. The Division submitted a brief “Reply,” dated March 24, 2016, stating that it “has not been
served with any opposition, and the Office of the Secretary indicates that no opposition has been
filed with the Commission.” The Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) received Eichler’s
opposition on March 24. However, because Eichler made every effort to file the opposition on
March 16, this is deemed timely. He sent it overnight by FedEx; the envelope shows the shipping
date as March 15 and displays the tracking number 7826 0296 9164. The FedEx website1 shows
“Actual delivery” of the item on March 16, 2016, at 9:41 a.m. at the Commission’s headquarters in
Washington, D.C.2 Eichler is reminded that he must serve the Division with any filings with the
Commission or any communications with OALJ. In light of the above circumstances, the Division
may supplement its reply by April 15, 2016.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
