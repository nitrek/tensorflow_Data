UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
January 21, 2016

In the Matter of
Vadda Energy Corp.
ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING
File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Vadda Energy Corp. (CIK
No. 1082492), a Florida corporation with its principal place of business listed as Flower
Mound, Texas with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously ‘Pink Sheets’) operated by
OTC Markets Group Inc. (‘OTC Link’) under the ticker symbol VDDA, because it has
not filed any periodic reports since it filed its registration statement on September 30,
2013. On October 9, 2015, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation
Finance to Vadda Energy requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations, and
Vadda Energy received the delinquency letter on October 15, 2015, but failed to cure its
delinquencies.
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of
investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.

Therefore, it is ordered, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EST on January 21, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EST on February 3,
2016.
By the Commission.

Secretary
