In the Matter of

ORDER FOLLOWING SECOND
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

CHRISTOPHER M. GIBSON

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings on
March 29, 2016. A prehearing schedule is in place and a hearing is set to begin on September
12, 2016, at Commission headquarters in Washington, D.C. Christopher M. Gibson, Admin.
Proc. Rulings Release No. 3866, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1844 (ALJ May 25, 2016).
At a second prehearing conference on August 23, 2016, I responded to the parties’
procedural questions and said that: I do not require opening statements, but if the parties want to
present brief opening statements, they will be allowed to do so; a limited amount of direct
examination will be allowed when an expert takes the stand and adopts her or his pre-circulated
written report that usually substitutes for direct testimony; unopposed exhibits can be offered at
any time; and I will rule on the admissibility of an exhibit when it is offered and will consider the
parties’ pending objections when doing so.
If the parties agree to certain facts or the admissibility of certain exhibits, it would be
helpful if, in advance of the hearing, the parties file a written stipulation and then present the
stipulation at the hearing for my consideration. Lastly, I would appreciate receiving electronic
copies of any filings, emailed to alj@sec.gov, in PDF text-searchable format.
