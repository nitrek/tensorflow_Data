Re: Interests in ABLE Accounts


Dear Mr.Fippinger:

In your letter dated December 31,2015, you request the staffofthe Office of

Municipal Securities' view an:

{i) whether interests in an account established by a State, or an agency or

instrumentality thereofpursuant to the Stephen Beck,Jr., Achieving a Better Life

Experience Act of2014'(the"ABLE Act"),offered through an ABLE Act

program(an"ABLE Program")2 are "municipal securities," as defined.in

Section 3(a)(29)ofthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934,as amended(the

"Exchange Act"),and

(ii) whether a dealer participating in the sale ofthose interests would be

participating in a"primary offering" and thus be subject to the requirements of

Rule 15c2-12 under the Exchange Act.

We have not conducted an extensive review ofABLE Programs. Based upon an

analysis ofprograms that have been brought to our attention in your letter and in other

communications with the staffofthe Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board(the

"MSRB"), however, we do believe that at least some interests in ABLE accounts as

described in your letter may be "municipal securities" as defined in Section 3(a)(29)of

the Exchange Act,depending on the facts and circumstances,including without

limitation,the extent to which an ABLE account offered through an ABLE Program is a


The ABLE Act added Section 529A to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,as amended(2b U.S.C.

§529A)(the"Code").

Based on materials the MSRB staffhas provided, we understand that ABLE Programs are established by

States under Section 529A(b)ofthe Code as "qualified ABLE programs" through which individuals

make contributions for the purpose ofaccumulating savings for qualified disability expenses of

beneficiaries. Individuals purchase interests in the trust and the trust assets are invested in a manner

consistent with the trust's stated investment objectives. Individuals purchasing trust interests do not have

a right to control the investment oftrust assets. Transactions in interests described in your letter are

expected to be conducted by dealers.

direct obligation of, or obligation guaranteed as t~ principal or interest by,a State or any

agency or instrumentality thereof,

In response to your second question, we note that Rule 1Sc2-120(7)under the

Exchange Act defines a"primary offering" as including an offering ofmunicipal

securities directly or indirectly by or on behalfofan issuer ofsuch.securzties. Based

upan your letter and communications with MSRB staff, it is our understanding that

interests in ABLE Progarams generally are offered only by direct purchase from the issuer.

Accordingly, we would view those interests as having been sold in a"primary offering"

as that term is defined in Rule TSc2-12. Ifa dealer is acting as an "underwriter"(as

defined in .Rule 15c2-120(8))in connection with that primary offering,the dealer may

be subject to the requirements ofRule 15c2-12.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate to

contact me at(202)551-5680.

Sincerely,


Jessica S. Kane

Director, Office ofMunicipal Securities


In your letter, you compare ABLE Programs to tom-advantaged college savings plans established

pursuant to Section 529 ofthe Code("529 Plans"}, and cite Exchange Act Release No.70462{Sept.20,

2013),78 FR b7468,67472-73(Nov. lZ,2013),as well as correspondence from Commission staffto the

MSRB stating that at least some interests in 529 Plans may be,depending on the facts and circumstances,

municipal securities for p~-poses ofthe Exchange Act. We note for purposes ofsuch comparison that, in

connection with no-action reliefsought by many higher education trusts with respectto 529 Plans, an

opinion ofcounsel was required to the effect that the issuer is a State,an agency or instrumentality ofa

State, or a political subdivision thereof. See, e.g., Letters re: New York College Choice Tuition Savings

Program (Sept. 10, 1998);New Hampshire Higher Education SavzngsPlan Trust(June 30, 1998).

Re:

Dear Ms.Kane:

The Stephen Beck,Jr., Achieving a Bettex Life Experience Actof2014(the"A.BLE

Act"}added Section S29A to the Internal Revenue Code of I9$6,as amended(the"Cade")to

permit a state, or an agency orinstrunxentality there€~f,to establish and maintain a new type of

taaf-advantaged savings progz~azzx to help supportindividuals with disabilities in maintaining

health,independence,and quality ofLife. Section 529A was modeled on Section 529ofthe


Code.l Section 529 ofthe Code,in part,established tom-advantaged college savings plans{"529

savings plans"}to encourage saving far future higher education costs.2 The U.S. Securities and

Exchange Cornn~iss on(the"Commission")has determined that intezests offered by such 529

savings plans are municipal securities under Section 3(a)(29}ofthe Securities Exchange Actof

1934,as amended (the"Exchange Act").3


Reportto accQmpauy H.R.647, Committee an Ways and Means,H.R Rept_ No. ~13­
614,part 1 at7{2014).

Section 529 also established prepaid twition plans. 26 U.S.Code § 529{l~)(1){A){i).

Under a prepaid tuition plan,an investor may purchase hution credits or certificates on

behalfofa designated.beneficiary,~rhich entitle the beneficiary to the waiver or payment

ofqualified higher education e~enses.Prepaid tuition plans generally have residency

requirements. Such credits or certificates generally are not viewed as being municipal


securities, and dealers generally do not participate in the mazketing ofprepaid tuition

plans.

Board believes it would be inappropriate to begin such investigation without knowing whethex

the Board hasthe authority to do so under Section 15B(b)(2)ofthe Exchange Act This depends

on whether such interests are municipal securities under Section 3(a)(29}ofthe Exchange Act.
